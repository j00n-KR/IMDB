0,bkoganbing,Pure Warrior,7,18 October 2009,"In First Blood Sylvester Stallone introduced his second enduring screen character John Rambo, Vietnam veteran of the Special Forces. Those hick law enforcement characters from the Pacific Northwest really didn't know who they were messing with. Even though Richard Crenna did try to steer them straight.It all begins innocently enough. Sheriff Brian Dennehy the local law where Sly was traveling through gives him a ride out of town and tells him to keep going. Dennehy just doesn't like Sly's looks, not that he's done anything. All Stallone was there to do was visit a Vietnam War buddy whom he finds out has died from cancer most likely gotten from Agent Orange. Not that it was any of Dennehy's business because Stallone wasn't breaking any laws.But when Dennehy sees him start back to town he then arrests him on the usual charge of vagrancy when they can't think of anything else. But the treatment and disrespect he's shown by the town police brings back memories and he snaps. He injures about six cops breaking jail and Dennehy's hot to get this guy no matter what it costs.The best I can say for the rest of the film is that Sly makes them pay plenty.Richard Crenna was Rambo's colonel in Vietnam tries in vain to tell the local and later the state law just what they're up against. Rambo's been trained in survival and killing techniques with or without weapons. He's a pure warrior and even normal fear has been driven right out of him.For some of us who've had bad experience with the law First Blood was a film we could identify with. Just citizens who get arbitrarily pushed around for one reason or another. I remember wheeling a heavy shopping cart with groceries and laundry on the sidewalk of one of the main thorough fares of my city and a police car just drove right up and blocked my path. When I protested the man in blue threatened to run me in for obstruction of justice. I know exactly how Stallone felt when being pushed around. I suspect many in the theater audiences knew as well. Stallone makes a lot of mayhem in the Pacific Northwest, the location cinematography for First Blood is just great, it can't be anything else in that part of the country. And Sly Stallone introduced an enduring cinema hero in John Rambo.",First Blood
1,Leofwine_draca,"Forget the cheesy sequels, this grimly realistic film is the best of the original trilogy",10,16 July 2016,"Not content with creating one hugely successful film franchise with the iconic ROCKY series, Stallone joined the burgeoning ranks of '80s Hollywood action stars by bringing the character of Rambo to the screen. Of course, the muscle-bound ex-soldier soon became one of the most famous movie creations of all time, so it's interesting to go and look back at his roots in FIRST BLOOD, an adaptation of a dark action novel by David Morrell. Some things were altered in the transition from book to screen, namely the transformation of Rambo into a good guy instead of a misunderstood anti-hero.Anyway, FIRST BLOOD is a great flick, another fantastic movie made in a very good year for film. When mentioning Rambo, most people think of the two sequels that turned the franchise into a cheesy, over-the-top guns-n-explosives fest along the line of Arnie's COMMANDO. FIRST BLOOD isn't like that – it contains a modicum of realism, even during the pyrotechnic-heavy climax. It's a thoroughly engaging storyline, about a drifter who finds himself up against a corrupt police force, and it's scarily real – as each plot twist plays out, you realise that human nature has never been put so well on screen. Stallone is excellent as the psychotic soldier, and he's given great support from the cast which includes a career-best Brian Dennehy, a hammy Richard Crenna, and many others.The plot is packed with suspense and achieves a level of primal fear and tension in the woodland setting, reminding me of the similarly-themed SOUTHERN COMFORT in some places. There are many great moments to enjoy as Rambo tackles a totally hateable enemy – the corrupt, bigoted small-town mentality of a police department. His initial prison break is the stuff of legend, while the subsequent stalk-and-slash pursuit in the woods is one of the best portrayal of jungle traps and survival I've seen. What also hits home is how sad the story is – Rambo finally reveals his motivations and reasoning at the climax, and it makes for all-too-real drama. While the fourth film in the series, Rambo, is still my favourite, FIRST BLOOD is nevertheless a fantastic film that's up there with the best and definitely the best of the original trilogy.",First Blood
2,SnoopyStyle,Such a great character,8,10 October 2014,"John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a former Green Beret. He goes to find his Nam buddy Delmar Barry but he's dead from exposure to Agent Orange. That makes him the sole survivor of his team. He walks into the town of Hope, Washington. Sheriff William Teasel (Brian Dennehy) picks up the drifter and drives him out of town telling him to get a haircut. Rambo turns back towards the town and the sheriff arrests him. He flashes back at the cruel treatment as a POW and battles his way out of jail. The manhunt turns deadly when deputy Galt tries to kill Rambo for revenge but instead falls to his death. The manhunt escalates and Rambo's former c.o. Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives not to rescue Rambo from the cops but rather rescue the cops from Rambo.This starts as a great tense suspenseful drama. Stallone is great as the drifter loner Rambo. He is emotionally damaged. It's a great character. The last act does try to go bigger. I don't think the big action is necessary or particularly fitting. I expected Rambo to stay in the woods. I do like the fact that the climax turns out to be a heart-to-heart with Trautman. It's the most fitting way to bring Rambo in.",First Blood
3,Prismark10,Introducing Rambo,8,20 February 2019,"Edna, the Inebriate Woman was a classic BBC drama from 1971. It is about a homeless drunk woman in Britain who really is left with nowhere to go. It was directed by Canadian Ted Kotcheff.The same director made First Blood just over a decade later. The film stands as a survivalist action thriller about a desperate man who has been pushed too far or itself is an allegory of the Vietnam war. Just like Walter Hill's film, Southern Comfort.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam veteran, a Green Beret. He was a lethal killer in Vietnam but back in the USA, despised and unable to hold on to a job.Rambo wanders the Pacific Northwest to see an old comrade in arms, only to be told he died of cancer. As he walks through a small town of Hope, the Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) escorts him out. He does not want vagrants like Rambo.When Rambo walks back in to Hope, Teasle arrests him, back at the station his deputies abuse him. The famous 'shave him dry' line! A furious Rambo freaks out and heads out to the woods. He uses guerrilla warfare on the advancing police and National Guard.Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) the man who trained Rambo drops in and tells the Sheriff that maybe he is the only one who could get through to Rambo.The film made a clever move by making Rambo an anti-hero who just wants to be left to get on with his life. We see him deliberately not trying to kill anyone. It means the audience's sympathy remains with him. You root for him when he whacks the police who themselves are bullies. Brian Dennehy is such a fine actor that his Sheriff is more misguided than a villain.It is left to Stallone to bring the weary and damaged Rambo to life. When the film was made, he was not pumped with steroids like he was in the sequels. Stallone looks like a soldier, although he looks a little too neat. Some of the action scenes although implausible stays just about on the right side of credibility. Stallone does fluff his final scenes with his mumbling.Kotcheff has delivered a taut, stripped down action film.",First Blood
4,kosmasp,"Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge",8,11 November 2019,"Edge of sanity some might say, but coming back from a war and not recognizing the city you grew up in or the city you lived in, can be quite disturbing. Also disturbing that war lovers thought this was a love letter to war and people on the right thinking this movie was made for them. It's the weirdest interpretations since Scarface (Tony Montana) was made an icon after the movie came out, even though it meant the opposite.Sylvester Stallone talks about that in his commentary, otherwise I might not even have known about that and to be truthful I did not even see it. What I did see after a couple of decades of not having seen the movie, how I remembered the structure in a different light. The misshandling of the police was quite something. But that happens if two Alpha males butt heads against each other.Still you as a viewer can understand the pain of the main character more than the ego the head of the police has. It may have dated a little bit, but not to a degree that it takes anything away from its impact!",First Blood
5,classicsoncall,"""Hunting? We ain't hunting him..., he's huntin' us"".",8,17 October 2009,"""First Blood"" is the kind of picture I like to come back to from time to time, one that doesn't wear out it's welcome with repeat viewings. It comes at you from some sort of primal level, from that area within that makes you want to lash out at dimwitted neanderthals that only judge a book by it's cover, and not by it's content. The kind of film that examines bigotry and narrow small-mindedness, and then proceeds to exact it's revenge on all the conventional arbiters of power that reside in a single individual who deems himself the lone authority on right and wrong.I must say, Brian Dennehy does a splendid job of portraying that kind of character I love to hate. It's there in his mannerism, his speech, the condescending way in which he looks at others unlike himself. Then, when faced with the consequences of his own actions (deputy Galt's fall from the helicopter), he ratchets up the tempo instead of recognizing his error. One failure leads to another, and then another, until the snowball effect destroys an entire town. And then when it's all over, there's no recognition on the part of John Law that this could all have been avoided with a little more discretion and a lot more tact.Sylvester Stallone has come under a lot of heat for portraying seemingly one dimensional characters like Rocky and Rambo, but his pictures have a way of hitting you where you live. For dedication to his craft he's come under fire for being simple minded and formulaic. Maybe that says more about the critics than about an audience that finds Stallone's characters to be average Americans who want to be left alone to pursue their own goals and ambitions without interference by self important arbiters of authority. I'm sure there's some sort of political corollary in there about where we are as a country today, but I don't want to go there in a movie review. At least not today.",First Blood
6,gavin6942,Rambo Kills Cops,7,18 February 2006,"Having never seen a Rambo movie before, I expected him to be in Vietnam blowing things up. I was very wrong. This is the story of John Rambo walking the streets as a drifter in search of his old comrades. Finding out the last one is dead, he becomes very distraught. When confronted by the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy), Rambo snaps. The rest of the movie is one man's war against the local police department. It's hard to say whose side to be on.If you want straight action, this is your movie. There is plenty of helicopter flying, gun shooting and booby-trapping. Good, old-fashioned fisticuffs, as well. The pacing is perfect and you can hardly stop rooting for your hero.The star of the movie, in my opinion, is Richard Crenna - playing Colonel Trautman. Trautman's matter-of-fact attitude makes him something of a deux ex machina, a bit of reality in a place of fiction. His plain speaking, explaining to the police what they're up against, frames Rambo in such a perfect picture. This film would already be recommended, but Crenna makes this film HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",First Blood
7,lee_eisenberg,rugged individualism,5,19 April 2006,"Most people probably remember ""First Blood"" as the movie that gave birth to the action flick as we know it today, but I was able to interpret more. It's clearly looking at how the US government abandoned the Vietnam vets - which leads Sylvester Stallone's character John Rambo, as the lone fighter, to strike a blow for the common exploited man. But of course, that's what the typically American rugged individualism is all about. Maybe this movie is worth watching as a historical reference. But still, it looks like the cynicism arising from the Vietnam War is clearly abounding here. Also starring Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy.",First Blood
8,jboothmillard,Rambo: First Blood,5,26 February 2008,"Besides the Rocky movies, the Rambo movies are perhaps the most famous that ""Sly"" has starred in, although it was through the sequels that his iconic image is more recognised, nevertheless, legendary film characters have to start somewhere, directed by Ted Kotcheff (Wake in Fright, Fun with Dick and Jane). Basically, Vietnam War veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has been discharged for seven years. He travels on foot to visit an old comrade, only to learn that his friend has died from cancer due to chemical exposure during the war. Rambo continues to travel, wandering into the small town of Hope, Washington. He is intercepted by town Sheriff William ""Will"" Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who sees him as an unwanted nuisance, he drives him out of town and tells him not to come back. But Rambo turns back, so Teasle arrests him on charges of vagrancy, resisting arrest, and possessing a concealed knife. Chief Deputy Arthur ""Art"" Galt (Jack Starrett) and Teasle's officers abuse Rambo, triggering flashbacks of the torture he endured as a POW in Vietnam. Enraged, Rambo fights his way out of the station, regaining his knife, steals a motorbike and flees into the woods. Teasle organises a search party with automatic weapons, dogs, and a helicopter. Galt goes against orders and attempts to shoot Rambo from the helicopter. Trapped on a high cliff over a creek, Rambo leaps into a tree, injuring himself. He throws a rock at the helicopter's windshield, the break startles the pilot, and Galt, who has removed his safety harness to get a better firing angle, loses his balance and falls onto the jagged rocks below. Rambo tries to convince Teasle and his men that Galt's death was accidental and that he wants no more trouble, but the officers open fire and pursue him into the woods. It is then revealed that Rambo is a former Green Beret and received the Medal of Honor, but a vengeful Teasle refuses to turn the manhunt over to the State Police. Rambo sets up booby traps and, one by one, non-lethally disables the deputies, until only Teasle is left. Overpowering Teasle and holding a knife to his throat, Rambo tells him he could have killed them all, and he threatens to fight back with greater force if Teasle does not let it go. The state police and National Guard are called in to assist in the manhunt, while Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer Colonel Samuel ""Sam"" Trautman (Richard Crenna) also arrives. Trautman confirms that Rambo is an expert at guerrilla warfare and survival, he gained his experience during intensive combat in Vietnam. He gives advice to Teasle that Rambo could be persuaded to surrender peacefully if he talks to him. Rambo recognizes Trautman's voice on a stolen walkie-talkie, but refuses to give up, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and noting ""They drew first blood"" before hanging up. Trawling through the woods, Rambo is surprised by a Boy (Danny Wozna), who after being momentarily overpowered, runs off and alerts the pursuers. Rambo is cornered by National Guard detachment at the entrance of an abandoned mine. Against orders, they use a rocket, collapsing the entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. He survives and finds another way out, hijacks a supply truck containing an M60 machine gun and ammunition and returns to town. To distract his pursuers, he blows up a gas station, shoots out most of the town's power, and destroys a gun store near the police station. Trautman knows that the sheriff is no match for Rambo, but Teasle ignored his advice to escape. Rambo spots Teasle on the police station's roof and they engage in a brief gunfight, ending with Teasle shot and falling through the roof glass. Rambo prepares to kill him, but Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be shot if he does not surrender. Rambo, knowing he is the last survivor of his elite unit of Green Berets, collapses in tears and talks about his experience in Vietnam and after his return. Teasle is transported to a hospital, while Rambo surrenders to Trautman and is taken into custody. Also starring David Caruso as Mitch, Bill McKinney as Captain Dave Kern, Michael Talbott as Deputy Balford and Chris Mulkey as Deputy Ward. Stallone does give a good performance as the misunderstood, ostracised and emotionally damaged loner pushed too far, Dennehy does well as the bigoted snarling sheriff, and Crenna is just the guy who makes wise comments. This is a slightly questionable premise, a one-man war against the forces of the law, but the cat-and-mouse chase is interesting, with only small bloody moments and occasional explosions, the sequels turned Rambo into something of an indestructible cartoon figure, there are some far-fetched escapes in this, but at least this introduction to the character is more grounded, a fairly good action. Worth watching!",First Blood
9,rmax304823,"We have met the enemy, and he is us.",3,23 March 2004,"A literary critic divided protagonists into four levels: (1) the ironic, in which the central character is too naive to understand what's up, like Candide; (2) the low mimetic, in which the character is weaker than the ordinary, like most of Hitchcock's characters; (3) the high mimetic, more powerful and skilled than most people, like Patton; (4) the heroic, in which the character has superhuman qualities, like Superman. John Rambo is most a high-mimetic character with touches of the heroic. As his ex-superior officer, Richard Crenna explains, he can kill with guns, knives, or bare hands, he ignores the weather, he knows how to live off the land, he can eat things that would make a billy goat puke. So far, so high-mimetic. But he has heroic abilities as well. Crenna doesn't mention it but Rambo can also jump off 500-foot rock cliffs into a forest and land uninjured except for a scratch on his biceps, which he later sews up by himself. He can also move like Flashman. Brian Dennehy is on the roof of the sheriff's office and Rambo blows up a building a block away. Dennehy rushes to that side of the roof and a moment later Rambo explodes another building a block away on the opposite side of the roof. Dennehy rushes, but before he gets across the roof, Rambo is another block away. Rambo is also able to plaster himself over with mud against a hillside. Assuming that he used his hand and arm to cover himself (as opposed to, say, a tongue) then he managed to cover his final arm with mud by some means unknown to the rest of humankind.This is one mixed-up movie. The Sheriff is unexplainedly unfriendly at first, then implausibly murderous. His minions are exclusively brainless goons. They stumble into ambushes. They don't give Rambo a chance to surrender peacefully. A madman in a helicopter tries to shoot him for no reason. The Washington National Guard troops are a bunch of disorganized pussies and wimps who will ""be back behind the drugstore counter tomorrow."" Rambo kills none of them, of course, or he'd lose our sympathy, but to satisfy the kind of audience that enjoys action movies he wounds and humiliates them all and destroys billions of dollars worth of windows and gas station tanks. What is Stallone's motivation for this outburst of fury? He's been hassled by the cops of this dinky town after hearing some very bad news about a comrade in arms and quietly trying to find something to eat. The movie gives him more than that, though. At the end, in probably the best scene Stallone has put on film, he breaks down and sobs while describing an experience in Vietnam. Richard Crenna gives a TV-movie-level performance as the colonel, a man of few words but very many condescending smirks. He's given ""Dragnet"" dialogue. Dennehy: ""I'm going to send 200 men out there after him."" Crenna: ""If you do that you'd better bring something else."" Dennehy: ""What's that?"" Crenna: ""A lot of body bags."" Dennehy's part is that of the rabid, hateful Southern sheriff, but it's confusing because as a man so filled with self-righteousness, pride, and machismo he ought to be in awe of a real soldier, especially a winner of the CMH. It really is a Southern sheriff movie, you know. Only the geography has been changed. Denney's bloodthirsty adjutant speaks with a Southern accent. Dennehy keeps addressing Rambo as ""Boy."" As an action movie, this is pretty good. As a reflection of anything resembling reality it falls a bit short. Rambo shouldn't be pitted against all these stupid but innocent people. He ought to still be killing enemies over in Vietnam. This was a mistake soon to be rectified.",First Blood
10,Tweekums,They just had to push him,9,6 June 2017,"Vietnam veteran John J. Rambo was only hoping to visit an old war buddy but when he gets to his home he learnt that he died the year before from cancer caused by Agent Orange used in the war. He walks on to the nearest town, just hoping to get something to eat before moving on. Here he is stopped by the local sheriff, Walt Teasel. He doesn't want drifters like Rambo in his town so drives him out of town. Rambo turns to walk back into town and is promptly arrested and once in custody he is mistreated by some of the deputies. This causes him to have flashbacks of the torture he experienced in Vietnam. He then fights back and escapes, steals a trail bike and heads to the wooded mountains outside town. Teasel and his deputies give chase but it is soon apparent that they have bitten off far more they can chew; one deputy tries to shoot Rambo from a helicopter but falls to his death after Rambo throws a rock at it. The rest are picked off one by one; not killed but incapacitated. Eventually State Police and the National Guard are called in. At this point Rambo's former C.O. Col Trautman arrives and cautions against continuing the chase unless they want a war that they have no chance of winning.Given that this film has a reputation for being overly violent one might be surprised that only one character died perhaps those criticising it had just read the book which contains far more deaths. There are other scenes of violence though; the way Rambo is treated is definitely 'police brutality' and the way the deals with the pursuing deputies is shocking at times. This film is an impressive action film but it also has a message about the treatment of Vietnam veterans and police attitudes to people they don't feel fit in with the sort of people they want in their town. This message is pretty obvious without being too heavy handed. Sylvester Stallone is on great form as Rambo to such an extent that it is impossible to imagine anybody else in the role. Brian Dennehy is also impressive as Sheriff Walt Teasle; the character could easily have been a pantomime villain but Dennehy's performance makes him human. There is also a fun performance from Richard Crenna as Col Trautman and solid performances from the rest of the cast. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a solid action film that packs lots of great moments into its short run time.",First Blood

The trilogy was a completed by the recent ¨Rambo¨ , a definitive improvement, with Julie Benz and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand . The quartet was a complete success though the best considered is the original . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans ; it's a movie for adrenaline lovers . Rating : Good , entertaining but violent . This exciting and moving motion picture is professionally directed by Ted Kotcheff.

12,BA_Harrison,The original and the best.,9,11 September 2013,"After he is wrongfully arrested and physically abused by the prejudiced police of a hick town, disillusioned Vietnam Veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) escapes to the surrounding mountainous countryside where he wages a one-man war against the Sheriff (Brian Dennehy) and his men employing all of the survival skills he acquired as a Green Beret.In Rambo: First Blood Part II, the jingoistic, ultra-violent sequel to First Blood, Sly Stallone's John Rambo—a musclebound, comic-book warrior toting a rocket launcher who singlehandedly hands the commies their collective ass—became a larger-than-life symbol of US military strength, an instant hit with American audiences, not least with then President Ronald Reagan. So iconic is this image of Rambo that it is easy to forget that he was once a broken man, struggling to adjust to civilian life in a country still coming to terms with defeat in Vietnam.This more human portrayal of the character is what helps makes First Blood far superior to any of its sequels, Stallone bringing to the screen a believable hero for whom the viewer can not only cheer but also empathise. This excellent central performance, coupled with superb, no-fuss direction from Ted Kotcheff, makes for one of the most satisfying action flicks of the 80s—an adrenaline-pumping 93 minutes of gritty guerrilla warfare, old-school stunt action, and brutal 80s-style payback.",First Blood
13,moonspinner55,"After living with the specter of Rocky for years, Stallone finally hit pay-dirt as Rambo",3,3 July 2006,"Although not as beloved as his Rocky Balboa character--and not as popular at the box-office as his ""Rocky"" films or this picture's two sequels--1982's ""First Blood"" was a perfect fit for Sylvester Stallone, not requiring him to talk too much and yet showing off his rock-hard physique. John J. Rambo is an ex-Green Beret who gets into trouble with the law near Portland, starting an all-out war with the local authorities. The film works fast and hard at getting the audience completely on Rambo's side, but does so by turning the police officers into dolts and bloodthirsty sadists. Most of the scrapes our hero works his way out of are due to his own irrational behavior, but the full-throttle machismo, brainless though it may be, struck a nerve with a great many people. Followed by ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" in 1985 (which upped the action ante) and ""Rambo III"" in 1988. *1/2 from ****",First Blood
14,paul_haakonsen,He will give you a war you won't believe...,7,28 January 2016,"When growing up as a kid back in the 1980's there were some big action names that was impossible to not have heard about or having watched their numerous movies, and Sylvester Stallone certainly was one of those action stars.The 1982 movie ""First Blood"" has always been a very memorable movie to me, and it was a great start to the Rambo franchise. And director Ted Kotcheff did manage to create a good movie which really helped shape the action genre back in the early Eighties.""First Blood"" is about an ex-green beret who returns to USA after having served in Vietnam. And on his trek into a small town, he is bullied by the local sheriff and deputies. However, little do the bullying authority know that they are meddling with a highly trained and efficient killer. When John Rambo flees into the forested mountains with the police in hot pursuit, the game changes, and the police find themselves out of their league.The story is interesting and well-paced, and it doesn't take much time for director Ted Kotcheff to kick the movie into a high gear and take the audience on a very entertaining ride. And the characters in the movie were really well-fleshed out on the screen, a fact that applies to both the protagonist and antagonist.There are some familiar names and faces on the cast list, especially if you were watching movies during the 1980's and 1990's. The cast list includes Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Brian Dennehy and also David Caruso.While ""First Blood"" is not Shakespearian cinema, then it is still a good and wholeheartedly entertaining movie, whether or not you like Sylvester Stallone or not. I have been a fan of the Rambo franchise since 1982 as ""First Blood"" saw the light of day.",First Blood
15,Quinoa1984,"cool, slick action-movie danger and excitement, if a wee bit preachy",9,7 February 2008,"Sylvester Stallone, when in the right context, can hold together an action film like it's nobody's business. First Blood, for the most part, is a terrific example of a man doing what a man does when put to his limitations- that is, when the man is a Green Beret with plenty of torturous, bullet-strewn skeletons in the closet. When it does come time to make its point as a ""MESSAGE"" movie (message in CAPS for a reason), it doesn't quite make it's mark- it's also slightly disappointing, in a campy-sense, that the new DVDs lack the awesome quality of the audio as Stallone originally mumbled through the final monologue, now pristine and obviously dubbed- as far as ""Vietnam scarred me and nobody at home helped."" It also isn't very nice to end the film with a sappy song of mourning for Rambo's semi-tragic end.But up until then, it's a near 80s action movie classic, a kind of pre-Predator chase movie where Stallone is, in a sense, both Schwarzenegger *and* Predator, attacking and evading foes like it's some kind of absurdist set of skills. Rambo gets picked up for somewhat sticking it to the Man, so to speak, in a small town up in the Northwest by a hard-ass cop (Brian Denehey) who doesn't like him from the start, pegging him as a drifter even though he's just in town to see a friend (who, by the way, is no longer living, which he never mentions save to the Colonel, but I digress). He's mishandled by the cops, sees a razor to shave him, freaks out, and beats to a pulp his way out of prison, onto a motorcycle, etc etc, till he's in the woods kicking tail and taking names.And, overall, the picture works as hard-hitting entertainment. The direction is pretty clear and unpretentious, the music hits home the notes of an ironic pro-military war movie, and Stallone flips the switch on an image he had by that time semi-established. Instead of inspirational Rocky it's pure anti-hero Rambo, who breaks the law, kills and goes nuts in destroying the town, but possibly (in argument only) in self-defense. At the end you don't stand up and cheer for the guy, but scratch your head and wonder how he got to this point. If the actual dramatics of the movie don't manipulate as well as Rocky for an emotional response it should be a given with the so-so delivery of the message (and, as well, Rocky has an obvious bit more warmth as an inspirational tale). But as a tome of a genuine tough guy, crazy but formidable, facing the elements, it's an example to follow in the genre.",First Blood
16,BandSAboutMovies,Intriguing movie that maybe shouldn't have had sequels,8,16 August 2019,"The first of the Rambo films has an interesting pedigree. It comes from director Ted Kotcheff (the original Dick and Jane, North Dallas Forty, Uncommonn Valor, Weekend at Bernies) and was based on a downbeat 1972 book by David Morrell. When Stephen King taught creative writing at the University of Maine, he used First Blood as a textbook. Ten years, eighteen screenplays and three studios later, the film finally got made.Back in 1982 when the film rights were first sold, producers considered Steve McQueen for the lead. Sheriff Teasle was offered to both Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall, but they turned the part down. Lee Marvin turned down playing Colonel Trautman, but Kirk Douglas eventually took the role. He quit just before shooting began, as he wanted the movie to end like the book, where Rambo and the sheriff fatally would one another, Trautman kills Rambo and sits with the dying lawman. Rock Hudson also signed up to be in the film, but he had to undergo heart surgery, leaving Brian Dennehy to play Sheriff William Teasle and Richard Crenna to play Colonel Samuel Trautman in what would become the character actor's most iconic role.Seven years after his discharge, he left Vietnam, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is wandering America. A visit to Hope, Washington to see an old friend is cut short when he learns that his former military brother has died from cancer that was caused by Agent Orange.As he wanders the highway, Sheriff Teasle begins to harass him, finally driving him to the unskirts of town and telling him not to come back. When he does, he's arrested for vagrancy, resisting arrest and possession of a knife. The police are brutal to the former war hero, as Deputy Art Galt (Jack Starrett, Nam's Angels, Race with the Devil) and the other cops spray him down with a hose and even attempt to dry shave his face. Rambo snaps and decimates the outmatched lawmen; he;s a former Green Beret who won the Medal of Honor.Galt chases him from helicopter, taking shots at him even though he's been warned not to, which leads to his death. Rambo informs the police that the man's death was his own fault, but the rest of the police come in shooting. Our hero, such as it is, dispatches each of them with non-lethal traps until only Teasle remains.Even more officials - state police and national guard - come in, along with Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer Colonel Sam Trautman, who advises that Rambo just be allowed to leave town. All hell breaks loose with Rambo nearly killed in an abandoned mine before escaping and destroying much of the small town. As he prepares to kill the sheriff, Trautman convinces him to surrender and Rambo collapses in tears, screaming ""Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off! It wasn't my war! You asked me, I didn't ask you! And I did what I had to do to win! But somebody wouldn't let us win!""The first rough cut of this movie lasted three and a half hours long and was so bad that Stallone wanted to buy it and destroy it before it ruined his career. After heavy re-editing and a second ending, where Rambo doesn't commit suicide, the film became a great success. The character itself would change as America moved from a country unsure of how to deal with the war in Vietnam to one that embraced its status as the world's policeman; the next Rambo film would present the character in a completely new way.",First Blood
17,Coventry,Always be nice and hospitable to Vietnam veterans passing through your village!,8,10 May 2014,"Just how insanely popular is your franchise when literally everyone on the planet knows the name of the lead character rather than the movie title itself, and when that same lead character's name even became synonymous for ruthless macho beefcake warriors all around the world? Rambo is truly one of the most legendary men ever to hit the big cinema screen and especially this original first film was an enormous box office hit. And deservedly so, as Ted Kotcheff's ""First Blood"" is also one of the single most exciting and entertaining action movies ever made. It's an unpretentious, straightforward and compelling adventure that guarantees adrenalin rushes from start to finish and benefices from a few amazing performances and perplexing outdoor filming locations. ""First Blood"" is based on a novel by David Morrell, which I personally haven't read, but allegedly the book is a lot more dramatic and psychological, whereas Sylvester Stallone (who co-wrote the screenplay) and company opted to strictly aim their movie at action fanatics. Former Green Beret John J. Rambo only just found out that his last Vietnam buddy has passed away and aimlessly drifts alongside the small town roads in rural Washington. When approaching a little town called Hope, Rambo is immediately stopped by the overconfident & arrogant Sheriff Teasle who doesn't like long-haired and scruffy vagabonds in his territory. When Rambo refuses to leave, he's apprehended, humiliated and provoked by Teasle's equally intolerant deputies. The barbaric treatment brings Rambo's Vietnam traumas back to the surface, so he battles himself a way out of the police station and into the wilderness. The increasingly frustrated Sheriff Teasle is bound to catch Rambo, but in these impenetrable forests the especially trained guerrilla warrior is unstoppable. Pretty soon, the search for John Rambo turns into an enormous manhunt, and they even require the help of his commanding officer in Vietnam; Colonel Sam Trautman. Many people initially think that ""First Blood"" is an actual Vietnam War movie but – as described – does it merely revolve on issues like problematic reintegration, post-traumatic stress disorder and a general lack of respect for war heroes. There's a number of great thrillers dealing with similar themes, but sadly they are a lot more obscure than ""First Blood"", for example ""Rolling Thunder"", ""The Park is mine"", ""My Friends Need Killing"" and many others. The film isn't nearly as violent as you might expect and – in sheer contrast to the later sequels – thrives on tense atmosphere instead of explicit bloodshed. Sylvester Stallone demonstrates that he definitely can act, especially during the gripping climax, but Brian Dennehy steals the show with his courageous role as the slimy, hypocritical and obnoxious small town sheriff.",First Blood
18,sunwarrior13,First Blood: One Great Action Movie,10,23 October 2011,"During his current run of the Rocky series,Sylvester Stallone released First Blood,also known as Rambo: First Blood,in 1982. It was an is action thriller about a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam War veteran.Stallone played the lead role of John Rambo.It also stars Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy.The movie was based on the novel of David Morrell's novel of the same name. It was the second successful movie franchise that Stallone starred in together with Rocky.The story was about an ex-Green Beret John Rambo,who is targeted for persecution and abuse by potbellied Sheriff Will Teasle,played by Brian Dennehy.When he can stand no more, Rambo goes bonkers, killing a deputy and heading into the surrounding hills, armed to the teeth. Only after Rambo has picked off practically every law enforcement officer within a radius of 50 miles do the local authorities bring in his former commanding officer, Trautman,portrayed by Richard Crenna,for advice. Trautman's response -- that the locals had better get a lot of body bags ready -- is hardly encouraging. Since its release, First Blood has been a critical and commercial success and has had a lasting influence on action films.The film is notable for its psychological portrayal of the after-effects of the Vietnam War, particularly the challenges faced by American veterans attempting to re-integrate into society, something not deeply examined in subsequent Rambo sequels.First Blood has definitely is considered one of the most memorable ones in film history.Stallone has proved himself to be a great action star and one of the best physical actors in history with his portrayal of John Rambo.Aside from that,this film has created some sort of a benchmark about what action movies will be all about in the years to come.Also,it was the first of its kind to portray Vietnam War veterans that have had psychological problems which was first of its kind during its release. Overall,it was one great action movie.",First Blood
19,searchanddestroy-1,Crap !!,1,14 April 2020,"Yes, crap, crap, crap. I know that I should be lynched by the mob, thrown into the bonfire of indecency towards the ""god"" Stallone. If I say such a thing, it's ONLY because I compare this film with the novel it is inspired from. I speak of the David Morrel's book, which I have read at least six times in my life. In the book, I guess many viewers have said it, the story, the overall topic remains the same, except the ending, but the deep character study has NOTHING to do with this crap, made for sissies, good ""American"" spirit, the early eighties spirit, the rebirth of the Americanism. It was a real pain for me to guess what such a movie would have been ten years earlier. A movie speaking of Nam war vets, but not only, the tale of a bloody, brutal, gritty face to face between two war heroes, but not the same war: Korea for Teasle character and Vietnam for Rambo. A duel where the protagonists will respect each other though determined to kill the opponent. I repeat, the novel was a deep depiction of two men, very different from this garbage pop corn movie where the sheriff is shown so that the audience can not feel empathy for him, on the contrary. But of course feel the deepest one for Stallone. To summarize, there is no surprise at all in the movie, a film not dark at all, on the contrary of the book. In the film Stallone does it best not to kill, whilst in the novel, he does his best not to spare. In the novel, Rambo is a cold blooded killing machine with brain and spirit, and the sheriff a very sensitive and intelligent man, very different from the character in the film. But it remains impossible for the reader to feel empathy for one more than the other. The book remains factual, that's what make it so awesome, so powerful. It doesn't tell you what to think or feel. Unlike this lousy picture. I won't even speak of the sequels. what's the use?",First Blood
20,hitchcockthelegend,"It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo. It's all in the past now.",9,22 May 2011,"First Blood is directed by Ted Kotcheff and adapted by Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone, from the novel written by David Morrell. It stars Stallone, Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna, Bill McKinney and Jack Starrett. Cinematography is by Andrew Laszlo and the music scored by Jerry Goldsmith. Locations for the shoot were in British Columbia.John Rambo (Stallone), ex Vietnam war veteran, wanders into small town Oregon and is met with hostility by Sheriff Will Teasle (Dennehy). Arrested for a trumped up charge of vagrancy, Rambo is subjected to rough house treatment by Teasle and his staff. Fuelled by the haunted images of his time in Vietnam, Rambo breaks out of custody and makes for the hills, with Teasle and the force in hot pursuit. But this is terrain made for Rambo, an expert soldier trained to survive and kill, it's a war, Rambo versus the rest.The character of John Rambo would slip into pop culture and forever be associated with cartoon excess. By his own admission, Stallone himself felt they dropped the ball after the original film, and he's right. However, First Blood is often wrongly lumped in as part of that excessive package, because it's a film well worthy of revisits to see just how well it holds up as a taut and tense thriller. A film led by the bold theme of showing just how badly some of America's soldiers were received upon returning from Vietnam. First Blood delves deeper into the psyche of one such soldier whilst casting a caustic eye over small town Americana. The makers rarely let up on the troubling thematics at work, developing Rambo with clinical strokes as the plot unfolds, the trick in the tail being that the audience are firmly on his side as he goes about bringing his Vietnam to the picturesque place the locals call home. By 1982, it seems, America was on the side of the soldier.Stallone is a perfect fit for the role, his physicality unquestionable, he brings the brood and pain to Rambo like few actors of his ilk ever could. The sarcastic may point to his lack of dialogue hardly constituting a great acting performance, that's rot, because this is a fine character portrayal by Stallone. Dennehy is on fine form as the brutish bully Sheriff who just couldn't leave Rambo alone, while in the support ranks McKinney and Starrett leave good impressions. The interesting casting comes with Crenna as Rambo's ""maker"", Col. Samuel Trautman. The role was Kirk Douglas' hook line and sinker, but he wanted a different script and insisted that the film end the same way as the novel. In the end the makers just couldn't give in to his requests and he walked at the last minute. In stepped Crenna to put a bit of father figure pathos into Trautman, and subsequently earning himself a three picture deal and a place in pop culture in the process.It's also a film that's photographed with great skill by Lazlo. He captures the British Columbia mountains and forests with beautiful scope, but in keeping with the tone of the film his colour palette is suitably grey and green. Goldsmith provides an effective score, particularly when the narrative is focusing on Rambo's alienation, while the stunt work is very impressive. Even if we drift away from the theme of the piece, it still works extremely well as an action movie drama, be it motorcycle/helicopter pursuits, or jungle warfare, First Blood pumps the blood frequently. All neatly constructed by the director of Weekend at Bernie's! On release it grabbed the attention and became a monster box office hit Worldwide, today it still stands as a damn great movie, and you know what? Stallone and co were right and Kirk Douglas was wrong. 9/10",First Blood
21,Theo Robertson,Dubious Moral Stance,6,16 November 2004,"As a thriller similar to SOUTHERN COMFORT this movie works very well . Okay FIRST BLOOD is by no means a work of art but it's far better than its ridiculous right wing sequels which involve a thread bare plot of a killing machine getting sent to kill loads of reds . There are one or two technical problems with this original , for example motivation is skipped over : Sheriff Teasle sees Rambo , doesn't like his type in town and decides to give him a lift out of the county . Rambo for some reason decides to head back and is arrested thereby setting up the story . Is there any reason for Rambo wanting to go back to a place where he's not wanted apart from setting up the story ? Brian Dennehy is excellent as the sheriff but Richard Crenna is almost a carichture of an army officer as Col Trautman though he was cast at very short notice so I guess he shouldn't be judged too harshly . Unfortunately Sly Stallone is a hopeless character actor and watching him spout his angst ridden lines made me laugh out loud when in fact we're supposed to burst into tears listening to the experiences of the Vietnam vet . A terrible performance from Stallone in arguably his best filmMy major criticism of FIRST BLOOD isn't down to the acting - It's down to the dubious morality of the screenplay . We're supposed to feel sorry for John Rambo and granted he must have had a terrible time in the 'Nam followed by coming home to be called "" Baby killer "" or being met by indifference and Teasle and Trautman discuss Vietnam but at no point does anyone point out the obvious fact that politicians were to blame for the conflict . Worse still Teasle is painted as being some kind of bad guy for the audience to dislike . Let's see now Rambo killed one policeman , injured several others and is running around the North West wilderness with a gun and Teasle is trying to capture him at all costs which makes the sheriff is the bad guy for upholding the law ? I've never been convinced that Rambo is an anti hero good guy in say the way James Bond is and this might have something to do with the franchise being vilified by moral guardians who blame violent movies for high crime rates . I do recall newspaper campaigns in Britain trying to ban this movie and the sequels because at one point it seemed every violent nutter had a Rambo movie in their video collection when arrested by the police . I doubt if this movie caused one single crime but it does seem bizarre when cinema makes heroes out of violent killers in morally dubious movies",First Blood
22,Hey_Sweden,"""We ain't huntin' him, he's huntin' us...""",8,28 July 2013,"""First Blood"" is one of the most entertaining films of its kind, a straightforward, tough, extremely fast paced thriller with a real poignancy to it, a poignancy that was mostly absent in the over-the-top comic book sequels. It's not a very faithful adaptation of the David Morrell novel, instead portraying its haunted lead character John Rambo (played here by Sylvester Stallone) in a far more sympathetic light. And you do feel bad for John Rambo: like so many Vietnam veterans, he's had a hard time readjusting to civilian life, encountering hostility from far too many Americans. One such man is hard headed, close minded small town sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who takes one look at Rambo and decides he doesn't like him. Rambo escapes his clutches and leads Teasle and many law enforcement types on an intense chase through the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Soon Rambo's former superior Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene to try to talk some sense into his crazed soldier, who's hellbent on finishing the private war that Rambo insists the cops started by pushing him too hard.While watching this, you do realize that Stallone does get under-rated as an actor, and you do really come to understand his character and resent the authority figures who mistreated him. Crenna is equally solid as the Army man who takes a certain pride in his ""creation"". Dennehy's role could easily have come across as a one-dimensional villain, but he's a great enough actor to give the man some dimension. Other familiar and reliable actors in the cast include Bill McKinney, Jack Starrett, Michael Talbott, Chris Mulkey, and David Caruso. Excellent location shooting, slick cinematography by Andrew Laszlo, and a memorable, rousing music score by Jerry Goldsmith are heavy assets. Granted, this movie isn't always exactly 100% believable, but it's still on a more even keel than the sequels; it's played straight and is compelling from start to finish. The stalking / pursuit scenes are actually quite suspenseful.In this viewer's humble opinion, ""First Blood"" can rightfully take its place as one of the most enjoyable films to deal at all with the effects of the Vietnam War on the people of its time. It may not necessarily be a ""great"" film, but it's exciting as hell, leading to a big emotional finish. The final speech may not be the most coherent, but it's certainly heartfelt.The following year, Canadian director Ted Kotcheff (another under-rated talent who's had a diverse career) made another Vietnam war related action picture: ""Uncommon Valor"".Eight out of 10.",First Blood

After a face-off Teasle arrest's Rambo & takes him back to the police station where Teasle's deputies also give Rambo a hard time who eventually snaps & goes crazy, Rambo beats up the deputies & breaks out of jail & steals a motorbike & heads for a nearby forest with Sheriff Teasle & his deputies in pursuit. Rambo uses his skills to hide, track & turn the tables on his pursuers, Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) attempts to talk Rambo down & give himself up...Directed by Ted Kotcheff & based on the novel by David Morrell (apparently in his commentary track on the Special Edition Morrell states he named Rambo after a brand of apples) I had actually never seen this until last night, I don't really know why since I have seen Rambo III (1988) & Rambo (2008) & enjoyed them both a lot & I have to say I really liked this one too. The script differs from the novel in various ways including changing the ending in which Rambo is killed in the book but lives in the film but never having read the book I cannot compare the two, First Blood is great to just sit down & watch since it has a great pace that keeps going all the way through, it's never too fast in that you can't reflect on what's going on but it never slows down to the point where I was bored. Although definitely an action film the film has things to say, the aftermath of the Vietnam war & the abandonment of those who fought in it along with the effects of the war on those who fought in it & there's a broad swipe at racism as well. The villain of the film isn't as black and white as you may think, is it the Sheriff who just wants to do his job & protect his town or is the villain Rambo who causes untold damage & ultimately breaks the law? The character's are good, Rambo barely says anything & never really interacts with anyone either as it's the other character's (played by better actor's) tell the story & flesh Rambo's character out more than he does. I enjoyed this, it's not full of flashy effects & the body count is surprisingly low with one one on screen death but overall I thought it worked great as both an action film & one with a (albeit slight) message.The action is really good here, this is solid 80's action with nice steady camera shots rather than modern shaky quick fire edited hard to understand set-pieces that give me a headache. There are exploding cars, exploding shops, motorbike chases, fights & shoot-outs plus a car jump in which a stunt man broke his back but carried on & the shot is actually in the film. First Blood was the first Sylvester Stallone film that wasn't Rocky not to bomb at the box-office & arguably launched his career. The film looks great & the forest wilderness is a terrific backdrop for Rambo to turn the tables on the cops, Rambo uses the terrain to his advantage & as an action adventure film setting it works well.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 the production ran months over & delayed the filming of Rocky III (1982), the action scenes are great with cool explosions & no modern quick editing at all. Although set in the US this was filmed in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is good from a solid cast & since Stallone doesn't hardly say anything is acting skills or lack of don't get the way too much.First Blood is a terrific early 80's action adventure film, there's a bit of a cop out ending in which no one really wins or loses but that just left the door open for some sequels which duly followed with Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), Rambo III (1988) & Rambo (2008) while the IMDb lists Rambo V: The Savage Hunt (2011) as currently in production.",First Blood

While traveling through a small town in Washington, Rambo is arrested by Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) for being a vagrant. When a sadistic deputy abuses Rambo, he lashes out violently and escapes custody, fleeing into the mountains. As a manhunt is underway to capture Rambo, his mentor and former commanding officer Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) shows up to try and prevent a bloodbath.Probably the best Stallone movie behind the first Rocky. Great action, yes, but also a terrific script and some really good performances that elevate this above so many other action movies. I've read David Morrell's original novel and I have to say this is a case where the movie adaptation is just superior in every way. In the book, the Teasle character is more of the good guy and Rambo is a psycho killer that has to be put down like a dog. So kudos to Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Sylvester Stallone for making the changes they did to the plot and for all the quotable lines their script gives us. As for the acting, there isn't a bad note anywhere in this. Even the supporting players are excellent. Stallone and Dennehy knock it out of the park. Richard Crenna has arguably his most famous role here as Colonel Trautman. He gets many of the best lines.Great score from Jerry Goldsmith with a memorable theme song. Ted Kotcheff's direction is solid. The action is fantastic but, as I said, it's so much more than just a popcorn movie. It has something to say about the Vietnam war and how the soldiers were treated when they returned home. This won't sit well with all types but I appreciate what they were going for here and thought they did very well with it. Had there never been another Rambo movie, this one would still be a classic.

26,zardoz-13,Rocky With A Rifle,9,27 August 2012,"Although it took David Morrell's superb action novel ""First Blood"" about a decade to reach the screen, ""North Dallas Forty"" director Ted Kotcheff, ""Sky Commando"" scenarist William Sackheim, ""Hill Street Blues"" creator Michael Kozoll, and Sylvester Stallone, have done a sterling job adapting it as a film. Indeed, Morrell has gone on record and called it ""not a bad picture."" You know you're watching a good cinematic adaptation when the author likes what Hollywood did with his masterpiece. Morrell confides a lot about the differences between his novel and the landmark film on one of the two commentary tracks of the ""First Blood"" DVD and Blu-Ray. Indeed, he drew inspiration from Kirk Douglas' superior contemporary oater ""None But the Brave"" (1962)that co-starred Walter Matthau and Carol O'Connor. In fact, Morrell has described ""First Blood"" a veritable western with the motorcycle substituted for a horse. Essentially, the novel ""First Blood"" constituted Morrell's protest of the Vietnam War. Ultimately, the protagonist John J. Rambo racks up a double-digit body count in this novel and winds up dying from rabid bats. Kotcheff and his gifted scribes have revised Morrell's narrative and characters so that the hero survives everything that the villainous sheriff's department hurls at him in the wilderness as well as the city. The film departs from the novel in the lack of characterization given to the villainous Sheriff Will Teasle who struggles to make life difficult for our heroic protagonist. ""First Blood"" was one of the first movies about a misunderstood Vietnam veteran who found it impossible to assimilate back into society after the horrors of combat. Remember, ""The A-Team"" did arrive on NBC-TV until the following year, and it concerned a group of Vietname vets who were still wanted by the law.Sylvester Stallone of ""Rocky"" fame plays a former Green Beret who received a Congressional Medal of Honor for his valiant service. John J. Rambo has returned from from Vietnam, and is hoofing his way around America, trying to track down his old friends. He discovers that his last friend, Delmar, has died from the cancer that he developed from Agent Orange. Rambo arrives in a Northwestern town of Hope where the intolerant sheriff, Teasle (Brian Dennehy of ""10""), decides to escort him out of town before he can enter town. Rambo accuses Teasle of pushing him, and Rambo takes on the entire sheriff's department, making them look like clowns. Not long after Rambo is arrested and taken into custody, he experiences flashbacks about his imprisonment in Vietnam at the hands of the enemy and goes berserk when Ward (Chris Mulkey of ""Cloverfield"") tries to shave him with a straight razor, while Galt (Jack Starett of ""The Born Losers"") holds Rambo and Mitch (David Caruso of ""CSI: Miami"") watches. Rambo overpowers his captors and escapes from the jail, seizes a motorcycle, and tears off into the woods like Steve McQueen. The sheriff, his posse, and the National Guard comb the forest for Rambo. Gradually, our lone wolf hero whittles down the opposition. The National Guard corners Rambo in a cave and uses a rocket launcher to seal the cave shut along with Rambo's fate. Naturally, this obstacle doesn't stop Rambo from finding a back door. He jumps onto a truck transporting an M-60 and shows up back in Hope to battle Teasle. Rambo's former superior officer Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna of ""Wait Until Dark"") arrives in the nick of time to talk Rambo out of an impossible predicament. The State Police escort Rambo from the sheriff's station in handcuffs.Stallone found two signature characters during his rise to fame in Hollywood. Rocky came first, and Rambo came second. ""First Blood"" ranks as one of Stallone's top ten movies. Jerry Goldsmith's orchestral score is impressive and underlines all the dramatically important moments. The stunts, especially the guy falling from the side of the mountain while a helicopter hovers nearby is unforgettable.",First Blood

Looked set up for an interesting final act.However, it then loses away. Cue explosions and gunfire merely for the sake of it. Ending feels a bit tame.There was a lot of potential for making something incredibly profound. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and how badly Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home are covered, but not in much depth. The sum total of the exploration of these themes is some flashbacks in the beginning and a short speech by Rambo at the end.

28,Boba_Fett1138,One of the simplest and also one of the best.,8,4 April 2008,"In its core this is really one simple straight-forward action flick. It's part of the reason why this movie is just so great and a true genre classic but also when you look past the surface, you'll see that this movie has so much more to offer.The story in its main core is real simple; An Vietnam vet who is being chased by a couple of mean cops through the woods. This is basically how most part of the movie is like. It's good and also sort of refreshing that there are totally no distracting different plot-lines and needless characters or comical relief or anything else of that sort, that most other genre movies have. But the movie is really more than just a 'dumb' overblown action flick. It actually knows to still very humane and on a small scale, as strange as that may sound, since this movie is known for being one of the most ultimate action movies out there.The movie mostly works out as well as it does due to it's main character John J. Rambo, who has become a real action movie icon. He is definitely a character who is on the edge and looks like he can snap any moment but we understand him nevertheless. Even though he says as little as possible you can still follow his emotions. For this, also credits needs to go to Sylvester Stallone. of course lots of people have criticized his acting over the years, the same as all big action movie actors got criticized. But playing a believable and likable action movie character also really takes skill, especially the role of Rambo, who is a real well layered character in terms of emotions and personality. Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna also play some real good roles. The acting within this movie is not what you perhaps would expect at first sight from an action movie. It was also fun to see a still very young David Caruso in a for him early movie role.It's a quite hard brutal action flick, even though funny enough only one person in this entire movie dies on screen. Nevertheless, Rambo causes the cops and his other chasers lots of different injuries, by guns as well as self made weapons and contraptions. So for the fans of the action genre this movie has plenty to offer for them.The movie isn't made by the most talented cast or crew that was around at the time but it's just one of those movies in which everything comes together and eventually works out perfectly and takes each and everyone involved in the production to a whole new higher level of prestige.What I also like about this- and all of the other Rambo movies, is the Jerry Goldsmith musical score, except for the latest Rambo movie from this year obviously, since Goldsmith past away in 2004. I feel it's one of his more underrated works. Everybody knows the theme for movies such as ""Jaws"". ""Rocky"" or James Bond but not that many actually also known the Rambo theme, even though it's at least just as brilliant and recognizable. Perhaps it has to due with the fact that it was an action movies score done in the '80's, which of course was not the most respectable genre at its time.Still great and also quite unique within its genre.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",First Blood

While there is action, and it's rather nicely done I might add, it isn't gratuitous, nor is the blood and the like. The plot is well-written and develops well. The pacing is magnificent. The editing and cinematography in this are very good, there is one sequence in particular which is highly effective, and nothing you'd find in a run-of-the-mill movie of this genre. The suspense is marvelous. The acting is great, the leads all give solid performances. Sly is spot-on in the role. The dialog certainly has well-written and quotable lines, if the one-liner or two seemed out of place, and it's never poor. There is language in this, plenty, and harsh, albeit it could be argued that it's justified and fits the characters. The DVD features a teaser and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fans of those involved in making it, not the least of whom being Stallone, and possibly of the book. 8/10",First Blood

I'm too young to have seen the Dirty Harrys and the John Waynes and truthfully I never saw John Rambo on screen. But that was OK because they came out with Rambo action figures and a Rambo cartoon. I still remember the jingle: ""Rambo! The force of freedom.""John Rambo ushered in a new age of action heros. He could fight, handle multiple weapons, and survive in extreme conditions. He was the ultimate soldier. Oh yeah, he also had PTSD. It was the actions of the haughty megalomaniac Sheriff Teasle (Brian Dennehy) that triggered the PTSD of John Rambo. If the jerk of a law officer could've just left John Rambo alone then no one would've been hurt.",First Blood
31,Uriah43,Intense,8,24 October 2013,"""John Rambo"" (Sylvester Stallone) is a decorated war hero who has recently returned from Vietnam and is haunted by his experiences there. As luck would have it, he aimlessly drifts into a small town and is wrongfully arrested for ""vagrancy"" by the local sheriff, ""Will Teasle"" (Brian Dennehy). While being processed inside the sheriff's department, one of the deputies decides to get rough with him and Rambo reverts to his combative ways and escapes into the mountains outside of town. This results in a massive manhunt for him with dire consequences for those who seek to bring him in. Now, while my summary probably doesn't do justice to the intense plot, I will say that this is one of the better action movies out there. Admittedly, some of the scenes are a bit too unrealistic but then that's Hollywood for you. Even so, both Sylvester Stallone and Brian Dennehy performed very well and I rate this movie as definitely above average.",First Blood

Things get out of hand as Colonel Trautman, Rambo's old commander, appears to shed light on the situation.........There isn't really much to say about First Blood that hasn't been said a thousand times before. After Rocky, it's Stallone's most famous character, and aside from having a bad case of sequleitis, Stallone never made a film better than this in the eighties. It's groundbreaking stuff for sure, merging action, drama, and an element of horror effortlessly in its short running time, and thank goodness the makers didn't stick religiously to the source material, because it would have been such a very different affair, making Rambo an abhorrent psychopath.Stallone, whatever you may think of his role choices, has been given a really bad rap for this film, because his acting is sensational in some scenes, especially the opening scene when he discovers that the last of his squad has expired.Crenna turns up halfway through as Trautman, and although he is brilliant, he really does nothing more than talk Rambo into more of a rage, and be sarcastic to Dennehy, in arguably his finest role to date.He horror element is the stalking scene in the woods, and although the fact that the Sega game Golden Axe stole a lot of the sound effects, it doesn't detract the films tensest scene.Although the first two sequels were over the top propaganda, seeing this with the 2007 Rambo is the best way, because it gives us the gritty element to Rambos tortured soul.Essential viewing.",First Blood

Apparently, he is the last of Rambo's buddies left after the war (Rambo being the main character for the two people who might not know who I am referring to). Well he finds out this guy is dead as well so suffice to say Rambo is not in the best of moods. He ends up strolling through a town where the local sheriff stops him and promptly escorts him out of town. Rambo says he would just like to get something to eat, but the sheriff is most insistent on his leaving. Rambo is dropped off on the edge of town and Rambo promptly turns back towards town, most likely tired of the attitudes people like the sheriff have towards him and others that served in Vietnam. Well the sheriff arrests Rambo and him and his staff proceed to treat him like some sort of animal leading to a violent escape by Rambo and the sheriff and first his deputies then the national guard go on the hunt for him. Rather good scenes abound in this movie as Rambo makes rather short work of the deputies and some guys dogs. You also get to witness Rambo trying to escape a cave and have a cool shoot out at the end. All is not perfect with the film, but there is enough good stuff to make this an all around pretty good film. I just do not see a small town being as inhospitable towards a veteran of any war. The kind of attitude you see from the sheriff is something I would think one would see in maybe a college town at that time or a city. I also wonder if there were maybe a McDonald's in town if the sheriff had taken him through the drive thru would Rambo been more apt to leave when taken to the edge of town? It also could have ended if that one idiot did not shoot Rambo in the side of the head when he was trying to surrender.

The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and winds up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army, who takes on both the police and the National Guard using jungle warfare tactics.""First Blood"" (1982) is an action/adventure of the first order. It's easy to lose sight of this in light of the two comic book sequels that made a caricature of John Rambo: ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985) and ""Rambo III"" (1988). Thankfully, the series made up for it with the outstanding ""Rambo"" in 2008, which is grim, gritty and deep.The Great Northwest locations are picturesque, albeit drizzly and dreary, while Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western ""Silverado"" (1985) albeit his character in that film is even worse.Stallone is in his physically prime here, although he's not quite as bulked-up as in the two sequels. His waist is only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing ""First Blood"" is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape or get in better shape.Stallone is outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally lets out all his pent-up rage by screaming out: ""Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!""I'm not normally into DVD commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition DVD by writer David Morrell is very worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the movie set many precedents in the action/adventure genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of motion pictures, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.It doesn't matter how many times you've seen ""First Blood."" The film has such a captivating anointing you'll be spellbound from start to finish every time.

36,The_Void,Overblown entertainment almost at it's best,7,23 November 2004,"Titled 'First Blood', but more commonly known as 'Rambo', this film tells the story of ex-Vietnam Greet Beret, John Rambo who starts his own personal war with a local sheriff after being picked up for vagrancy. The Rambo series has a reputation for being big, bold and stupid; and there is a good reason for this, as that's exactly what it is. However, as no film fan worth their salt will go into this film expecting a deep and philosophical masterpiece; the fact that it's entertaining is more than enough to stop it being a bad film. First Blood features more explosions, gun fights, fist fights and just general adrenaline pumping carnage than you could wish for, and it manages to keep up the high tempo that it creates towards the start for the duration. The film is rarely boring as the action keeps it ticking over, but it does start to get a bit samey after you've seen Stallone hammer another bunch of people with his M4 for the eight hundredth time.The action in First Blood is pure comic book stuff, and it does manage to go ridiculously over the top on several occasions, but it's all in the spirit of entertainment, and is, therefore, forgivable. Sylvestor Stallone is an actor that I'm not a fan of; the way he speaks and his general demeanour is annoying, but he definitely knows his way around an action film. And let's face it; that's all he's good for at the end of the day (yes, I've seen Cop Land). The script is something in First Blood that could do with some work; it's not bad on the whole, especially when compared with some of Stallone's other work (e.g. Cobra), but it spends too much time focusing on Rambo's mentor telling the police that Rambo will kill them all blah blah, and it becomes dull and silly all too quickly. The way that it 'brings the Vietnam war' home is a good idea, and I like that aspect of the film...although it was done to much better effect five years later with the Schwarzenegger masterpiece; Predator.To sum up, First Blood is very good entertainment. There's plenty to keep action fans thrilled, and some of the ideas such as the commentary on the Vietnam war are good, but it's let down by a script that gets silly and too much of the same stuff. Recommended viewing if you want something to entertain you and aren't too bothered about depth.",First Blood
37,zetes,Don't F with Rambo!,8,18 May 2008,"I was surprised to find that I had never seen a moment of the first Rambo movie. I always thought I had seen bits, if not all, of the original three films. I guess I've seen bits of parts 2 and 3, but not 1. I was also surprised that First Blood was a really good movie, well made, well acted and with some kick-ass action. It's definitely in the mode of nastier, more depressing movies of the 1970s. It reminds me at times of Deliverance. The body count is actually pretty low, but the movie is extremely violent. Sylvester Stallone plays Vietnam vet John Rambo, a former Green Beret, now on the road looking for old friends, all of whom seem to be dead when he finally finds them. When passing through a small town, he is picked up by the sheriff, played by Brian Dennehy, and hassled for no good reason. Dennehy and the rest of his police force soon realize that they've screwed with the wrong man, as Stallone goes all Vietnam on their asses, escaping into the nearby forest and attacking all who follow. After causing some general havoc, the National Guard is called in. Also, Richard Crenna, Rambo's former commanding officer, shows up warning Dennehy that Rambo's gonna kill 'em all if they don't call it off.",First Blood
38,Mr-Fusion,"""They drew first blood, not me.""",9,7 March 2011,"I have no shortage of esteem for ""First Blood"" as an action movie. Once it gets rolling, it's off like a speeding train. A lot of that is thanks to Goldsmith's terrific score (a favorite): tense mournful, patriotic. But it's also down to casting. Crenna and Dennehy are electric playing off of each other, with Rambo looming large in absentia. And as for Stallone, well . . . for me, this is some of his best work, full of barley suppressed rage and contempt for abusive authority. You can just feel the guy seethe. When all is said and done, this is a character study, and we don't get to really see that until Stallone's agonized tirade in the movie's closing moments. There's depth to this movie, and Stallone really makes it work. But even as a piece of entertainment, there's more than enough firefights, jungle warfare and explosions to satisfy.9/10",First Blood
39,JamesHitchcock,A Rambo Film with Something to Say,6,4 March 2008,"""First Blood"" is the neglected episode of the Rambo trilogy, or, as we should now perhaps say following the belated release of a fourth instalment, the Rambo tetralogy. The character was made notorious by episodes 2 and 3, ""Rambo re-fights the Vietnam War Single-Handed and Wins"" and ""Rambo Ignores Détente and Wipes Out the Entire Russian Army Even Though the Cold War is Nearly Over"". (Yes, I know those weren't the official titles). So notorious, in fact, that the very name Rambo became synonymous with a sort of aggressive, bloodthirsty kick-ass nationalism.To anyone familiar with the comic-book antics of episodes 2 and 3, episode 1 must come as something of a shock. When we first meet John Rambo he is not a musclebound warrior intent on killing commies for Uncle Sam, but rather a down-on-his-luck Vietnam veteran, an aimless, homeless and jobless drifter who drifts into a small town in the Pacific North-West. The local sheriff, Will Teasle, takes an irrational dislike to him (he seems to harbour a prejudice against the Army) and arrests him on a trumped-up charge of vagrancy. In the police station Rambo is beaten up by Teasle and his officers, which causes him to go berserk, turning on his tormentors and escaping from custody. Most of the rest of the film is taken up with the police's increasingly desperate attempts to recapture Rambo and his equally desperate attempts to fight them off.An important character (who was to reappear in episodes 2 and 3) is Rambo's former commanding officer from Vietnam, Colonel Samuel Trautman. It turns out that Rambo was no ordinary soldier, but a highly-trained member of the elite Green Berets (the regiment eulogised in John Wayne's film of that name) who won numerous decorations for bravery. Trautman wants to be allowed to try to persuade Rambo to surrender peaceably, warning Teasle that his men are taking a huge risk in taking on a man who is capable of killing them all. Teasle refuses to listen, but the more he tries to prove Trautman wrong, the more Rambo seems to prove him right.There is plenty of bloodshed and destruction in this film, but it does not glorify violence in the way that episodes 2 and 3 were to do. Violence is the preferred solution of the mentally unstable Rambo and the arrogant ignoramus Teasle, whereas the wise and honourable old soldier Trautman tries to find a peaceful way out.That is not to say, however, that the film is uncontroversial. Even if it does not glorify violence, it does tend to contribute to the myth of the special forces as superhuman. When Rambo goes on the rampage he seems less like an angry ex-soldier than a deranged Superman, minus the cape and the underpants worn outside the trousers. Even more controversial is the film's attitude to the Vietnam War. A number of other films from this period, such as Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"", featured mentally unbalanced Vietnam vets, but ""First Blood"" does not blame Rambo's mental breakdown on his combat experiences alone. It also blames the North Vietnamese, who tortured him while he was a prisoner, and those elements among the American public who met returning soldiers with indifference or even with outright hostility. (Rambo himself blames the ""hippies"" who demonstrated against him and his returning comrades at the airport). This position was a controversial one, especially among those who had opposed the war and in some cases had glorified the Communist regime in Vietnam. Such people did not like the idea that they might have been partly to blame for the problems encountered by many veterans in returning to civilian life or that they had wilfully ignored the brutality of the enemy.Despite the controversy, ""First Blood"" is a film with something thoughtful to say about war, about social attitudes to war, and about the roots of violence in society. Stallone manages to convey something of his character's mental anguish and Richard Crenna does a good job as the voice of reason Trautman. The contrast with the macho heroics of the two sequels is striking. 6/10",First Blood

Even the most machoest, toughest, roughest men in the world just need a hug! :D",8,4 November 2005,"I'm not sure why, I mean, bad acting, senseless violence, not much of a plot, but I loved this film. I have been interested in seeing the big macho films of Stallone and Schwartzenegger for a while. I'm just your average girl who loves the action flicks a little better than the chick flicks. In the 80's an extreme amount of action flicks came out: Die Hard, The Terminator, First Blood, Commando, Aliens, Batman, etc. I'm not sure why, maybe the 80's were just that boring. ;-P Just kidding to those who grew up during the 80's.In essence, First Blood is a movie that replays the Vietnam War with Stallone's humorless, absurdly indestructible killing machine, JOHN RAMBO. Yes, the Rambo! Well, we start off with evil cops who just hassle Rambo, I mean after all, we do need him to go off in some way. Rambo is haunted by some very disturbing memories from Vietnam. He escapes from prison where he is very much abused and runs to the mountains. He goes on a crazy spree of not really killing, more like scarring all the cops who did him wrong. Thanks to them, now they've got a loose and crazy killing machine who can kick some 20 men butt.I loved the ending, because they actually touched on real human emotions. I'm not saying this because I just love drama movies, but it made this one just more than an action movie. It was real and showed that even Rambo can cry. For an action flick, everyone, this is it. I'd also recommend Die Hard or The Terminator. 80's, what a decade, huh?8/10",First Blood
41,MovieAddict2016,Much smarter and better than it's given credit for,7,27 May 2005,"I won't lie, ""First Blood"" is no ""Deer Hunter."" It doesn't successfully evaluate the post-Vietnam after-effects on the human psyche. But it isn't the human bloodbath people think it is, either. If you want to know a scary statistic, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) kills one, maybe two people in this film - tops. There's no massacre, and in fact he doesn't let loose until the very end.The curious thing about ""First Blood"" (which, by the way, you will notice is not called ""Rambo"") is that Rambo himself is not really the main character. He's an anti-hero in some ways, and in others less so.First of all, he rarely speaks. Second of all, he garners little screen time after the first fifteen minutes; the middle of the film is devoted solely to the police force trying to chase him down.It's not until the very end that Rambo loses his nut and goes on a rampage, and even then all he does is shoot up stores and he certainly doesn't attack any surprise-attack Viet Cong intruders.In fact this is a very low-key Vietnam-themed survival thriller (yes, thriller) and the only reason people think of Rambo in general as this macho killing-machine action icon is the following sequel, ""Rambo: First Blood Part II,"" which is responsible for every Rambo cliché known to man.You might very well be surprised by how different this film actually is from its sequels.",First Blood

43,KineticSeoul,Soldier fighting against society and his own inner demons,7,22 September 2010,"Yeah this is basically a action movie that goes in a more humanistic approach, now this is a 80's movie but it's still gripping to watch the traumatized soldier fighting back in a society that has abandoned him and hates him without knowing and experiencing the bloodshed that took place in the Vietnam War. John Rambo is a icon, but he becomes more of a cartoon or comic book like hero instead of a more believable soldier who is fighting his own demons, which haunts him. Sylvester Stallone has created another movie icon that influenced many other characters in the movies, video games and other forms or types of entertainment. Solid Snake from the MGS games come to mind as well and I can tell Hideo Kojima was heavily influenced by John Rambo when making the MGS games. I also liked how the action in this film has a purpose and defines John Rambo and his character. The Colonel shows up later in the film and goes on and on about how badass of a soldier Rambo is and what he has gone through. The audience gets the point, but I personally thought it kept on dragging with the colonel constantly talking about how deadly and unstoppable he is CONSTANTLY. Which got sort of annoying and for a while it seems that is the only purpose for that character. Rambo in this film basically is fighting off cops that goes on a power trip, and I detest cops like that. So I couldn't help but root for Rambo the whole time and despised his enemies that is suppose to protect and serve. But soon realized it's not only the thug cops he is against, but society itself that treated him like dirt without experiencing the horrors of war and for fighting for his country, unjust war or not. What was also interesting is how the hunters which are the cops, become the hunted, but Rambo doesn't kill any of them except one who had it coming. His a character that doesn't kill any innocent civilians. Overall this was a good film about a soldier fighting against society and his own inner demons. Although there is a lot of chase scenes and action sequences, the last scene with Rambo and the colonel was emotional and helped get a understand of Rambo even more and made him appear to be a real torn up character. Which made the film more memorable and left a mark.7.4/10",First Blood
44,OllieSuave-007,Rambo is a force to be reckoned with.,8,26 August 2015,"Sylvester Stallone stars in one of his most iconic roles, playing Vietnam Veteran John Rambo, who uses his combat skills to go against the group a sheriff officers who arrest and abuse him after accusing Rambo of being a drifter and resisting arrest.Stallone as Rambo proves he is a force to be reckoned with, mercilessly kicking the sheriffs' behinds left and right as he displays a very formidable set of fighting and survival skills. It was interesting seeing Rambo roaming about the wildness like a lone commando in a war zone.Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Teasle plays a very formidable antagonist to Rambo, somebody who appears determined to protect his town from Rambo's wrath, yet, somebody who is also a somewhat arrogant, enraged instigator.Just about the entire movie consists of Rambo trying to evade the lawmen's pursuit, which doesn't have much of a solid plot, but results in a very fast-paced script and an enthralling story to see how Rambo attempts to survive his ordeal.

45,sddavis63,Rambo Is A Classic Anti-Hero,7,6 May 2014,"Over the course of his career, Sylvester Stallone has created two iconic characters: Rocky Balboa and John Rambo. Comparing the two - and there are both similarities and differences - is interesting. As far as the similarities are concerned, both are tough as nails and just keep on fighting against all the odds. There's also a softer side to both of them - although that softer side, while it comes out in Rambo at times, is much more front and centre in Rocky. But the differences are more dramatic. Rocky is the quintessential hero. He's everyone - the underdog who gets a shot at living his dream and makes the most of it. But Rambo is more of an anti-hero. Rather than living his dream, he's really trapped in a nightmare. You admire his toughness; you admire (in a way) his battle against obnoxious cops. And yet, at the same time, Rambo's a threatening and even frightening figure. You admire him, but you don't really warm up to him.Rambo's a Vietnam vet. He's a former green beret and a winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor. And he's a trained special ops soldier whose orders were basically to kill. Back home, though (as often happened to Vietnam vets) he was treated with contempt by a society sick of Vietnam, he was unable to hold a job. Then, reduced to being a drifter, he gets into a confrontation with a local sheriff (played by Brian Dennehy) who's none to happy to have Rambo's ""kind"" in his town. The confrontation escalates, and in pretty short order Rambo's at war with the sheriff's department, the State Police and the National Guard - and he's winning!Maybe it's implausible, but it does make for pretty good action, and overall I thought this was one of Stallone's better performance. The range of acting needed is greater than in the Rocky series, and Stallone does well with it, especially in a scene near the end of the movie when he plays a very emotional scene in the presence of his former commanding officer (Richard Crenna) when he breaks down and exposes his own personal demons dating back to his Vietnam experiences.This is really more than an action movie. It does - in an over the top way - deal with the issues faced by Vietnam vets who served their country and then returned home to find a country that didn't appreciate their efforts. Implausible, yes, and also violent, but overall this is an enjoyable movie. (7/10)",First Blood

Only discover he's too late as his pal had died of cancer. While, walking through town, the sheriff doesn't take to kindly to drifters and escorts Rambo out of his town. But when Rambo ignores his advice and tries to head back to the small town for a meal, the sheriff arrests him as a no-good vagrant that was resisting arrest and carrying a concealed weapon. When in prison the authorities were roughly cleaning him up, and through that, he has flashbacks of the torturous ordeal faced in Vietnam. This leads to him beating up the cops and escaping into the nearby woodlands. The sheriff wants his man, so they organise a hunting party, but shortly enough they find themselves becoming the target.Watch the bullets fly by and booby traps spring up in this slam-bang and quite thunderous action flick that at times does actually have a mild temperament compared with the overblown and outrageously silly, but fun comic book sequels. This was the first time I watched the original. I've seen the sequels plenty of times, but I was more than surprised about the quality of this one. The action is there, but unlike the sequels its got interesting facets. Plot-wise it's taken off David Morell's novel, but there are certain changes, especially the ending. It seems to show a little more meaning within its character's motives and hard-edge action sequences, which are very well executed. There's really no superhero display in Rambo's attitude, but more so an emotionally unstable man coming to grips with a society he can't figure out and fit in with. So, this becomes his little private war and the film's soul.The script can get a bit corny, but at least it has a little more weight to it. While, it's Sylvester Stallone's tremendously tortured performance that makes you cheer him on. His raw character has a little more ground and plausibility in his mindset. Brian Dennehy chews up the scenery whenever on screen as the determined local Sheriff Teasle. Also making appearances is a sturdy Richard Crenna as Colonel Trautman and a young David Curuso as one of the sheriff's men. One factor that hits you is that it doesn't take too long to fold out, as it swoops right into its engaging detail and gritty vigour with very little in the way of intro. Jerry Goldsmith trumps in with a well-integrated and harrowing score that paints the perfect mood to what's happening on screen. Andrew Laszlo's competently earthy photography manages to get right amongst the thick wilderness and director Ted Kotcheff makes perfect of the surroundings and slow rising tension.One of the better action yarns of the 80's.

47,Robert_duder,One of the most memorable action series began with this drama,8,23 January 2008,"One of the things that surprised me the most when I watched First Blood for the first time was that it wasn't an action film. Yes it had a lot of stunts and some action sequences but it wasn't the blow things up, in your face, guns blazing action that you might associate with Rambo films. Instead First Blood had a story...an important story...with a character that instilled itself into pop culture infamy forever and its easy to see why and how. First Blood is about stereotyping, profiling, exclusion, war and watching it nowadays makes it even more important than it was then or later on. With eye opening Vietnam films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Casualties of War and so forth First Blood did something that those films weren't able to do...take the exact same message and bring it to the mainstream public with one of the biggest stars of the day. In a way First Blood is almost shocking because essentially John Rambo is NOT the hero. I suppose he could be considered the 'anti-hero' but his actions are not saving anyone, and in fact hurting innocent people who can't possibly fight him but try to no avail anyways. Still the message is clear and it's a very story driven film with the creation of a movie icon.I'll argue with anyone, anytime...Sylvester Stallone is a very talented actor AND a very talented writer. No one could ever touch the character of John Rambo the way he did. Stallone went way beyond the action genre and actually created John Rambo from personality and history and his movements, everything. In this first installment he laid the groundwork for Rambo. Quiet, brooding, scorned, angry, unstable, haunted, deeply emotional but buried beneath all these other emotions. I think that's a hell of a performance in my books. Brian Dennehy is Stallone's rival and does a terrific job playing the conceited and determined small town sheriff who will stop at nothing to bring Rambo down. The two of them have a terrific on screen chemistry and Dennehy is a first rate actor. Richard Crenna adds to the cast as Rambo's only true 'family' and the one person he trusts. Crenna doesn't give a lot of variation to his performance, he's just kind of there to inform everyone of what Rambo is capable of. He is sort of monotoned and straight faced but he's a Rambo series staple and the character he plays is very important.Watch the end of this film closely for John Rambo's break down in the Grocery store when Traut (Crenna) tells him ""It's over."" You know the infamous line ""Not that it's over."" Watch the scene that follows and then tell me that you're not moved and blown away by Stallone's performance. It's real and it's important. First Blood by some will be considered untouchable by the rest because they see it for what it was likely meant to be...a drama...and important drama with a message but the film makers created this incredible character and by the time the film is done you're thinking one thing; I want to see this guy in his element in the action that they speak of and then you have the serializing of Rambo (which you will see by my review is NOT a bad thing.) I suppose I'm judging First Blood on it's merit of being considered an action film because as great as Stallone is and how interesting the film is...I didn't find it mind blowingly entertaining. Still the film is well made an absolute classic and definitely worth seeing. If you're a huge Rambo fan then you can find a lot of hidden details about this mysterious man that Stallone created. It's a must see on any list. 8/10 **************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home.

48,ElMaruecan82,They drew the first blood ...,8,29 October 2014,"... says Rambo to the guy who made him, Colonel Trautmann he couldn't be righter. You know this situation when you underestimate the strength or the dangerous power of that seemingly harmless guy who always keep his cool, and you have people around you telling you to apologize or just get the hell out before it's too late, you know nothing about the guy, but you start to make up an aura around him, and you know you've made a big mistake. In ""First Blood"", the first opus of ""Rambo"" series, the Police did that mistake, and they're gonna pay the biggest price.Indeed, there's one part that is absolutely irresistible in he film, it's the beginning. John Rambo just comes from Vietnam, looking for a friend, who lives somewhat in the most isolated area in USA's North, the man's dead from Cancer, because of that orange thing spread in Nam, says his wife. She almost could carry the man who formerly towered over everyone. Rambo is shocked, he gives the picture and tries to find the closest town to have some food, and probably some rest before getting back wherever he live. Life was hard for Vietnam Vets but he's got no one to hold his grudge against, that's just fatality, but somewhat, fatality isn't over yet with him.What is strange in Rambo is that the heart-pounding chase that is about to start isn't driven by a plot, or a motivation, there's no mission, nothing, just a great miscalculation from a man who awakened the monster behind that guy minding his own business. Brian Dennehy is Sheriff Teasle, a big burly man, nice looking, respectable, intimidating, he knows everyone by their first name in Hope, his town, boring as he wants to keep it. So, when he finds that smelly and dirty drifter entering his territory, he sees immediate disturbance and he tries as coolly and respectfully as possible to get rid of Rambo without hurting his feelings. ""Is there a law forbidding me to eat here"", ""Yes, me"", ""Why are you pushing me?"" asks Rambo, Teasle's speech about being the Sheriff of a quiet little town who wants to keep it that way, is a cliché now, but it worked then.It woks because it's straight to the point, and it's immediately illustrated by the following scene. Teasle leaves Rambo at the city exit, wish him goodbye and leave. If it was a Simpson gag (the series paid tribute to the film), you'd have cloud appearing and a storm starting in the background, the sky wasn't very welcoming anyway. But then, it's one of the most memorable pivotal moments from any film, that clear expression in Stallone's eyes saying ""what the hell has just happened?"" We know exactly what goes in his mind, what he's thinking, and naturally, we expect the right reaction, to get back on his road. Why did he do that? Principles  that's all. The man was insulted and he wouldn't take no crap from anyone, at that moment, ""Rambo"" takes off and delivers its premise. It's all about choosing your own path, and the deviation forced by Teasle wasn't acceptable.I remember the first time I saw the film, my father told me he was coming back from War, and I immediately assumed it was the last film,""Rambo III"", and I was so impressed by the film, I guessed the first movies would be pretty bad ass. But little did I know that the two other films would make a joke of the Rambo-figure making him exactly the type against what he was fighting. ""First Blood"" like ""Rocky"" is the first, and the best, it has provided the screen with a new immortal icon... after Rocky and Indiana Jones, the 80's begged for a franchise-military hero. And while the Vietnam Vet wasn't a totally fresh figure in 82, while, like Ebert pointed out, there had been ""Deer Hunter"", ""Travis Bickle"" or Bruce Dern in ""Coming Home"" and they didn't need to say much about their experience to know how haunting they were, John Rambo became the most vivid and iconic embodiment of the Nam trauma. Indeed, while the speech wasn't vital to understand Rambo because it was shown in microcosm in the film, it was still necessary.It was for one simple reason, it added substance to a character who was still a one-dimensional bad-ass hero trying to escape from the Cops and indeed fighting the Police with an undeniable superiority, but there had to be something in his heart that needed to come out. It was necessary because, as I said, the film had no specific plot, it was a sort of nihilistic escape that had no possible conclusion other than Rambo surrendering because he was, by essence, a good guy, the only death in the film wasn't his fault and he tried to conceal it, but the harm was done and the no-return limit was reached, so was Rambo, he broke his reaching point, and became a sort of Colonel Kurtz with no army, with all his experience of a Green Beret expressing itself, because that's what he was, more than anything, a Green Beret, the cause of his despise would be the cause of his triumph.The nervous breakdown in front of Colonel Trautman after Teasle was finally incapacitated is another highlight of Stallone's acting talent, when given a good script and an interesting character to hook your hearts on. As action-packed as it is, ""First Blood"" is also a fascinating character study, all the more fascinating because Rambo never says anything about himself, we see what he believe, he's strong like ten men, he masters every transportation and forest is his territory, not to mention the redundancy of Trautman praising his merits, to Teasle's much displeasure, the final element of his personality is finally imploded at the climactic speech. After that, the film can close, leaving us pretty much satsified.",First Blood
49,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It's a long road.,7,19 December 2019,"Though occasionally slow, 'First Blood (1982)' is usually entertaining and often tense as it builds an actual character around the now (thanks to its sequels) caricature of a lead, focusing on his struggles with PTSD and using his tragic tale as a commentary on the way the US treats its veterans. Despite all the destruction and otherwise impactful violence, there's only one kill, which is a far cry from its lead-slinging follow-ups. It goes to show just how powerful this piece's relatively small amount of pain - both internal and external - really is. It's more of a steady drama than an all out 'action flick', for sure. It's a much more resonant experience because of it. 7/10",First Blood

When he refuses to leave a town, he is thrown in jail where he was abused. He eventually escapes and he has to dodge the sheriffs who are after him.Sylvester Stallone is a very good actor that no one gives him credit for.

The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense. I highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric.

Now revisiting after 13 years, i found one interesting aspect of this picture. Althrough ""Rambo"" associates with action, physical force and weapons, ""First Blood"" isn't about the action at all. Action in this movie is never forced, it is logical consequence of the actions. Later movies became super action flicks, but this was always more about the character - it's actually a superb character study.Sylvester Stallone shines in one of his best acting works, creating unforgettable character. 32 years have past since this movie saw a day light, and it still looks great and most important feels real. And the ending - still one of the most powerful speeches in cinema, Stallone is absolutely brilliant in there.",First Blood
55,ironhorse_iv,Rambo gave the fans a war movie that they couldn't believe.,7,10 February 2013,"Oh John Rambo-- how much you have become to represent the testosterone full adrenaline action star who just shoots at anything that moves around you. John Rambo is too much a cartoon character like Flippy the green bear from Happy Tree Friends. Yes, I push it, Rambo. Before the over-kills, glorious violence that First Blood Part II and III gave us, there was First Blood. A movie with violence, but also very smart written with dark tone somber subtext message. First Blood was based on the book by David Morrell inspired by real-life post-Vietnam war era backlash against veterans. The movie by Ted Kotcheff seem like a modern day PG-13 version of the book. I'd love to see them remake First Blood in a contemporary setting and make it a little bit more hard core like the novel. Plus the ending to novel is shocking. Still, it's a good rated R film as it is. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam vet whom comes upon the town of Hope, looking for some food after mourning the lost of his war-time friend. Seeing him as a drifter on the road, Hope's sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) confronts Rambo offers him a lift to the town limits, hinting strongly that drifters aren't welcome here. Note in the U.S., some local officials encourage vagrants to move away instead of arresting them so it's a common theme here. While the movie wants to put Teasle as the bad guy guided to that conclusion by the storyline, if you pay attention to what Teasle is doing, you can see he isn't. He knows his citizens by name. He is a man of law and order. He doesn't back down to Rambo even though he knows he is superior to him. His motives are to keep his town peaceful and he thinks he is a threat, which somewhat came true. So he was justified in a way. He doesn't arrest him, at first. He knows Rambo might be trouble so he even gives him a lift out of town where he would be out of his jurisdiction. Will Tealse was doing his job. When Rambo politely declines Sheriff Teasle's suggestion by showing back into town, Rambo finds himself under arrest. While in custody, he isn't really treated right by the cops. Teasle says if he had a problem, Rambo could come to him and he would of reprimanded the officers. The police officers may have gone over board after he was in custody like trying to shave him. The sheriff officers weren't even that bad. David Caruso's character was the ""sympathetic"" cop too, but he's still an idiot. Just waiting for him to put on glasses and the CSI Miami music kicks in. It sent Rambo off, due to reminding him of Vietnam torture flashbacks. He then escape, commits several felonies batteries, grand theft auto twice, kidnapping, animal cruelty, speeding wreck-less and endangerment innocent lives with an automatic weapon and arson. All that because Teasle wouldn't let him get a cheeseburger in his town, gees. Rambo heads off road, with the entire police department on his trail in the forest. When his skills prove to be too much for Sheriff Teasle's men, the military arrives - led by Rambo's former commander in Vietnam, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), whose loyalties are divided between the man he trained and those seeking to bring him down. Colonel Trautman is treated with all the best one-liners in the film, but Sylvester Stallone does have his collection of one-liners too. Plus a speech, that is sad, but incoherent due to Stallone's slurring voice. I think the real message of the movie is that we need to treat our veterans better. All Rambo wanted was to get a cup of coffee and mourn a friend who died from cancer. Instead he got arrested by cops wanting to be a bit crude. The movie tries hard to make sure that Rambo will be seen as a tormented, misunderstood, amazingly resourceful victim of the Vietnam War, rather than as a sadist or a villain. Still, I wouldn't call Rambo, a victim. He still went overboard. While the film, tries to say away from the theme of Cop Killer by having Rambo didn't kill anybody still I think he might has cause a death or two somewhere in the film. The film is undeniably violent and features its share of grisly moments, but First Blood is more thought-provoking than its high death toll body count sequels, at least acknowledged that viewers might have functioning brains. The script was smart enough to recognize that Rambo's appeal was not limited to his big muscles and ability to mow down legions of bad guys with a really big gun yet it was tailored made for Stallone's macho, action-oriented persona. Stallone even help write the script. The music is stunning and both 'It's a long road' by Dan Hill and the theme song by Jerry Goldsmith tells the story of being alone. The movie inspired such works as 'The Park is Mine' and the 'Hunted' both with Tommy Lee Jones. Without First Blood, we might not have gotten Solid Snake and the Big Boss from Metal Gear Solid. So to think, the whole Rambo saga and a lot of movies wouldn't happen if had he just gotten some food. Check it out, and draw the first blood.",First Blood
56,The-Sarkologist,Alienation of the Vietnam Vet,8,16 September 2017,"This is one of those films that was hugely popular back in the eighties but for some reason simply fell by the wayside and has effectively been forgotten about. Okay, while it isn't the movie that catapulted Stallone into stardom (that was Rocky), it certainly helped. Mind you, it is also one of the movies that also Stallone as a stereotypical tough guy that speaks more with his fists than with his mouth. However, as a film it is quite good, and certainly much better than the three sequels that came after it. In fact the sequels seemed to toss the whole purpose of this film to simply turn Rambo into your typical action hero whose job is to go out and rescue people.Anyway, the movie is about a former special forces officer who served in Vietnam but upon returning to America has simply become a drifter. In fact everybody who he knew as a family have simply died leaving him effectively alone in the world. So, he simply drifts from place to place, however one of those places happens to be a small town called Hope, and the Sheriff decides that he doesn't particularly want people like Rambo wandering through his town so he forcefully has him removed, and when Rambo doesn't comply he arrests him, takes him to the station and roughs him up a bit.Well, that happens to be a bad move because not only does it trigger a number of flash backs, but it also causes him to snap, beat up all of the occupants of the police station, and then flee into the mountains. Well, being the cocky small town police that they are they decide to go after Rambo alone, but pretty quickly discovered that that is definitely not a good idea since he takes out each and every one of them. Then, when the cavalry is called in, he not only manages to escape their trap, but takes the fight into town where we come to the dramatic conclusion.First Blood isn't your typical action movie by a long shot. Okay, you do technically have the bad guys in the form of the police, but the thing is that these police aren't corrupt in the sense that some police officers are but rather they are simply protective of their town to the point that they will push strangers around and politely ask them to leave if it seems as if they are going to cause trouble. Well, the problem is that when you push the wrong person around it has the potential to come back and bite you.The thing with this film is that it is about how the Vietnam Vets were treated when they returned home from war. It wasn't the heroes welcome that the WWII vets received, but rather they were ignored, and in some sense blamed, for the failure in Vietnam. This was America and they don't lose wars, but Vietnam was an effective loss, so it must have been the troops who were the reason that they lost. The thing is that this was a different type of war, and one that they Americans didn't adapt to at the time (though past experiences have demonstrated that they can fight a guerrilla war). However, that is not the issue in the film, it is the treatment of the vets that is.In a way they were left on the trash heap of society, and when they were able to pick themselves up out of it they were once again blamed for where they landed up. In many cases it was the World War II vets that were looking down on them because they too had been to war, and they had managed to transition back into civilian life, so if the Vietnam Vets weren't able to then maybe they weren't trying hard enough. However, as mentioned, Vietnam was a different type of war and as such the experiences that the Vets had over there were different to those that the WWII vets faced.Some people simply label First Blood as a mindless action film, but I would say that it is much, much more than that. It doesn't end the way a mindless action film ends, but rather confronts us with the alienation that Vietnam Vets face in the United States. It also confronts us with the bigotry of small town America, though you are no doubt going to find that in many small communities the world over. It challenges us to how we should look at working with our vets, and attempting to seek solutions to these problems than simply sweeping them under the rug. The thing is that no doubt there are going to be similar issues in relation to the vets of the Iraq War, and things no doubt have the potential to be much worse for them due to the hypercapitalist nature of the modern world.",First Blood

58,slightlymad22,Stallone Finally Gets A Hit Away From Rocky,10,30 December 2015,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 'First Blood'.Plot In A Paragraph: John Rambo (Stallone) is a former United States Special Forces soldier who fought in Vietnam and won the Congressional Medal of Honor, but his time in Vietnam haunts him. As he came to Hope, Washington to visit a friend, he was guided out of town by the Sheriff William Teasel when Rmabo tries to return to the town he is arrested. As he escapes to the nearby woods, he goes on a rampage, as Teasle and his deputies pursue him.Stallone had two hit movies in 1982, for the first time in his career. This was also his first hit movie away from 'Rocky'. Sly gives his best performance since 'Rocky' in this movie he is totally absorbing and brilliant. That's not to say his performances have not been good, as I have enjoyed them all. This is also his best movie since 'Rocky'. All the supporting cast are superb here too!! Brian Denehey is fantastic and Richard Crenna is wonderful as Rambo's Colonel who is condescending and patronising in the delivery of his lines to Denehey's Teasle. Jerry Goldsmith also hits a home run with his score. As does the Dan Hill track ""It's A Long Road""I honestly believe this should have been considered for some Oscars that year, as its a 10/10 from this reviewer.",First Blood
59,paulclaassen,Watch it for the action...,5,20 November 2020,"Due to the success of the franchise, 'First Blood' is now known as 'Rambo - First Blood'.Sylvester Stallone stars as an ex-soldier avenging a handful of corrupt cops who mistreated him for no reason at all. And he certainly has the skills and experience to outwit them. Its hard to believe this film was made almost four decades ago. It still holds incredibly well and certainly stood the test of time.I believe the action sequences and Stallone in the lead to be the selling point for this film. At the time, Stallone already gained worldwide recognition as Rocky Balbao in the 'Rocky' films. As for 'First Blood', I have a lot of issues with the film, but mainly with the lead character. He sure do cause way too much damage for a 'responsible, innocent' guy. His actions go way beyond what is called for. And he really ought to talk more.If you're looking for an action flick that doesn't really care much for justifying character actions, and you're a fan of Stallone, then this is definitely for you. I believe the message here is never to judge a book by its cover, figuratively speaking, off course. And it was quite fun seeing the tables turned.

60,sol-,War veteran parable,7,20 February 2016,"Academy Award winner Sylvester Stallone is well cast here as a decorated Vietnam War veteran who takes a detour through a small town where he is mistaken for a vagrant, abused and mistreated by the local police until breaking point. While Stallone's now iconic character of Rambo is often associated with unrelenting violence, the body count in 'First Blood' is refreshingly low as the film is about Rambo's quest to survive rather than avenge; he even asks his antagonists at various points to desist, but of course, the local police are too arrogant to listen. 'First Blood' does not have the likeliest of stories as Rambo soon proves superhuman and indestructible, barely suffering a scratch for all of his ordeals, but for what the film lacks in credibility, it makes up for in intelligent, dark satire. As Rambo points out in a poignant speech near the end, ""back here, there's nothing"" for him and no ""code of honour"". Rambo represents all the soldiers who returned from Vietnam to be called killers and murderers rather than heroes and freedom fighters and his struggle is symbolic of the struggle of all Vietnam vets to reintegrate in a society that does not want them. There is also a curious irony of sorts in that the US trained to Rambo to be such a good soldier that he is nearly impossible to kill. What if Rambo (or any of his fellow soldiers) suddenly snapped and decided to use all their training for ill-purpose on home soil? While 'First Blood' is an exciting, well-paced thriller on face value, it is the film's screenplay, full of such thought-provoking ideas, that really makes it tick.",First Blood

62,tomgillespie2002,Interesting observation of the post-Vietnam American consciousness,5,19 November 2012,"Giving the decades action hero his (or hers) raison d'etre, John Rambo became the ultimate right-wing icon, and, through the First Blood sequels, exacerbated the one-man-army excesses that became so pervasive in action cinema. But before the hyperbole of Republican jingoism, - where the scars of the Vietnam war were refreshed and revised when Reagan, quoting from Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), stated that; ""This Time We're Gonna Win"" - Rambo, or more specifically, the Vietnam veteran, was persecuted in American society.Sylvester Stallone's ""John J."" drifts through the American landscape searching for the remnants of his Green Beret troop, but finds despair in their absence. The veteran often came back to from the war unable to adjust to civilian life, left with the trauma of warfare, they were subjected to dehumanising abuses by the hippie generation, the middle- class students of the anti-war protesters (as Rambo says ""They call us baby killers""). Rambo represents the American working class, the bottom of society, who were abused by foreign policy, trained into machines of death, and forgotten about. Unable to hold a job in the negative climate, Rambo wanders, like the Western outlaw, attempting to find his retirement. Much like the conventions of the classic American Western, the lone outsider enters a small town (not the sun blistered West, but the cold, isolated North-East), finding the antagonistic Sheriff Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who's only concern is containing the status quo.In Rambo and Teasle there are two souls damaged by late 1960's American politics. Rambo has been reduced to an angry outsider, whilst Teasle, who clearly continued as Sheriff during the war, would have seen the United States reduced to civil disobedience. Rambo enters town with long hair, he is unwashed, and displays the stars and strips on his jacket, a flag that had lost its meaning in the hearts of men like Teasle. So when this nomadic person, a post-war hippie, drifts into his territory, he is myopic in his attempts to get rid of him. In creating this vacuity of an idealised America, the sheriff protects from the transient generation. The two characters are the different generations, and the divide between these different ideologies. They have both been trained by US authorities, and each, like the country itself, only foresees victory and survival.The structure of First Blood is very simplistic. After being arrested and taken to the local police station, Rambo makes a spectacular escape, making his way on a motorcycle to the rocky, and heavily wooded mountains. After which Rambo is pursued as the authorities, and the audience, begin to discover his exceptional survival techniques, and he wages his own personal war against American small-town hypocrisy, including the inept national guard, made up of local hicks, too young to have any knowledge of war. Unlike the similarly themed action films that proceeded First Blood, Rambo does not actually kill anyone intentionally (Galt (Jack Starrett) falls from a helicopter after a rock hits it, only because he unfastens his seat belt), which actually adds corners to an otherwise one-dimensional character.Rambo's final outburst of violence is directed at the buildings of the small town. The symbols of progress, and the inscrutable institution, the machine of society, of which he is a small, expendable component, a government trained killing machine. Originally to be played by Kurt Russell, Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) is the military, the superior and trainer of this broken machine. As Rambo's only exterior relationship, he acts as his father figure. The two characters become human when sharing the screen. An often lampooned scene in First Blood is the emotional outpouring by Stallone, which is at times incomprehensible, as his character finally has a voice, but this scene is pivotal to his redemption.Based on a 1972 novel by David Morrell, the film makers thoughtfully toned down the more extreme book. It is a competently made action film, the more ridiculous elements of the one-man-army aspects of the narrative have since been diminished by the more over-the-top action that followed. First Blood sits comfortably within the transition from '70's anti-heroes to the machine-bodies of the '80's. It looks back at Clint Eastwood and Travis Bickle, whilst moving towards a Schwarzenegger. It has muscle and explosive action, some thrilling stunts, and a squeamish scene of Rambo sewing his own gashed arm with a needle and thread. But with this comes an interesting (if slightly over the top) observation of the post-Vietnam American consciousness, the barren psychological landscape, and the harsh effects of war on the individual, what we would call Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",First Blood

Stuck in a war that siphoned off the lives of so many young soldiers, we ended up with nothing more than a stalemate that propped up another corrupt government. Plus, the anti-war venom grew so fierce stateside that when soldiers returned, they were often jeered instead of cheered for their service. This film tells the story of one of those soldiers.For a basic plot summary, ""First Blood"" focuses on John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a returning 'Nam vet who gets hassled by a small-town sheriff (Brian Dennehy) for no more offense than looking like a drifter (with his scraggly beard, beat-up army coat, and knapsack). When the sheriff won't back down and Rambo has some war flashbacks that set him off, it sets up a manhunt in the woods that sees the soldier start picking off the town's policemen one by one in order to ""survive"". Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), Rambo's old commanding officer, then shows up to explain to the sheriff what he is dealing with...the best of the best who will never back down.The thing I find truly amazing about this film is that, while it is a ""war film"" through and through, there are not actually any scenes of warfare involved in the entire 90 minutes. Instead, director Ted Kotcheff takes a much more oblique, psychological approach to the character of John Rambo. Though the audience never knows exactly what Rambo did or saw in Vietnam, by the time the film concludes it is very much apparent the type of man/soldier he was and thus why he ""snaps"" under pressure from the sheriff.The acting in ""First Blood"" is also first-rate, with Sly Stallone turning in arguably his best ever on- screen performance, despite not uttering more than a handful of lines the entire movie (though his impassioned plea to Col. Troutman ranks up their with Jack Nicholson's ""You can't handle the truth!"" speech in A Few Good Men). Dennehy is perfect as the ignorant sheriff that the audience can love to hate and cheer when he ""gets his"" in the end.Overall, I consider this to be one of (if not THE) best of the ""war effects"" films ever produced. Current movies like ""Brothers"" and ""Jarhead"" have tried to duplicate this type of filmmaking, but have fallen far short of this standard.",First Blood
65,poe426,Ironies abound...,7,29 July 2014,"Because I'd been a boxing fan all my life, I was familiar with Stallone's movies- and with some of his personal history, which was included in the big ROCKY book about the making of the movie. To wit: his avoidance of the Draft, which he did by leaving the country. In FIRST BLOOD, he plays a gung ho soldier a few cans short of a six pack who goes off on a hick town whose sheriff can't keep his hands to himself (played by real life Vietnam vet Brian Dennehy). Rocky Rambo puts the town to the torch (not unlike the way an American soldier would torch a hootch in 'Nam), but, for all his supposed prowess as a killing machine (Richard Crenna, in an unintentionally hilarious part, tells the sheriff to ""lay in a big supply of body bags""), he doesn't really do all that much killing. (In the book, he evens commits suicide.) FIRST BLOOD IS very well directed and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, but Stallone chews the scenery badly and the subsequent films just got worse and worse. Guess you had to be there...",First Blood

However First Blood is essentially a film apart. Yes it has some implausible moments but they are carried through by the compassion you feel for the character who has lost everything.Early David Caruso is a big part of why this movie works, his expressions of concern, sympathy and later fear counteract the lack of those feelings from all other members of the community.Outstanding!",First Blood

71,matthewssilverhammer,Better Than It's Sequels Would Have You Believe,8,20 September 2019,"The legend of Rambo has gotten a bit out-of-hand over the last 35 years. Because of the cultural reputation and the obnoxiously bombastic sequels, he's often seen as the manliest of men, an archetype of the sweaty, bulging action stars of the 80s and 90s. It's a strange transformation, given where this character started. Sure, First Blood has its share of bad-to-the-bone bloody action. However, I think we forget that the movie ends with our hero breaking down on the floor of a police station, decrying the horrors of Vietnam and our treatment of those soldiers as they return home. We forget that this first Rambo is a well-directed, deeply soulful and honest post-war study that's as caring as it is thrilling.
Stallone's career has largely been defined by two characters: Rambo and Rocky, with the latter being the one he is most praised for and serves as proof he can do more than just throw a punch and shoot a machine gun. However, his turn as migrant war veteran John Rambo is as subtle and heartbreakingly unhinged as you could want. Sure, you get the marquee moments of Rambo rigging R-rated-Kevin-McAlister type traps in the woods, but mostly you're watching a broken man learning how to live in a broken country, neither of whom recognize one another anymore.
It's a powerful statement on the psychological effects of war, made even more powerful because of it's seeming unlikely placement in a movie that promises (and often delivers on) macho action violence. First Blood is a thoughtful and gripping little adventure tale, that's easily the 2nd best 80s Christmas action movie; Mr. McClain is a tough guy to bring down.",First Blood
72,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The dangerous and unstable war vet makes for a great action movie focus,8,23 May 2009,"The concept of war in their own backyard is a foreign one to most Americans. With two tragic exceptions, no blood has been shed on American soil in wartime since the Civil War. ""First Blood"" is a thrilling fantasy in that regard, turning the Pacific Northwest into the Vietnam jungle and introducing a character so deadly and skilled yet so mentally unstable that he manages to elicit both sympathy and total fear.John J. Rambo (Stallone) is a dangerous case of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drifting his way toward Portland after learning that no one who survived Vietnam from his unit is still alive. At first he's quiet and complicit -- a perfect role for Stallone -- but when he starts getting lip from a small-town sheriff (Brian Dennehy) who arrests him out of pure dislike, his abuse by the police awakens painful memories and he violently escapes, using the wilderness as a hideout from the relentless and prideful sheriff, declaring ""war"" when they draw first blood.Stallone creates his second iconic character in Rambo, a role fitting for his limited acting range: He must either say nothing, be violent or act completely insane. Still, the character is cool, intimidating and his unfair treatment in the film manages to win our support and sympathy. He is terribly misunderstood and completely dangerous; an exciting combination for a main character.""First Blood"" is not a great example of suspenseful and exciting film-making, but Rambo's raw, untamed survivor-man appearance and the fact that at some point in the film you know he's bound to go berserk, keeps the film interesting. That and the fact that the colonel who trained Rambo (Richard Crenny) keeps dropping these giddy one-liners such as ""I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you, I came here to rescue you from him."" The acting is mostly sub-par, with even a young David Caruso giving some of the worst and most awkward line deliveries I've ever seen. Dennehy is good but his character is so completely stubborn and ignorant that he hardly counts. Regardless, the acting does nothing to enhance the movie -- it's success is all about a great, simple concept.Rambo is completely uncomplicated, not even delving into Rambo's Vietnam experience other than a few quick flashbacks and his one monologue to Colonel Trautman. It could have made the film better, but a dangerous war vet taking out small-town American cops when it wasn't even his fault is genius fodder for an action movie and even some food for thought.",First Blood

74,Anonymous_Maxine,True models of law enforcement.,6,28 May 2004,"First Blood is the unexpectedly simplistic story of a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran who returns to America and is shunned by the people who's freedom he was fighting for, as was so famously the case with so many soldiers returning from that war, regardless of how much or how little they believed in the war itself. I have to say here that the story is simplistic because it really boils down to John Rambo fighting a One Man War for his very life but really for no reason. His plans to visit an old Vietnam friend are crushed when he learns that that friend died of cancer that he developed from Agent Orange in Vietnam, and so he immediately becomes a drifter. Evidently he had no other plans and came from nowhere, and therefore has nowhere to go. I won't go into whether or not the book went into more detail about where Rambo came from or why he has no destination whatsoever beyond visiting his friend, because I haven't read it.I have, however, seen the movie, and at this point in the trilogy, I find it rather surprising that Rambo has become something of a cultural icon because of this film and the two sequels. In First Blood, as he wanders aimlessly down the highway, he stumbles into a small town and right into the town sheriff, who politely escorts him to the town limits, saying that drifters only cause trouble but he's more than welcome to grab a bite to eat 30 miles down the road. After being dropped off, Rambo promptly walks back toward town, is promptly noticed and arrested, and ultimately ends up in an all-out battle with what has to be the most incompetent police force on earth, then with the most incompetent state police force on earth, and finally the most incompetent national guard on earth.First the town police can't even get Rambo to put his fingerprints on the paper, then he manages to punch his way completely out of the police station while unarmed, then the state police starts a massive manhunt, apparently unable to find Rambo, who is conspicuously hiding out in his enormous log cabin in the woods, in which he builds a nice fire and takes a nap, and then the national guard is afraid to pursue him in a mine shaft, so they fire a grenade into it instead, but only after the senior officer importantly says, 'Wait, lemme get outta the way first' Just so you know, the type of elite military forces that would be sent on such a mission are just that. Elite forces. And by that, of course, I mean these guys don't mess round. They don't respond to orders with 'No way, I ain't going' in there!' The commanding officer of such a company would never, while under fire, call out, 'Who's got the rocket launcher?' Nor would he say 'Give that man a cee-gar!' 'Bullseye!' or, heaven forbid, 'Come on you guys, shoot!' Rambo's rampage is somewhat justified by the mental scars that he suffered from his training and work in the Vietnam War, although that topic only comes up right at the beginning of the film and then in the closing scene, when he suddenly starts ranting and raving about how bad the Vietnam veterans have it back in America, spouting more dialogue all at once than he had in the entire film up to that point. If he had been able to explain any of this to the idiot police officers in the beginning of the film, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble. Sure, we wouldn't have had a movie that way, but he wouldn't have had to throw himself off the side of a sheer cliff and into a tree to avoid getting shot, either. Not a bad trade-off, I should think.The reason it seems curious to me that this movie has inspired two sequels and a cult following is that, while it's true the movies are certainly fun to watch, the logic is nonexistent, even for a cheesy action movie. Rambo allows himself to be taken into custody by men that he could snap like twigs, then doesn't react to anything, including such benign queries as 'Name?' until he has a razor to his throat. By the way, this is the nicest criminal justice system I've ever heard of. Not only do they assign you a court date the very morning after your arrest, they even assign half of the police force to be on hand while they give you a shave so you'll be presentable in court. Even worse, the whole movie is based on irreversible combat training that Rambo is acting on, in massive self-defense, which is what causes him to enter into a one-man war against the town police force, the state police, and the national guard. Sure, soldiers come back with post-traumatic stress syndrome as well as the remnants of dangerous training that can lead to harsh reactions to small provocations and sleepless nights, because these people have been so heavily trained for combat that some of that remains after the war. What the movie catastrophically forgets is that, along with combat training, soldiers also come out of the military with intense respect for authority figures, especially those in uniform. Not Rambo. Not only does he treat the police as well as the national guard like the subjects of a hunt, he doesn't even respect the very guy that trained him. Somewhere along the way, it seems, Rambo snapped and lost all control of his abilities, becoming a dangerous weapon, a lethal weapon, if you will, who does, in fact, need to be stopped. Unfortunately, the guys who should be the good guys are such morons that it is impossible to root for them, even if they weren't led by the sheriff, who is the only really bad guy in the movie. First Blood is fairly clever as a manhunt film, but as an informational movie about what it's like for Vietnam veterans it's pretty outlandish. Sure, there are tons of problems surrounding that war and the soldiers did return and get pretty bad treatment, but Rambo is such a two-dimensional character that it's almost a shame to see him representing them. He came from nowhere and goes nowhere at the end, all we see is him going nuts. I hope the movie hasn't actually contributed to the problems that Vietnam veterans have had to face.",First Blood
75,imseeg,"""They drew First Blood..."".",8,5 May 2018,"I hate dumb action movies and Sylvester Stallone often stars in them, but ""Rambo First Blood"" is an exception to the rule. This is truly a well made action movie with a great revenge theme in it. The story: a deranged vietnam vet flees jail. 90 minutes of pursuit follows. Will he live, will he die?I hesitantly put on this movie, expecting the worst dumb action movie, but I got pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of attention for detail: great glorious american soundtrack. I mean really only americans can make such a gloriously suspenseful soundtrack. Compliments to Jerry Goldsmith. Great photography too, I mean really great camerawork with pursuit scenes that actually uses stuntmen instead of computer generated action. Long takes without cuts. Real explosions too. Yes, for those too young too remember, there was a time when many explosions in movies were actually REAL. NO GREEN SCREEN and NO CGI. For a moment I even thought they used actual REAL machineguns too, because in one scene an entire builing gets blasted by a huge handheld machinegun and it looks damn real. The stuntmen get special praise in the end credits. They get top billing. That's unusual, but when you have seen the actionscenes you will understand why.""Rambo First Blood"" is a thrilling action movie with great acting in it. Acting is always paramount, even in an action movie. Bad acting spoils the credibility of the characters. Only explosions and chases alone cant make an action movie a classic. Fortunately ""Rambo First Blood"" is a joy to watch. There are 3 lead characters in it, of which 2 are full blown enemies of eachother. It sure makes for an enticing thrilling watch. It has become a modern classic, however critically gutted it was back in the eighties, it was still one of the biggest most popular action movies of the entire eighties!

76,gwnightscream,One Of Stallone's Best!,7,11 March 2012,"Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy star in this 1982 action film based on the novel.

He mentally unstable, and when the town began to abuse him, he goes off the deep end. Why did they do this? It's because of the local sheriff(Brian Dennehy). He made sure that no Vietnam veterans come here. One member of the police force admired Rambo. Others consider him a menace to society. The reason why most veterans come to the U.S. homeless is because of the stress from war. Rambo uses his combat smarts to take out the town. The only person who would understand him is Col. Trautman(Richard Crenna). The chase scenes was amazing. I liked the parts where the dirt-bike and the police car make the jump over the railroad crossing. The army truck scene is a classic. I liked it when the truck jumped the roadblock, and when the truck crashed the gas pumps and Rambo blew it up. The town should have know better than to ban Vietnam Veterans from coming home from the war. Goes to show they were being completely UN-American!

78,bsmith5552,He Could Have Killed All of You!,7,1 September 2006,"""First Blood"" has been crucified by the critics, but I totally disagree. Taken for what it is, its an excellent action film with memorable characters and plenty of excitement.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a Green Beret special forces member, has returned from Viet Nam. He goes to visit the only other surviving member of his unit only to learn that his friend has died of cancer, caused by the chemicals he had been exposed to in the war. Now Rambo is truly alone. Trained to kill, his expertise is no longer needed as he tries to fit into society.While walking towards a small town, he encounters the local sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who takes an immediate dislike to Rambo and winds up arresting him for vagrancy. When taken to the police station he refuses to cooperate and gets roughed up by sadistic deputy Galt (Jack Starrett). Rambo explodes and manages to escape into the wilderness.Rambo goes into the forested hills as Teasle and his deputies Ward (Chris Mulkey), Lester (Al Humphries), Shingleton (David Crowley) and Mitch (a very young David Carouso) pursue him. Rambo with his guerrilla training, takes each of them out in turn, injuring but not killing them except for Galt who plummets from a helicopter to his death.After Teasle believes that Rambo has been killed, he is greeted by Rambo's former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) who doubts that Rambo is dead. He tells Teasle that ""he could have killed all of you if he so chose"". Traupman manages to contact Rambo by radio and tries to talk him down. Rambo refuses and manages to make his way into the town where.................Stallone made an interesting statement in his DVD commentary. He likened Rambo to the Frankenstein's monster running amok in the forest attacking anyone whom he encounters. The monster was created by science and Rambo by the army. Both are thrust into an alien world and are seeking to find their place in it. That comment to me, puts the whole story in perspective and gave me a better appreciation of what the Rambo character is all about.Stallone like the monster, has little to say except for a soliloquy at the end. The casting of Dennehy as Rambo's chief protagonist, raises the film up a couple of notches. Crenna has little to do but give his famous looking down the nose stare. Starrett is good as the brutal Galt but he exits much too soon. Thet could have lost the unnecessary weekend warrior sequence without losing anything in the story.Followed by two sequels.",First Blood

80,freemantle_uk,The traumas of war,7,19 May 2009,"In the 1970s America was in the myers, suffering from economic problems, Watergate, the Vietnam War and the subsequence protect movement. In 1972 a little novel called First Blood was written which set out to be an anti-war novel and its affects on people. 10 years later this novel was made into a successful film, commerically and critically, starting Sylvester Stallone.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), is Vietnam vet, a green beret. He discovers that he is the last of his unit and has become a drifter. Whilst walking he goes to a town called Hope in Washington State. The redneck sheriff Will (Brian Dennehy) warns him to stay away and drives him through the town. Rambo is pushed and ends up getting arrested. Whilst in police custody Rambo suffers from police brutality and flashbacks of being tortured by the Vietnamese. He snaps, attacks the officers, and makes a run for it in the forest. There his guerrilla warfare training kicks in, and easily fires of the local police and national guard. He starts a one man war against the sheriff as he trauma is brought back.First Blood kicked off the very successful Rambo series, sporning 3 further films. Rambo 2 and 3 became very right wing, with America re-fighting and winning in Vietnam and then with Rambo beating back the Soviets in Afganstan. However, First Blood had more of a heart and a message about the treatment of veterans and the trauma they suffer (admittly taking it to the extremes). It's a bit more psychological then the other Rambo films. The direction by Ted Kotcheff, he handled the actors and the action well. I personally enjoyed how Rambo was able to camouflage himself, and able to fight with instinct. It gives you a good insight in the style of war, and how the survival skills were transfered to forests of North-West America. The writers and director also made sure that to keep Rambo a moral and sympathetic character he never killed anyone directly. That was a wise more so the audience can support him. It's a little like Jason Bourne before Bourne came to the cinema. Out of the 80s actions stars, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme (80s and 90s), Steven Seagal (admittly 90s), etc... Stallone is the best actor out of all them and this was a strong performance by him, especially his final speech. Kotcheff made sure he didn't make a clichéd action film.However there are two major films. Firstly the premise is a little thin. Why did Rambo bother going back to the town in the first place? But there are worst ideas and Rambo is a decent film. Second is sadly the film is dated nowadays compared modern actions films (Bourne films) and war films (Saving Private Ryan). But it is a standard of good to 80s auctioneers.It's worth watching if you want something short to escape the world.",First Blood
81,strong-122-478885,When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again. Hoorah! Hoorah!,2,17 November 2013,"*Possible Spoilers Ahead!*Yep. A shiny, gold star goes to anyone who can clearly understand more than 3 words of what Stallone's character was babbling about during his final monologue.Whatever the frick Rambo was ranting on and on and on about (ho-hum!) in this supposedly dramatic and emotional moment was pretty much lost on me. All that I got from his spewing was just a demented slur of inarticulate rubbish. It was a truly terrible display of the verbal venting of pent-up anger that I've ever witnessed.(Sorry, but, no ""Oscar"" nod for Stallone on that one) If I didn't know better I'd have sworn that Stallone's character (little Johnny Rambo) was a certified mental defect of the highest order.If First Blood had been billed as a silly, slapstick Comedy, then, yes, I could've appreciated its asininity-factor to some degree. But, this utter nonsense was deemed as being regarded with the utmost dead-seriousness. And, of course, with that, no one would ever dare to be allowed to even chuckle at the likes of Sylvester Stallone, the King of Self-Love.The one scene (of many) that totally killed me was where Rambo (who was being shot at by an officer with terrible aim) leaps from clinging to the side of a sheer-faced cliff and plunges about 50 feet, crashing through trees and then finally landing on the jagged rocks below - Only to walk away from this certain-death ordeal with just a bad scratch to be concerned about. (Ha! What a laugh-and-a-half that was!) If you were to ask me, I'd swear that they were actually making this garbage up as they went along. And, naturally, with Stallone being one of the screenplay's co-writers, my presumption probably isn't too far off the mark on that one.First Blood is clearly the sort of ramshackle-movie where one doesn't give a single, sweet damn about any of its characters. They were all despicable, each and every one of them.I think its somewhat revealing to note that (other than seen very briefly in this film's opening scene) there was literally no female presence, whatsoever, happening in the story. Viewing First Blood from the perspective of an adult male, I certainly thought that this total lack of women spoke volumes about Stallone's attitude towards the opposite sex.This wretched mess also lost itself some considerable points by its blatant placement of certain well-known consumer products such as Coke, Chevron, Dairy Queen and Raleigh cigarettes.And, after all is said and done, I ask you - Did this Rambo-bozo really have the sort of image that Stallone wanted so badly to be identified with? Well, I guess that this was the case - 'Cause as his films that followed after First Blood showed, he literally milked this contemptuous character to its very last drop, and then some.Anyways - When Johnny comes marching home again. Hoorah! Hoorah! We'll give him a hearty welcome then. Hoorah! Hoorah!",First Blood
82,PWNYCNY,Misunderstood vet.,8,8 October 2005,"Sylvester Stallone knows how to pick his roles because this role was meant for him. Here he plays a troubled Vietnam War veteran who cannot adjust to a civilian society that rejects him for the very service that he rendered on behalf of his country, and now treats him as if he is the enemy. One can reasonably ask: Is this any way to treat a soldier who simply did his job? This question is implicit throughout this movie. The poor guy is hounded, harassed, mistreated, humiliated and ultimately spurned for no reason other than ""he was passing through"" and looked like he could be a ""troublemaker."" And what's even worse is that even the U. S. Army itself ignored him. As Rambo himself complains, he called his Colonel but was told the Colonel wasn't in. And when the Coloenl finally does respond, it's too little too late. Rambo has reverted to his soldierly ways in order to defend himself - this time against his own country.",First Blood
83,dee.reid,"""First Blood"" - A necessary action film...",8,23 May 2005,"...That got bogged down by the monosyllabic and ridiculous action set-pieces of its later sequels. ""First Blood"" saved star Sylvester Stallone's then-fledgling career and in doing so, created an American action hero icon that would eventually come to rival the likes of Schwarzenegger and Norris in later years.But, people today may look back at this violent film from 1982 and laugh at the fact that Stallone was involved in its production; probably the stereotypical images of the later sequels drag down the experience. (Why, oh, why did the world's political climate play into this character's demise in the '80s?)""First Blood"" is also very easily one of Stallone's best and most skilled acting performances, being that his dialogue is kept to a minimum (at least until his dramatic and emotional tirade at the end), and instead allows his character's motivations and violent actions speak for themselves.Adapted from the novel by David Morrell and deftly directed by Ted Kotcheff, it tells the story of disturbed Vietnam veteran and ex-Green Beret John Rambo (Stallone), who arrives in a small town in the Pacific Northwest looking to reunite with an old buddy from his days in the service.While walking down the road, he's approached by the town's no-nonsense sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), and from their first encounter, Teasle and Rambo immediately don't like each other. Teasle then demands that Rambo leave the town and is willing to escort him to the town's limits and forget any misunderstandings that may have come between them. But because Rambo knows that he has broken no laws and is being treated unfairly by the sheriff, he then takes this small town sheriff and the National Guard to war.Using his expert combat training, Rambo is able to successfully elude his would-be captors in several suspenseful and climatic action sequences set in the Pacific Northwestern wilderness. Teasle becomes obsessed with capturing this wanderer who's turned his town into a war zone. It seems that Rambo can only be stopped by Rambo, or some thoughtful coaxing by his former colonel, Samuel Trautman.""First Blood"" has already gained a reputation for being a tension-filled and skillful action movie that surprisingly has very few explosions and a low body count. You would think that a movie dealing with such tumultuous subject matter would be splattered with wall-to-wall with action, wouldn't you? That's what I thought at first, but again, this is a movie that apparently likes to keep things to a minimum, and that could include action scenes.Under the film's surface, however, it tells a story of a man so deeply affected by his wartime experiences that he has difficulty separating his battlefield nightmares from peacetime stability. Stallone gets all of this just right and in healthy doses. Dennehy is also quite menacing as the obsessive sheriff, a 'Nam veteran himself, who makes the terrible mistake of setting off a brutal war that eventually, no one ever wins.""First Blood"" is a definitive and (dare I say it) marvelous action film that should be separated from its sequels and negative pop culture influences. Instead, it should be viewed on its own, without any outside intrusion, and let it stand alone as a testament to a horrific war that destroyed more lives than it ever saved.8/10",First Blood
84,FilmCriticLalitRao,Director Ted Kotcheff depicts the amazing fight of an innocent man against a corrupt system.,8,1 September 2015,"American film 'First Blood' concerns the fight of an innocent man against a corrupt system.It describes how corrupt practices continue to prevail within certain American police stations who would abuse their powers in order to discriminate against people whom they choose to term as outsiders.The pace of the film is fast and no time has been wasted to convey the message that a powerful innocent person would retaliate with ferociousness once he is challenged by thugs.By making 'First Blood',Director Ted Kotcheff has been successful in showcasing the frustrations of a former Vietnam war veteran whose strength was underestimated by brutish police force in a small American town.It is true that 33 years after its making,this film continues to be praised as one of the best action films.However,there are other reasons to watch 'First Blood' as it was also instrumental in revealing Sylvester Stallone's acting abilities.Lastly,the survival of a former army veteran in harsh nature is one of the unique facets of First Blood.This is something which has not been depicted by many action films.",First Blood

Saddled with certain genre baggage, I'm still not sure it gets the respect that it so richly deserves.The environment is a character of its own, and highlighted by Andrew Laszlo's gorgeous cinematography, its harsh beauty is the canvas on which director Ted Kotcheff paints his near masterpiece.Featuring exceptional performances from its three key actors; Sylvester Stallone, Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna, 'First Blood' remains the high water mark for the genre.",First Blood
86,jimbo-53-186511,Like Rambo himself; First Blood is taut and badass,8,27 November 2019,"Former Vietnam War Veteran and Green Beret John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) comes to the town of Hope looking for a former friend and fellow war comrade. Whilst he doesn't find his friend, he does bump into the town sheriff William Teasel (Brian Dennehy) who takes a disliking to Rambo based on his mistaken belief that due to Rambo's dishevelled appearance he is some kind of bum rather than the solider that he actually is. When Teasel decides to bring Rambo in, Rambo breaks free when flashbacks from Vietnam force him to attack several police officers and escape into the forest. Once there Rambo calls upon all his survival instincts to try to outsmart and outfox the town's police folk and given Rambo's pedigree the Army feel the police's only chance of bringing Rambo in lies with his former Commander Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna).Quite simply, the beauty of First Blood lies with its raw simplicity; essentially you have one man doing what he has to do when his back is against the wall and this is what essentially acts as the body for the entire film. In some ways the film's moral compass is of interest because when watching this I was divided upon who actually drew 'First Blood.' On the one hand Rambo garnered initial sympathy with me in that he was minding his own business when an asshole cop picks him up and starts giving him the third degree simply because he didn't 'fit in.' Then when Teasel drops Rambo off Rambo then proceeds to walk back in the direction he came from even though he told the Sheriff he was heading in the opposite direction. Granted Rambo technically didn't do anything illegal but I could see how his bizarre actions may have rubbed the officer up the wrong way. It's a classic case of a six of one and a half a dozen of the other scenario, but of course my loyalty still lay with Rambo!!!Once Rambo is in the forest and must turn to his training, stealth, and survival instincts then the film really starts to move into a league of its own. There is suspense aplenty and the town's officers soon finds themselves unwillingly drawn into a potentially deadly game of cat-and-mouse against an opponent they have little chance of succeeding against.I think what makes this film so good is that it not only acts as a superb, knife-edge, tension-filled suspense thriller (certainly for the middle portion of the picture), but it actually works two-fold in its attempts to highlight PTSD and the difficulties that such a condition can have on a soldier re-entering into civilian life or the civilian world. This is highlighted at various junctures in the film via flashbacks (although in its early stages it's only there to advance the plot), but towards the end of the film it becomes much more prevalent and the section towards the end where Rambo is pouring his heart out to his Colonel does go along way in giving us an insight into his mind-set (that 5 minute or so segment despite some wobbles did show that Stallone could act if he put his mind to it).The ending may seem downbeat and an anti-climax for some, but for me that was the right way to end the film and in some ways it was quite refreshing given the way that some action films seem to create over-the-top and ridiculous finales.Like I say First Blood is taut, badass and utterly brilliant.",First Blood

89,juneebuggy,I'd forgotten what a great movie this is and hello Hope B.C,9,1 January 2016,"I hadn't seen this in quite a few years and enjoyed it immensely in my re-watch. It is slightly dated now but the movie is 30+ years old so now I guess it should be. Still a great story and Sylvester Stallone is excellent as John Rambo; quiet, strong, tormented. He doesn't say much throughout the entire movie but still manages to convey a lot of emotion. This also makes his final speech when all the hurt & anger and PTSD comes out even more powerful and heart wrenching.The story follows is a Vietnam veteran and drifter John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who wanders into a small Washington town in search of an old friend and is met by intolerance by the local sheriff who arrests him. When the sheriff and his deputies try to restrain and shave Rambo he has a flashback to his time as a prisoner of war and freaks out, escaping jail and sending the entire town on a manhunt for this former green beret. It will now take former commander (Richard Crenna) to save the hunters from the hunted.Brian Dennehy is suitably hateable as the sheriff who keeps ""pushing"" John, forcibly moving him on when all he wants to do is get a bite to eat. Also worth a mention is Jack Starrett who is so rednecky and horrible that you might cheer if he were to say fall out of a helicopter onto some rocks. A young David Caruso also turns up as a sympathetic officer. I can't say I was overly impressed with Richard Crenna as Rambo's former mentor he seemed very wooden.Great music here too, haunting theme by Jerry Goldsmith, sorta sad The Long Road I think its called.On a personal note I really enjoyed all the shots of Hope B.C, where this was filmed. A town I've been to many times. Hasn't changed much really, the bridge is gone now but they do still have a First Blood museum, complete with a Rambo signboard that you can stick your head through the top of and take pictures. Cheesy but fun. 12/8/15",First Blood

Rambo finds coming back home to American is a difficult task and he never really recover from the trauma, he suffered on Vietnam. Rambo finds himself being the only man left in his platoon, when he tries to meet his last contact. Who just recently died from getting cancer from Agent Orange. Rambo is living the life of a drifter, While he tries to stop in a small town for food. He's stopped by a small town corrupted Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) and he wants Rambo out of town immediately. When Rambo tries to walk back to town, he gets arrested by the Sheriff. Things get worse when Rambo is taking in the jail, he gets unfairly brutally tortured by a sadistic Deputy Sergent (The late Jack Starrett) and fellow police officers. Rambo finally escapes to the Mountains and hiding from the police. When Rambo kills the Deputy Sergent from defending himself. He finds himself in even more worse situation, when he becomes the hunted. Now he sets traps for these officers. While he tries to find a way to get out of the U.S. Northwest. The sheriff makes an personal vendetta to capture Rambo, dead or alive. Now Colonel Samuel Trautman (The late Richard Crenna), who is a former boss and friend to Rambo. Who tries to help Rambo before things get worse. But Rambo is slowly planning his personal revenge to the sheriff as well.Directed by Ted Kotcheff (North Dallas Forty, Uncommon Valor, Weekend at Bernie's) made an tough action drama that become One of Stallone's best films. Which this film is based on a novel by David Morrell. Stallone certainly become an classic character for this picture, especially most audiences at that time seen him mostly as ""Rocky Balboa"". Stallone is terrific in the role. The film has strong performances by Dennehy and the late Crenna gives fine support to the well made picture. The action sequences and Canadian location in the movie are first-rate.The Ultimate Edition of ""First Blood"". DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Digitally Remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an fairly interesting commentary track by Stallone. Which Stallone admits that the movie was difficult to make, the filmmakers and Stallone panic after seeing the long rough-cut of the movie. Which Stallone thought it was a terrible movie at first. He was willing to buy the negative and destroy the film. Thanks to smart editing in the picture, Stallone felt the movie was saved after seeing an perfectly first 40 minutes of the film. He also talked about that Trautman character was originally cast for Kirk Douglas. Who actually came on the set of the film but before his scenes were going to be filming. He really wanted the Rambo character to die as Rambo did died in the novel. He wanted many changes in the script as well. Then Crenna was cast after Douglas left the production.DVD also has the alternative ending, where Rambo does died by killing himself. DVD also includes an deleted scene and an outtake. The oddest feature on the DVD is the ""Groundbreaking Military Special Operations Features"". This might find some amusement for the die-hard fans of the series. But it's quite silly, despite some cleverness on that feature. This is the third time that ""First Blood"" got released to DVD. On the original and second DVD edition had an fascinating commentary track by novelist Morrell. Which this third DVD edition doesn't bother to include the original commentary track as well. In the first movie about Rambo, he turned into an icon anti-hero. Like Snake Plissken character in John Carpenter's Escape from New York. But Rambo character turned more into a Action Hero in the sequels. A couple of familiar faces like Bill McKenney, Chris Mulkey and David Caruso appears in small roles. This is a classic action/revenge/drama that has an good looking cinematography by Andrew Laszlo (The Funhouse, Innerspace, The Warriors) and classic music score by the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, The Edge, The Omen). Don't miss the original film. Screenplay by Michael Kozoll (The Hard Way), William Sackheim and Stallone (Rocky Series, Cobra, Cliffhanger). Panavision. (****/*****).",First Blood
92,Kdosda_Hegen,"First Blood is my favourite book. This film is so different from the book, that it's an entirely new thing.",10,5 August 2020,"This is one of the best films ever made. Without going into spoiler territory I'll just mention some of the main ingredients that make this film phenomenal. It has fantastic music that is both sad and beautiful and songs with deep lyrics. The film consists of harsh editing especially by comparing it to the book, acting is some of the best seen in an action film and tons of cool action with impressive stunts. It's a one hell of a ride. The film doesn't play by cliches and breaks many rules of typical action films. It features one of the best portrayals of PTSD from war and the exposure of the flaws in the system, iconic characters with amazing character development and tons of depth concealed in the film's themes. The writing of the film is top-notch with many multi-meaning quotes having a deeper message and most dialogues hitting strong.The film is not mainly about the battle between Rambo vs police but more about what it feels like to be left alone and fighting everyone else, the madness of war within yourself, it's about how war traumatises people and how it turns men into weapons and killing machines. It's not just one of the best action films ever made, it's also one of the best dramas ever made.Reading the book made me appreciate this film even more. I love everything about the book and it's so different from the film, It's like two completely different stories. Considering the book came first, this film is the one that changed everything, it pretty much the exact opposite, the main thing being that in the book you root for cops, but here you root for Rambo. In the book, Rambo is the ""villain"", but here he is a ""victim"" or is he really? The book does take a much more detailed look into the characters, but the film brings many new messages and subject matters to the concept. I respect the creators so much for making it an entirely different thing, because now I can't even say which one is better, since it's two very different stories I rate them as two completely different things, neither the book nor the film is better. Both of them are masterpieces in their own way.",First Blood
93,JoeKarlosi,First Blood (1982) ***1/2,9,11 June 2014,"First and best of the series has former soldier John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) traveling through a small town in the hope of visiting an old army friend. He is spotted by bigoted sheriff Teasel (Brian Dennehy) who promptly escorts him off his turf. When the peaceful Rambo turns around and defiantly starts walking back into the town, Teasel has him arrested. Mocked, mistreated, and beaten at the police station, Rambo snaps with agonized flashbacks of Vietnam, escapes the police, and flees off to the woods where he is pursued by law officials. What they don't realize is that Rambo is a Green Beret, trained for survival and conditioned to endure pain and weather. Teasel and his men have now set Rambo off, and he wages a personal war on them that ""they won't believe"". Rambo's old commanding officer (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene to try and calm things before his man goes too far.This is surely one of Stallone's finest films and characters, and Sly looks his best in FIRST BLOOD. His John Rambo here is someone we can sympathize with, and his balance of calm followed by extreme self-preservation intensity is well realized. This film is smaller and more independent in feel than the sequels which came after it, and this gives it more appeal. Brian Dennehy is quite good as the hateful town sheriff whose prejudice has resulted in Rambo's wrath. Richard Crenna was a last minute substitute for Kirk Douglas (who backed out eventually), and perhaps occasionally appears a tad theatrical in his approach. The ending of the movie contains an emotionally charged speech by Stallone which is often criticized as being incomprehensible, but if you pay close attention you can decipher just about all of it. ***1/2 out of ****",First Blood
94,gcd70,Misses the mark,4,1 October 2007,"Ted Kotcheff's film tries to make serious comment on how the Vietnam war affected many of its soldiers. ""First Blood"" gives us 'John Rambo'(Stallone), a man pushed too far by the local law enforcers at a small U.S. town. Angry, he declares a 'war of his own' against them.The action is not bad, but this was probably the wrong vehicle for Kotcheff to bring his message across with. Perhaps Stallone's 'Rambo' is the wrong sort of hero. He is good in the action sequences, however he is a little too unbelievable and unstoppable to be taken seriously.The attempt at an emotional ending to the film also fails, mainly due to the fact that we can barely make out what Stallone is saying.

95,dworldeater,Win by attrition,10,27 March 2017,"First Blood is in my opinion, Sly Stallone's best film and best performance that made him an icon in the action genre. Sly is John Rambo, a highly decorated Vietnam War vet and former Green Beret that is passing through the small town of New Hope, Washington for a little grub and is stopped and harassed by its sheriff(played by Brian Dennehy). The sheriff tells Rambo that he is not welcome in his town and escorts him to the city limits. Rambo ignores the sheriff and is arrested for vagrancy. When in custody at the police station, he is beaten and abused by the local deputies. He then beats them up, steals a motorcycle and heads into the mountains. Armed only with his hunting knife, the local police, state police and national guard don't stand a chance. John Rambo's character is mostly developed through the dialouge of other characters. This works well and Stallone truly delivered a very grueling and totally believable performance. Richard Crenna gave an excellent performance as Col. Trautman and it is never clear how he will handle the situation with Rambo until the end of the film. While First Blood is an action film(and one of the best),the film is very well made, the story and character development are fluent and the acting is solid. The Rambo franchise is often associated with ultra patriotism and right wing politics(which are prevalent in the next two films), but the character of John Rambo is nothing like that in this film. If anything, he hates the US government as they have abandoned him. He is an outsider struggling to find his place in society. Authority figures such as the small town sheriff try to shun him and beat him down and he reacts by fighting back and blowing up the town. As tough and as skilled as Rambo is, Stallone played John as a very tragic, flawed social outcast that wants to live a peaceful life, but is driven to violence by the local law enforcement authorities that won't leave him alone. First Blood is one of my all time favorites and by far the best movie in the series.",First Blood
96,ShootingShark,The Original And Best Rambo Flick - A Classic Action Drama,8,11 December 2005,"John Rambo is a Vietnam War veteran having trouble readjusting to normal life who drifts into a small north-western town and immediately falls foul of the local sheriff, who arrests him for vagrancy. The feud escalates to lethal proportions when Rambo busts out and heads for the hills, hotly pursued by the cops, and a bloody manhunt ensues.Let's get one thing clear right off. The two sequels to this movie, Rambo: First Blood Part II (surely the stupidest title in movie history) and Rambo III are big-budget right-wing macho Hollywood crap. This movie on the other hand is a superb little action drama, nicely written, brilliantly acted and extremely well made. Its strength is twofold - primarily, it's a great boy's adventure flick packed full of fantastic action; a motorcycle chase, camouflage combat, helicopters, a fall from a sheer cliff-face, Dobermans, a rat-infested mine, an exploding gas-station and a lunatic with an M16 assault rifle. Secondly, Stallone (who co-scripted) wisely lets the rest of the talented cast tell the story and pares his dialogue to a minimum, which gives his touchingly hysterical crying-fit speech at the end all the more poignancy. Dennehy is excellent as the implacable Sheriff Teasle, constantly justifying his personal vendetta against his prey in terms of his responsibility to keep the peace. The movie is a model of good action film-making on a modest budget, with fabulous photography by Andrew Laszlo in beautiful wintry forest locations (it was shot in Golden Ears Park in British Columbia), great stuntwork by Conrad Palmisano and a stunning score by Jerry Goldsmith, which punctuates the violence perfectly and features a truly haunting guitar-and-trumpet theme. Stallone is a love-him-or-loathe-him kind of actor, but I kinda like him, and this is my favourite of his movies; he's completely convincing as the ultra-survivalist Rambo (""He's been trained to eat things that would make a billy-goat puke."") but the character is a great rallying-call to the disenfranchised, exacting his vengeance only when he is pushed too far. When his old Colonel tells him he can't go running around wasting friendly civilians, his bitter response is, ""There are no friendly civilians."". A somewhat forgotten film, but one whose influence on action films since has been hugely significant, this was a big hit for the great independent producer partnership of Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who went on to make several excellent films (Angel Heart, Johnny Handsome, Total Recall, and several others). Extremely well directed by the talented Kotcheff, and based on a great pulp novel by David Morrell (in which Rambo dies). Don't miss it.",First Blood

100,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,First Blood (1982),10,29 December 2011,"I, like many, have probably grown up with Rambo being a part of popular culture. From all those references to such an iconic character I was expecting some war film centered around an unstoppable killing machine. I was completely wrong, and thankfully so. Rambo is the story of a dark and troubled man. Rambo isn't a hero, but he should have been. He's a man that came home with no one to welcome him. He drifts from town to town, antagonised wherever he goes. One day a police force pushes him too far. Rambo's mental instabilities take hold and he pledges a war against these men in authority. There are no clearcut villains, and certainly no heroes here. We empathise with Rambo, and understand the police action taken against him. As well as being a commentary on the treatment of Vietnam Vets, it also shows how war isn't an excuse for such violent actions. Dennehy's wonderful character is shown (very subtly) as a soldier that managed to find his path. At the same time Dennehy doesn't know when to quit, his pride getting in the way. This is an action film with real substance, real issues, and real discussions to be had. It also never fails to deliver on the action, and Stallone's final emotional breakdown will relate to anyone that's been pushed too far. A film focused mostly on understanding, not excusing. I regret waiting this long to watch it.",First Blood
101,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The anti-rocky,8,19 May 2014,"If there's one character that Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for besides Rocky Balboa, that's this guy - John Rambo. The character of John Rambo may be an exaggeration of what kind of a struggle many war veterans live through everyday after being combat, but it represents them in a way that allows the audience to have sympathy. No matter how well decorated a war veteran is, if they suffered a traumatic event, it will never leave them. The memory will replay over and over again until their very last day. For most, the event is only strong enough to physically paralyze the veteran leaving them immobilized. However, there are some that suffer from and still can live and move around with it in their subconscious. John Rambo is one these and unfortunately, he gets pushed to far.After arriving into a small town to visit a war buddy, John Rambo (Stallone) is pressed by the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) to keep moving and not return. This however, makes Rambo become defiant and return back to the town, resulting in his immediate arrest. Things only get worse once in the sheriff's building, where Rambo is treated like the worst criminal they've had in the last century. To be honest, I think they were bored - but they picked the wrong person to be bored with. With all the instigating, John Rambo is finally pushed too far with many of his memories replaying over and over. It's at this point he breaks free and begins to fight for himself as if he was back in the war.Stallone's acting is great here. His doesn't say very much for a lot of the movie but when he does, his emotions portray an accurate description of what post traumatic stress victims have to deal with on a daily basis. Also, he gives audiences a better understanding of what it's like to be a soldier and then return to world that's totally opposite from what one is used to and how alienating it can be. Brian Dennehy as the obsessive town sheriff is also convincing because of his stance on drifters. His mindset is understood but his morals aren't up to par. Yet Dennehy's character still isn't fleshed out enough. His motives are given some explanation too but not entirely.Attempting to help the sheriff understand who he's up against is Colonel Trautman played by Richard Crenna. One of the best things about Crenna's character is how he understands John Rambo and is able to see anything coming before the rest of the authorities. Crenna also has some very good lines. Let's also not forget (just for a little fun) that David Caruso (Horatio Caine - CSI: Miami) has a small part in here too. He's extremely young and is one of the better cops in the local town. He at least tries to give John Rambo the benefit of the doubt that he's not some punk off the street looking for trouble.The action is fun to watch here too. Retaining gorilla warfare is an interesting trait to maintain. Don't forget those survival skills though, he's better than any boy scout I've seen. Adding to that is Andrew Laszlo's cinematography where he captures some very wide angle shots of the mountainous landscape of which Rambo must survive and live off of. Surprisingly though, Jerry Goldsmith's score isn't as prevalent as some may expect it to be. It's certainly constructed better than some of his previous scores, but it still lacks strong action cues besides its main theme for Rambo. It does carry emotion but not a tune that's extremely memorable. It's not bad though. Definitely an entertaining action film.This is one heck of a survival film. It has big action and respectable performances that portray the psyche of war veterans with a perspective that many people today do not consider.",First Blood

When the intimidation turns violent, survival instincts emerge and he takes refuge in the mountainous surrounds, as scores of local police try to flush him out with disastrous results.The film that started it all and vastly superior to its dysfunctional progeny, with Stallone as the unassuming veteran whose inner hulk is awoken by the unjustified actions of, principally, Jack Starrett as a corrupt and aggressive cop, then further stoked by Brian Dennehy as the violence threatens to escalate. Richard Crenna plays the special military adviser flown in to try and appeal to Rambo to concede, Crenna quick to castigate the ill-advised goading pointing to the decorated soldier's valour and survival skills in Vietnam as testament to his supremacy in the cat and mouse game that's unfolding, and warning of a protracted and bloody massacre from which only the unstoppable Rambo will prevail. There's also roles for young David Caruso as an unwilling participant in Starrett's sadistic interrogation, Bill McKinney, Michael Talbott and John McLiam in supporting roles.Has earned a reputation as a misguided social commentary that promotes violence in its extremes, the character of John Rambo emerging as the poster-boy for the little guy, who responds to mistreatment with lethal force. It's not quite that sophisticated in its approach, focusing more on delivering a full-throttle action movie that combines terrific stunts, edge-of-your-seat thrills and colourful characters and locations. While Stallone's indecipherable closing speech tends to attract criticism that infects the whole film, it's not a deal-breaker in my opinion, some viewers perhaps placing too much emphasis on five minutes of gobbledygook rather than the merits of the preceding hour-and-a-half. Ignore the invective that is mostly borne of the inane successors (Rambos 2, 3 and 4 at last count), see the original, and you might be surprised.",First Blood

Well-made action pic is pretty good for a while, with scenic forest locales and suspenseful chases and cat-and-mouse games, but even with credibility being abandoned early on, the filmmakers push things too far in the lead-up toward the conclusion. Stallone's climactic speech aims to strike an emotionally powerful note, but just comes off as hammy, didactic posturing (and hard to decipher through the star's signature mumble). Until said moment, Stallone gives an earnestly restrained and physical performance; Dennehy and Crenna (as Rambo's former commanding officer) have some effective scenes together and individually.

111,sme_no_densetsu,The first (and best) of the Rambo movies,8,24 February 2020,"Few actors have the good fortune to play a character that proves popular enough to spawn a long-running franchise. Even fewer are fortunate enough to play two such characters. Sylvester Stallone can count himself among that select group. By 1982, he already had three ""Rocky"" movies under his belt and he was just getting started with Rambo.""First Blood"" introduces us to John Rambo, a Vietnam vet whose combat experiences have left him psychologically scarred and unable to reintegrate into civilian life. After being unjustly persecuted by a small town sheriff, Rambo escapes custody and becomes the subject of a massive manhunt. However, with his training as a Green Beret, Rambo proves to be a highly elusive and deadly target.This brief synopsis suggests plenty of action and that is indeed one of the hallmarks of the series. This particular movie is unique in that it basically transplants jungle warfare into a rural American setting. The forests of British Columbia stood in for locations in Washington and they provided an excellent backdrop for Rambo's personal war. However, the action is only part of the film's appeal. Instead of presenting Rambo as a mindless killing machine, the movie examines the mental toll of his training and experiences as a soldier. This thoughtfulness is what elevates this movie above a slew of other action movies, including its own sequels.Stallone is the undisputed star of the picture and I'd have to say that he's not too bad at all here. He's well suited to the physical demands of the role and he contributed a memorable dramatic performance to the movie's climax. In that scene he played opposite Richard Crenna (as Rambo's former C.O.), who was also at his best in that scene. Overall, I think Crenna was pretty good but I'd love to have seen what Kirk Douglas would have done with the role, had he not dropped out just before shooting began. Outside of the impressive climax, the movie's best performance surely belongs to Brian Dennehy as sheriff Will Teasle. He excels as a villain who truly believes that he's the good guy.With a script that was more intelligent than most and good production values (including a score by Jerry Goldsmith), ""First Blood"" stood out from the crowd and became the start of a highly successful franchise. The recent ""Last Blood"" was a disappointing finale to the series but the the first sequel and the 2008 reboot were both satisfying action spectacles. Neither approached the depth of the original but, then again, few action movies have been able to pull off the same mix of action & drama as ""First Blood"".",First Blood

113,Howlin Wolf,A taut exercise in suspense that bears little relation to its silly sequels...,9,10 October 2001,"Surprise, a ""Rambo"" movie that tries to say something profound about the plight of its main character and his mental state.  For the most part it succeeds.  Not for this movie the ridiculously oiled pectorals of part II, where Rambo is transformed into a grunting, soul-less killing machine.  He actually begins the movie as a fairly nice chap, someone we can sympathise with, and it's his unnecessarily rough treatment at the hands of small-town sheriff Dennehey and his crew that is likely to shift audience sympathies firmly in the direction of the 'misunderstood' Vietnam vet.   Here, Rambo is also a character who is reluctant to kill unless he absolutely has to.  A far cry from the eventual homicidal maniac he was to become, who is seemingly responsible for more death than World Wars 1 & 2 combined.  So, to those expecting bucketloads of gore and senseless killing, you'd probably be better off watching the news.  ""First Blood"" is actually more akin to those 'survival in the wilderness' programs you might see on the Discovery Channel; with Rambo having to rely more on guile and cunning than brawn and an M-16 to get him out of tricky situations.   That's not to imply that this is boring.  Far from it.  Director Kotcheff shows a keen awareness of pace, it's never by any means certain that Rambo will survive (if you discount the other films, of course!) and the supporting characters are all wonderfully unsympathetic.  Even Trautmann, Rambo's supposed mentor, has a touch of the villain about him for being complicit in the ultimate dehumanisation of Rambo during the war.  By far the best character here is played by Dennehey; always watchable, but Stallone too is good; nicely restrained, more ""Cop Land"" than ""Cobra""
   Not an action film as such, it sits better as suspense. In that sense, it does exactly what it says on the tin; rendering John Rambo a far more interesting character here than his incarnation in the other two films. That is basically just wet-dream material for inadequate, spotty faced adolescent boys everywhere.  This Rambo is recognisably human.  Having said that, neither should you view expecting a solemn Vietnam protest movie in the vein of ""Platoon"" or ""The Deer Hunter"".  It's different in tone and style to the both of those movies, but in my view at least, is better than either of them.",First Blood
114,coltras35,First Blood,6,16 October 2021,"Sylvester Stallone stars in another role that helped cement his place as a big action star - As Rambo -the writer David Morrell apparently partially based Audie Murphy on Rambo - is an ostracised Vietnam veteran is provoked into starting a one-man war with the bigoted law enforcers of a small American town.There are some exciting action adventure elements featuring in the first Rambo film, with some near impossible feats such as leaping from a mountain and down a steep drop through the trees and surviving, but on the other hand it's a realistic psychological drama with a grim tone. Of course, that fits the rather downbeat subject. The violence can be hardhitting, the tone rather bitter, and though the message and the plight of ex-vets is portrayed well here - Stallone acts very well- it's not the Rambo film I would watch on a regular basis.

116,dunmore_ego,The OTHER Rocky.,7,2 January 2013,"Hey, all you skatepunks and facebookers and under-30 neo-hippies: you know that word ""Rambo"" that you toss around to describe tough guys? It's an unquestioned part of modern English vernacular: you use it as sarcasm, insult or deflective compliment; newscasters use it to sprinkle their reports with humor; sociologists use it to identify unnecessary brutality; the word is in the Oxford English Dictionary, fer chrissakes! Rambo. This is where that word came from - FIRST BLOOD.It didn't originate with any of those misnamed sequels sporting the ""Rambo"" dog tag. It originated in a novel by David Morrell (First Blood, 1972), subsequently made into this effective, primal, unlikely hit.FIRST BLOOD would not only augment Sylvester Stallone's existing tough-guy career (by this film's release, he was already up to ROCKY III), it was a tectonic cultural ground slam, spawning the sequels that would bear the ""Rambo"" moniker and entrench the archetype in world consciousness. ""Rambo"" virtually wiped out the other metaphors for tough guys: Hercules and Tarzan.Viet Nam is over. A bedraggled ex-Special Forces operative, John Rambo, (Stallone) tramps into a hick American town, searching for long-dead friends and a hot meal. The antagonistic sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) wants Rambo to keep walkin.' When Rambo refuses, Teasle (that name just kills me!) hauls him to jail, where all the small-town redneck officers (including Bill McKinney and David Caruso) beat, berate and bully the compliant Rambo to his breaking point.And then all Italian Stallion breaks loose.It is established that Rambo is a ""war hero"" (whatever that means - maybe that he has big muscles) and the movie is a slight nod to post-war trauma and the difficulty in assimilating back into society - especially redneck Amuuurican society that is the least likely to accept you, that you are most apt to have come from. But that theme will only surface towards the end, when Rambo gives his Grand Soliloquy. For the most part, FIRST BLOOD is an adrenalin punch in the face, appealing to our primal revenge instincts.Escaping the police station, Rambo flees into the forest, Teasle on his tail (I kill me!) and the whole sheriff's department as posse. Like a baleful wolf blending into the forest, Rambo stalks the namby-pamby officers, putting them out of commission one by one. And as surprising as it may sound, Rambo actually ""kills"" no one! Though this movie has a violent reputation (garnered in retrospect by its sequels), in FIRST BLOOD, only one officer falls from a helicopter and dies accidentally. Body count: 1! This sends Teasle into revenge mode - even though he was the one who started the conflict by provoking Rambo. The story ignites our sense of perverted Justice very well indeed. We're on Rambo's side from minute one.I'm sure David Morell did not intend to rip off CHATO'S LAND (1972) - Bronson's Apache picking off his white pursuers one by one - but that is the brutal template FIRST BLOOD is fashioned on. The hunted becoming the hunter.After Rambo puts his infamous gigantic hunting knife to Teasle's throat and warns, ""Don't push it...or I'll give you a war you won't believe!"" - the military are called in. Hoo-rah! With them comes Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who was Rambo's trainer, therefore someone who can presumably hit Rambo's PAUSE button. Unfortunately, Trautman can only talk in clichés and dynamic one-liners that involve doing a camera-turn before he exits the room; he overacts so much that five extras got their SAG cards.Trautman can't do much with Rambo over the walkie-talkie, except cause more flashbacks for him. Rambo maintains to Trautman that he didn't start this fracas - that ""they drew first blood!"" After destroying the whole town, Rambo comes face to face with his beloved commanding officer and cries like a baby. He's trying to fit in - he says - but the society that he fought to preserve refuses to conform to his new PTSD lifestyle. Oh, so it's OUR fault the military trained the humanity out of you and lied to you that you could one day return to humanity psychologically unscathed...You gotta respect Stallone for his business acumen, and how he turned two shallow movie characters into worldwide phenomena. But it was here, in FIRST BLOOD, where we also realized what a grand orator Stallone is, when he gives an impassioned monologue in the finale, on the death of innocence, that went something like this: ""Nothing is over! Nothing! Yucan swish it oohh Wozen my Waar I didn't ask you And the Wooma Gooma maggots protesting and the Waahoouy baby murderer code of honor! You wash my back, l wash yours! Heahh, there's nothing! All dese gray guys Chevy Convertible we wanna drive until the tires fell off And the Woouy Mogam Oosh body parts flying everywhere! Ouuuy l wanna go home, Johnny!

117,oneguyrambling,A dignified intro to an increasingly mindless action quadrilogy.,8,17 February 2012,"John Rambo wasn't born a franchise, he was initially just a Vietnam veteran back in the United States, faced by a country that didn't seem to welcome his sacrifice for his nation or appreciate the lengths he went to protect their way of life.John Rambo was insecure and eager to please, to be reintegrated back into society. Accepted. Struck with the realisation that many of his returned vets have already died, Rambo is headed North on foot when he arrives at the outskirts of a town called Hope.And this is where 4 movies chock full of cinematic violence really start.The local Sheriff is named Will (Brian Dennehy), he spots what appears to him as a long haired troublemaker wandering into his town and immediately offers him a lift.The other way.This over-zealous act isn't appreciated by Rambo, who immediately turns back and starts to trudge back towards hope, Will takes this as personally and immediately takes him into custody to teach this unkempt loner a lesson.Now mere unpleasant treatment rapidly takes a turn for the worse when a couple of cops with something to prove start seeing Rambo as a personal challenge, deciding that breaking his will should somehow teach him a lesson. Not even the obvious scars that cover this quiet man's body alter their misguided mindset.But then the mistreatment triggers some 'Nam flashbacks in Rambo's fragile brain, and his years of combat training and instinct kicks into gear. Rambo escapes in a whirlwind of physical violence and hightails it to the mountains near town, where heavy bush should provide him with sanctuary. Will though has now officially lost the plot and summons the entire force of about half a dozen (it's a small town remember?) to what essentially equates to a 'good ole boy' hunt.Things again escalate when Rambo reacts negatively (but understandably) to being shot at not once, but twice, the second such incident leading to the unfortunate death of his primary tormentor from earlier in the day.The tone of the hunt becomes decidedly less jovial and from this point on Rambo reverts to the 'old' ways The final hour or so sees the genesis of certain recurring plot elements that become more and more familiar to action fans – not always Rambo films either – the army gets involved and the lone man is significantly outnumbered and seemingly at the mercy of the elements with a big storm coming in.Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) appears midway through the film as something resembling Rambo's publicist. He is the guy who pops up in each and every film that warns anyone dumb enough to not know yet (including the audience) of what to expect, reeling off Rambo's credentials before ending with a carefully chosen brief one-liner that removes all doubt as to his intent I think in this film it was ""God would have mercy. He won't."" In later films he made sure to include Rambo's name, it must've looked better on the promotional materials. First Blood is actually a superior film to all of the sequels even if it perhaps didn't garner the box-office or teen audience. It is pretty well acted, very fast paced (for the 80s anyway) and boasted an exceptionally strong low key soundtrack. The violence is also mis-remembered, by my count only one fatality in the entire film – but before we think it is a Care Bears type film it would be fair to say that many men would be limping permanently after the credits rolled.Final Rating – 8 / 10. The first film in the series is actually the most atypical in the bunch (and the best). And if this is too slow and non-violent for you consider it an intro to the guy who will go on to kill hundreds of foreigners in the next three movies.",First Blood
118,TheUnknown837-1,"""The kid is resilient.""",9,12 May 2009,"Despite some controversy in the middle of his career, Sylvester Stallone most definitely began his fame with two of the most memorable and iconic films of all times which not only started a series of sequels, parodies, and rip-offs but created characters and role models for movie-goers. The first was 1976's Best Picture-winner ""Rocky"" (1976). The other was ""First Blood"". And while the former is the better of the two, ""First Blood"" and the Stallone character of John Rambo is undoubtedly more famous, more influential, and more sympathetic and respectable.I should revise that. I'll say that Rambo, from the very first film, was an icon. When the first sequel, ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" came out in '85, Rambo was transformed into an icon unworthy of such fame because it was all blood and guts, needless killing and violence and no story. Yes, in a way, that also applies to 2008's ""Rambo"", even though I did like the fourth film. But still, there is really only one really great film to the four-part saga and that, naturally, is the first one.""First Blood"" is based on a 1970s novel of the same named by David Morrell. A book I highly recommend for readers. Like many, I saw the film before I read the book and I will say this to anybody in the same position as me: read the book, but prepare to be surprised. After the opening third of the story, and a few similar scenes, there is no resemblance and the overall way we perceive the two—and their characters—is vastly different. And this is the rare case where the movie is actually better than the book.For those not familiar with the story, ""First Blood"" revolves around a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo, who after being unfairly treated and discriminated by the local police force, who have arrested him for vagrancy, unleashes his rage, escapes into the woods, and after inadvertently causing a police officer's death, becomes the target of a massive manhunt led by the enraged sheriff played magnificently by Brian Dennehy. Rambo's former commander, played in another famous performance by the late Richard Crenna, arrives in hopes of saving lives. But it's not Rambo whom he wants to save. It's anybody who stands in Rambo's way.Like ""Die Hard"" (1988) and ""Commando"" (1985), ""First Blood"" is the classic one-man army scenario, but unlike many of its mimickers, manages to blend the spectacular and jaw-dropping scenes with a story and characters and a moral message. And it's because of these last two items especially that the movie overpowers the book.The characters are vastly improved from David Morrell's original text. In the original book, Rambo was a personification of the evil of Vietnam: a killing machine that took joy in causing pain and suffering and caused vast amounts of it. Stallone's interpretation is a far more sympathetic and human version: a tortured soul in a nation that no longer wants him, improperly treated and far less lethal. In the film, Rambo kills nobody directly and although he is shown at times to be brutal, is also merciful. And at the end, we see how truly torn-apart he is by his experiences in the war. Also, I liked how the character of Teasle (Brian Dennehy) was changed to serve as a better antagonist and have fewer subplots which I felt only got in the way in the novel. And more importantly are the changes made to Col. Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) who in the film plays a father figure to Rambo and the only sign of friendship the veteran has left while in the novel, there was no real relation and I often questioned what exactly was Trautman's purpose in the story. Don't get me wrong. The book is good and so are the characters. But in the film, it's just a lot better.Returning to the character of Rambo, I want to focus a little more on the film's vague, but nevertheless powerful allegorical message about the veterans of Vietnam, the torture they went through, and the hatred they were ""rewarded"" with by their people when they returned. ""First Blood"", unlike its sequels, shows this. Not with as much authority and tear-jerking power as say ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), but still powerful when we see a rather meek and humble sympathetic figure come out of this never-say-die, unstoppable one-man army, who unlike his novel counterpart, is weakened by his country's sudden and unforgivable conduct against him.But of course, there is in ""First Blood"" was people want from it: action. Lots and lots of action in this well-crafted story. Aided by a great music score I believe by Jerry Fielding, the film presents oftentimes implausible actions scenes that nonetheless put a lot of grit and punch behind themselves. But what works, at least for me, in this magnificent film are the characters. Not for their icon status, but because of the way they are molded into three-dimensional human beings instead of stock characters with only a lot of macho to hold themselves up. And the allegory, while not as efficacious as it could have been, is leveled at just the right point because that's the kind of film this is. It's not meant to be heart-stopping in its intensity or tear-jerking in its symbolism. But an effective blend of entertainment and sympathy. And it works.",First Blood
119,baumer,They drew first blood not me. They drew first blood.,10,14 June 1999,"First Blood is simply one of the best films ever made. I think it transcends the action film genre and has stood the test of time. Stallone was immensely popular back in the 80's and if it is true that he hated the first cut of the film, then one can only say that he is lucky that he didn't get his wish to scrap the entire thing.John Rambo is first introduced to us as he is walking into a small town to look for a friend of his that he served in Vietnam with. Upon discovering that he contracted cancer coming back from the war, Rambo wanders aimlessly into town. He is greeted by a small town overzealous sheriff named Will Teasle, played wonderfully by Brian Denehy. He at first tells Rambo that he will help him out and give him a ride. When Rambo asks if he can find a good place to eat, Teasle directs him to a diner about 10 miles up the highway. Rambo asks if there is a law against him eating in the town, Teasle, says yea, me. This sets up the premise as Rambo begins walking back into town. Arrested for vagrancy, Rambo is taken to the local jail and we meet some of the local redneck officers, notably, a young David Caruso, who seems to be the only one who empathizes with Rambo. Finally, he escapes the jail and takes the entire small town sheriff department and the military on a hunt into the local ""jungle."" First Blood has strength of character. It has frenetic action scenes and every actor in the film is at the top of their game. Samuel Trautman, Rambo's mentor and former Colonel in the war, is played by Richard Crenna as a no nonsense but empathetic man. He knows Rambo has pushed back a little too hard but he understands where his plight comes from. He wants to avoid more bloodshed but at the same time he doesn't completely agree with how Rambo has been treated. He is obviously a law abiding citizen, but he knows that not all the laws were upheld when dealing with Rambo.Sylvester Stallone is RAMBO. There is no one else that could play him. Just like Harrison Ford embodies Indiana Jones and Bruce Willis is John McClane, Stallone is about as good as he has ever been here. He is quiet, he is strong and his physicality creates a character that many of us can empathize with and eventually root for. David Morell wrote a different character in his book but Stallone paints him more as a sympathetic character. He is correct in doing so. While Morell's vision is still present, this is more of Stallone's creation. Rambo is about as unique a character present in film history.First Blood is a film released in 1982, but in my opinion it set a new standard for action film stars. I think James Bond was pretty much your standard action film star before that. He was smooth and debonair and nothing went wrong for him. Rambo, at least in First Blood, is realistic. He bleeds, he cries, and he wears his emotion on his sleeve. This is someone that many of us could and can relate to. The sequels made him larger than life and that is fine, but this small film done by the Carolco guys is about as perfect a film as you can get.10/10",First Blood
120,DunnDeeDaGreat,Dramatic action classic and one of Stallone's best movies,7,15 June 2003,First Blood is action classic that makes you think.

It is impossible to watch it without releasing at least few tears, especially at the end, when we watch the main character cry. And that emotional and abuse part is very real. For example it reminded me on personal real life abuse and reactions to various abuses since childhood in form of crying, damaging stuff, in the weakest case releasing tears. Maybe the rest of movie is not that real (being able to evade death many times) and quality. But for it's time (technology abilities) it is.

123,mentalcritic,The best of the Rambo films,7,1 May 2005,"David Morrell's novel, First Blood, told a rather harrowing story of a veteran forgotten by the country he fought for. After an attempt to catch up with an old squadmate ends in tears, he wanders into a nowhere town with a rather bigoted sheriff who arrests him for vagrancy. As he is dragged down to the cells and given a cleaning up for a court date, he begins having flashbacks to his time in a Vietnamese prison camp, which eventually spill over into a violent rage that these policemen cannot stop. In this respect, the novel and film are pretty much the same, but the film takes a number of divergences from the novel that do not do it any favours.In the novel, a bit more background is given to the Sheriff, explaining that he is a veteran of the Korean war, for one thing. The film pretty much reduces the policemen in this story to a bunch of clownish buffoons who couldn't catch the flu. One pivotal moment in the film is when Arthur Galt, the sergeant who attempts to get Rambo's name earlier in the film, falls from a helicopter. Before he does so, he attempts to put a bullet into Rambo, in spite of repeated orders not to from the Sheriff that is supposedly one of his best friends. I somehow doubt that this film won Sylvester Stallone, or any of the writers, friends among the police force. Even Rambo himself is never given more than one dimension. It is also interesting to note that Rambo is often absent from the screen when much of the exposition is delivered, lending some credence to the story that Stallone suggested his screen time be cut down and the story told by other characters.Another area where the film diverges from the novel is in the ending. The novel's ending had Rambo shot down by a policeman at the final fight from within the police station. A darker ending was filmed for this film adaptation, in which Rambo eventually kills himself. Apparently, this ending was deemed to be too dark, with the ending as we know it edited into its place. Of all the divergences from the source material, this is probably the most regrettable. Although Morrell would write two more Rambo novels, both appear to be based on screenplays that Sylvester Stallone had a hand in. If they had not altered the ending, we might have been spared two of the most downright embarrassing sequels in the history of film. Or at least, they would have had to turn the clock back a bit and made them into prequels, which might have made for a more interesting story, given the historical contexts in which the Rambo character has fought.Richard Crenna puts in a great performance as the serious dramatic part of the film. Every bit of acting credibility that the film has, which is not saying much, comes from this man. Interestingly, other actors who were considered for this film include Clint Eastwood, who probably would have made the film a little more credible. His asking price might have been more than the production team could afford, however. John Travolta was also considered for the part of Rambo, and while this is one of many roles that John rejected that catapulted another actor to stardom, I doubt that Travolta would have any regrets about this one. For although Stallone had a truly commendable career during the 1980s, setting a record for the highest actor's salary in 1988 with Rambo III, he has pretty much disappeared from the front page in the past ten years. Unless you consider his record thirty nominations and ten wins for Razzies in various categories to be particularly newsworthy. Then again, given some of the things I have heard about those who have turned up to accept their Razzies in person, I doubt that Stallone has done the same. But then, he is also in a pretty exclusive group of actors who have directed themselves in Razzie-worthy performances.When all is said and done, I gave First Blood a seven out of ten. It is not a great film. It is not even so stupid that it is brilliant. But as an action film with a low bodycount and a statement to make, it works. It is certainly more entertaining than the sensibilities of those looking back on it without the proper historical perspective would have you believe.",First Blood
124,jaredmobarak,"We're not hunting him, he's hunting usFirst Blood",8,30 January 2008,"If I'm going to see the fourth installment of a film franchise, I should at least check out the one that started it all. That fact brings me to finally seeing the 80's classic First Blood. It wears its decade on its sleeve with the acting, broad humor at times, and cheesy credit song ""It's a Long Road."" Despite all that, though, the movie lives up to the hype and fires on all cylinders. I had no clue that the story pitted one Green Beret against a hick town of bigot cops. When I thought Rambo and I had visions of one-man wars versus countries or platoons of soldiers, not civilians out with a vendetta. Rambo just wanted a friend in the world that saw him fight for his country with honor and return home to heckling and protest. All he did overseas was spit on by his return and he became a stereotype drifter, an untouchable to society. The truth of that comes out when a Sheriff in Oregon sees him crossing the street and escorts him out of town, refusing to allow him to even have one meal. He kept pushing and pushing, enough so that Rambo just couldn't take anymore.As far as the premise goes, this one is quite effective. Based off a novel, I can see where the story would be strong despite the subsequent sequels for which I hear are horrible. To have a man beaten, on the brink of giving up on life, find his way back to the horrors he has been trying his hardest to forget is a clichéd setup for sure, but it is all we need to set this thing in motion. With some nice quick cuts, we are shown the torture he endured in Vietnam juxtaposed with the handling by the local authorities on a trumped up vagrancy charge for looking unclean. They drew first blood and it is up to him to get himself out, with or without taking other people with him. Rambo understands that these people are civilians and decides to only incapacitate them rather than kill all in his wake. These are not the Viet Cong, they are like him, however, they know nothing about what he has gone through in order to allow them to sit back at home feeling free. If nothing else, this film is here to show people that no matter what your views on a war may be, no matter how much one thinks it is not our fight, if our troops are there, they deserve our full support. They are doing a job and a service that we are not willing to do ourselves as we sit and watch TV feeds, shaking our heads that it is all for nothing. If we give even one inch, they will take a mile, you can't lay down, ever. They fight for us and deserve to be treated as heroes.With all that said, can one really condone what John Rambo does in this film? No. Not even his old superior Colonel Trautman, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Creena, can accept what he is doing. He doesn't come in to set his boy free; he arrives to get him into custody so the fight will stop. The private war that has commenced needs to come with consequences. The punishment just needs to fit the crime. Rambo does nothing wrong except to hope for some shred of decency from humanity. That idealism is what causes all the trouble. Sheriff Teasle happens to be the straw that breaks the camel's back and all hell breaks loose. It is a matter of survival at first, but with the unrelenting pace, it soon turns into a search for justice by a warped mind doing the only job he knows how. I laughed when I heard the stats that the character kills just one person in this film. I mean how can Rambo, the ultimate badass, kill just one person? The laugh is on me, though, because I don't even count that one as his, it was the helicopter pilot's fault for jerking the aircraft. Rambo may destroy an entire town, but a cold-blooded murderer he is notat least not until part two (with the great name of Rambo: First Blood II, a dual title that confuses the heck out of people on what the original truly was called).First Blood has become so entrenched in popular culture and the lexicon of cinema that even though I had never seen the film, I could swear I knew Creena's monologue about Rambo verbatim. I'm sure it was parodied multiple times and probably shown at sporting events or something, but I just knew the entire speechpretty crazy since I had never seen it before. Besides his nice turn during and after that sequence, we get a powerhouse performance from Brian Dennehy as the sheriff. This guy is good and it is too bad he was never used to full potential in the industry. Sure he did a lot of films, but nothing that he stood out from the pack with. As for the star, Sylvester Stallone shows why he was pound for pound the best action star of the 80's. Between this series and Rocky, he was stellar. From the charisma and shy modesty with which he begins the film, searching for his friend, to the stoic killing machine on the warpath, to the broken man unable to believe what has happened to the world around him, Sly runs the gamut effectively and perfectly. By far one of the best action films I've seen, First Blood stands the test of time and delivers on the cult status it holds. Surprisingly, I am now really looking forward to Rambo (part four) and definitely checking it out in a couple of days.",First Blood

It's nothing people haven't seen before but the subject matter is well handled here. Unlike it's sequels (though they're pretty good) First Blood doesn't loose itself in over the top action sequences and remains firmly grounded in reality (for the most part anyway).Stallone does an exceptional job as Rambo. Playing him in a sombre and relatively straight way makes his emotional outburst towards the end all the more powerful. And although you have to pay close attention to what he's saying, his monologue is pretty effective. Richard Crenna does well as Rambo's mentor from Vietnam and Brian Dennehy is his usual reliable self, turning in a forceful performance as the unlucky small town sheriff.More pluses here include good cinematography, nice looking scenery and a terrific music score by Jerry Goldsmith. Based on a good book by David Morrell, the film of course changed the downbeat ending and opted for a bit more uplifting one. It paved the way for two decent sequels so I've got no quarrel with it.

First Blood did inspire the Rambo movies which then became an icon and turned it's star into an icon however First Blood is far more fascinating and respectable then the guilty pleasure brought on by the later chapters. The movie itself doesn't depict Stallone as a good guy but rather as a sympathetic psychopath and at the end he's pretty much killing everyone who gets in his way. Indeed here is where most of the interest is found in this genre classic. At the end Stallone does do an impromptu speech about his injustices inflicted upon him but all of his rage is better expressed in the action sequences near the end where Stallone has gone berserk.

The Rambo character was big in the 80's, becoming a cult icon and spawning spin-off's, cartoons and merchandise. However that was in the 80's, today's audiences barely just remember ""Rocky"" and probably aren't too familiar with Rambo. This isn't at all a family friendly film, it's more of a macho bloodthirsty action film rather than anything deep and inspiring. Stallone does a decent job as John Rambo showing that he's an onion with layers of passion and pain. The supporting cast is good and believable, especially Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna and even David Caruso. The score is effective and drives the movie on. It gets a little cheesy in places, especially towards the end but that doesn't sour the film one bit. Like the subject of the film this is dark and misunderstood.

Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character's eyes.. ""First Blood"" doesn't deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects. It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real. He feels that society is against him and he is angry. The movie has ton's of action, the motorcycle chases. Rambo climbs the wall of mountain and is been pursued by a helicopter and the police officer becomes the killer and try's to shoot Rambo with a riffle. Rambo jumps and hangs him self on the tree. That jump was for real and Sylvester Stallone really performed it. Rambo uses his martial arts to defend him self against abusive corrupt cops to escape. I love how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations. The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill, yet, he doesn't kill a single human in the film on purpose. John Rambo uses M60 machine gun and shoot up various stores in town including police station destroys the gun store and gas station.

129,The_Movie_Cat,First Action Hero,7,29 June 2000,"The Rambo trilogy is of historical film interest, as it effectively presages both the beginnings and the inevitable end of the ""action"" movie trend prevalent throughout the eighties.First Blood is a strong vehicle for Stallone, and odd in its style. While made in 1982, it has enough panoramic sweeps and lengthy scenes to make it feel like a work of the late 70s. Or this could be the ""Deer Hunter"" connection, the film being set in much of the same woodland territory and with the obligatory Vietnam angst to propel the narrative. Made just four years later, there's even a line where one cop asks another ""didn't we go deer hunting here last year?"" Whether this is a direct reference or not I don't know, but I'd like to assume it is some form of homage.Now, I won't commit film heresy by saying that I think First Blood is better than the 78 DeNiro vehicle (though I DO think it's better than that pretentious, cold and overrated ""epic""), but it's an important focal point for the origins of Rambo in film history. The first twenty minutes or so of this film see a leisurely pace and some dialogue scenes, where the end gives Sylvester a chance to eulogise over the horrors of war. Only a wooden performance from Richard Crenna and a cheesy end titles song by Dan Hill detract from this one. Okay, it's not an all-time great, but then it's not supposed to be; it doesn't have its sights aimed that high. But it IS a well-made, compact film that just happens to have what seems now sporadic violence but was then mould-breaking action sequences, including a plethora of explosions. John Rambo, a taciturn, partly psychotic Vietnam veteran is possibly the most interesting characterisation Stallone ever played. At least in this film.When Stallone returned to the role three years later the action genre was well and truly underway, and his non-Rambo roles  Cobra, an arm wrestler in ""Over The Top"" and a dumbed-down Rocky in the execrable ""Rocky IV""  saw him only respond to violence and effects. The need to actually ACT was no longer required. Rambo 2 is a non-acting role, a shoot-em-up video game on celluloid. Plotless and pointless, it's a completely different film to the original, related by name only. This time the cheesy end song is by Frank Stallone, though Richard Crenna gives a better performance. With an ineffective screenplay by Stallone and James Cameron, it provides such unlikely treats as a ""Rambo in love"" subtext and some Cod Russians. While the film takes the Rambo concept out of the arthouse and firmly into the mainstream (making over $300 million in the process), it is praiseworthy in some respects. One of those is Stallone who, while not required to act, just point guns, does still make a notable effort in the role. The movie is also, if not anti-American, anti-Government, and as subversive as the first. And it does have a nice exchange to conclude: ""How will you live, John?"" ""Day by day"". In every other respect, however, it set us up perfectly for the final part of the trilogy, which may in many ways be the better film.
For in 1988 Stallone did us all a great favour, something which would have been lost on him at the time: he failed. Rambo III, a $63 million production, was regularly cited as amongst the top ten all-time biggest flops. (Although it still made $189m world-wide) The original movie gave us a dysfunctional member of society, twisted by the darker side of the ""American Dream"". Rambo III sees the ultimate distillation of that character into an establishment figure that touts anti-Soviet propaganda as he takes on an entire division of the Russian army. A character who only speaks to deliver smug one-liners and indulges in a witless display of pyrotechnics, firing exploding arrows like the comic book superhero ""Hawkeye"". This second sequel gave us Sylvester at possibly his physical peak, a pumped-up narcissist who never wears a shirt. Perhaps not as bad a film as is made out, (the usage of an Asian people as heroes is rare in American film, even if the ethic is misguided) Rambo III still stinks, though not nearly as badly as many of the wannabe action movies of the same period. It took a high-production work like this one to fail to mark the first weakness in the seemingly invincible action genre. Even then it took Stallone time to realise he was beat: Daylight, Judge Dredd and the vaguely-enjoyable Demolition Man saw him continue to go through the motions, a sad waste of a considerable and overlooked talent. Such a genre saw few stars, with mainly non-actors latching onto the trend. Steven Segals, Dolph Lungrens and Jean-Claude Van Dammes all proved they could kick-box but not anything remotely approaching a performance. While successful, the only two real stars of this genre were Stallone himself and Schwarzenneger. I don't include Bruce Willis in this category as, while the ""Die Hards"" of this world fit the mould, they still required the lead to act, to say lines, to demonstrate emotion. Whether Willis did this or not is another matter, but they were, to a degree, acting roles, rather than the ""murder-death-kills"" of Demolition Man.Which is why Stallone should look back to First Blood for the next stage of his career. His return to acting proper in 1997's ""Copland"" surprised many, and I know of numbers of people that stayed away just for his name alone. To date he has yet to consolidate this role. I like Sylvester, and believe he can act, when he lets himself. The first couple of Rocky films and this movie allowed him to work as an actor. They may have effectively overseen the destruction of the action genre, but in their initial stages they were worthwhile experiments in cinema. Finally: ""Play It Again, Sam""; ""You Durtee Rat!"" and ""Beam Me Up, Scotty"". Stallone is added to this rank. Because, you know, he never actually DID say ""Don't push me!""",First Blood
130,gab-14712,Meet John Rambo!,8,8 July 2019,"In 1982, First Blood introduced audiences from all over the world the man we know as John Rambo, played by Sylvester Stallone. This is an action film, but the movie is not seen as an action film, but more of a ""survival wilderness"" movie that allows for ripe characterization. Unlike the sequels that follow which depict Rambo as a cold-blooded killing machine, we get a man dehumanized by his exploits in the Vietnam War and someone we can sympathize with because of the events that occur. It is because we have such a character, is why we have an above-average action film. The film itself explores nothing new, but the themes remain powerful and provoking all the same. The Vietnam War took a lot out of the military and the people of the United States in general, and films from the 1970's and 1980's take these issues to heart. This is also what elevates the movie above average action fare.Stallone portrays John Rambo, a former Green Beret. He wanders to a town in the state of Washington to visit a friend of his. As he enters town, he is picked up by the police chief, Teasle (Brian Dennehy). Teasle seems willing to help him out at first, but that ends when Rambo asks where he can get a bite to eat. The chief sends him to a diner ten miles outside of town. Rambo does not take to kindly to that and comes back to town where he is placed under arrest for vagrancy. Rambo is then mishandled by the town's police force, and then all craziness breaks loose. He escapes the prison and goes to the forest, where the police and military join forces to take him down. When Rambo's former superior, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives to defuse the situation, maybe-just maybe, all parties can make it out alive.Stallone, using his starpower from the Rocky franchise, was able to get this movie made. He and director Ted Kotcheff made changes to the script, drastic enough where you could say the book is completely different. From all reports I have seen, the endings are completely different. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is up in the air, because the ending here may be the weakest link to the movie. The movie is at its best when we watch Stallone setting up fort in the wilderness and doing nothing but surviving the elements and the combined police/military force. The best scene, in my opinion, is where we see Stallone show off his physical prowess when escaping the police station. The cops were mean, but Rambo is even meaner. Watching him strike down the police officers using force is very fun to watch!The performances are all great! Stallone, when given the right script, does well with what is given to him. Rambo is the one he made his own and is his best well-known role outside of the Rocky franchise. At least with this particular movie, his character is given depth and nuance and Stallone does a good job at showing these. Richard Crenna is excellent considering he was the studio's billionth choice to play this part. He certainly gave Tauchman a side of empathy. Brian Dennehy was very fun to watch as he saviors his role as the police chief. When we first meet him, he is not who he seems.Out of all the Rambo movies from the 80's, First Blood is the one to see and remember. The sequels are just mindless action movies, but this is a darker film that uses its PTSD theme to full effect. Does it completely work? Maybe not as better films, but this theme allows us to sympathize with the character of John Rambo. Also, Jerry Goldsmith's theme he created for Rambo, ""The Long and Winding Road"" is an effective musical theme. When the movie is in the forest with Rambo using his tactics he learned as a Green Beret, that is when the movie it at its best. I need to commend the character for not trying to kill anyone, unlike the future sequels. If you want to see an action film with an underlying theme, check out First Blood.My Grade: B",First Blood
131,fernandoschiavi,"""First Blood"" establishes itself as an efficient and realistic action film, which still leaves two deep questions for reflection, both philosophical and political",7,12 September 2020,"In a time of consolidation of genres based on the popularity of great action stars, the 1980s saw ""First Blood"" a cornerstone for understanding its period. When we think of the films of the character Rambo and most of the action productions of the 1980s, the character immediately comes to mind with a machine gun and detonating his enemies. But this first film, directed by Ted Kotcheff, based on the book ""First Blood"" by David Morrell, is not just about action, managing to address the issue of the Vietnam War in that context of the 1980s, in addition to the traumas that humanize the main character and causes us to cheer for him on his journey.
The Vietnam War had considerable relevance in the United States' film production in the period. The conflict, which ended in 1975, was the object of classics such as ""Amargo Regresso"" (Hal Ashby, 1978) and its reflexes would last until the end of the 1980s, with films such as ""Born on the 4th of July"" (Oliver Stone, 1989) . Even though the script adapted by the trio Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone does not go so far into the issues of the trauma suffered by Rambo, a way of tracing the story is identified so that the character's attitudes are consistent. That is why there is no strangeness in the soldier's somewhat robotic behavior, even before Trautman (Richard Crenna) confirms that he has had specific training to solve all challenges that are presented to him in the most violent and chaotic way possible.Unlike most ""brucutu films"" of the 1980s, the first Rambo is a surprisingly ambitious and mature work that proposes a series of very welcome social / political discussions, using action as a starting point for the themes it seeks address. Avoiding turning the premise into a mere excuse for the action sequences, director Ted Kotcheff makes a point of placing the plot in the most realistic universe possible: unlike traditional brucutus, John Rambo is perfectly capable, for example, of breaking down when falling from a precipice, which naturally leads the viewer to be concerned with the fate of the character (after all, he is not invulnerable) - and this may not be necessary in a work such as Commando (which commanded exaggeration from the beginning and which, precisely therefore, it allowed Arnold Schwarzenegger to jump out of a moving boeing and survive without any problems), but, in First Blood, an approach like this helps to evoke the sense of urgency required by the plot. In addition, Kotcheff devotes much of the narrative to just showing how Rambo stays alive during a war, creating several sequences that feature the protagonist sewing a wound on his arm, hunting animals to reuse them as food and / or improvising a torch to help himself. drive in a dark environment.Scheduled to Kill immerses itself in a series of thematically relevant discussions: exposing the terrible conditions provided to veteran combatants, the film also denounces the mistreatment suffered by a good part of the soldiers after returning from the war - which, in turn, are constantly demonized by a society that has never been close to an armed conflict and ignores two important details: 1) not all veterans are ""baby killers""; and 2) many people go to war not willingly, but because they were forced. At the same time, the various assaults suffered by Rambo at the police station alert us to the brutality promoted by the police not only in the United States, but in much of the world, committing the famous ""abuse of authority"" whenever they arrest a citizen for the sole purpose to torture him, in a clear act of sadism. To conclude, there is a brief comment about the spectacularization of the violence when a group of soldiers, believing that they managed to kill Rambo, decided to celebrate his ""victory"" and waste time taking pictures, which is remarkable.
""Rambo"" is unquestionably an action film, and in this sense, Ted Kotcheff's direction is very competent, in managing to create sequences that are not only exciting, but also extremely realistic. From the moment Rambo rebels in prison, starting the sheriff's relentless pursuit of Rambo, who cuts the farms on his motorcycle and later on foot, the skill of the director, who still creates quite creative plans, is remarkable. Note, for example, the great plan in which Rambo hides behind a tree while the helicopter tries to find a breach for the policeman to shoot him. We practically hide from the shots with him and hope for his success. During the hunt in the woods (where Rambo obviously felt at ease and knew very well how to cope with what he found along the way) there are many striking scenes. In one, the plane allows the viewer to see Rambo from above while a policeman searches for him on the ground and does not notice his presence, seconds before he attacks. Kotcheff, however, also creates exaggerated and unlikely sequences, such as when Rambo jumps off a cliff and falls alive down there or when he faces many armed policemen alone and escapes the police station. But for that, he has a special asset, which is Stallone's ability to perform in these sequences that require physical strength.Rambo would not be the same without Sylvester Stallone, an actor who is often underestimated and who, here, is favored by the way the film builds the persona of the protagonist: never established as an indestructible hero, John Rambo is a guy who seeks a life social, but that is massacred by society itself and that, as it gets mistreated, it also gradually reveals its skills, leading the viewer to discover who the title character is as the narrative progresses - and Stallone illustrates this evolution of brilliantly, suggesting Rambo's panic through subtle but powerful looks, and reaching a touching emotional climax in the final minutes of the projection, when he exposes his particular traumas to the audience. In addition, Richard Crenna does well by turning Colonel Trautman into an almost father figure for Rambo, offering not only training, but support for the protagonist.Ted Kotcheff, who never really emerged in the direction of feature films, probably does his best work here in this capacity. The simplicity of the script helps a lot, but it builds tension with very well linked sequences and well positioned cameras in order to put us in a subjective position, waiting for Rambo's attack and also watching the veteran's action. Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack manipulates a little, but it gives the ex-soldier a melancholy tone, realizing that even though he risked his life, even suffering and losing companions, he is still frowned upon and badly received by the nation he swore protect. The photograph that Andrew Laszlo presents also strengthens the depressive aspect of the tape, its register harmonizes well the costumes in non-vivid colors of Rambo, besides fitting well the bucolic scene of small and conservative city.There are many differences between the book and the film. In the book John Rambo, he is actually a problematic man, who causes the death of several people. In the film the protagonist is treated like a hero, and the people who chase him, like villains, which also did not exist in the book and do not even kill anyone in the film. Furthermore, the outcome of the film does not match that of the book, in which Rambo ends up killed by his former commander, Colonel Trautman. There is an alternative ending to the film (quite easy to find on the internet, since it was even recorded and finished) where Rambo commits suicide in front of Trautman, using his friend's gun. This outcome would obviously make more sense, but leaving John Rambo alive is an attitude that makes us rethink much more, in order to try to understand how to live with those who committed murders in the name of an allegedly sovereign nation, and how to reinsert them back into the membership common. The disturbed man dying would be a very easy solution, and definitely Rambo's script: First Blood is not simplistic, despite exuding simplicity, containing complexity and quite critical to the American way of life.Seen decades after its release, the work seems far less violent, almost a war drama for much of its time. However, its concept still yields good discussions. Not only in the figure of the persecuted, Rambo, but also in those who persecute them. ""Rambo"" is fortunately not just the scenes of frantic action, explosions and shots. Its great action sequences serve as a backdrop for infinitely deeper and more interesting reflections. Portraying faithfully what happened to the American soldiers, who were considered as vagrants and drug addicts on their return to the country, ""First Blood"" establishes itself as an efficient and realistic action film, which still leaves two deep questions for reflection, both philosophical and political. human mind by the horror of war? And how is the treatment given by governments to these people who fight to defend the interests, often noble, of their countries? After watching this and so many other good films that address the theme, it is not difficult to reach a conclusion.",First Blood
132,spookyrat1,"Attempted Killing For Vagrancy in Jerkwater, USA !",8,21 April 2020,"Hard to believe this first and best release of the Rambo franchise is almost 40 years old. And it's only fitting too that since its release, First Blood has received reappraisal from critics, with many justifiably recognising it over the decades past, as a significantly influential film in the 80's action genre.The film is based on the 1972 novel of the same name by David Morrell, but I would suggest there aren't too many readers of the book, who having seen the film, wouldn't agree that Ted Kotcheff's adaption is an improvement on the literary source.The movie sensibly sets John Rambo up as ex-Green Beret trained Vietnam veteran troubled by PTSD flashback episodes emanating from his stressful military service. His, is a more moderate and sympathetic character than the one depicted in the book, who is closer to a kind of uncontrolled psychotic lethal weapon. Visiting the small town of Hope, Washington after finding out an old comrade had fallen victim to Agent Orange induced cancer, Rambo is unfairly arrested as a vagrant by the town sheriff Teasle and ends up in jail. Led by sadistic chief deputy Galt, Teasle's officers abuse Rambo, triggering more flashbacks of the torture he endured as a POW in Vietnam. He snaps, overwhelms the patrolmen, fights his way out of the police station before stealing a motorcycle and fleeing into the woods. He is pursued unmercifully, until his former CO, Col Trautman arrives to try to settle the rapidly escalating skirmish during which Rambo claims (truthfully) that Teasle and his cronies sought to draw the ""First Blood"", causing Rambo to seek to finish it.The three lead characters are all extremely well cast by experienced actors. Sylvester Stallone makes Rambo , like his other ikon Rocky, indelibly associated with him. His last long exchange with Trautman in the stand-off climax again demonstrates what an underrated actor he is often recognised as being, when given the right material. The screen writers which include Stallone, were smart to establish a much closer relationship in the film between Rambo and Trautman. Richard Crenna brings just the right amount of patriarchal concern and humanism to career army officer Trautman. The late Brian Dennehy, though arguably best known for his highly regarded stage career, delivers a career-defining performance as the menacing troubled law man, who becomes too easily law breaker in his fateful pursuit of a foe, of whom he realises too late, he should never have made an enemy.Great photography in extremely scenic, outdoor locations, which mirror the book's settings perfectly. First Blood also has a couple of wonderful set action pieces, the most memorable being the mid-film cliff jump/fall in which Stallone himself was apparently the (injured) stunt person. Truth be told in watching it, you can't see how it couldn't be Stallone making that breathtaking drop look so real. Jerry Goldsmith's stirring musical score too, has become permanently associated with the character and the franchise.Darker, more sensitive and resonating, yet still filled with action highlights, First Blood sees the intelligent genesis of the Rambo character of later, more and more exaggerated sequels. Ironically, in this first movie outing of a figure usually always associated with death and destruction, I don't think it's spoiling to state in finishing, the body count for this movie is a solitary one.",First Blood
133,Vivekmaru45,The best of the best in the Rambo Series.,10,4 December 2010,"Ted Kotcheff is the best director, far better that the ones that directed Rambo 2 and Rambo 3. In fact he should have directed 2,3 and 4.Stallone's a stud throughout the film. Showing us his toned, muscular physique. Nice one Sly.Richard Crenna gives us great comedic relief in the film when required. Such as: ""he can eat things that can make a billy-goat puke"" and ""don't forget, if you send that many men, don't forget to send an ample supply of body bags"". Brian Dennehy to me is the star of the film. He is also one of the central characters in the film along with Sly. You can literally feel the tension in his character all the way till the end of the film.Full Plot: Rambo is searching for one of his friends from his unit, Delmare Berry and soon learns that he has died from cancer due to Agent Orange exposure. The scene cuts to Rambo entering the small town of Hope on foot. With his long hair and military-style coat, he is quickly spotted by the town's overzealous and paranoid sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who quickly drives Rambo out of town, noting his strong distaste for ""drifters."" Rambo heads back toward town immediately, to the dismay of Teasle who arrests him.Rambo stands his ground against the officers at the station and is brutalized and harassed by Art Galt (Jack Starrett), the sheriff's cruel head deputy and closest friend. While being processed, Rambo has flashbacks to his time as a prisoner of war. When Galt and two other officers (Chris Mulkey and David Caruso) attempt to dry-shave him with a straight razor, Rambo has a flashback to being tortured in a North Vietnamese P.O.W. Camp back in 1969 and loses control, escaping on instinct using his military training. He fights his way out of the station, assaulting most of the officers, throws a civilian off a motorcycle and steals it and is pursued into the nearby mountains. The deputies are eventually forced to search for Rambo on foot and he climbs down onto a steep cliff to elude capture. After spotting Rambo from a helicopter, Galt blatantly disregards protocol and attempts to shoot him in cold blood. Rambo drops into a mass of trees and cornered, throws a rock at the helicopter in self-defense. The helicopter pitches and Galt falls to his death. Teasle, who did not see Galt's attempt to kill Rambo, vows to avenge his friend's death.Teasle leads his deputies into the woods in an attempt to capture Rambo. The deputies are inexperienced and bicker, particularly after learning over the radio about Rambo's combat experience and status as a war hero. Rambo quickly disables the small, disorganized team using guerrilla tactics and booby traps, severely wounding but not killing the deputies. In the chaos, Rambo isolates and confronts Teasle with a knife to the throat. ""Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe. Let it go"" he warns before disappearing into the woods. A base camp is assembled near the site and the National Guard is called in. United States Special Forces Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives, taking credit for training Rambo. He is surprised to find any of the deputies still alive and warns that it would be safer to let Rambo go and find him after the situation has calmed down. Teasle refuses to give in.Rambo is eventually cornered by the National Guard in a mine entrance. The novice guardsmen fire a M72 LAW rocket at him, collapsing the mine and trapping him inside. They assume Rambo is dead. Unbeknownst to his pursuers, Rambo has escaped into the tunnels of the mine. Rambo finds some old fuel and makes an improvised torch. After wading through waist‑deep water and fighting off rats, Rambo cleverly uses the flame of the torch (as an indicator of air flow) to find an exit near a main road. Rambo hijacks a passing M135 2½ ton cargo truck and returns to town, crashing it into a gas station. He blocks the highway to anyone in pursuit by igniting the spilled fuel. Now armed with an M60 machine gun, Rambo destroys a sporting goods shop and a few other businesses in an attempt to confuse Teasle before making his way to the police station, where Teasle awaits on the roof.Eventually Rambo enters the police station. Teasle spots Rambo and fires at him but misses. Rambo shoots back at Teasle, injuring him. Teasle falls through the roof onto the floor. Rambo steps over him, prepared to kill him. Before Rambo can shoot Teasle, Colonel Trautman appears and tells him that there is no hope of escaping alive. Rambo, now surrounded by the police, rages about the horrors of war and the difficulties he has faced adapting to civilian life; he's tired of being misunderstood, and how in the army he was a war hero but back in America he could not even hold down a steady job. He weeps as he recounts a particularly gruesome story about witnessing his friend dying by having his legs blown off by a booby-trapped shoeshine box. Rambo then turns himself in to Trautman and is arrested. The credits roll as he and Trautman exit the police station.First Blood was released the same year as E.T, Tootsie and Porky's.

134,itamarscomix,Rewatch this,9,23 September 2011,"The ludicrous sequels burned the image of shirtless, oiled-biceps, rocket launcher-toting, bandanna wearing Rambo so deeply into American cultural iconography, it's understandably easy to forget how very different the first film was, and that it was in fact a fantastic little movie with real credibility and a real message (or that Rambo doesn't have ammo-belts on until the last twenty minutes or so). Not that it's not filled to the brim with excellent action scenes - but it's also darkly realistic, with a lot less explosions and a much lower body count, with a depressing anticlimactic ending and, most importantly, with a strong and bold anti-militaristic message. A lot like Rocky, it's a very worthy classic that was damaged by too many sequels and too much studio greediness.",First Blood
135,russem31,Has a message,7,10 March 2006,"First Blood (1982), more famously known as Rambo, is a film starring Sylvester Stallone in one of his two more well known roles - as the title character John Rambo (the other being Rocky). This film was made only 7 years after the end of the Vietnam War and was one of the first films to address the issue of the conditions of Vietnam Veterans. Although this film resembles the movie Deliverance (1972) (the hunting in the forest and mountains), it is an average action film that makes a point about Vietnam Veterans. Even though most of the film is average, a true gem happens to be the late composer Jerry Goldsmith's classic score (the theme is very memorable), as well as the late Richard Crenna as Rambo's former commander, Colonel Trautman Rambo's.

137,Maziun,"Intelligent , touching and exciting",8,18 July 2013,"Rambo : First blood"" is a true pearl in it's genre. Rarely you will find an action movie almost perfect on every level – acting , story , action scenes , music , substance. Along with ""Rocky"" it's Stallone's most famous and best movie . It's also one of his finest performances.What makes it such a great movie is the the ability from the creators to combine action spectacle with a emotional story . All the action is driven by the dramatic conflict between characters . It feels very natural and makes the scenes more exciting , because you're emotionally involved on a level not often seen in other action movies. None of the action scenes seems unnecessary or pure eye-candy.I don't like to use this word when I'm describing action movies ( because almost every one of them needs some suspension of belief ) , but here it fits perfectly . REALISM. ""First blood"" is a very realistic movie . Emotional realism and practical realism. It feels like this story could happen in real life , which is a big plus. What is interesting and unique is the anti-war and anti-violence message that comes from this action movie . I doubt that anyone who's seen the movie will doubt about the honesty of message . ""First blood"" has heart and never becomes hypocritical about what it's trying to say , especially since the body count here is low.The story here is still actual in our times and universal . Just replace Vietnam with Iraq or Afghanistan and you could very easily make this movie today . You don't have to be a American or war veteran to appreciate it . It's easy to relate to Rambo . He's a man that has been push to far and fights for his dignity . It's a story of social injustice , lack of empathy and miscommunication. It's a story about how war can take your humanity and how the system rejects somebody it doesn't needs anymore.The conflict is written really well . There is no black or white , there are shades of grey everywhere . Not many people realize it , but this movie is based on a book ""First blood"" by David Morrell . In my opinion , the movie is superior to book , especially since the characters are more complex . In the book Rambo was a psycho , sheriff a nice guy and Trautman a cold blooded professional.Here , Rambo is a obviously troubled man , but a human being you can understand and care for. Sheriff is a man that cares about his job and people who live in his city . He provokes Rambo both intentionally and unintentionally . He's not a villain , more of a good man with bad attitude. Colonel Trautman is torn between helping Rambo and stopping him before someone will be hurt. As his friend he understands his pain and tries to protect him from the world that doesn't need him anymore.Sylvester Stallone , Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna – they all fit they characters PERFECTLY . They understand them . Stallone is silent , lonely , strong yet emotionally vulnerable person . Dennehy is both prideful and arrogant , brave and stubborn , self-righteous and honest . Crenna is intelligent , cool , confident and also emphatic person . The whole trio gives great performances , the best in their careers. Maybe not Oscar material , but definitely worth ovation.I can't say a bad thing about other actors . They give solid support to the main trio . Watch out for David Caruso (""CSI"") in small role of Mitch, one of sheriff's men. Usually action movies don't have memorable music , but not here . Jerry Goldsmith created memorable score – both heroic and sad . There is also a great song ""It's a long road"" by Dan Hill (you can hear it at ending credits). Andrew Laszlo provides the movie with sometimes dynamic , sometimes breathtaking photography. Last, but not last – Ted Kotcheff directs the whole thing with confidence . The pacing is perfect.""Rambo : First blood"" is a story about pain and miscommunication , but there's also hope here . Hope , that somebody will give you a helping hand and will understand you . Hope that you can live with your demons. Also , it's a warning about how violence and social injustice can affect our lives . It's all here in this action movie that has something to tell instead of only providing spectacle . I give it 8/10.",First Blood

Well,the thing is; this is a pretty good actionmovie and no one can take that from it! Its independent, entertaining, tough, highly dramatic and interesting. Sylvester Stallone delivers one of his best performances ever (together with the first Rocky).STORY: A home coming soldier, former Special Forces Nam vet. John Rambo has got some serious mental wounds after the war, his only remaining friend lives out on a depressive countryside, when he finally reaches the place he gets to know that his Nam friend died of cancer last year. Rambo is alone. While walking in the wilderness he soon gets in trouble with the local cops, he kicks down the sheriff and his helping men and soon he runs out in the wilderness, out in the forest, alone. He gets the cops after him...and they're pretty p*ssed off on the Vietnam soldier...now, Rambo has started his own war...Very amusing! Very nice piece of action! We get a lot of different kindof nice genre flashes here: we get flashbacks from Vietnam showing Rambo getting tortured, we get a lots of nice characters; we get Rambo showing of his best bits from Nam experiences - but the ending scene is very nice I think, showing Rambo sitting in a totally smashd up house talking out about his mental problems to his Colonel Trautman, that was in the same group together with him back then. That's a very nice scene I think, maybe Stallone doesn't do his best performance right then, but the mood and Vietnam - psycho rubbish, really gets you thinking about the poor bastards.Rambo: First Blood stands alone as a one hitter very nicely, allthough the sequels aren't that bad it maybe had got a better reputation if it had been a outsider sort of.

140,tonypeacock-1,Stallone delivers a Rocky free franchise,7,16 August 2019,"I have seen portions of this film before but never together so I decided to give it a go. It is 1982 and Vietnam war hero John Rambo seems to be minding his own business in the north U.S.A. (filmed in Canada) when he is systematically targeted by some local redneck Sheriffs led by Brian Denehy as Teasle, arrested on a trumped up charge and threatened with 90 days jailtime.What these police don't realise is that they are messing with the wrong guy. Rambo is a decorated Green Beret awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour.What follows over the next hour or so is a war against one man psychologically damaged perhaps by his Vietnam War experiences. Only a smug senior army commander played brilliantly by Richard Crenna can get at the psyche of Rambo and stop the inevitable destruction and death.Director Ted Kotcheff delivers Stallone's second most famous character after Rocky Balboa to the screen in an action thriller that would go on to multiple sequels. Stallone is at his muscle bound best before his mangling in the late nineties made him an Expendable laughing stock. Anything that Bruce Willis and Schwarzenegger would do in the eighties Stallone manages here with some great action sequences of combat and survival skills.One thing that did catch my attention was quite trivial (which goes a long way to explain my film watching). How do American police cars in this type of film manage to drive through the forest terrain? Back to the film. Stallone delivers a testosterone filled thriller.",First Blood

When I first saw this film, I only watched bits and pieces, and mistook foolishly as just another action movie. But after viewing it again, I now see it's true nature, as well as respecting it on a number of levels. As for Stallone, this is the best role he's ever done in my opinion. His performance was just spot on and you end up feeling very connected with his confused character. Richard Crenna was awesome as Colonel Trautman, and despite what happened to the series later on I'm glad he was present in them. And Brian Dennehy was great, being the fool who kept pushing and on a more significant level symbolizes how many Americans felt about Vietnam veterans. With no real friends left, no occupation, and nowhere to go, John Rambo comes ""back to the world"" expecting at the least acceptance back into society. But even that is turned down, and he quite simply loses it. Backing all this is a great score by Jerry goldsmith, whose music keeps a level of constant tension and darkness, but always a touch of remorse. And the cinematography was great.

148,raypdaley182,Typically American,5,17 June 2007,"So what do I mean by Typically American?Smacks of overkill, going to the extreme. The film starts all calm and mellow with Rambo going to visit one of his former Army Buddies only to discover he'd died of cancer from Agent Orange.So the film is getting it's political messages in early. Rambo is prevented entering the town by Sheriff Teasle (does he even legally have the right to deny him entry based on his appearance? So much for Land Of The Free.) and is driven to the other side of town and told to start walking.Teasle sees Rambo walking back into town and starts exceeding his authority right there, asking him for id, grabbing him and then claiming assault (untrue, he grabbed Rambo 1st) and arresting him on 3 trumped up charges.The vagrancy charge is so trumped up its unreal, the assault charge is a pure fairy tale as it never happened. And the only charge that might have stood was the concealed weapon which he'd have never found if he hadn't searched him.Rambo is treated awfully in custody, assaulted twice by the officers processing him (including a VERY young looking David Caruso who would go on to find fame as Horatio Cane in CSI:Miami), little wonder he reacts the way he did.His escape from jail is not unwarranted but the police were already trying to shoot at him even then (for what offence, exactly?). His fighting with the police in the station can be explained by the treatment he received (both the assaults and the fire hosing) and would not be counted too heavily against him.His 1st actual crime is theft (of the motorcycle) and then he goes to ground in the forest. He is shot at by Galt (who is acting against orders and is solely responsible for his own death) and the helicopter pilot would have been able to clear him of ANY involvement in Galt's so called murder.Even during the 2nd encounter in the forest, Rambo does not actually kill anyone at all. When he quite easily could have killed all of them. The only man shot was hit by Teasle by accident.Even when the National Guard shoot at him, he never kills anyone.I am unsure exactly why the rats attack Rambo in the mine (he is no threat) but I assume it is to make the viewer think everything is against Rambo and nothing is for him.The final conflict in the town is pretty contrived, even after all the pushing Rambo still does not kill Teasle. He merely injures him.Trautman finally talks Rambo down after his breakdown when he realises he is the last of his squad alive and is alone in the world.The ending of this could have been much better explained what was going to happen to Rambo and would have better set up the sequel.",First Blood

All the years I've seen Sylvester Stallone as yet another dumb jock hero, and I've avoided watching his movies because they seemed to contain too much drama for me. I'm an action movie guy: I like it when things blow up.Since then, I've gained great respect for the guy. Check out ""Oscar"", which is hilarious. Did you know that he wrote the script for ""Rocky""? Anyway, ""First Blood"" is quite dated and we've seen flashier action films since 1982. But there's a real story here, and I got a connection to some of the anguish that Vietnam vets had coming home and not getting a parade, just the reverse. And although there is a lot of drama, its not overly arty or melodramatic, and the pace is fast enough. The trip underground is sort of a rebirth: I get it!Who should see this film:-- Action movie buffs, even if you don't like dramas: this one'ssafe-- Drama movie buffs who might like the occasional action flick-- Everyone like me who stereotyped Sy Stallone and should dopennance.

150,SquigglyCrunch,"Nothing Special, Just Another Action Movie",5,30 December 2015,"Maybe I saw this movie too late, when all the ideas have been used to death in other action films. But nevertheless, I found little pleasure in this action classic. The plot is predictable. Nothing new, nothing special. That's not always a bad thing, but in the way this movie presents it it feels like there is no effort and ends up coming off more like a video game- movie than anything else. The characters aren't anything special either. I wouldn't say they were bad, but they were never really focused on until the very end when we received some weird forced moment with Rambo. The action, which is the star of this movie, is boring. I personally don't like watching one overpowered person beating everyone up. One- sided fights just aren't my thing unfortunately. All the fights I felt were too slow and rather predictable too, so I found little entertainment in it. Sylvester Stallone particularly stood out to me as a bad actor. Now maybe that's just because that was supposed to be his character, where the only things he says are little grunting noises occasionally that are made to resemble words, but don't always succeed. Maybe he is a good actor, but he was just given crappy material to work with. Either way, he stood out as being another negative of the movie. Overall First Blood is nothing special. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, the characters are unfocused and sometimes forced, the action is boring, and the acting wasn't great. How this became a classic is beyond me, but maybe it just has to do with timing. Back when it first came out maybe it was incredibly original and deep, but now it stands as just an below average, effortless action movie.

A Vietnam war veteran is forced to survive against extreme changes of staying alive. Sylvester Stallone is doing a fantastic job in one of his more famous performances in his career. What I love so much about the film is how it examines Rambo's struggle against a whole army, his skills in the forest and his skills in guerrilla warfare that help him survive. His dialogue with his colonel is emotional and his character in general: Rambo is the kind of character that represents the veterans of war and their struggle in becoming part of society once again, but in ""First Blood"" people don't accept Rambo, people don't know what he's been through and don't like him, thus he is forced to protect himself against his own society. I can relate Rambo's character with Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"" both characters are veterans who are trying to be part of society again but they don't get accepted and are forced to protect themselves once again. This is a fantastic movie that examines many controversies surrounding veterans and war and I love this movie for being complex and full of tension.",First Blood
153,The_Light_Triton,Filmed not far from where I live.,10,25 January 2008,"First blood has got to be one of the most ignored titles, but yet one of the best action movies of all time. a lot of people refer to it as Rambo 1, or just Rambo, but then again, that could be misleading, because of the new Rambo movie, which was released today, and that was titled Rambo.OK, enough with the rant about titles. let's talk about this movie. so we have a Vietnam war veteran who suffered 3 months in a Vietnamese POW camp and escaped to go back to the army, and win a congressional medal of honor. how awesome. soon as he gets home, people spit on him, call him a baby killer, and hate him. this guy keeps America the land of the free, and people are hating him.so there's no explanation as to why he's broke, and that he has no home (i'm sure that soldiers back in the 60s and 70's got paid as well as the soldiers in the modern time) but he doesn't. he wanders from town to town, living off the land, until one day, he arrives in hope (which is a real town. i know, because i've been there.) and is immediately pushed away by the leading policeman, which sends John. J Rambo into a series of events, which lead to the truth about most modern day veterans.I mentioned this before. this movie was filmed in Hope, British Columbia, and thats only a few miles from where I live. pretty much all the scenes were filmed in that location. and some of the places, such as the hope bridge, are well known, because thats where good old Sylvester Stallone (who still is one of the best actors of all time) drove an army truck through a roadblock. the town also has it's signature Chevrons and dairy queen (which are still there.) and it indeed is a small town.However, the movie is awesome, i suggest you go rent the new ultimate edition (because it has no trailers in it) but really, avoid the survival mode in it, because thats actually kind of lame and it makes you watch the same scene twice. plus, the lack of subtitles in the menu is kind of annoying (but this can be solved with the help of a Closed-captioned TV) 10/10",First Blood
154,nickenchuggets,"""I'll give you a war you won't believe""",9,1 October 2021,"I don't know what it is about the 1980s, but this decade in particular introduced a whole slew of action movies with explosions as far as the eye can see, memorable one-liners, and plenty of well directed fight scenes to keep people coming back for more. If you don't live under a rock, chances are you've heard the name ""Rambo"" at least some point in your life; a name synonymous with being a tough guy. After watching this film for the first time, I have to admit it wasn't what I thought it would be. There are still many exciting moments in it, but they also try to tie the storyline to a real life conflict, which gives the movie a bit of a historical feel. It's only a slight alteration though. It gives the main character some depth so the audience can understand what drives his actions. As you might expect, the movie is about John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a veteran who has returned home from fighting in vietnam. One day, he is walking in the small, nondescript town of Hope, Washington, when he is approached by a cop named Will. Will has a disdainful and scornful attitude towards John right from the start, saying how ""drifters"" like him aren't wanted in small and quaint towns like this. Will drops John off near the edge of town, basically telling him to get lost. Defiantly, John walks back in the direction of the town, prompting Will to arrest him for being a vagrant. Will also discovers a large knife concealed under John's coat. Will brings John into the local police station, and the cops there don't make any effort to understand his situation and instead decide to insult him. When one of the cops tries to shave John, it triggers a PTSD-induced flashback of his days as a prisoner in vietnam. John goes completely berserk and manages to fight his way out of the police station barehanded, and then steals a motorbike to flee into the forest with. Will takes a number of men under his command and tries to track him down, even bringing in a helicopter at one point. Despite hordes of men trying to subdue him, John manages to evade them all. Later, Rambo's exploits manage to catch the federal government's attention, so Washington sends Rambo's former boss, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), to try and resolve things peacefully. The colonel tells the cops how John is one of the bravest men he has ever known, and is also a former Green Beret, as well as being a Medal of Honor recipient (the United States' highest award for bravery). Trautman also says how the cops are bigger fools than he expected, as they are anticipating John is going to give himself up on account of being surrounded by the police. Trautman knows that against a single opponent or a lot of them, John will kill them, one by one. Trautman makes an attempt to talk to Rambo on a radio he stole from one of the cops, but not even the colonel is able to persuade him to stop fighting. John causes even more destruction by hijacking an army truck carrying machine guns and driving it to a gas station, which he blows up. By this point, Will has had enough and goes to kill John himself, against the precautions of the colonel. Will manages to pick the right building John is hiding in, and tries to sneak in on him through the roof, but John manages to shoot him and he falls into the skylight. Will tells John to finish him off, but Trautman suddenly shows up and tells John he is making a big mistake. People who want him dead are all over the place, and it makes no sense to continue this rampage. Dejected, John says he caused all this mayhem because of how unfairly returning vietnam veterans were treated. He wants to know why the veterans of all other wars are respected by america, but those who fought in vietnam are meant to feel ashamed. John walks outside the building with Trautman, and the violence is over. Like I said earlier, Rambo is not what I expected. I kind of anticipated seeing a lot of gunfire, explosions and things of that nature, and while that certainly did happen, this movie is more than just a mindless action blockbuster. The thing that makes John a believable character is his motive. It is most definitely true that vietnam veterans were abused and insulted upon returning to an america they thought would be grateful for their efforts. Why this is is still a debate to this day, but many people argue america should never have been involved there in the first place. This would probably explain why this movie didn't come out earlier. The war ended in the mid 70s, but vietnam movies were (understandably) not seen in a good light right after the war ended. This is why you see a lot of vietnam war films made in the 80s instead since they figured people were over it after a few years. To summarize, Rambo is the epitome of what you'd call ""chaotic good"", if you're familiar with Dungeons and Dragons. This means that he is technically a good guy (as shown by his patriotism), but he'll do what he thinks is right. Sometimes this interferes with the law, but he doesn't care. The sequels to this movie are not as well done as this first entry, but when it comes to action movies, few can top this franchise.",First Blood
155,harryplinkett14,80s gold,8,27 October 2019,"They don't make them like this any more. The film's downfall is the poorly written drama, especially in the third act. I also resent the casting choice regarding Colonel Trautman. Richard Crenna plays the role with an ever present hint of irony that undermines the seriousness of the whole thing. If you don't believe me, compare his performance in this film with the one n the parody with Charlie Sheen. Do you notice any difference? I hardly do.
Now, the action parts are by and large good, especially early in the film. By the end, Rambo is just blowing everything up, but it's not quite satisfying. There is also the famous cut between him driving a truck in the middle of the day, and a shot of him driving at night, while no passage of time is supposed to exist between these shots. A small budget can do that to a movie, they probably didn't have the luxury to rent the truck for more than one afternoon.
Anyway, the film meant something back in the 80s, when memories of the war in Vietnam were still fairly fresh. Some of that appeal is now gone, but the enthusiasm and freshness of the action still entertain. The film industry has long since lost that creative spark.",First Blood

157,J_Batek_II,"The Classic Movie That Gave Us Rambo, The Iconic Vietnam Vet.",8,17 June 2019,"A quintessential action film. 'First Blood' (1982) showed Hollywood that Sylvester Stallone could be more than a punching bag in another sad Rocky movie. This is a bold, well-written film that portrays a United States Vietnam veteran in a sympathetic light ( a rarity in 1970's and early 1980's film). Stallone gives an amazing performance, and his monologue at the end goes way beyond the acting quality of most action movies. I enjoy location shooting, and this film is set in the little town of Hope, British Columbia, in Canada. Without this film, most people would never encounter the town of Hope. It's cool seeing a small town in the 1980's get blown up by Rambo. Besides the soundtrack, there is nothing wrong with this film. Great work, Stallone.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

158,Rautus,Good but the Novel is better,7,31 May 2009,"First Blood (1982)Directed by: Ted Kotcheff Based on the Novel by: David Morrell Screenplay by: Michael Kozoll & William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone Review: The Novel which First Blood is loosely based on is defiantly one of the Greatest Thriller's I've ever read, it's a interesting manhunt which is told through the Point of view of Rambo and Teasle as the two hunt after each other in the Woods and then finally in the Town. During this hunt the book also describes Rambo trying to survive as the National Guard, Police and Hunters try to capture him Dead or Alive.The Novel is much more darker and gorier than the film, the Character of Rambo in the book is more unstable and kills a lot of people while in the movie Rambo only kills one person while wounding others. The Novel explains more of Rambo's back-story before he went into Vietnam and also explains in detail the struggle Rambo had inside the POW camp and how he escaped. When you read the book you know Rambo isn't a Action Hero but instead a Troubled Young Veteran trying to survive as he's being forced back into violence.The Character of Teasle in the book does give Rambo a hard time and is persistent is getting Rambo, the book also goes into more detail with his past and with his personal life, the relationship between Teasle and Orval in more explained in the book showing that Orval was like a Father figure for Teasle since his real Dad was killed in a Hunting accident.The Character Sam Trautman doesn't have the same relationship with Rambo like he does in the film.The Ending in the Novel is another big difference from the film.My only real grip with the film is that they should have made it closer to the book, other than that the film is a entertaining Action/Thriller that shows how one man must survive against a whole army using the skills he developed in Vietnam, the film also shows how frustrating it was for Vietnam Veterans when they came back from the War.The Soundtrack for First Blood is great and really sets the mood for the film.The acting is great, Sylvester Stallone does a excellent job as the mentally unstable Veteran Rambo. The speech he gives at the end although a little hard to understand especially when he starts crying is so true to what it was like. Richard Crenna is great as Sam Trautman, he has that caring and empowering Father like figure especially when he finally meets Rambo again. Brain Denhey does a great job as the Sheriff determined to get Rambo, it just would have been nice if they made him more like the Tease in the novel. The scenery in the movie is stunning to look at and the Action is thrilling and exciting.Plot: When Young and Rugged veteran John Rambo goes to see his War buddy he sadly discovers that he's passed away, travelling along the the highway Rambo enters a small Town. Drifting through the town Sheriff Will Teasle stops Rambo and offers to take him out the Town, driving him out Rambo decides to go back. Teasle sees Rambo coming back so he arrests him, in the Police Station Rambo starts giving the Police a hard time by refusing to talk to them, have them file his Finger Prints and cooperate.After being cleaned up the Police go to shave him, having a Flashback of the Vietnam War Rambo fights his way out the Station, jumps on a Motorcycle and escapes to the Woods.Teasle and a few others go into the woods to try and apprehend him but soon find themselves being hunted by Rambo.Rambo lets Teasle go unharmed, after a while the National Guard is called in to stop Rambo. It's then that Teasle meets Sam Trautman, Rambo's mentor who offers to help them get him.It soon becomes a fight for survival as Rambo uses his Skills to try and get out the Area before the National Guards and various Hunters find him and stop him.Overview: The First Blood Novel is definitely better but the film is a entertaining 80's Action/Thriller that introduced the Legendary Action Hero John Rambo to the movie going public. Check both the Novel and the Film out to see how different they both are.",First Blood
159,willcundallreview,An Action film with an Action man,7,8 July 2014,"First Blood is an action film that not only has scenes with purely well made well action, but also a performance from an actor we don't always see the best of. With it's quiet feel the film can really jump into life at any moment and you won't find many films that can pull this kind of thing off and still keep you entertained until the last few moments. I felt First Blood was a solidly pretty good action movie, and here is why below.The story is thrilling yet has a slight dramatic depth to it to say that most of these type plots usually end up all guns blazing and deaths constantly. This film manages to avoid the over the top amount of kills and settles for a slow pace that really does work. I especially liked the start when Rambo is pushed over the edge emotionally, it brings the whole film to a thrilling start and even the most hardened veterans of action films will still feel their heart beating faster.Sylvester Stallone is an actor that many times is criticised, but here he is at his near full best, doesn't talk an awful lot but his emotion carries and you really start to feel for what he says(well, if you can at times make it out). I liked Richard Crenna and his calm demeanour in the film, even in the most dangerous of times he still seems to keep a straight face and mind and the actor really knows how to make himself look like a father figure.It is directed quite well and same goes for the writing, Ted Kotcheff I feel maybe didn't need to do much in scenes as Stallone just knows it all anyway but is hand is steady throughout the movie. Stallone is among the writers and he does well too, although with the 3 and the dialogues sometimes kept at a minimum, it is easy to see just how easy this was to write really. I liked some stunts but I felt more was needed in that area and more things like big jumps and run chases would have been appreciated as well.My main critical points focus on the slightly dull dialogue and parts seem a bit rushed in honesty, it doesn't hurt the film badly as I have already said, it is a pretty good movie, but it definitely makes some scenes seem rubbishy. I wasn't too keen either on the way the film has to keep pointing out Stallone is hard to kill and a seasoned veteran, it got on my nerves because we hear it 20 times when Richard Crenna arrives, and even more after just a few minutes.I think those who love good action and a story pieced together actually quite well, you will enjoy it, has a good back story but also doesn't focus too much in the past, stays in the present story. If you like massive explosions and car chases etc, this may not be for you really, lacks in that department but if it had them in the film, it would have ruined it and made it so much more unrealistic and rubbish.Overall it is Solidly Good and although not quite straight good, still is moving there by the end. It just needed a little more time I feel and it could have rated even higher, worth a watch though for anyone who likes film. One more thing, if you like Stallone and his many movies that include fighting and shooting etc, you should have a blast with this, this could be Stallone's best action thriller film he has ever done(and he does a lot of them), a great watch for you guys and with so many sequels too, why not watch it.",First Blood
160,Cinemaniac1984,The movie that introduced us to John Rambo.,9,2 May 2015,"It's hard to believe when First Blood was released in 1982, this movie would spawn three sequels and cement the character John Rambo as a cultural icon. Rambo would also be a term used to symbolise a reckless person who solves problems with violence. First Blood would also prove to be a successful movie for Sylvester Stallone and adds another famous character to his filmography, alongside Rocky Balboa from the Rocky series.The film starts with John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a Vietnam Veteran who is drifting across America to locate a former Vietnam buddy. He is saddened when he finds out that his friend died of cancer after being exposed to Agent Orange. Rambo passes through a small town called Hope, Washington where he is met by the town's Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy). Sheriff Teasle arrogantly proclaims his dislike for drifters and troublemakers in his town and automatically perceives Rambo as a drifter due to his unkempt appearance and his old Army jacket. Teasle drives Rambo to the edge of town and refuses to let Rambo buy something to eat. Angered that Teasle has insulted Rambo, Rambo defiantly turns around and starts walking back. Teasle spots Rambo and arrests him for vagrancy, resisting arrest and carrying a concealed weapon (his knife). While in custody, Rambo is beaten and humiliated by Deputy Art Galt (Jack Starrett) while the rest of the deputies such as Mitch (David Caruso), Ward (Chris Mulkey), and Preston (Don Mackay) are either too weak, ignorant or even partake in Rambo's mistreatment. This also causes Rambo to have flashbacks to his time as a POW in Vietnam where he is captured and tortured. Rambo then snaps and violently lashes out at the deputies, assaulting them. He manages to escape from police custody with his knife and heads for the nearby mountains on a motorbike he has commandeered. Teasle spearheads a manhunt to find John Rambo. Little do they know, John Rambo is a highly decorated Green Beret who is an expert in survival and guerrilla warfare and the deputies have taken on a lot more than they bargained for. The situation deteriorates and the Washington State Police and National Guard are brought in to assist in the manhunt. Also joining in is Rambo's former commander in Vietnam, Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna), who's warnings about Rambo as well as pleas to let him go fall on deaf ears. Colonel Trautman finds himself to be Rambo's only ally and must convince Rambo to surrender. Rambo maintains that the sheriff drew first blood and continues his one man war through Hope, symbolically waging war against society who has turned his back on him.Although Sylvester Stallone has endured a mixed reception with the Rambo series, without a doubt First Blood is one of the best movies of the series as well as one of Stallone's best movies. The rest of the sequels, although enjoyable, turn John Rambo into a one-dimensional action hero and as a symbol for the person who can wage a one-man war on the enemy. Sylvester Stallone has never been better.Brian Dennehy does an excellent job as the overzealous and arrogant Sheriff Will Teasle who although wants to maintain a boring and peaceful town, has bitten off more than he could chew by looking down upon John Rambo as just another drifter and dismissing all warnings from Colonel Trautman on how dangerous Rambo is.Richard Crenna is perfect in his role as Colonel Sam Trautman, an honourable and respectable man who has taken on an unofficial role as a father figure to John Rambo.While there is a lot of action scenes that have become famous (or infamous) throughout the Rambo series, the ending where Rambo pours his heart out to Trautman has remained imprinted into my memory. Rambo rages about the horrors of the Vietnam War and the unfair conditions and treatment he came home to where he and many other soldiers were abused and spat on by protesters as well as the inability to adapt to civilian life let alone hold a job. As Rambo says he was a respected war hero in the Army with loyal comrades and be responsible for million dollar equipment, back home he can't hold a job and nobody respects him . Rambo weeps as he recounts a gruesome incident where a friend was blown up which still haunts him. Rambo is revealed to be a broken man suffering from the effects of PTSD and his mistreatment at the hands of the sheriff's deputies pushed him over the edge. I'll never forget Trautman fighting to hold his own emotions back as he consoles Rambo, both of them having gone through the same experiences and injustices of the Vietnam War. Though First Blood was set in Hope, Washington, filming took place in Canada throughout the province of British Columbia and Hope, British Columbia is actually the name of the place filming occurred. The scenery featured in First Blood is beautiful, and the backdrop was perfect for the movie. I've always admired Jerry Goldsmith's works as a composer and his score was an absolute delight to listen too. His score gives the movie an energetic and thrilling feel, yet there are times his score emphasizes the tranquility of certain scenes, particularly the opening of the movie.First Blood is also notable for being the Rambo movie in the series with a body count of one, unlike the rest of the movies in the series notable for high on-screen deaths. First Blood is still an enjoyable action movie today, and easily one of the best Rambo movies. It's also not just a one dimensional action movie with well rounded characters and a great story. First Blood is also one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies besides Rocky (1976) and Cop Land (1997). A definite must see movie for all lovers of action and fans of Sylvester Stallone.9/10.",First Blood
161,stevenrotherforth,All he wanted to do is get something to eat!,10,21 October 2017,"First BloodAmidst the action movies of the 80's First Blood is one of the greatest. Not for the action or the explosions but for the stand out performance by Sylvester Stallone. An underrated actor who is as much to blame for the negativity that is often bestowed upon him. He has made some poor movie choices throughout his career but First Blood certainly isn't one of them. The film is based on the novel by the same name written by David Morrell and tells the tale of John Rambo. A Vietnam war veteran who on his return home finds that his country doesn't want to accommodate him anymore. He wanders from state to state, a drifter with no purpose. All his friends have been consumed by the war either on the field or by the chemicals sprayed on to the fields. The opening scene of the film describes this to heart wrenching effect. Alone in the world Rambo stumbles upon a small town where all he wants is to get something to eat. He is bullied and made unwelcome by the towns sheriff played by Brian Dennehy. From here on the story unfolds as local law enforcement mistreat the drifter causing him to retaliate. Stallones performance here is at first subdued before over boiling with fury. He looks gaunt, undernourished and tormented. The fear is apparent in his eyes. But there's also a rage there too. A fire that still burns, a war that wages within him. He was extracted from a war he was told he wasn't able to win. He was returned home to a country that seemed to not care for him. A country that he had sworn to serve. A country that he loved but didn't love him back. When the switch in Rambos head is flipped and he goes off like a land mine all those around him, all those who crossed him will pay. Stallone doesn't have much dialogue in the film except right at the end where a broken man finally breaks down, confiding in the only friend he has left. Colonel Trautman played brilliantly by Richard Crenna. In the novel Rambo dies. Killed by his only friend. In the movie obviously he survives as several silly inferior sequels followed. First Blood should be judged as a stand-alone film and not have the cartoon like sequels tarnish its brilliance. The movie is wonderfully shot and has a fantastic score by Jerry Goldsmith. With a strong cast and a career best performance by Stallone this film has stood the test of time. A character study of a man broken by war and it's aftermath.",First Blood
162,buccaneer21,A Serious Character Study Film About Military Veterans Having Psychological Problems,10,26 September 2019,"Sylvester Stallone just made another film in the Rambo franchise entitled,""Rambo: The Last Blood"". It was obviously a disappointment as it basically ruined the franchise. This would definitely just entertain Rambo fans who perceive him to be a killing machine. Nevertheless,I would like to review the film that started it all known as ""First Blood"".""First Blood"" is a movie based on David Morrell's novel of the same title. It stars Stallone as John Rambo,an ex-Green Beret who served during the Vietnam War veteran, that just was honorably discharged.When he got to a town looking for a friend,he got in trouble with the policemen. Added to that,we also get to witness that he is affected by psychological problems brought to him by his military service. He apparently is suffering from PTSD or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This brought him into trouble as he got entangled with hometown police and Rambo's military superior,Colonel Trautman came into the aid of the police to restore order to the situation.This was obviously the best film of the franchise. It definitely deserved a perfect rating. This was a serious character study film especially about people who served the military that have psychological problems.That was truly evident in the main character,John Rambo. It was obviously the first of its kind during its time of release almost 40 years ago. Added to that,it also provides the viewer a better appreciation for people who served for their character particularly the Vietnam War.No question that this was a great film before the sequels occurred when they made John Rambo a killing machine.It truly deserves the highest rating.",First Blood
163,Bogey Man,Classic action film,8,17 July 2002,"First Blood created a new character for Sylvester Stallone after the success Rocky. Canadian director Ted Kotcheff directed First Blood from the novel First Blood by David Morell. Morell wrote the novel in 1972 while the film was shot in 1982. Morell wanted to write a book in which a Vietnam veteran gets involved in similar circumstances than in Vietnam. Stallone plays Vietnam vet John Rambo, who is visiting his old friend only to learn he's passed away some time ago. In the little town, he soon gets into trouble as local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) starts to follow Rambo and wants to get him out of the town and is irritated by this big and silent man. Soon Rambo is arrested by the crimes he never committed and the sadist guards and polices abuse him, before he finally manages to escape the police station, and start the legendary hunt, and thus the structure for this action film has been developed. ""Non stop action"" as author David Morell said.This is indeed pretty exciting and non-stop after the first 15 or so minutes. There are many chases and pulse pounding moments, which I really felt were genuinely exciting and breath taking. The director of photography in First Blood is Andrew Laszlo, the same photographer who shot Walter Hill's Southern Comfort and its incredible visuals in the swamps the film was set in. The scenes in forest are equally brilliant in First Blood, so this Hungarian cinematographer is really talented. Just watch the gothic scenes in First Blood, when Rambo does his first traps while the police is after him in the forest, soon after the great helicopter attack scene. Very atmospheric and great looking scenery. The film is very professional and brilliant in editing and pace, too, and the helicopter scene at the cliff is really amazing. That was the scene in which Stallone hurt himself while doing his own stunts. The excitement is very high on that helicopter scene with great use of camera. The film is pretty dark in tone and in its colors, but at least the ending is little ""brighter"" and purifying, even though Rambo dies violently at the end of the novel. The end speech Rambo gives shows the acting abilities of Stallone and I think it must be among his greatest acting moments. It is very gripping to watch this man's suffering and emotions exploding. The brief flashbacks from Vietnam are also very chilling and horrific, and also reminded me of James Glickenhaus' ultra nihilistic action film The Exterminator, which has also similar, albeit far more disturbing flashbacks from the war.I am really pleased with the film's quality considered this is an action film which usually don't have merits this high, at least action films of today's Hollywood. This film created one of the more legendary movie characters and heroes of all time, and author Morell has said that Rambo is equally significant hero character in the field of cinema as James Bond and Tarzan, and that is probably true. There are also two sequels, directer by George Pan Cosmatos and Peter Macdonald, but they are not as high on quality as this original, which can almost be called classic. Rambo gets 8/10 from me and deserved the great DVD release it got from Artisan.",First Blood
164,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,16 November 2004,"Seen by many as just another mindless action flick, this goes deeper than most films of its kind. Yes, it is a classic 'one man army' movie, and although i feel its sequel deals more with the disillusionment of veterans, it is an effective look at a man trained only to kill-destroyed by his government, forgotten by his people. Small town exclusiveness, fear and small-mindedness are exploited to the full, and if you give it a chance, this is actually a highly satirical movie. But if you want to see explosions, guns and killings, which is what first brought me to this film, then you can't find many better.Stallone dispatches of the 'bad guys' using every inch of his Rambo's training, and yes, from the start you know the cops don't have a hope. The few roles which call for any substantial acting are done well, the action is of a high quality, the music is memorable, and the script sufficient. if you want deep characterisation then watch The Deer Hunter, but for action, watch this. 8 out of 10",First Blood

Sylvester Stallone,despite being the 11th choice among the actors, stars in this film based on the novel of David Morrell's novel of the same title. It co-stars Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy.""First Blood"" tells the story of a Vietnam War veteran who just returned to the country - United States of America - that he came to serve. As we can see from the film, he is obviously suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and he is a misunderstood Vietnam War veteran who is not getting respect nor understanding from the police force that are dealing with him after he got questioned and arrested by the police.This was definitely a great character film. It provides us a view of what military people went through upon serving in Vietnam and how it somehow ruined them mentally and psychologically. Added to that, we also see how they are treated in their country upon going back from service. Finally,we also see how much trouble it created until the conclusion when Rambo's former military superior came to help the police and how it all ended. This was obviously the best film of the Rambo franchise.Rambo definitely was a great character-driven film before he was developed into a killing machine in the sequels.",First Blood
166,theshadow908,Awesome one man war action flick.,7,6 September 2006,"First Blood tells the story of John Rambo, a Vietnam vet who has returned to the United States haunted by the horrors of war. As he passes through a small town, he is arrested by the Sheriff for drifting. Rambo's mistreatment in prison brings on terrifying flashbacks of his treatment in a POW camp, and he escapes from the jail house and flees into the surrounding mountains. The police hunt him, and soon he is forced to fight a one man war against the town to stay alive. This may seem like your average cheesy, brainless action film, but it's awesome action and suspense puts it above the others.This movie is about a man who, even though he's back home, hasn't left Vietnam. He is haunted by memories of his time in a POW camp, the deaths of his best friends, and the way he felt when he returned home to a far less than warm welcome. When he is arrested and treated badly simply for passing through and having long hair and a 5 o'clock shadow, he snaps. At first it's a fight to get away. Then it becomes a fight to stay alive. I liked how John Rambo didn't have that many lines in the movie. The movie allowed his facial expressions and the other characters to get the point across. The action scenes are fantastic, particularly when Rambo uses army tactics and camouflage to subdue the police that are hunting him. I didn't mind the father/son relationship between Rambo and his former commander and trainer, Col. Trautman, but I felt like Trautman was just there to say a few corny lines about how deadly Rambo is.The acting isn't bad. Sylvester Stallone plays Rambo the same as any other 80's action character he's played, but he does make a cool character. Richard Crenna is good as Col. Trautman, but the best performance comes from Brian Dennehey as the headstrong Sheriff Teasle.Overall, it's another 80's action movie, but with a cool story and some amazing action.7/10",First Blood
167,Didier-Becu,THE MOTHER OF ALL EVIL?,7,8 August 2003,"First Blood (or as it is called by everybody : Rambo) is the kind of movie we should be ashamed of to admit we actually liked it, but the truth is that this movie comes close to that of a true masterpiece and perhaps one of the finest actionmovies ever made! We better not talk about the sequels (director Ted Kotcheff distances himself completely from it), the many Rambo wanna be-movies (remember the laughable ""Missing in action""-series with Chuck Norris) or the fact that tons of idiots identify themselves with Rambo. Even the story was back then quite original (only be seen in ""Apocalypse now"" or ""The deer hunter"" as this movie was more a critic towards the society (boys who fight in Nam were abandonned by their own countrymates). The movie starts great with John Rambo (Stallone of course) visiting a small American town to visit an old Namfriend at where he is quite shocked that this friend died of cancer he got there. Disappointed he walks back till a sherrif (brilliantly performed by Brain Dennehy) tells him to go away as his ""city"" doesn't want creeps like him. He soon lands in the local prison without having committed a crime and once he's got beaten by everyone who wears a blue skirt, Rambo escapes to the prison. By accident and by selfdefedence a cop dies but Dennehy and his crew declare the war on him...and during the second part  of the movie that is as brilliant as Boorman's ""Deliverance"" you see the haunt for Rambo. Eighty minutes long you see a brilliant picture that looses its fascination at the end when Rambo comes back to town...it would have been better if everything was shoot in the forest though. The role played by Stallone (apart from the rather ridiculous endmonologue) is a silent one...and let's say it like it is, this casting was perfect. Lots of serious people will dislike it, you're right on if you do that with Rambo II or III but this one is great.",First Blood
168,RiffRaffMcKinley,"Why, Yes, It Is a Long Road",10,17 September 2011,"What makes ""First Blood"" so bizarrely effective is how it works on more than just a literal level. Fans of simple shoot-'em-up action can revel in the film's near-implausible carnage, but underneath it all is a metaphor that feels more genuine than anything seen in a long time. Rambo struggles to survive via violent, chaotic clashes with the bullying police and the comically inept National Guard that represent something deeper and more common: the struggle of Vietnam survivors to readjust to life in the United States. As he wails and screams in his climactic monologue about the war, he finds himself having his freedoms and rights taken away by the very people whose freedoms and rights he went to Vietnam to protect. It's a brilliantly complex analysis of the war and its tumultuous, far-reaching effects, one that defies politics and platitudes. I've never seen such a seemingly over-the-top action extravaganza done with such a convincing and shatteringly powerful ""ulterior motive."" Shot in British Columbia, the movie has a dingy, foggy, where's-that-bright-yellow-thing-from-the-sky look to it. There are certain visual parallels to ""The Deer Hunter,"" but ""The Deer Hunter"" this ain't. Stallone gives what is arguably his one great performance, a sobering blend of anarchic physicality and perfect on-cue histrionics-- combined with a level of articulateness that mercifully takes this character in the full opposite direction from Rocky Balboa, which I was not expecting. And while the music score isn't one of Jerry Goldsmith's best, the main theme is one of his best individual compositions, and the music is well above average for both building suspense and evoking sincere emotion. Though it doesn't have the character name in the title, this may be the only ""Rambo"" movie that was actually about Rambo-- the real Rambo, not the human action figure-- and as such it is vastly under-appreciated.",First Blood
169,mOVIemAN56,Instant Classic,10,23 March 2005,"(Possible Spoilers)First Blood is ultimately considered a very violent, pointless movie. However, I found First Bllod to be much more. John Rambo (Slyvester Stallone) is an ex- Green Berie visiting an army buddy. Upon visit he learns the man is dead and heads into town. Not looking for trouble, Rambo remains quiet as he is questioned by Police Chief Will Teasle.Next thing you now Rambo is escaping from prison and running into the woods. Throughout the entire movie we see Rambo's amazing skills of military training from putting stitches in his own arm to traveling through an abandon mine shaft. Even though the movie is considered violent, there really is no killing (except for a police officer accidentally falling out of a helicopter).Although when most people watch First Blood they think of it as a violent pointless movie its message is deep. It shows how the world treated American hero's after Vietnam and how the army was pretty much there whole life. Stallone was an excellent choice as the ex-soldier Rambo and Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy add solid supporting jobs. The best part of this film is probably Rambo remembering his training and using it against the police force in the forest. First Blood: Slyvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, and Brian Dennehy. 4 out of 5 Stars.",First Blood
170,tankace,Made Stallone the action start we all know!,8,30 June 2016,"First Blood was an adaptation of the 1972 book of the same name, but lets be honest we know the movie, which as action films go is awesome, grounded and open the career of Stallone to the action genre ,no some say that was wrong , but the volume of amazing flick born of that decision like Demolition Man ,Cop Land ,Tango & Cash and Ants, makes me think was worth it.So to the uninitiated the film follow John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran who tries to find his comrades from his platoon, but when the police mistreats him ,he is forced to fight back and unfortunately for the cops, a trained green beret is better than some police officers. What you were thinking , he is a commando, not a bump, he clearly has more experience in fighting back. The important thing however is not the intense scene, which are really good (bonus fact: the movie was made with only 15 million dollars!), it is that Rambo wasn't looking for trouble, he only wanted to be left in peace and the reaction of the society forced him in the defense.That fact is very real for the veterans coming back for literally the other side of the world and after the pain of war brinks ,they are called names (not the nice ones) and put on the side by their countrymen for whom it was said to them they were fighting. Personally both the Vietnam War and the Irak War were quit mismanaged endeavors and the soldier on the ground ,altough they were many persons who deserve court martial for their actions, the majority went their because they believed that what they did it was for the greater good. So to treat them like jerks ,when they return home is to say it polite bad karma!First Blood is no doubt a awesome flick ,with well written character story and good action and suspense . Is a rock solid 8 out of 10, if only didn't make sequels it would have been better, although Rambo (2008) wasn't to bad at all.",First Blood
171,OMTR,'Old men start wars and young men fight them. Nobody wins. Everybody in the middle dies and nobody ever tells us the truth' - Sylvester Stallone,10,9 September 2019,"In 1972, David Morrell wrote his novel 'First Blood' about traumatized Vietnam War veteran John Rambo and his battle with the authorities in a small town. Morell had various sources of inspiration for his novel; including the classic novel 'Rogue Male' by Geoffrey Household, but a major source for the character of Rambo himself was a real-life war hero: Audie Murphy.In the film, co-written by Sylvester Stallone, Rambo does not actually kill anyone. He is the victim of the deep egocentricity, ethnocentrism and idiocracy of lowlives, who have spent all of their lives stuck in a boring life in their little hometown, and have never opened their heart and their mind to the outside world.'First Blood' really must be Jerry Goldsmith's greatest score. The cast and filming locations are perfect, like in most American movies of the 1980s. The message about shameful chemical warfare - Agent Orange - and a despicable greedy and warmongering kakistocracy that sacrificed a generation of young Americans in a useless war is also interesting.Finally yet importantly, this is the birth of Sly's second most iconic character after Rocky Balboa, and one of the most famous movie icon in the world and in filmmaking History, which initiates a series that is always at its best when it uses brutal action sequences to tell personal stories about senseless wars and broken heroes. Looking forward to discovering 'Rambo: Last Blood' on September 20.",First Blood
172,bluesman-20,Nobody knew his name was Rambo all they knew was that he looked like trouble.,10,23 April 2008,First Blood is that rare film that is not black and white instead it deals with areas of Gray. Stallone's Acting is Very Good maybe the Finest he's ever done outside of F.I.S.T. And Yet while his Rambo is a compelling portrait of a man slowly going insane trying to find something resembling peace. Rambo never finds it. All he finds is hatred and fear aimed at him and that makes them hostile towards him. The Main Villain in this if you can call him one is Police Chief Wil Teasle wonderfully played by Brian Dennehy. The interaction between the two is tense and that's before the shooting starts. But this is Stallone's movie and his Tour de force as he creates a complex character that many have a hard time separating from the Real Stallone. Richard Crenna Steals the Show as Colonel Sam Trautman United States Special Forces coming all the way from fort Bragge to come get his boy. Crenna underplays his role cool as anyone has a right to be. Together this cast sets off a match headed towards Kegs of Gunpowder and dynamite First Blood does not disappoint and it will stay with you long after you've seen it.,First Blood
173,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,This time he's fighting for his life - Stallone's best action war movie my second favorite Rambo Movie of All Time!!!,10,13 October 2019,"Sylvester Stallone's first and best action film my favorite Stallone movie is Rambo. ""First Blood"" is a classic action film from the 80's. ""First Blood"" is my second favorite Rambo film and my favorite action movie of all time!!! ""Rocky"" (1976) and ""First Blood"" are Stallone's best movies that started the franchise. We got Six Rocky's and Five Rambo movies. ""First Blood"" is iconic classic action war movie that is realistic powerful performed by Sylvester Stallone. Dircted was by Ted Kotcheff who after this movie went and directed Uncommon Valor (1983) a rescue mission to find Americans held in P.O.W. camps in Laos. That was before Rambo: First Blood Part II and Missing in Action come out.""Is there a law against me getting something to eat here?""Hughe Rambo / Stallone fan, I collect Stallone and all Rambo movies. Rambo III is ym favorite Rambo than First Blood. Rambo: Last Blood the fifth movie does not exist. For Vietnam War I enjoy Platoon (1986), but First Blood is a war action film that i love thsi movie so much!!!! It is dearly to my heart and special.""First Blood"" is based on David Morrell's novel. The original author could't find a name for the main character. He stated he was eating an apple and asked his wife what type of apple it was. She replied it's a Rambo apple. So the name John Rambo come from the apple. The movie shows a lot how Vietnam Vet's were poorly treated back in the 70's and 80's. First Blood wasn't the only movie. Platoon (1986) was a realistic Vietnam War movie and realistic performed. You have a tv show Tour of Duty (1987 - 1990) how Vietnam War changed life's. Tommy Lee Jones also played A Vietnam Vet in a TV Movie The Park is MIne (1986). First Blood never attend to be an action movie, it was more about PTSD and Vietnam Vet fighting back. He thinks everyone is against him. In a novel Rambo kills over 200 people for practice, in this movie he doesn't kill anyone. A cop is killed by his own stupidity, because he did not buckle up him self in the helicopter. There was this kid in which Rambo dosen't kill him, but he only took his rifle away and let him live. In the novel he killed that kid. This si my favorite Ted Kotcheff film he did.There is this movie with Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro called The Hunted (2003) and that movie is based on ""First Blood"" novel. In that movie Benicio Del Toro is John Rambo character and he is killing people, he is too far gone and he is a freaking monster, that he has to be put down. Tommy Lee Jones is Trautman character, the former commanding officer and he helps FBI to track Del Toro down and stopping him. In this movie Trautman (Richard Crenna) is more dark and you don't know if is Rambo's friend or his opponent and with little push, he could have killed Rambo. The Hunted (2003) is a great underrated movie and it is a First Blood movie.Sylvester Stallone is a war hero ex-Green Barret Vietnam Vet John Rambo who comes to visit a town one of his best friends from his Unit, only he learns his friend died. Goes trough town, but he is kicked off from the town from the Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) after Rambo is arrested for vagrancy. Rambo is thrown in to jail and his tourted by Teasle's men. That time Rambo's memories really come back to hunt him, when he was tortured in Vietnam when he was was a P.O.W. and now he is tortured again. After deputy's cross the line Rambo uses his army skills and martial arts in self defense and beats the hell out of cops, steals his knive and runs away in the forest in which he is been hunted by Teasle and his men. In return he hunts them and set's those bobby traps hurts those officers. Trautman (Richard Crenna) is Rambo's former commanding officer, who try's to talk out Rambo to turn him self in.The movie it self is actually an action war film with dramatic seqeunces in the end. It is a damn good movie, it is people's favorite film. Everytime in this year I come to see the ranking the Rambo movies on YouTube ""First Blood"" is people's favorite film. The action sequences are realistic and real performed. After John Rambo is climbing down the cliff you see Rambo been chased and shoot by a cop on a helicopter. Rambo jumps off the cliff, that jump was for real. Sylvester Stallone really jumped off the cliff and he really hung him self on a three broke his ribs. Blood and crying was for real, Sly did not act, it was for real. They shut down the film seting for four months so that Sly could heal.You have a motorcycle chases, Rambo is chased on a motorcycle by Teasle. I love the scene in which Rambo destroys with an army truck the car's on a bridge. I love John Rambo with a M60 machine gun that is his emo. I wish that Rambo would use more M60 machine gun in the movie not only in the finale. Rambo uses his Survival Knife that was designed by famed knife-smith Jimmy Lile. I love the dialogue: ""What do you hunt with a knife?"" ""Name it"". I love the showdown between Teasle and Rambo. Teasle stand on a roof with his AR-15/SP1 riffle firing on Rambo while in return Rambo fiers at Teasle with his M60 machine gun at Teasle wounding him, but not killing him. Excelelnt finale and action sequence performed.Brian Dennehy R.I.P. he died that year in my opinion he was a bad-ass as Sheriff Teasle. He was a Korean vet and he never give up. I don't care what aynone says I love him as the villian. He thought that he did the right job and he is doing right defending his town. For some reason his motives were explained Korean war was forgotten, Vietnam War was popular that time, that is why he attacked Rambo. Richard Crenna as Samuel Trautman was excellent as Rambo's former commanding officer. Richard Crenna was great in this movie he pulled off fantastic performance. We have young David Caruso from CSI: Miami as Mitch, Michael Talbott from Miami Vice as Balford and Chris Mulkey as Ward and they all did great job in this movie. Beautiful music score from Jerry Goldsmith and a beautiful song ""It's a Long Road"" sung by Dan Hill. Beautiful filming locations filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. I hope that bridge they filmed, is still there. They wanted to tornit down but locals defend it, because it is a memorie and a film mark on ""First Blood"".First Blood is realistic great powerful action war movie that actually put Sly on the top of his career. The movie suppose to be 2hrs long but they cut to 1 hr and 33 mins and it was fast paced. I am a huge Rambo fan that is my favorite action hero. This is my second Rambo movie.Overall: damn good movie a classic 80's action film that I love so much.",First Blood

The character of John Rambo is so identified with Stallone that it's amusing to note how many actors were considered for the role, including Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Taking a huge leap forward for Action/Adventure films, ""Rambo: First Blood"" get's the job for fans of the genre, and can even welcome newcomers. It may not be a perfect movie, but I absolutely loved it for what it was. As a former vet, John Rambo (Stallone) has escaped prison and is on the loose, fighting to stay alive. Throughout his fight we get glimpses of what happened to him during the war and the depth of his character becomes far more detailed than one might expect. I loved the action, the characters, and the story, but the script could have been a bit smarter I suppose.

Unfortunately, most people don't understand what it's like when you go through a war, what traces it leaves on you. The war stays with you forever.Particularly impressive is his speech at the end, which perfectly shows how soldiers sometimes feel, when they are unfairly attacked for policies over which they have no influence.Then all despair and anger come to the surface and we see a man hurt by injustice, a man who simply wants to survive and find his place in this world.A story that shows us that we should treat each other better.

178,zac-04879,Each Detail is Solid and Involves A Serious Outlook,8,2 October 2021,"The first Rambo tale is an exceedingly strong, effective and complex actioner highlighting a sympathetic former soldier's conflict between an aggravating sheriff. If anything's maturely projected on, it's the fact that this highly underrated film deals with heavy themes relating to trauma after war and the lack of regard for veterans.Not even the most adored or strongly-performed actors would own as much of the ability as Sylvester Stallone possesses to portray the powerful character. Majority of the acclaim deservedly falls into his hands. With the performance at the centre, each of the ideas constructed by the screenwriters are unquestionably remarkable. The outlook is heavily complex and is immensely realistic for First Blood's entire length.The adventure, action and smart ideas surround all the deep subject matter. Not only does 1982's Rambo live up as a direct action-adventure movie, but even those who don't generally appreciate the genre will love First Blood for the themes. What else is there to discuss? There's very infrequent material that shapes out as uninteresting or unnecessary, but it's a great focus on the feeling of being misunderstood or disrespected.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",First Blood
179,stormhawk2021,Rambo: Chronicle of an underrated movie,9,26 June 2017,"Sylvester Stallone stars as John Rambo: a lonely, alienated, and troubled Vietnam vet just trying to move on with his life until he gets unlawfully provoked over a misunderstanding, and finds himself in a war against a sheriff's department and the national guard. The fight doesn't seem fair, mostly because Rambo is outnumbered, but all bets are off since he's a former Green Beret, and he's had a really hard time moving on with his life. Unlike the sequels, this one is (for the majority of the run time) more of a dramatic survival story and not a balls-out action film. I really loved the focus on stealth and guerrilla tactics over pure brute force. It's a great character study with focus on vet's rights, PTSD, and intolerance. It does get kinda preachy, but nevertheless is still very compelling and gripping. Sylvester Stallone is wonderful. He shows off his action skills, and he's great as expected, but where things really shine is with the character and the acting. The action is a main part of who he is, but he's still a flawed and rounded character. Stallone really has to act here at times too, delivering what's still the most dramatic monologue of his career that actually sees him breakdown in tears. It's not often you see something like this, much less have it actually be really powerful and moving. Bravo. For supporters, we get a young David Caruso that's kinda fun to watch, but the main support that really holds the film up is with Brian Dennehy as the determined narrow minded sheriff and Richard Crenna as Rambo's mentor- perhaps the only one capable of bringing the senseless conflict to an end. Both are great, and this is some of their best work. You sort of sympathize with the sheriff a bit, but probably not as much as you should. The film really paints it as Rambo good, everyone else bad, and that's a shame that they didn't go for a bit more complexity or moral ambiguity in that area. Things fare better with Crenna's character, but he too could have been a tad more developed. That's really my only major issue here: the film is a bit too one sided, and towards the end, things just kinda start crumbling. I get how Rambo said that if they kept pushing he'd really ramp it up, but when this all happens it just took me out of it all somewhat, and seemed a bit inconsistent. Fortunately things don't crap out too much, and the film does conclude pretty satisfactorily. It's just the lead up to the climax where it has its stumble. The film is well shot, the locations are great, there's pretty strong direction, neat ideas, and, probably most effective next to the acting, we get Jerry Goldsmith's absolutely thrilling and brilliant score. I still get chills every time I hear the opening notes to the main theme. EVERY time. Definitely check this one out.",First Blood
180,mcjensen-05924,Let's Be Honest......,4,4 July 2021,"While this has achieved quite a following to almost a cult status, that doesn't detract the fact that the writing and acting is atrocious. We all know Stallone does not have a trace of acting talent, and that fact is on full display here. Brian D.'s sheriff character is portrayed ridiculously. I get he's supposed to be unlikeable, but his actions and words are that of an outright lunatic. He risks his whole town and staff, yet he says he's only protecting them? Huge contradiction. And when he learned Rambo was a war hero, why would he double down on his idiocy? Big disconnect. Some of the early action sequences were quite good, especially in the forest. Some of the later ones were eye rolling silliness. Richard C. Probably delivers the worst line of dialouge in the most wooden manner possible, and I always laugh when I see it. Not sure why the director didn't insist on a better take-it's stupefyingly awful! Hint: almost at end of movie. The best parts are when Stallone is by himself eluding capture, when he's not talking at all. Supporting cast, mainly the sheriff's department, are all equally horrid in their appearances with the exception of David C. He showed the only hint of acting talent in this whole laughable farce. Excellent script and great idea ruined by average writing, acting, and lackluster performances. A cliche ridden disasterpiece. As usual, the rating on this site is high, and in the case of this movie about double what reality would dictate. Watch it for the history I guess, if you've never seen it before. Don't expect much though, and seek out the far better movies of this topic that exist.",First Blood
181,AndreiPavlov,"Thank you, Mr Ted Kotcheff, you got it right and you did it right",10,12 September 2005,"""First Blood"" has all the grounds to be called the standard for the whole action genre. It is tough, bloody, realistic (even with the jump from the cliff it looks like a documentary!), and very dramatic. John Rambo cries in one of the scenes but it's no weeping. These are tears of a tough man who has been on the verge of a breakdown (on the verge of killing everybody on sight before being terminated by the army).We finally have a special DVD edition of ""First Blood"" in our country. It has some deleted scenes included as a bonus. It is sad that the suicide ending had been put off. What a mistake! A possible ending can be like this: Rambo dies, his colonel's face is shown in a close-up, the camera comes closer to his eyes; then goes the scene showing him and Rambo leaving the place (like in the final cut), but it all ends with the colonel leaving alone. The credits start to roll over. The End. Here we would have the following interpretation: Samuel Trautman only imagines that they are leaving the place together, though John Rambo is already dead lying in a pool of blood. It is very annoying, if it is true that the public opinion had wanted to digest a ""happy-end"" version and the director had surrendered. John Rambo must die and there must not be stupid ""Rambo II"" and ""Rambo III"" which added some cartoonish smell to the original movie. So, while personally watching the film, when reaching the final episode, there is a burning wish to jump to the death scene (taken from the DVD bonus). He dies - the movie ends. ""First Blood"" is an example of clever action without doubt. And please mind: there are no stupid love/hug/sex scenes in the movie (though, there is a deleted sex scene as a bonus on the DVD – and it is not stupid, it is tragic). Every piece of violence is in its right place and the epic music is amazing.Even for this version where Rambo lives in the end, it is a solid 10 out of 10. Thanks for attention.",First Blood
182,illbebackreviews,Stallone is one of the most underrated actors and this film itself is an underrated classic,10,18 May 2013,"The word underrated has been commonly used when referring to movies. Even the greatest of films, such as The Godfather, have been considered by many to be underrated. Whilst this may be true to a certain extent, Rambo: First Blood is truly one of the most underrated action flicks that happened during the 80s.When referring to the action star, Sylvester Stallone, the words that pop out of one's mouth are definitely Rocky and Rambo but the film itself, First Blood, is never truly appreciated. In First Blood, Sylvester Stallone plays a Vietnam war hero, John Rambo, who has a hard time getting past the traumatizing events of his days in Vietnam and one days, gets into a feud with the police that results in him opening a one man war against the local police force, to the point where he has them on a merry chase across his favourite place: the jungle! First Blood is one of the films that features one of the most simplistic plots yet is at the same time, one of the most effective action films, in many ways similar to the 1988 action classic, Die Hard. First Blood, too is a classic, and is pure 80s action entertainment that truly demonstrate how low budgeted the film was yet how effective and how entertaining it turned out to be.Stallone's performance in the film is truly underrated, as is his overall acting. His performance is genuinely strong throughout the film and delivers a few emotionally powerful moments, despite the fact that his character has very little backstory. The action sequences in the film are extremely easy to follow and extremely intense but the film is more so, a thriller than an action film. First Blood changes gears in its final act as Rambo gets on top of the police and here, the movie is at its very best! Richard Crenna plays Rambo's fatherly figure, and extremely well I must say! His character is one of the more interesting elements to the film and his generosity for Rambo is evident throughout the entire film. Back to Stallone's acting, he is definitely the most physical of actors I've seen. Unlike action stars such as Schwarzenegger, Stallone is trained for physical combat so many of the physical fights in the film are definitely amazing and realistic to watch.First Blood is a true 80s action classic that will live forever. Maybe a tad slow at times, First Blood surely keeps the audience engaged for its entire 90 minute run time. The intensity, the entertainment, the excitement and the action do not stop throughout this 90 minute classic action film.

After hearing of the death of one of his former companions during Vietnam he heads to a nearby small town. A cop then takes him into custody after he tries to take Rambo away and Rambo keeps refusing to listen to him. At the police station, mentally unstable, Rambo is given a hard time by the cops and so he beats them up, and escapes and starts a one man war against the entire police force.Rambo is a great character with a lot of depth. YOu can really sympathize with him when you understand the horrors that he has been through. Stallone does a great job portraying Rambo, the veteran from Vietnam who returns and finds many did not appreciate him.There is plenty of action in this film, but not an over abundance of it. It is not a non stop violent shooting fest like the Rambo sequels tend to be at times. There is a message that is trying to be sent and a lot of emotional scenes to even out all of the action packed scenes.Of particular awesomeness is a scene where Rambo escapes from the police station.Stallone also gets to show his range towards the end where he gives an emotional monologue that probably hits close to home for many Vietnam veterans.Great film.

This dramatic core is what makes First Blood a stand out film.As a piece of film, First Blood stands out as a very down-to-earth sort of film. The escalating manhunt for John Rambo in a sense depicts a very sorry fate for those who served in Vietnam, while at the same time it may stretch one's suspense of disbelief. However, the moral ambiguity of the film is what makes it intriguing to watch.As a movie First Blood really falls short of being amazing in either story, setting or structure, but it's the kind of movie you have to watch to the very end once you start.

187,carlos37andre,Powerful message,10,3 June 2021,"I can't believe it took me so long to see this movie. I can't think of a lot of negatives to say, honestly.The story has an incredible pace, the scenes are raw and impactful, you are at the same time scared of Rambo, and feel really sorry for him, you can see him in your nightmares, but also wants to hug him and tell the Sheriff to f#$% off.The score is suspenseful, and helps a lot in many scenes, like the one when he's escaping from the mine, or even the chase scenes in the first half.Stallone is... just amazing here, mainly cause of the final monologue, I knew there was ""something"" at the end people said it was impactful, but man... my jaw dropped during the scene, is incredible.For real tho, the final monologue from Rambo, might be one of the greatest scenes I've ever seen in an action movie, ever.This is honestly a near perfect movie imo, it's literally 90 minutes long, and they go as fast as a bullet, the pace is insanely good, the character is relatable, and well, the message is clear and powerful, it's an ""anti-war"" movie in a lot of ways, but it tells its message through the lens of the soldier, rather than the civilians, it explores so much of how it can literally break a person, and well, mainly related to the US and the Vietnam war, a lot of times these people will come back... and be left to die by the world around them.It's complex, and there is a ton to unpack here, and, well, I probably don't have much more to add, the movie is almost 40 years old, and therefore there are a lot of more in depth analyses about it, and all its underlining themes out there, who do it way more justice that I could ever do, so I won't even attempt it.So, to sum up, the movie is great, it has a lot really impressive stunts, the action get's you on the edge of your sit, as do the suspenseful scenes, the acting is pretty good, but mainly Stallone is great. At the end of it all, my jaw had dropped, and I had to think about it for a while. Between all the great action and suspense, there is a real issue been approached, with a complex and powerful message told through the exploration of the effects of war in the mind of a soldier. Either way, it's a hell of a movie, a must see to every movie fan out there, and I'm sad it took me so long to see it, but also happy I finally saw it.",First Blood
188,Alex-372,A Classic,9,29 March 2003,"Ok, I'll have to declare what baggage I bring to this movie. Before Rambo: First Blood I was a big fan of war movies (like A Bridge Too Far), and I loved the forests, especially pine forests. When I first got to see this (after 1983), this was great. I dug the landscape (home of Grunge) and Vietnam stories were still few and far between. Anything good just wasn't there. Nothing had really been done on Vietnam. Nothing like Tour Of Duty, but lots of pseudo-Vietnam stories like The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now. As such, this is again not a real Vietnam story, but a post-Vietnam story. Sylvester Stallone plays a ex-Special Forces veteran who apparently was sent out to eliminate enemy personnel, and wants to visit the home of one of his comrades. By the book Sherif Brian Dennehy decides to push him around, until Stallone decides to ""push back"" and bring guerilla warfare to Colorado. This is a very lean, very effective little movie, that maintains most of it's credibility for three quarters of the show. This movie was followed by several sequels, of varying quality.First Blood was one of Stallone's main franchises (next to the Rocky series) and helped kick off and fuel the lone super-action hero genre of the 80s with superstars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and lesser knowns, Jean-Claude van Damme, Jeff Wincott, Jeffrey Speakman, Thomas Ian Griffith and more. Look for small cameos from then (1982) still unknown actors, David Caruso, Michael Talbott (Stan Switek in Miami Vice) and Chris Mulkey.This is a classic movie, only paralleled in it's effectiveness and lean budget by the hyper-realistic LRRP documentary-styled ""84 Charlie Mopic"".",First Blood
189,Mr_Censored,"""I'll give you a war you won't believe!""",9,5 January 2010,"Starring the one and only Sylvester Stallone, ""First Blood"" introduces the world to the legendary action hero John Rambo, in the first of four confusingly titled films. Directed by Ted Kotcheff (""Weekend at Bernie's"") and co-starring Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna and a young David Caruso, the film is as notorious for its extensive action scenes as it is for the intense and iconic performance put forth by Stallone, who is also credited for writing the screenplay.Ex-Green Beret and Vietnam War veteran John Rambo is passing through a small town after learning of the death of a member of his unit, and all he wants is something to eat. The local sheriff (Dennehy) doesn't take too kindly to him, however, and after he breaks out of jail, a strong disagreement turns into a full-scale war, with Rambo at odds against the town's police force. Not only does he make a fool of the sheriff, but in his wake, leaves a trail of destruction all on his own that only serves to match the amount of rage and alienation built up inside of him.Despite laying the violence on a bit thick, the film never cheapens or lowers itself to average action-filler. At the heart of it, it's a story about a man's mental disintegration following a failed attempt at re-entering society. Stallone's speech during his breakdown towards the end of the film not only shows significant range for the actor, but also marks a rare occurrence where an action film attempts to address a painful but all too true reality. ""Rambo"" is not only a great action film, but a gritty and raw one that feels real and human at the same time. Action films just don't get better than this, although the three sequels that followed sure did try.",First Blood
190,Ziya90,One of the best stories ever written,10,11 February 2010,"First Blood is a flawless action thriller. And the great success of film also comes from the plot, exciting. Rambo is not cup of tea of critics, but they must be fair and candid. I don't know exactly why, but may be they suppose to be intellectual, so they suppose to like intellectual movies. You know, according to critics, every movie is ideological, carries political or social messages and they are interested in messages, not movies itself. First Blood has a very engrossing and exciting plot. As I know, the first single army movie is this one. I have seen the movie since my childhood more than 30 times approx. and every time I excited, enjoyed as if watching it for the first time. This is the best one in the series. Each time, I wanted to enter the screen and tell the sheriff let him go! Sylvester Stallone is like he was made for Rambo (and yes Rocky too) and his acting, performance is outstanding, yes, he is not one of the best actors of all time, but. By the way, as I learned, Kirk Douglas who would have played Trautman left the set so that Rambo does not die at the end of the movie. Well, I like Kirk Douglas very much, but this news made me frustrated. And critics agree with him, don't they? They hate Rambo, so they don't want to (have to) watch him more. As for Trautman, it is like he was made for this role too. There are some unforgettable moments. For example the scene that Rambo sutures his wound himself. The jump scene is unrealistic, but no problem. Direction is stylish and no flaw. The final was touching, very effective and different from other action movies, thrillers. And if there is one more thing legendary, it is musics. This is talent! First Blood is about a war veteran who comes to a town in order to eat somethings, but a sheriff does not like him with no reason and does not let him go.",First Blood
191,pinkliz41,Good but not great,7,9 June 2007,"This was an alright start for the now dubbed four films, but could of handled a bit more care. Sly Stallone is good in one of his early screen roles, but arguably could of been tonnes more exciting. There are some shades of excitement but not enough to get u hipper.The visual effects are half descent but more could of been done. Stallone makes an alright appearance as Viatnamese Veteran, John Rambo but the acting is just not convincing enough for me. Dull, boring and lazy, those are my words to describe Sly in this film. But it does begin to lighten up round halfway through the film. I have not yet seen the 2nd or 3rd films yet, but il tell you one thing, the 4th one looks brilliant which comes to our screens in 2008. So i'm not making any judgement on the 2nd or 3rd ones until iv seen them.To be summed up, Rambo first Blood is an half descent film, with lots of explosions, but thats about it it really, the story's so-so and the acting, well u can all guess what its like.",First Blood

John Rambo's story through the entire saga is sure heart breaking for its honesty for the veterans out the and highly appreciated by the others for his life lessons and the cruelty that delivers satisfaction to our deepest darkest parts. Stallone's acting and writing was really stunning on this one. This really set the base for the amazing sequels and even though Quentin Tarantino himself advised him to kill Rambo, he didn't.

194,kingofdanerds,They drew first blood not me,10,9 December 2020,"In the 70s and early 80s, Sylvester Stallone was fairly successful in the movie business. The Rocky films were apart of his success but also the Rambo movies. First Blood was released in theaters in 1982 and recieved mixed reviews from critics but has since recieved a critical re-evaluation and has often been considered one of the best action films of the 80s. The film itself was a box office hit making $125 million. The film was based off of the 1972 book of the same name. (For the record, I have not read the book but I am aware of the differences between book and movie). The film had the rights bought to it several times by different film companies until Anabasis got the rights.The film follows Vietnam veteran John Rambo who is a drifter. He is looking for the rest of the men in his platoon and finds that all of them have passed away. While walking through town, a police officer starts harrassing Rambo and arrests Rambo for a number of absurd charges. Vagrancy, resisting arrest, and carrying a concealed weapon. When they return to the jail, the officers start to abuse Rambo which triggers flashbacks of when he was a POW in the Vietnam War. All of this causes Rambo to escape and be pursued by the police as he fights for his survival.When I first watched First Blood, I was amazed by the film. I knew of the sequels (but have not really watched them) and how they were more on the over the top action side of the genre. In First Blood, it takes things seriously. While this film can be considered as an action film, I like to think of it more as a survival/thriller. A good example I have is 1984's The Terminator which is an action film, but I like to think of it more as a sci-fi/thriller. Now the action scenes are done fairly well and done so with good direction. The direction of this film is done fairly well. The acting is done fairly well here. The star of the film here is Sylvester Stallone whom I never saw as a great actor but after watching this film, I am aware of his acting capabilites. He acts well when he speaks dialouge and when there isn't any dialouge. A lot of what we see of Rambo is where he is not talking and is interesting because I was able to know what he was thinking without any dialouge. The cinematography is pretty amazing. This film was made on a small budget but when you look at this film you may think that the budget was at least double. The whole natural filter works well with this film as the setting is in a wooded, Pacific Northwest town. Which brings up an interesting point. The setting is in a wooded area. Rambo fought in the jungles of Vietnam. This makes it very interesting because the film puts Rambo in a sort of familiar setting. Now, a major criticism that was fairly common when this film came out was the fact that there was loads of violence, but only one person dies in the whole film and it is in the first half of the film. I personally do not have a problem with this. Another common criticism back then was how the story was not plausible. I can see where people are coming from here. This is one of those one man war movies but done in a rather plausible fashion. I am aware the sequels are way too over the top. I find it plausible that a Green Beret would be able to do everything that Rambo did in this film because from what I hear, Green Berets are Grade A badasses. I think making viewers sympathetic towards Rambo is interesting. The film is essentially about what people thought of the men who served in Vietnam which was largely considered to be a pointless war. Rambo is misunderstood by the people he returns home to. It is quite interesting and that final scene is really emotional too. Something that I will note but won't really take any points off for is the sound. I thought the gun sound effects sounded too quiet but then again, what do I know? I have seen lots of action movies and I suppose that all of the sound effects are different. Some are most likely not realistic to the real world but again, what do I know?First Blood is a fantastic film. It tells a real story and is not one that falls victim to being an over the top action film. The acting is truly fantastic with me actually seeing Sylvester Stallone being a really good actor. This is a film that I would recommend to just about anyone looking for a good film to watch.",First Blood
195,SPZMaxinema,Stallone at his best!,9,22 August 2021,"While it is a sad and unfortunate story, Stallone flawlessly portrays the struggles of American veterans in the post-Vietnam war age of America, while at the same time delivering action for the audience that kicks butt!

196,jdring2007,"character driven, commonly misunderstood in more ways than one, satisfying but not ""action-packed""",8,23 September 2021,"Iconic for a reason, and say what you will about its many sequels, this serves as a great ""origin story"" if ever there was one. And I'm sure nobody involved knew it was going to become a franchise, much less a household name for the character of John Rambo. Stallone, who was already iconic as Rocky, now plays a different kind of role and in my opinion plays it to the T. As strong and ruthless as Rambo the character has become over the years, and as he is in the movie, he's so much more; he's traumatized by war, vulnerable, and human. Having seen this already a couple of times in the past, watching it again I had to chuckle and shake my head at the beginning, saying out loud: ""he just wanted something to eat."" And then he'd be on his way. But no. He was judged from the start, as a veteran and a drifter, and by none other than a flawlessly acted Brian Dennehy, in a detestable but not completely immoral role. Despite the cleverly titled ""First Blood"" and its character's notoriety over the years as being brutal against his enemies, the movie isn't what I'd call action-packed. It's more of a suspense with action and drama, possibly even equally. The crying scene in the third act is something that I knew nothing of when I was younger, having heard of Rambo but never seen the movie. It was very humanizing and while easily joked about because of Stallone's voice, I applaud him, and the direction. The monologue itself was actually great, and very heartbreaking. The vague ending, however, I wasn't a big fan of, but with sequels upon sequels, it's not too bad.",First Blood

198,lotus_chief,One of Stallone's best....a classic,9,15 April 2004,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW** First Blood was the beginning of the Rambo franchise, as everyone knows. However, although the Rambo name was later seen on action figures and cartoon shows, and the back end of tireless jokes referring to his weapons and seemingly superhuman abilities; the John Rambo character that was originally introduced to us was complex and intriguing.  The message behind First Blood is a familiar, yet engaging one....which made the film great. Very low-key in its approach, it gets straight to the point:  Vietnam veteran returns to the country he fought for and loved, only to be looked down upon and chastised.  The characters in First Blood take it to another, more despicable level; namely picking on him for no reason and driving him to the point where he snaps (understandably) and wreaks havoc on the town. What I love about First Blood is how realistic it is.... everything that happens is in the realm of possibility; no suspension of disbelief needed here. It's more of a drama than the other two sequels; the pacing is great. Stallone turned in a great performance as the withdrawn, spooked Green Beret vet who just wanted to live a normal life and try (albeit impossible) to forget about his horrific experiences in the war (Vietnam).  You can't help but feel sorry for him throughout the movie.  He first tries to reach out to the only thing that he knows 'back in the world' (his good friend who he fought with in the war), only to find out that he's since died of cancer. To make matters worse, its suggested that he died from the gases consumed during the war.....even at 'home' Rambo can't get away from the war.  With nothing else to turn to he wanders, minding his business when he's pushed by the local police to the point where he snaps and goes on a rampage.  The last scene between him and Trautman is beautifully depressing, as Rambo finally breaks down.  It's a wonderful story, helped by Stallone's great performance.  He was able to balance the killing machine side with the helpless, sensitive side of the character flawlessly.  Definitely one of Stallone's best films, a classic in my eyes. ***1/2 out of **** stars.",First Blood
199,Tiger_Mark,This is a Great Great Film!,10,10 February 2004,"It is sad that the image of Sly Stallone has become what it has become. He is mocked and used as a punchline by more than a few comics. As a result, many of his films are seen in a less than favorable light. This is very unfortunate, because in ""First Blood,"" Sly made one of the great all-time action films. However, it is more than an action film, and if the final scene does not make your skin tingle, well, you are not human. In many ways, First Blood captures, more than any other film, the difficulty many returning Vietnam Vets had when they returned to America. They had so many friends and so much responsibility in Vietnam. Back in America, they were isolated and slow to readjust into the peacetime way of life. As a result, many were sent wandering about, or worse, heading to jail. First Blood tells the story of one American hero who you should not push too far. In John Rambo, you have a hero from a war nobody wanted to remember. However, the town that persecuted him will remember him, for a long time.",First Blood

This film is filled with very intense action and is also dramatic as well as being mysterious and emotional.

The film is also filled with shoot outs, explosions and loads more and is just absolutely awesome. First Blood also has some amazing and brilliant acting by Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Brian Dennehy, Bill McKinney, Jack Starrett and Michael Talbott (aka Stan Switek in Miami Vice).

202,sandnair87,Rambo Gets His 'Blood' Up in this Wickedly Enjoyable Action-Thriller!,9,15 February 2016,"'First Blood' follows John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a green beret who had a successful and violent career in Vietnam but has terrible memories from the war that plague his life. He is also trying to find a way back into society and recover from the hell he experienced. When he wanders dazedly into a small town called Hope in the Pacific Northwest, he falls foul of an over-zealous hick, the town sheriff. Soon the local law enforcement officers detain him and harass him to a breaking point, giving him flashbacks of the torture he experienced in Vietnam. Rambo snaps and goes on the run, hunted by the authorities who don't realize how dangerous he really is.At this point the film turns essentially into a chase movie with Rambo foiling his pursuers at every turn. Hiding in the dense woodland and mountainous terrain, he fends off the local posse using guerrilla methods he learned in Vietnam. Described by his former commanding officer as ""a killing machine"", we soon learn that Rambo isn't a cold-blooded killer. He's almost a Boy Scout, and a phenomenal Boy Scout at that, who concentrates not on revenge, not on unmotivated mayhem, but on survival in the wilderness. The violence continues to escalate through the movie, all leading up to an apocalyptic conclusion.Boasting some of the best use of rugged landscape seen in years, First Blood is an effective, if outlandish, picture that offers several big-screen thrills. The plot may seem preposterous, but as directed by Ted Kotcheff, the movie has a crude but undeniable momentum. He knows how to stage an action scene with flair and keeps the film moving along at a rapid pace. The emphasis is clearly on toughness and versatility, as a battered, bloody Mr. Stallone demonstrates a wide range of scouting skills, from building traps to exploring a pitch-black cave; he also slaughters wild animals and gives himself stitches. He barely says a word in the entire film, save for one long and laughably pat speech that comes up at the end, about how Vietnam has affected him and why he has lashed out against the small town, which has him sounding even more incoherent than the screenplay warrants. But as a powerful, silent, hollow-eyed presence, he is unexpectedly commanding. He makes sure that Rambo is seen as a tormented, misread, amazingly resourceful victim of the War, rather than as a sadist or a villain, by allowing us to look into the disturbed psychological head-space of a lone man, bent on survival.Call it macho crap. Call it mindless escapism. Call it Sly's grand posturing. In fact, call it all of the above.

Sylvester Stallone is not the super vet in this film, at least not physically. (He gets bigger and bigger as his career moves forward, check out The Expendables.) The acting in this film is straightforward and honest. The deputies are locals who don't have a lot of experience in dealing with violence, the sadistic jailer gets his comeuppance soon enough, and Brian Dennehy is the sheriff who realizes he probably screwed up, but doesn't want to admit it. How dare some drifter challenge him in his town! Stallone is the lost soul, the disenfranchised loner who returned from a war to be met with protesters instead of open arms. Richard Crenna (R.I.P.) portrays the would be mediator who tries to defuse the situation. Underneath all the violence, you have to remember that the character Rambo has done nothing wrong, and is being pursued unjustly. Underlying the movie is a statement about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the way returning veterans are treated, even today. So while the adrenaline junkies among us usually praise the action in this film (and there is certainly some worthy action), most people tend to forget this film is a political statement that simply lays out the facts and lets you be the judge. Rated R for violence, language, and some disturbing images, this film is a collectible for any serious collection.",First Blood

People might dismiss this film too quickly as it's a Rambo film but maybe thats because of the overblown action packed sequels that followed, but this film has many emotional moments. Stallone was great in this and put everything into his performance plus the music by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent. The follow up to this film was nothing more than an adrenaline pumped actioner, though it was highly enjoyable, whilst Rambo III is pretty rubbish to be honest.

208,jake-law123,The movie that gave birth to the greatest war hero ever!,8,29 June 2010,"The film that started the movie franchise that is Rambo. Although this film isn't necessarily an action film, it still has some decent action in it, and has plenty of potential for future action films. This film is more of an emotional drama, that being said, it's still entertaining as crap, and definitely worth checking out.John Rambo, (Sylvester Stallone) is a former Vietnam Green Beret who returns to the states to find that all his friends from the war have died. He stumbles into a small Washington community, where a sheriff busts his butt and sends him out of the town. Rambo gets ticked off and confronts the cop. After getting unfairly arrested and physically abused at the station, he escapes into the forest where he's hunted down by the police force and the National Guard, using his Vietnam survival skills at his wits against them. As the plot forms, it officially continues when Rambo's colonel from the war, Colonel Trautmen, shows up and offers to help catch Rambo under the condition that he's released all the charges, and leaves with him.The film is pretty much Rambo on the run, that being said, it progresses rapidly, and never really gets slow. You're always rooting for Rambo to get the upper hand, which makes it feel great when he takes advantage of the situation. The action scenes are small and rare, but again, not really an action film, and it still manages to entertain the audience. The study of the Rambo character is explained through Trautmen, explaining what makes him so persistent.One thing I might say is that the story doesn't really go anywhere new, most of it is just him being chased by the National Guard. The cause of the story is great. Rambo is irritated by the cop for mistreating him simply because he's a soldier, which a lot of soldiers experienced at that time, but after the abuse at the station and him escaping, it's basically an adventure/action film with not as much action.It's still a very entertaining film, not high in the action but definitely a very interesting character study, focusing on the true terror and impact that the war had on soldiers. If you're looking for more action, the next film in the franchise will have that for you, if you're looking for the better film, look no further.",First Blood

210,shaun98,Good for a rainy afternoon,7,18 September 2002,"No one would call ""First Blood"" an accurate portrayal of Vietnam veterans. It's a jingoistic, Regan-era action movie, shamelessly manipulative and completely implausible. It pales next to the realism of ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Born on the Fourth of July."" Judging from the setup, I strongly suspect that the source material, the novel by David Morrell, was much more literate and realistic. Indeed, as a film project, this property has passed through several studios, directors, and stars before Stallone took over. It would have been interesting to see the material in the hands of more serious filmmakers, but that will surely not happen for decades. Still, taken on its own as an action movie, it's not half-bad. You really can't take it seriously, but it's acceptable escapism that's short and to the point, unlike some modern films of the genre. (Do these James Bond flicks really have to run past the two-hour mark?)Regardless of the script shortcomings, Stallone himself is effectively cast. He rarely speaks, letting his facial expressions and body language do all the acting for him. His loneliness, instability and internal tension is believable, even if the script isn't. It's interesting to note that he's more of an anti-hero in this film than he is in most other movies. He's like Travis Bickle on steroids. The coda does allow him to show some vulnerability for once, though his monologue is such an obvious way of making an ideological point. When he's onscreen ""First Blood"" doesn't let up, but I didn't like it when the film focused on Brian Dennehy, who plays a sheriff determined to capture him. This two-dimensional character often got on my nerves. It might have helped if more insight had been provided for him; why did he react so negatively to Rambo's presence from the start? In contrast, Richard Crenna provides solid support as Stallone's former mentor from his Greet Beret days.Stallone's action scenes, while lacking in credibility, are quite engaging. The cinematography casts an appropriately cold, brittle parlor over everything. The mountains and forests are characters in their own right; even John Rambo himself is overwhelmed by their cold majesty. One of the best scenes is the forest hunt; the setting and action make for an appropriately eerie, suspenseful sequence. Despite the relatively low budget, it's still a more visually interesting movie than a lot of other action films. It's still not a cinematic classic, but it's much better than you'd expect from an early-eighties B-movie. I won't lie and say it's good art, but it's fairly entertaining and well-crafted.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by Carolco Pictures (thru Orion)",First Blood
211,EasternZZ,All he just wanted something to eat,10,3 October 2018,"Rambo just wanted one thing, something to eat. He was on his way to meet his old brother in arms (a Black soldier), and found out that he had died due to agent orange that the US Government dropped on Vietnam. Rambo makes his way through a small town, just looking for something to eat but a cop (korean vet) decides that he doesn't want Rambo there and forces him to leave. Rambo returns because no one tells him what to do, and the cop once again pushes him, then arrests him. They take him in, and then realized that he is an Army guy (but don't know which branch he was in). They then tortured him by spraying him with a water hose, and then attempt to shave him. They should have realized that something was wrong with Rambo since he overreacted to a small shaving blade, but they continue to try to shave him. He snaps and beats all the cops, then steals a motorbike and goes into hiding in the forest.Long story short, cops find out that he is a former Green Beret (one of the toughest people alive) and realized they have just messed up big time. The cop (who is Korean war vet) decides to go after Rambo, eventually Rambo kills a guy with a small rock, steals a truck, goes back into town and totally goes insane. This whole story takes place within a day. They tried to get Rambo's old commander to calm him down, but he just tells the cops that Rambo is an American killing machine and if want Rambo, they better prepare to lose a ton of cops on the way.Rambo eventually shoots and wounds the main cop, but before killing him he is confronted by his former commander. Rambo gets ready to run outside, probably commiting ""suicide by cops,"" but his commander tells him not to throw it all away. Rambo cries, telling him that he fought the war for America and all he gets is bad treatment from everybody, including being spit on, being called a ""baby killer,"" and that nobody wants anything to do with him because he was drafted into the Vietnam war. He then talks about seeing his friend get blown up by a suicide bomb from a Vietnamese child, and that parts of his leg got into his mouth. He eventually gives up and goes into police custody.10/10Great film!",First Blood

213,jmorrison-2,Very Good Film,7,6 May 2005,"Good story, told very well. What really makes the movie work is the antagonistic relationship between Brian Dennehy's sheriff character, and Richard Crenna's Army Colonel character. These are exceptional character actors, who shine in this. They are the characters who explain and flesh out the story, while Stallone acts it out. Very effective character played by Stallone, a troubled, haunted Vietnam vet, mistreated by small-town, small-minded law enforcement. These guys feel justified in abusing strangers and drifters who wander into their town; probably because the town feels exactly this way toward outsiders. The movie has something significant to say about who people really are, regardless of their appearance or dress.Well done portrayal by Stallone; of enragement and vengeance, and pain, suffering and emotional disturbance. The man won't win any acting awards but, given the right character, he can act.",First Blood
214,davidslicer,A hell of a film.* * * * *,10,24 November 2004,"The character of John Rambo became more popular in films such as ""Rambo:First Blood,Part II"" and ""Rambo III"".The character were treated like a comic book hero spawning action figures and a short lived animated series which lasted only a short while.There are not that many people who has heard of the Rambo character.He's well known through out,but today's generation would have been lucky to catch him on VHS or DVD.Back in 1982 when the character of John Rambo was introduced to movie screens,filmgoers were dealing with a character that was not displayed as an action icon,but a man who had a lot of demons within him.The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that John Rambo is not portrayed as an action hero.He is portrayed more as a man.A man who is haunted by memories of the Vietnam War.Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character's eyes.Violence in films are the main aspects in film today.Or at least one of.It's fun to watch a violent film,but the violence in this film was not filmed to thrill the audience,but to make us understand what John Rambo is going through.I have these memories of first watching this film twenty years ago when I was twelve.""First Blood"" doesn't deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects.It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real.I like ""First Blood"" because I understand the character.He feels that society is against him and he is angry.A lot of films there is only one villain where as in this one society is the villain.That is according to Rambo.Actually,there is one villain named Sheriff Teasle played by Brian Dennehy.He and Rambo seemed to clash against each other and Ted Kotcheff let's us experience these two men go at it.I liked how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are in hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations.The best thing about ""First Blood"" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill,yet,he doesn't kill a single human in the film on purpose.The killing of Galt was accidental and was deserving according to my eyes.This film is the best in the Rambo series because I understand the character and I understand why he is acting violent.""First Blood"" doesn't bring us John Rambo,the action hero but John Rambo,a regular man with a lot of demons he must face.""First Blood"" is the best of the Rambo series.",First Blood
215,troy-daniel-bush,Better than I originally thought.,8,4 March 2021,"I was in the eighth grade the last time I saw this movie and I did think that it was kind of lame. But now that I'm older I like and appreciate it way more!
It's a good example of how to make a good movie by just keeping things small, contained, and simple. Now, it's not perfect, but for an action film, it's really solid.All of the acting is fantastic. Stallon gives an emotionally powerful performance as the mentally scarred Rambo. Dennehy is great as the abusive cop. And Crenna was a commanding presence!The main characters are very memorable.The music is well-done. It sets the tone without forcing it on you.The action holds up well to this day.Most of the dialogue is well-written. Some of it is lame but you forget about it right away.This movie also does a good job at subverting expectations. Who was expecting this movie to end the way that it does? I don't think anyone. Plus, the only person in the movie that dies is Galt. And it can be argued that Rambo didn't kill him. But that guy was a jerk so who cares, right?Despite there being a low body count, there's plenty of satisfying violence and gore.The suspenseful scenes hold up.The stunt work done by Stallone was great.It's also really well-shot! There's a lot of nice long-takes, even during the action scenes.You empathize and sympathize with Rambo pretty quickly, and you want to see him succeed.The sound design was well-done, too. Especially for the time.Probably the most impressive thing about this movie is that it doesn't feel like its stuck in its time period.
There is very obvious ADR but much like the dialogue, you forget about it immediately.Shouldn't that dog guy have died?Why would Teasle leave that dog guy all alone and unguarded?The guy who fell out of the helicopter was clearly not Galt. The guy had more hair and his hair was dark.There is no way Rambo can fall into that tree from that height and just walk away with a scratch. I will say though, Stallone really makes you think he was in pain... probably because he really was when he did that stunt.Finding that tarp was pretty convenient.How did he rig that spike trap?Where did he get the tarp for that scarecrow?You can feel the runtime somewhat, considering how there's only two environments to this film. But it's not too distracting because the whole movie is exciting.
What happens in the movie honestly makes all of this stuff worth it. This is an action classic and I highly recommend it!",First Blood

He asks John does he have no pride? Anger, shock, and sadness fill his eyes. Will drops him off at the edge of the town and what do you know? John turns around. The Sheriff sees and makes an arrest and charges him with vagrancy at best.This man gave himself to keep our country free and then treated like this. How could that be? A Green Beret and Medal of Honor winner, looks to me that Sheriff Will is the sinner.Back to the story, we have John now in jail, his big sharp knife taken to no avail. His experiences there remind him of 'Nam, then he decides to drop the bomb. A daring escape is next what happens, took a bike from a kid, went up in the mountains.Now we have Will, with all his men, go to the mountain and let a search begin. John is a man who knows how to survive, sets many traps but keeps them alive. All except one, who goes past the line, shooting from a chopper, neglecting all signs. John, left handed, throws a rock, hits the window...the deputy falls to his death, far below.Will is so mad, all of his men have failed. ""Weekend Warriors"" are what he brings to prevail. Colonel Trautman also comes in to give a hand, little do they know he is really John's friend. The Colonel's suggestion to Sheriff Will: ""A good supply of body bags"" cause they will be filled.John is the best! the Colonel says, he knows how to fight with knives, guns and his head! Will ignores this and continues to flow, even John warned him, ""Let it go"".Finally a soldier lets a rocket fly. All that he says in turn is ""Bull's-eye"". They thought they had got and blew him away. John just went deep in a cave, he was OK! Using his training, his way out he found and jumped on a truck that was town bound. After the cleanup, the Sheriff, he went home too, to ponder the question, what did he do?John in his truck with an M-60 in the rear, he was ready to bring a world of fear to the Sheriff who was so elite that he harassed a man who just ""wanted something to eat"".What follows is the destruction of a town and a Sheriff who acted more foolish then a clown. And of a man who was no average Joe, a US soldier, he was Rambo!If you do not like my poem and on it you pee, just remember, ""You drew first blood, not me""!Sylvester Stallone plays John J. Rambo, a Vietnam Vet who is way down on his luck. The story is that of survival, revenge, and in the end, redemption. First Blood mainly takes place outdoors and I found that this setting was captured very realisticallyyou can actually feel the dampness and dirt soak into your clothes as you watch. The action also has a raw and believable nature to it; nothing too over-the-top or stylish. Rambo is serious and brutal in his methods, and he simply takes care of business in a most militant fashion. There is gunfire aplenty though, and quite an exciting chase that pretty much fills up the whole middle of the movie. Then, simply put, Rambo rampages the town! The score is memorably rousing and the acting (Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy) is excellent. Personally, I could watch First Blood anytime. The book (much more violent) is worthwhile too.",First Blood

But, in a person's mind, can they fight a battle they couldn't win? That is the set-up in First Blood, an action movie that ask that question and tells it very perfectly. After the Vietnam War, Vietnam veteran John Rambo, played by Sylvester Stallone, is traveling in the United States, lonely and very quiet. In America, Rambo decides to see a old-war buddy of his that died after the war of cancer. After the bad news, Rambo decides to drifts into a small town called Hope, located in Washington. The sheriff of the town is played by Brian Dehenny and he is very strict about drifters coming into his town. Like all movie's bad guys, Dehenny harasses the lone veteran. Soon after booking him for vagrancy and carrying a concealed weapon, Rambo is arrested, but not for long. He escapes from the jail and runs into the woods, where the police soon catches up with him. Soon enough, the police and the National Guard gets involved. Now, it's a massive manhunt to take down Rambo. Richard Crenna's character is Rambo's mentor and he plays a very good role as the colonel, who knows about Rambo. First Blood has a good cast and some good action sequences. Stallone's performance is very superb. Even though he is playing a tough guy who acts like Rocky and portrays a worn-out person, Stallone's character is very well said as a man who can't seem to win anything except the war in his soul.

220,Mr. Pulse,What did he say?!?,6,3 December 2000,"First Blood (AKA Rambo: First Blood, or just plain Rambo) is a fun action movie, and probably one of Stallone's few enjoyable movies of the eighties. It's entertaining and interesting, and generally exciting right up until the end.But I'm sorry, Rambo's final monologue (About ten times the dialogue he speaks in the rest of the movie) is just a load of incoherent drivel.  The man just isn't making any sense.  I get some of the words, but a lot don't sound like English.  I don't know if it was the added effort of trying to act emotional that he lost control of his mouth, but regardless the reason, the scene had none of the emotional impact it should have, and it was mostly his fault.  The fact that the Colonel acts shaken (his lip quivers) adds a huge unwanted laugh to a scene that is very unintentionally funny.  Still, you have to give the guy credit for acting that moved by a speech that unintelligible.Still, the movie's pretty cool, Stallone's pretty buff (and he really doesn't say more than 3 consecutives words until the end), and the Colonel's character has some real juicy scenes with fun dialogue.

Stallone plays one of his greatest roles ever as John Rambo, a Vietnam vet who is mistreated by a police force. The viewer asks immediately why is the police so arrogant? It seems that the police knows what kind of man Rambo is even if it later becomes clear that he didn't know.Since John Rambo cannot live a normal life he starts to fight like he was again in that war. What follows is guns' blaze and screams of dying people - the prize what the people have to pay for destroying Rambo's life that was once like anyone else's life. The army special force soldier is a killing machine and property of the army, he's not a human anymore or so they say to him. Rambo is therefore not actually responsible for the killing and the damage he did, quite paradoxically.Rambo is pure fiction - it's not a story from this universe because it makes too grand generalizations, but it however offers us a viewpoint into differences between soldier's and civilian's values.",First Blood

We have Rambo, a seriously disturbed Vietnam War veteran.

Rambo was a movie I wanted to watch for a long time and postponed all the time. Many people who watch the series or not, know the character of Rambo. Therefore, it has become one of the legends.

Sylvester Stallone stars as John Rambo, a man who has returned from the Vietnam war. In his past lie the horrors of the war. The long days when he was tortured by his captors and his body bears the scars of all that was done to him. He comes home to find that he has no friends left. And all of a sudden he finds himself in the hands of a cop who provokes all the war that lay deep inside him. And then, having been trained to kill and destroy all that came as a threat, Rambo wages a war as a one-man army on the whole police force. One of things I admire about Stallone's physique is that he looks like a soldier toughened up and built up because of his experience as a soldier. His muscles don't look like they have been subjected to artistic and systematic development. This gives him a tough look like that of a man who fought the toughest of battles in his entire life and the body came as a side product of it all. He does not fail to convince you that he indeed is a Green Beret who has done and seen it all. Like all action movies, Stallone's character does things that are humanly impossible. He jumps off cliffs and wages war on the whole city. While that does impress you as to what a war can do to the psyche of a man it still leaves you wondering how a man can do all this. But it does not matter. Action movies are meant to show things to you that do not happen in the real life and can happen in the reel life alone. These exaggerations can be easily forgiven. All in all, Stallone manages to deliver all the goods that are essential for an action movie - a bike chase, plenty of guns, strategical attacks and a lot of fireworks. But there is an emotional element to the movie as well. At the end of the movie, Rambo gets a chance to talk to his superior back in the war operations, the only person whom he can look upon as a friend and a guide. He breaks down and explains to him all that he has been through and how he has been left with nothing, how his life has completely been changed by the war and all the years spent fighting and getting tortured , living in a place where he witnessed the dark face of the human race. A highly recommended movie from my side. One of the best action movies of all times.",First Blood

This is an anti-war film in the form of an action movie. No, this film should not be confined to the framework of an anti-war film. What can I say? There are a lot of great films about what happened to soldiers in the Vietnam War, when he came back but I think this wild film is the best of them.",First Blood

Little does her realise that he has set in motion, a catastrophic series of events. The vagrant in question is in fact John Rambo, congressional medal of honour winner and Vietnam war hero. Responding to the harassment of his captors with sudden ferociousness, Rambo makes a daring escape from the small time jail, steals a motorcycle and roars off to the shelter of the nearby mountains. As the manhunt begins Rambo is in his element preparing himself for a ONE MAN WAR.This film stars: Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna & Brian Dennehy.

243,cwbellor,Rambunctious!,10,14 October 2014,"Before Rambo turned righteous Reaganista and became a quasi- patriotic icon, he was simply a misunderstood vet trying to readjust to post-muddyblood life. On a similar note, before CSI guy David Caruso was an ice cold, pun-peddling alpha man, he was little more than a Joe Ginger nobody who followed the more blood-thirsty cops into battle. Rambo rolls into a small pacific northwest town with olive skin and a green jacket. The problem is that this town is obviously of German Irish stock and Rambo's look is a little too Mediterranean for these Kraut Paddy cops. Nevertheless, they decide to show Rambo some good ole' northwest hospitality and try to give him a bath at the police station. Unfortunately, Rambo is in no mood for bacon burn. He resents the spa treatment and rams his way out of the pig pen. He does a John Conner and speeds away on a dirt bike only to wipe out when he tries to go up a hill. Then it's off to the woods where nature boy Rambo lays a beatdown on these hicks and Caruso can supply no pun for the violent maelstrom of mud and blood that ensues. The country cops decide that they're gonna hunt Rambi like he's Bambi and things get downright rambunctious and dirty as this veteran shows the tan shirts that he has feelings. Even after politely asking them to ""let it go,"" they decide it's time to call in the big guns. Enter a rabble of trigger happy weekend warriors representing the national guard of lard. And after Rambo goes caveman, these guys are ready to bury him in his new underground dwelling.It's wham, bam, thank you Nam as things go boom, dogs get dead, baby boomer bastards fly out of helicopters and Stallone sews himself a shirt.",First Blood
244,darrenbjones,Frankenstein's soldier.,7,20 April 2020,"The Rambo series of films is now known as macho action films where a one man killing machine takes on incredible odds to protect people. It's a far cry from the original movie which was a far more nuanced and complex film than it is often given credit for.In First Blood, John Rambo is a disenfranchised Vietnam veteran suffering from PTSD. He returns to an America he no longer knows. His friends are all dead, he can't get work and rather than looking at his military service with pride, he is instead confronted by an America which at various times hates and fears him while always feeling shame over his existence. When small town Sheriff Teasle escorts him out of town to keep troublemakers and vagrants away, Rambo has finally had enough of being hated and pushed away.Unfortunately a combination of police brutality and his own PTSD creates a violent cocktail that puts him and local and state forces on a headlong collision with each other. When Colonal Sam Trautman (Rambo's former commanding officer) arrives, too much hurt and ego has happened and neither side is willing to back down.Rambo starts out as the victim and we're cheering as he uses violent but non lethal methods to warn away his pursuers. Soon enough though things have changed and our response to him becomes a lot more complex as Rambo's revenge turns into a one man war that can only end in tragedy for the mainly innocent inhabitants of the small town of Hope.There is a lot of symbolism in this film, Rambo becomes less human and more machine (or monster) as the film goes on. A war machine created by Uncle Sam (represented by Colonel Sam) for killing that has been forgotten by its creators and is now unleashed upon the citizens it was created to protect. Stallone viewed Rambo as Frankenstein's Monster, created and then abandoned by Frankenstein (The US military) and it's easy to see the similarities as his rage and abandonment threatens to destroy the 'villagers' who fear him.It's a great film and Stallone's involvement apparently trimmed an unwieldy and exposition heavy three hour run time down to the tight drama we have today. His final speech as he breaks down in the Police Station is powerful as he seeks understand and forgiveness from his creator (Trautman). Unlike the Monster in Mary Shelley's classic he receives it and there is the hope of redemption at the end.Ultimately throughout the series Rambo doesn't find the peace he desperately seeks, instead he finds new meaning through channeling his violent nature and skills to do some good. He is a monster and this is his creation story.",First Blood

The film is well done indeed. I don't agree about most people feelings for Stalone (as actor). I don't believe he's a good actor; that's why the film isn't a masterpiece but ""just"" a very good film.

250,tallguy62,Great film in many ways,10,30 December 2004,"This movie is one of the few Hollywood action flicks that really ""works."" I will not pretend to admit that Stallone is much of an actor (he really isn't very impressive), but we have a good script, good action, brilliant soundtrack and great sets.The movie is interesting on several levels. First, Brian Dennehy and his idiot deputies actually DO portray how police officers behave when they get too much power. They go crazy. Why do they do it? Because they have the power to lock up people and use weapons. Having had personal experience with police officers, I have seen this before. One of the reasons this movie is so good is because Brian Dennehy is brilliant as an actor. He truly can play anything -- and this role shows him at his best (although his character is unlikeable). He carries the movie.Similarly, Richard Crenna is nothing short of brilliant in this movie. His acting ability is flawless. I have never seen him give a bad performance, and he truly shines to keep the movie entertaining. His scenes with Brian Dennehy really make you want to know what is going to happen next.So, even though Stallone is marginal at best, the other actors in this film really make it worth watching.Next, we have an absolutely brilliant soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith. This movie has a lot of running in it, and Goldsmith has always been a master at chase scenes. Truly, this is one of Goldsmith's BEST soundtracks because it is so riveting and full of life. The music makes Stallone's character come alive on screen.Last, this film was shot in the Canadian woods. The scenery and sets are stunning!

253,DaRick89,"The first of the Rambo series is also the best - First Blood is a good action and survival film, but it has notable faults",7,30 March 2006,"First Blood is a good, albeit largely forgotten, action and survival film. Nowadays, when people think of Rambo at all, a M60-toting teeth-baring, Commie killing tank comes to mind. This only comes to pass in the last two Rambo films, which were either mediocre (Rambo II) or poor (Rambo III). First Blood, however, surprised me greatly. I expected this film to kick off the modern Rambo legacy which lives on in the minds of many teenagers' today. Instead, I got a film which was more about survival than about pure action. A lot of the time, we see Rambo prowl through the jungle in a game of cat-and-mouse, being stalking and stalked by a few unwitting cops. We observe Rambo's incredible resourcefulness, as he uses all things available to him to create ingenious booby traps for his enemies while subsisting on things that ""would make a billy goat puke"". (He even uses a paper sack as a shirt!)Anyway, now on to why John Rambo is prowling through the jungle. He does not prowl through there because he wants to - no my friend, the 'system' is out to get him. (Where have I heard this excuse before?) You see, Rambo is a war hero of the highest order. After walking into a small town, the local sheriff, who seems to have X-ray vision, kicks Rambo out again. After walking back, Rambo is arrested for vagrancy. This is a ridiculous plot hole, as you cannot arrest anyone for being a 'suspected' vagrant, particularly if you have not seen the guy before. The plot mostly consists of hide-and-seek games between Rambo and said Sheriff; other than an interesting twist at the end, there is not much to it. I also do not understand why you would aggressively pursue someone for an offence as minor as vagrancy.However, the hide-and-seek games are enthralling to watch, due to the eerie music score which always seems to resonate in the background. I knew what would happen at the end, due to my prior experience with Rambo II, but the uninitiated will not guess what will happen until Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Samuel Trautman, arrives on the scene, 'to save the cops from Rambo'. At this point, First Blood has already firmly established itself as a survival movie, but up to this point, there has not been a lot of action. This quickly changes, as Rambo, who is by now 'on the edge', goes into town and blows a couple of buildings up real good. He also does everything possible to damage the town, including shooting up the police station. In the police station, his mission comes to an end...one way or another.One of First Blood's main failings is it's construction of the main character, John Rambo, who, on first glance, is seen to be terrorising a few cops. Rambo appears to be little more than an uncultured thug, which is why I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I could not for the life of me understand why Rambo was attacking a few decent cops who were merely following orders from a fanatical, obsessive Sheriff. Another failing is it's dodgy moral stance: that people who served in the Vietnam War are all schizophrenics and psychos and as such should be hunted down. The construction of Rambo could more or less be put down to the performance of the lead actor, Sylvester Stallone. Let's face it, when he plays anyone who has a deeper personality than that of a heroic muscle-man, he usually sucks. Thankfully, he utters precious few lines until the end, when he goes into a rant about Vietnam. The rant has absolutely no effect due to his lack of coherence. Luckily, he is backed up well by Richard Crenna, who plays Trautman with remarkable assurance, along with Bill Dennehy, who attacks the role of the local Sheriff with aggression, as he should, given that the Sheriff is an authoritarian character.Anyway, I have said enough. First Blood is a good action and survival film which has largely been forgotten, due to the omnipresent insanity of the two films which followed it. It is not what I would call excellent: it's plot and moral stance are both dubious and this is quite telling. It is still, however, above average and better than many action movies going around today. If possible, make sure you see it before seeing the other two, otherwise it loses some of its sting.3.5/5 stars",First Blood
254,amraampk,"John Rambo,, a man pushed too far",10,9 February 2007,"this movie takes u to the events in the life of a Vietnam vet John.j.Rambo who is back to his own country after having a disturbing and haunting experience in Vietnam. Here he wanted to meet his last surviving old buddy , but is met with utter dismay and dejection to learn that his last friend from his military days has also passed away due to cancer. saddened by the news , Rambo walks in into a nearby small town where he s met by the local sheriff will teasle. Teasle didn't like the presence of Rambo in the town and drops him out of the town , but Rambo tries to walk in back as he didn't committed any crime. Teasle arrested him on the charges of vagrancy , resisting arrest and carrying a concealed weapon. He then delivers Rambo to his deputy galt, who was more overslept than his senior and friend. when he along with his deputies started to brutalize Rambo, the haunting memories of torture and persecution in the p.o.w camp in nam revealed back to him only to make him remind that he s back again where he started and these people are also like the same vietkong and n.v.s which he encountered there. At one time when they forcefully try to shave him , Rambo have had enough of that and begins to retaliate with force. He escapes to nearby mountain side in the forest. When he is spotted , galt tries to kill him but is killed accidentally. This makes teasle more aggressive and infuriated. He and his fellow officers kept on pursuing Rambo in the jungle regardless knowing about his outstanding military record, his fight skills and guerrilla warfare techniques. Instead they are easily stalked , trapped and overpowered by the man they were pursuing. Rambo let them live and Scot free by injuring them in the traps laid down by him. Now the sheriff calls for assistance from the state police and a few army national guards men. At the same time colonel paul.s.trautman arrives on the scene who had trained and recruited Rambo in Vietnam.I saw this movie some 24 yrs ago , the 2nd of stallone after rocky 3 and stallone again fascinated me very much as he did in rocky. He portrayed an excellent character of of a disgruntled war veteran who is now at war with his country fellowmen and also at war with his own self for what he got by spilling his blood and an important time of his life on a foreign soil just for his nation. In this movie i liked the scenes of Rambo deliberately jumping form a very high cliff in order to save his life from galt ' s bullets. The other one in which trautman tells teasle,"" you send that many against him, don't forget one thing , a good supply of body bags. The one in which Rambo remembers of being given a knife cut in prison camp when he is tried the same tactic by local policeman. And the end when Rambo is met by his former commanding officer trautman and their is argument between them, Rambo openly speaks about the humiliation and misbehavior of his own people then he breaks down and sheds into tears remembering his friends, narrating down his horrific experiences of war. This the best in all 3 sagas in Rambo trilogy. In the end the single song in movie sound track itself speaks the language of the film. The plot and acting are better than its successor films. I would recommend this movie to all stallone fans , especially Rambo lovers. This is an action flick with a better concept and understanding",First Blood
255,sharkattack1978,First Blood was only the start of it....,10,21 February 2008,"Back in the 80's, a film was released that would change the way action movies felt. The film was First Blood and it made a little known actor called Sylvester Stallone into an international action star.Based on a novel about a disgraced and out of place Vietnam veteran by David Morrell, First blood tells the story of John J. Rambo who returns to America after a torturous tour of duty in Vietnam. His friends are gone, killed in action and he returns to a world where he is treated like either an alien or a criminal by the Police force. You see he's an outsider and they really don't like outsiders. Thus follows a brutal and torturous assault on Rambo by them. I felt that as i was watching the film, they were just as brutal as the Cong were in Vietnam. Finally something snaps and Rambo becomes a one man army who no-one can control. When push come to shove, Rambo has no mercy. he becomes unhinged and unstoppable. Relentless in his goal he will destroy anything or anyone who gets in his way (or severely hurt them if they're lucky). If you pose a threat, prey Rambo never comes for you. There is a poignant message in First Blood. Rambo is one of the many Vietnam war Veterans (whether fiction or factual) who returned after slugging their guts out fighting a losing battle that was the Vietnam war. Only to return unappreciated, unwelcome and unheard even ignored. The ones who lost their limbs or worse for a war no-one cared about. What hell these people must have gone through. I mean it makes you think, What was the whole point of fighting for a country that never cared? Why bother risking your life and body on the line only to have your neighbour spit back in your face and not give a damn? I have always felt sorry about these people since i decided to research the Vietnam war, it was a horrifying time. The things they did to people doesn't bear thinking about. So i was feeling sorry for Rambo from the very start. To go through all that and then get the treatment he got from the cops, he just didn't deserve it. He wasn't even hurting anyone for the first half of the movie, THEY were hurting him. I never felt sorry for the cops at all in this film, as far as i was concerned they deserved everything they got. They didn't deserve my pity, they bought on themselves. They really made angry off a vicious one man army so basically justice was served.First Blood contains great performances from Richard Crenna as Col. Trautman, Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, David Caruso (who found fame in NYPD Blue and CSI Miami) as a wet behind the ears deputy and of course Sylvester Stallone as the main character who became a hero to Vietnam vets and the American citizens by playing John J.

259,Celluloid_Fiend,"A War Doesn't End, Just Because The Battle Has!",9,23 October 2019,"A lot of people would likely classify this film as an ""action movie."" While there is certainly some great action sequences to be found here, it is really so much more than that. ""First Blood"" is something more than the typical shoot 'em up action epic, as it has the undertones of some very definite political themes and societal messages that most mere ""action movies"" never do.Aside from Rocky Balboa, John J. Rambo is without question the most iconic character in Sylvester Stallone's long career. And of the two, he is certainly the more emotionally complex. A man of deep loyalties and convictions, he is also easily able to shun aside the moralities of the supposed civilized world and, when provoked, become little more than a killing machine. It is this duality of a man who simply wants a quiet place for himself in the world, yet who is capable of committing some of the most outrageous acts of violence ever seen, that is what make the character so compelling.But it isn't simply Sly's performance as Rambo that gives the film such resonance. Equally adding the this potent dramatic brew are veteran actors Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. While Sly spends most of the film running through forests and slogging through tunnels, the interaction between Dennehy and Crenna's characters brilliantly encapsulate the clash of political views at the story's core.As noted the action scenes are very well done here. They almost make you believe that Rambo could single-handedly take down an entire town. They never go too far, or become too outlandish, with things. They keep it feeling just realistic enough to add the much needed tension for the inevitable showdown at the film's end. Adding to this is the stellar musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which is just the perfect compliment to the story unfolding. It never distracts you from what's occurring on screen and, in fact, enhances the emotions of the situations even more. Just what any good score should do.What more can be said about this film, that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? The film would create a cultural icon that would embody the decade of the 80's, as well as inspire sequel films for over 20 years. But while those sequels would easily up the ante in terms of non-stop action, they would never attain the same level of emotional drama that this film does. ""First Blood"" was a film that asked a lot of hard questions about a war, and it's aftermath, that had no easy answers. And that, above all else, is what makes it more than merely ""another 80's action movie."" It makes it a classic!",First Blood

The situation escalates and Rambo escapes into the nearby wilderness to start a one man war against them.Although many people may think of Rambo as some guy who walks around with a machine gun and blasting away everything in sight, this film is certainly not that. It is a tale of a mentally unstable man pushed to the limits and unfortunately for his enemies, killing is what he does best. What is great about the conflict between Rambo and the police is that you can't really point a finger at someone who you can easily blame. Both helped escalate the situation into what it turned into and the film isn't a black and white good versus bad story but both sides have their reasons for doing what they do. Its also a very realistic film with no over dramatization and it is also very brutal.The film, directed by Ted Koetscheff is quite well directed. Good use is made of the beautiful scenery. The action isn't over the top but very in your face and brutal.

Rambo as a character was fantastic in this film, and Stallone played him very well in this film. I don't like how in later films in the series, he just became this unkillable badass that just killed anyone who crossed him. Here, that's not the case. Here, you see a PTSD afflicted war vet who's essentially being criminalized and hunted down by an overzealous sheriff and a local police department.

266,gillies,More Relevant TODAY than in 1982,9,12 August 2006,"Well, the movie just finished up about 60 seconds ago, and i decided to comment on it. This is the second time I have seen this movie. The first Rambo movie that I saw was ""RAMBO II"".There are two ways to see this movie. The first is to not take the premise seriously, to see it as a mindlessly violent movie, and to miss the point. I suspect that people rating the movie below 7 see it this way. This was not the intent of the first movie, although RAMBO II and RAMBO III were certainly mindlessly violent movies.This movie is about rejection, loneliness, and post-traumatic shock syndrome suffered by Veterans, all Verans. The movie is particularly relevant today, as we fight a needless war about NOTHING AT ALL in IRAQ. We will have many citizens coming home with the mindset of Rambo, and many of them will be shunned for ""Losing this War"" which was never win-able.Rambo plays an outsider, visiting a town to see an old friend who is no longer there. In many ways, this movie is like a Western, where an unwanted stranger comes to visit an insular town. The Police Chief is the protagonist, and takes an instant dislike to Rambo, for no apparent reason. He participates in physical and psychological abuse, takes Rambo into custody, allows his lesser offices to ""Beat Up"" upon Rambo. Of course, Stallone escapes, and like a one-man tank he single-handedly DESTROYS the town, and is finally cornered. While cornered by the Police, he is talked down by his CO, who returns from Fort Bragg to help stabilize the situation.I cannot believe we involved in another war like this - two in my lifetime is simply TOO MUCH.9 STARS.",First Blood

268,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,John Rambo as John Brown,10,2 December 2020,"First Blood is the story of one of the 20th century's most compelling freedom fighters. The film opens with John Rambo's cockeyed optimism after finally reaching the long-lost address of his Vietnam War buddy Delmar Berry. Sadly, Rambo is informed by a Berry family member (ridiculously not credited anywhere I could find) that Delmar died from Agent Orange-linked cancer. Rambo digests the tragic irony of his Black comrade being killed by his government's negligence all while fighting on behalf of that same government as it failed to protect his civil rights at home.After defeatedly hiking away from the beautiful Berry homestead, Rambo is accosted by small-town sheriff Will Teasle. Again Rambo slowly comprehends what Delmar Berry must have endured in this same town. After all, if this is how they treat a white man...Clearly bigoted deputy Galt is so deprived of opportunity to abuse Black people in the lily-white town that he even says to a white maintenance man ""Hey there Leroy, sling that paint, boy!"" which Rambo hears with rising horror. Re-enacting the Birmingham fire hose torture in the town jail cell, the deputies continue to punish Rambo, possibly aware that he had been at the Berry property.Finally the skilled veteran drops his self-restraint and fights back, which then leads to Galt showing his true colors by firing wildly at Rambo every chance he gets, either on a populated town street or with Rambo clinging to the side of a gorge.Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five summed up the scene with their classic track The Message, also released in 1982.""...

Sylvester Stallone, the most entertaining actor in America, gives a great performance as John Rambo, an unstable Vietnam vet who must fight for his life when a small town Sheriff pushes him too far.

270,colm-hearne365,Sylvester Stallone's best movie ever!,9,9 October 2015,"I loved this action flick and I'm not even a big fan of Sylvester Stallone (I prefer Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger). I mean the only movies that I like by him are this, the first Rocky and The Expendables (particularly the second one). But if Stallone starred in movies more like First Blood than just cheesy action movies more about violence than a story, I would watch them more. It tells the story of John Rambo, a veteran who is a former member of elite group of soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War. He is still traumatized from his war experience and doesn't have a home or any friends (since all the other elite solders are dead). Sheriff Teasle then arrests him for vagrancy. But when things get out of hand, Rambo flees and starts terrorizing everything that stands in his path (even without killing them). But his former commander, Colonel Sam Trautman tries to talk some sense into him and stop from what he's doing. Not only is this one of Stallone's best movies, but it also helped the launch of action movies during the '80s like The Terminator or Die Hard or Lethal Weapon. But I think it's pretty underrated as well, I mean it didn't even get one Oscar nomination. And in this, we actually see Stallone give a big emotional speech about Rambo's hatred for war and watching his friend die right in front of him.If only Rambo had died (which is what happens in the book) we probably wouldn't have the silly and unnecessary sequels that have nothing much to do with the original",First Blood

272,dgl1199,Nothing is over! Nothing!,8,3 June 2006,"First Blood is based on a novel which, although I have never read, differs greatly from the film version. Stallone is John Rambo, who enters a small pacific northwest town as a grizzled looking loner in search of an old army buddy from Vietnam. After learning of the death of his friend from Agent Orange the previous summer, Rambo wanders into town looking for something to eat and is instantly confronted by the local sheriff, Will Teasel, brilliantly portrayed by Brian Dennehey. Teasle personifies the iconic small town sheriff, bullying, arrogant, drenched in ego. Teasle sizes up Rambo as a transient, taking particular offense to the flag on Rambo's army jacket, and makes it clear his kind is not welcome in the bucolic little hamlet he is charged to protect. Aside from his past in Vietnam, little is known about Rambo at this point, but Stallone does do an admirable job of capturing the psychological instability of his character which becomes more pronounced as Teasle pushes him harder. What ensues is an escalation of tensions resulting in Teasle arresting Rambo, ostensibly for nothing more than challenging his authority to dictate who can come and go in his one horse town.After his arrest, Rambo is treated brutally by the local deputies. Each is eager to impress the sheriff and lack the moral and intellectual capacity to function outside of their little world. They see Rambo as an opportunity to reaffirm their own power over someone who clearly, by virtue of his size and self confidence, has power over each of them. Their tactics to subdue and interrogate Rambo border on torture which pushes Rambo over the edge, setting off the warrior instinct he cultivated in Vietnam. He quickly overpowers the deputies, and Teasle, and effects an escape into the nearby mountains. It is here where Rambo sets the stage for his one man war, on his own terms.After igniting this firestorm, and after Rambo proves more than a match for his poorly trained and incompetent deputies trying to hunt him down, Teasle learns who Rambo really is, and what he has just gotten himself into. Rambo is a former Green Beret and recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Later, after the state police and national guard are mobilized to apprehend Rambo, Colonel Sam Trautman arrives at the behest of the army to defuse the situation. Trautman was Rambo's commanding officer in Vietnam, and provides a little more insight to the man Teasle considered nothing more than a psychotic drifter. Trautman recruited and trained Rambo as a member of an elite group of soldiers. Trautman, seemingly bragging, informs Teasle just who he is messing with: An expert with guns, with knives, with his bare hands, trained as a perfect killing machine. He adds ""I didn't come here to save Rambo from you. I came to save you from him."" Several explosions, spent shell casings, booby traps, and a couple million dollars worth of property damage later, Trautman convinces Rambo to surrender. But not before an impassioned monologue from Rambo revealing the tortured, conflicted soul of man haunted by his past, living without purpose in a world which doesn't want him.First Blood remains a favorite of mine although much more could have been done with it. Stallone does a good job with Rambo, but he would not have been my first choice. Stallone is a limited actor who made his mark as Rocky Balboa; a noble yet two dimensional character. Rocky works well for Stallone given the lack of emotional and intellectual range, but Rambo required a little more depth and nuance to really sympathize with him. Stallone's portrayal comes off as a little rigid and icy, although is not unclear that Rambo still struggles to retain his humanity. At the end of the film he lets loose his rage against a contemptuous society than neither understands him nor appreciates the sacrifices he made for them. Rambo is in many respects a hero, a man molded into an instrument of perfection for a single purpose, to fight and win for a greater purpose. Now that the war is over he has no place, no identity, and only the lingering pain of the past. His tearful rail at the end encapsulates the pain of a soldier no one cares for after having fought a war no one wanted. Stallone remarked in an interview recently that his monologue at the end of First Blood was probably the best acting he's done on film. I would tend to agree.In a greater context, I think the story, while at times totally unbelievable, is a commentary on America's attitude toward Vietnam and the way it handled the soldiers who returned. In a microcosmic sense, this small hick town represents the scorn and apathy of a culture which was, at the time, confused and angered about it's own identity and struggle to regain the power it relinquished to defeat in Vietnam. Rambo too is angry and confused, yet he never turned against his country until they turned against him. Then he gave them a war they could not believe. ""It was YOUR war! You asked me, I didn't ask you!"".An interesting side note: In the novel Rambo dies at the end. The film was to have ended the same way with Rambo asking Trautman to shoot him rather than letting him rot in a cell for years. ""You made me, you kill me. You owe me that."" But it was changed, for a variety of reasons most notably sequels, to allow Rambo to live. This ending was filmed and can be seen on Youtube as an alternate ending. It's actually pretty good.An excellent film. Thought provoking, engaging, well acted and well directed. I recommend this one.",First Blood

274,Weredegu,By no means the smartest but one of the most effective return-of-the-veteran movies,7,25 March 2007,"Akin to or rather an influence on other major action movies from the Russian 'Brat' to, lately, 'Apocalypto', 'Rambo: First Blood' is your by-now ordinary story of a simple man left alone to try and survive the day in defense of his individual good cause. It also fits into the series of post-Vietnam era veteran return movies, to where it belongs together with great films that are of course in a much higher league in many dimensions, take 'The Deer Hunter' for an example. In one dimension 'Rambo' may overcome those films, however. Specifically on the gut-instinct level it can out-power them. The unwelcome hero who just never really managed to return home after all those years, comes to be harassed and assaulted by the reckless local police of proverbial Swampville. You'll identify with him even if you yourself actually can't make, say, hand grenades out of milk and chocolate. You'll want to smash Swampville together with Rambo. Brian Dennehy, playing the local sheriff in the movie, does so well in the hated part that I guess he's fortunate if he hasn't met popular fury in some way in the period after the film was released.The film's power was enough to make me check on news stories about the Iraq veterans of nowadays - something I haven't done after films like 'The Deer Hunter', 'Jackknife' or 'Born on the 4th of July'. Of course, what one reads of in the papers is possibly only a small number of atypical cases, with the rest of the soldiers going home probably not being doomed because of having been over there. Still, there was enough horror in some of those stories. The difficulty of reintegration after an extremely formative period in one's life, spent in a faraway land, having brought life and death decisions every now and again. But I wouldn't want to emphasize the perceived link between Iraq and Vietnam, veterans share similar problems all over the world. For a change of perspective you may want to see the Iranian film 'Talaye sorkh' ('Crimson Gold', 2003), about a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war (the real First Gulf War).

283,marcusman48,A long road begins...,6,26 January 2008,"I always found war movies more than a little dull when I was growing up. But Vietnam was different - a war in which most of the traditional rules of engagement no longer seemed to apply. And because the scenario was so strikingly different from what American troops had experienced before, the collective experience stamped an unprecedented - and, in many cases, tragic - psychological mark upon their souls. FIRST BLOOD - the first Rambo film - gets this point across subtly and beautifully.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is an ex-Green Beret who lives in this world but cannot be said to be truly a part of it. His sole frame of reference is the POW camp in Southeast Asia in which he was tortured, and he cannot help seeing parallels to those atrocities in the brutal behavior of some of his fellow Americans. So when the arrogant sheriff of a sleepy small town in Washington State ironically named Hope (although a better title for it, as one character in the film puts it, would be ""Jerkwater, U.S.A."") has him arrested for the most arbitrary of reasons, the prospect of eternal haunting by the ghosts that have followed him back home becomes just too much for his sanity to bear.FIRST BLOOD has been called one of the last of the ""New Hollywood"" films that raised American cinema to previously unscaled heights in the 1970s; certainly, it was the last of the RAMBO films to proudly present the aesthetic. Although Stallone - in the souped-up RAMBO sequels and many others - would become famous for his macho one-liners, he speaks very little in this film - and our experience is so much the richer for it. He allows his actions and gestures to speak for themselves, communicating to us the willful indifference of a man who has been through hell and back; the simmering fury of an individual misjudged and ostracized by an ignorant world; the desperation of one who is determined to remain free within a society that regards him as a menace; and the anguish that invariably exists within anyone who has witnessed gruesome human deaths and (un)fortunately did not suffer the same fate. Brian Dennehy commands our attention, too, as the aforementioned stubborn sheriff whose unreasoning hatred of Rambo often drives him to act just as madly as the psychotic vet he's pursuing - and yet, when we get to know him better, is revealed to be not devoid of a core of basic decency after all.Aside from Stallone and Dennehy, the movie's biggest star is the virgin wilderness of the Pacific Northwest - a terrain superficially similar to that of Vietnam, and yet distinct enough to drive home the point that the savagery of guerrilla warfare packs the same punch against any backdrop. Shot in appropriately naturalistic fast-stock photography under dismal December skies, the forest in FIRST BLOOD looks raw, rugged, and dangerous - not the kind of locale you'd choose for a family camping trip. Other noteworthy qualities include the suspenseful musical score and thrilling yet totally believable action sequences. The performances, too - even the non-principal ones - are exquisitely nuanced, bringing out authentic human drives and desires.My only real quibble with this enjoyable movie would be the dubious moral message it transmits during the last twenty minutes. After having been put on the defensive - and thus earned our sympathy - for most of the picture, Rambo finally goes on the offensive by hijacking an Army truck and driving back into town, where he unleashes all his rage - and an M-60 - on various buildings. Why did the makers of this film feel it necessary to turn their protagonist into a terrorist? No matter what the circumstances of the plot, it is asking a lot of the audience to accept a hero (or an antihero, in this case) who lashes out indiscriminately at everything in his path simply to satisfy some perceived collective thirst for carnage. We all love violent sequences, but they must be dramatically plausible - and they really should be tempered by some sort of moral clarity.When Rambo tearfully surrenders himself to his sympathetic commanding officer in the end, he ceases to be a villain in any capacity - and yet, he can never regain the status of anything resembling a hero. Perhaps, ultimately, this is the point that resonates the most with us: that Rambo, for all his feats of martial prowess, is no crudely scripted character but a credible facsimile of all of us - or, more accurately, any one of us who had to live out his nightmare.",First Blood

Dennehy is also superb as the chief pursuing officer, whose ragtag bunch of cops includes a small role for David Caruso.I really did like this movie.

285,crazychap,"Gripping and mostly realistic, this is Stallone's best since Rocky",8,3 June 2005,"In the early 1980's, Stallone wanted to break the mould of being Rocky by promoting variety in his roles. But he is forced to repeat the Rocky franchise because the other films either fared decently or were flops altogether. As a result, after filming Rocky III (which would be released in Summer 1982), he finally got his chance with a movie called Frist Blood (also known as Rambo: First Blood in a lot of countries).First Blood is an extremely dark and grisly story in which Stallone plays a former Green Beret in his mid '30s haunted by memories of the war in Vietnam. He attempts to reunite with a fellow veteran, who is revealed to have died from Orange exposure a few months earlier. So, he strolls about here and there to find some peace, but instead ends up at the hands of a bored Sheriff from a quiet town who's looking for a fight. After enduring beatings and mistreatment from guards (much of this was unintentional), Rambo escapes and has to hide in a forest nearby, where most of the action takes place.Stallone finally showed some talent for the first time since the original Rocky, as he plays and brings this frustrated and marginalised character called Rambo, an ex-Green Beret, to life. The action sequences are very imaginative and powerful, even if they were not intended to entertain. The other two leads, Richard Crenna-- who was Rambo's friend and Boss from the Vietnam war--and Brian Dennehy-- the over-zealous Sheriff--, are dead-on with their roles and give their potential to fit their parts. My favourite scenes are the failed ambush late in the first half, and the cave sequence.Some of the movie's few flaws are that Stallone does not have much to say in most of the film, and many of the supporting characters are flat, and there's hardly any back story to the main characters other than spoken dialogue. The ending, however, in which Rambo tells his boss about one of his most frightening experiences in a Saigon bar, does give the chills and is effective in sending its message without being overtly explicit.The movie became a good BO film, earning over 3 times of its $14 million budget in the US and about $78 million overseas, making it his first big hit outside of the Rocky franchise. This would also inspire to create two comic-book style sequels and eventually another one that is more down-to-earth. Of all the Rambo movies, this one is the one to watch, because of its deeper and more critical storyline, critical because it reflects a strong social connotation: apathy towards the Vietnam veterans IS RIFE. Unlike their grandparents and parents before them, who were widely revered as heroes during the World Wars, the Vietnam veterans are not viewed as heroes but rather ""baby killers"" and are widely ignored and resented by the media, the government, and even the army itself. In short, despite living similar experiences as those of the previous wars, they become obstracised, and Rambo is pretty much a case in point.",First Blood

Excellent! This movie does not get the credit it deserves, definitely underrated and in my book one of the founders of the action genre but it's so much more than just an action flick. This explores the psychiatric mind of a lost hero and how society threw him away like he was nothing. The first half is cringe (in a good way) in how it explores the privileged when a man that has been through so much is being bullied by the very ones he protected in the call of duty.

290,wlmlbl,A great action movie,8,8 September 2002,"This is one of the best movies that Sylvester Stallone did. He actually wrote the screenplay for this movie, and his talents are visible. Stallone plays John Rambo, a Vietnam vet who is more or less a drifter, wandering from place to place. When the movie opens, Rambo is on his way to visit one of his old friends from his unit from Vietnam only to find out that he died from cancer. As it turns out, he died from exposure to agent orange that was used in Vietnam. Rambo then wanders into a small town to look for something to eat. The local sheriff there, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) doesn't like Rambo from the very beginning. This was probably one of the best acting jobs by Dennehy. Rambo is arrested for vagrancy, and immediately set upon by one of the sheriff's deputies. He is hosed down like an animal, and is in the process of being dry shaved, and totally flips out. He begins reliving one of his nightmares from Vietnam, and beats up the sheriff and his deputies and escapes from the jail. The chase scene afterward is great, and Rambo outwits the sheriff, and runs into the forest. The sheriff uses every means at his disposal to recapture Rambo to no avail. While the sheriff and his deputies are searching for him, he attacks them all, including the sheriff. He informs the sheriff that he could have killed them all, and warns him to back off. When Rambo's commander shows up to assist in capturing him, it turns into a real confrontation between him and the sheriff. Richard Crenna plays his commander, and does a great job. He tries to point out to the sheriff that it would be wise to just let Rambo escape and capture him later on, but to no avail. This sheriff is determined to get Rambo one way or another since he killed one of his deputies. Trautman (Crenna) tries to explain that with kind of survival training and combat training Rambo has had, the sheriff's men are no match for him. Rambo ends up in a cave,fighting for his survival. National guardsmen blow the cave up,thinking they killed Rambo, but are surprised when he shows up later. He steals an army truck loaded with weapons, and blows up a gas station in town, then blows up a sporting goods store before catching up with the sheriff. Rambo wants to kill the sheriff, but Trautman talks him out of it. Rambo then breaks down, relating to Trautman what it was like to come home from Vietnam, and be treated like nothing.

291,Newsgeek13,One of my favorite action movies,9,18 February 2014,"This movie is one of my favorite action moviesThe movie has a well told story of a drifter that came back from Vietnam. The police kick him out of a small town and that pissies him off so he starts a rebellion getting the whole police force involved. I really enjoyed this film, for the story, the action, the characters and the movie has an emotional touch. It's very rare in an action movie where the main character breaks down. The acting is really well done and then that music by Jerry Goldsmith is amazing, one of my favorite movie soundtracks. If you are gonna start watching the Rambo Series, start off with this one, it's a good watch. it's in my top 20-11 films",First Blood
292,skullballmovies,"""Who are they to protest me?""",9,26 July 2010,"This movie remains to be one of my favorite movies of all time for several reasons. It's an emotional, gripping, thrilling tale of a Vietnam veteran who comes 'home' to nothing and finds another war on his hands. He gets treated poorly by the local police squad and is forced to act out against them. It was at first shocking to see the way they were treating Rambo, especially because they knew that he had gone through so much from Vietnam. Sylvester Stallone is brilliant and gives Rambo this well known face and personality. In my opinion, he should have been nominated for an Oscar. This movie greatly surpasses the sequels and the most recent release. I highly recommend this film.",First Blood
293,beerwine900,"If you hear someone say ""Rambo's crap"" punch them in the face.",9,16 August 2007,"John J Rambo (Stallone) is a special forces green beret and Vietnam veteran, the story starts with Rambo walking down a long road he's been looking for a guy he knew when he was in Vietnam, he's homeless with nothing to live for. a local sheriff see's him and arrests him for vagrancy, when they reach the station Rambo gets beaten by some of the deputy's obviously this annoys him and eventually he loses control, his already fragile mind is pushed over the limit and he escapes with ease beating the crap out of any cop that gets in his way. The only thing in Rambo's mind is to escape and be alone before he kills anyone, but the hard headed sheriff decides to pursue him into the mountains and thats when the skills of Rambo come out as he starts his own personal war against the whole sheriffs department and the state police.A physcotic green beret.Expert in close quarter combat.Expert in guerrilla warfare.Expert in weapons and explosives.A man on the edge of sanity with nothing to lose.all the ingredient's for a superb action movie, but with something else as well.Rambo first blood dosn't just focus on the action but also on the sad side of a soldiers life, Slyvester Stallone shows excellently how war can effect a man phscologicaly, Rambo is in pain and he dosn't have any one who understands him, in Rambo's eyes nobody cares therefore everyones against him which is why his war will never be over.the action in this movie is great and Stallone is perfect for the part, when you see Rambo running along carrying a m60 support weapon (which are supposed to be used lying down with it resting on a bi-pod) is classic. i loved how he took down about 10 cops in the woods with just a knife.(Rambos knife is excellent by one off e-bay the blade is 10 inches long).Great action, great story, great acting makes Rambo First Blood one great movie.A classic, a Icon, to be honest its a classic icon.I give this movie 9 out of 10, well done Sylvester Stallone!

296,chewbaccawakka,A underrated 80s action flick which is clearly better than the sequels,10,15 May 2010,"The original Rambo film before he became known as a one man army as shown in the sequels, Sylvester Stallone plays John Rambo who is a Vietnam veteran who gets pushed too far by a deputy sheriff who hates drifters coming into the small town. Rambo gets into trouble by not doing as he says and gets arrested, he was forced to have a shave but the knife used for shaving reminded him of the torture and pain that occurred in the war camps of Vietnam so he pushed his way out of the police station and went to the woods to hide with the cops following him in there. A fun underrated action flick which is clearly better than the sequels which I love too but not as good. Before Stallone accepted the role as John Rambo, the role nearly went to Steve McQueen (who really wanted to play Rambo), Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino (who nearly got the role but turned down because he wanted him to be psychotic), Michael Douglas and Dustin Hoffman. Luckily, Stallone got the role and became another big known character of his along with Rocky and Cobra.",First Blood

299,maxkaemmerer,A masterpiece,9,10 December 2009,"Heavy spoilers ahead.You might know John J. Rambo as the muscular dude with the bandana who suffers from chronic Arthritis in his index finger, thus creating a never-ending trail of mutilated bodies, widows and orphans, which gave rise to the use of the word ""rambo"" for a violent person and the treatment of the character as a modern monster (I have a book about movie monsters that has an entry on him). Now I don't know about the 3 sequels, I only recently watched the first movie, but this reputation must sure come from the follow-ups. In the first movie, Rambo doesn't even kill any PERSON. He only throws a stone at a helicopter causing a jerk-face police-officer to fall out to his death who tried to shoot him unnecessarily because Johnny had roughed up his sorry butt a bit before. Then again, Rambo has to kill 3 unfortunate search dogs who are sent to assault him. The only trail he leaves behind is that of wounded police butt-faces and destroyed buildings (seriously, he blows up a gas station, a weapon supply store, destroys a convenience store and a police station; all, except maybe the police station, for, I'd say, reasons I do not understand). The best scenes are the one where the police officers try to find Rambo in the woods and he takes 'em out one by one (look out for David Caruso as a whiny cop who gets stabbed in the leg - awesome). The ending, which displeased Roger Ebert, as I read, is awesome, too.All in all, this movie is a psychological masterpiece: a rejected Vietnam-vet on a hike through the States goes nuts when he is abused by policemen in a small, snobby mountain town and keeps seeing flashbacks of Nam when he was a prisoner of war. He makes a stand against the police force and the National guard, only aided by his former superior Colonel Trautman.One of the greatest movies ever.PS: You couldn't ever discover Rambo in the woods even if he were doing the twist in front of your sorry nose...",First Blood
300,steve_baillargeon,An action thriller to view absolutely,10,24 March 2007,"This is clearly one of Stallone's best movies to date, and I like it a lot. It shows very well a situation that happened for real after the Vietnam war: soldiers who weren't welcome in their own country and who were simply rejected by everyone like outcasts in a elementary school. John Rambo lived this nightmare, and he had his own psychological war in the film. After all he endured you can feel pity for him, and it adds a touch of sadness to the plot, which is very good.Also, First Blood contains suspense unlike its 2 sequels (who are rather mindless and repetitive action films which I less like), and it makes this movie a classic to view and to enjoy.Steve Baillargeon",First Blood

303,DamianThorn,An action film with a message and a purpose.,10,9 June 2014,"This is a film that just about anyone, of any generation or gender should understand. It's a story that's simple yet so solid it draws you in and has you on the edge of your seat, then leaves you lamenting the pain of the films main character. A lone man, home from a war that nobody understood, hated and despised by the people who should have welcomed him home a hero. Rambo finds himself alone, his friends all dead and gone, haunted by the horrors of Vietnam and left with nowhere to turn. One simple decision to enter a small town brings him face to face with a hard nosed bigoted Sheriff who insists on thrusting Rambo into a whole new war. A war on his home soil and a war that will certainly lead to his death, but Rambo sees no other choice. With no way out, nowhere to turn and no idea how to ever really ""go home"", Rambo decides to make his last stand.This is a film that speaks volumes to just about anyone willing to listen. It speaks to the pain and torment of those sent off to war, those who feel like outsiders no matter where they are and those who just want to be left alone to live in peace but always feel as though society just won't let them do it. From the comments about how Rambo wears his hair to the remarks about his jacket, just about everyone can identify with some part of this character. The hard nosed Sheriff (played brilliantly by Brian Dennehy) is a character practically everyone has run into in their lives. Be it a cop, a teacher, a coach or even a father figure we've all met or known this type of jackass. The type that can never look past the surface to stop and think maybe there's a reason a person looks the way they look and maybe a little understanding and compassion would be better than a firm hand or outright violence.Regardless, like many of us Rambo try's to move on peacefully. Try's to co-operate and even almost begs for an end to the rapidly escalating situation being pushed by the Sheriff. Other characters in the film, other police officers and even Colonel Trautmen (Rambos former commanding officer) all try to diffuse the situation as it gets worse and worse but the Sheriff just refuses to back down.The movie is so well written, so well paced and so well put together that by ten minutes in, your already on Rambos side and by the end that certainly doesn't change. I can't express enough how in love with this film I am. Stallone shines as Rambo, Dennehy and Crenna (Colonel Trautmen) are amazing in their roles and I quite seriously couldn't complain about a single part of this film. The musical score is brilliant and the theme song to the movie played during the films final moments reaches into your heart and grips it tightly. The filming locations are astonishingly perfect as well and the direction and editing are simply top notch.People can argue whether or not the war in Vietnam was justified and whether or not the world had any business trying to stop a communist takeover of South Vietnam. But the one thing no one should ever argue is whether or not our soldiers are to blame. They fought that war because they were told it was justified. They fought that war because they wanted to defend the innocent and defeat the evil of communism. In many cases they fought because they were drafted and had no choice and then, even when they could have won they weren't allowed to because the war wasn't publicly popular anymore. Many of those soldiers never came home, countless died on the battlefield and countless more were taken prisoner, tortured to death or held in prison camps never to be seen or heard from again. As the story of Rambo points out, even those that came home never really did. They came back forever traumatized facing a hostile public, no jobs, no work skills and next to nothing in their pockets. It's a sad, disgusting state of affairs that we've seen repeated again with the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of our times.I apologize if I'm getting off track and perhaps emotional, but it's an issue that touches me deeply for several reasons that I won't go into here but I felt the need to express myself in this review. This is not only a fantastic action film but it's also a touching portrait of the living hell that a soldier goes through, not only during a war but after and more often than not for the rest of their lives. To lighten up a little, this is quite simply a dam good movie that certainly should appeal to any guy and a lot of women as well. It's just an all around great action movie loaded with drama and some amazingly poignant moments. I have a collection of movie memorabilia and in amongst it are the knives from First Blood and First Blood II. I own this film on DVD, BluRay and in digital format. I've watched it again and again and if all that doesn't tell you this is a good movie, just watch it for yourself. Ditch the rowdy friends for a night (you know the type I'm talking about) shut off the phone and just sit down and take this film in, uninterrupted and let yourself feel every moment. I seriously defy you to dislike it.",First Blood

305,xx-slay-n-xx,Rambo: A Sympathetic Monster or a Gutsy Action Hero?,6,5 May 2021,"Open scene: A quiet somber town in the middle of Nowhere, USA, surrounded by mountainous forests and filled with hapless citizens. It is idyllic, if not a bit boring at times. Nothing much seems to happen here. That is, until one day a dark and powerful presence wanders into town. It comes from seemingly nowhere and it's intentions are unclear. Within moments, this peaceful little place is subsumed in chaos as the violent force tears its way through the town and its inhabitants. The police are unable to stop it. No matter how many times you shoot it, it just won't die. Anyone who wanders into the woods alone is bound to be caught in the snares of this creature and either brutally maimed or simply disposed of, leaving a bloody corpse for the others to find. By the end of the story, the town is left in a fiery ruin. Buildings are destroyed, countless people are carted off in stretchers to waiting ambulances and bystanders are left in shock by the carnage. What is this creature that you are imagining? Perhaps something grotesque and green, dripping with puss and slime, the large fangs lining a bottomless gullet. Or perhaps it's a creature from the lagoon, or an alien from another world, or a shamanistic cursed beast. How about John Rambo?In many ways, First Blood (1982) is more reminiscent of the monster horror movies of the 1980s than the action hero movies of the same era. It has more in common with The Thing (1982) or Alien (1979) than with an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick like Commando (1985), only in this case Rambo is not Ripley or MacReady, he is the Alien and the Thing. Rambo is the mysterious entity that lurks in the shadows and catches you when you are alone. He is the terrifying entity that has no clear motive other than to kill. The character that was clearly written to be a protagonist, badass action hero is in many ways the existential threat to many innocent and morally neutral citizens. In other words, he is a horror monster.I don't necessarily view this reading as an intentional eyebrow-raise by the creators. I'm sure Sylvester Stallone imagined himself as a badass action hero with bulging muscles who saves the day. The legacy of the film and the sequels it spawned are evidence enough of that. However, sometimes a work of art can get out of the hands of the artist and become something larger. It is no longer within their control. Just like how Ray Bradbury intended Fahrenheit 451 to be a social commentary on laziness and addiction to technology, but it didn't matter. People will read it as an allegory of fascist censorship and the dangers of totalitarianism, no matter how many lectures he gives railing against this interpretation. First Blood is, in my eyes at least, heavily leaning towards monster horror with the scaffolding of an action adventure flick.It's not so much about the story. There isn't much in the way of story here. A wandering PTSD-laden Vietnam vet finds himself having to defend himself in the forest against a police force and eventually a military. The elevator pitch on this one is rather short. It's not quite a mind-bender. But that was never the point anyway, the movie holds up under its own positive qualities without having a revolutionary script. But besides the story, it is really the cinematic atmosphere, the music, the tension that really makes this movie memorable, and also what makes it reminiscent of Alien or Predator (1987). The movie is darkly lit, with scenes of flashing thunder and intense piano keeping you on the edge of your seat. We never really know where Rambo is until he strikes. He lures the officers deeper into the woods where he can pick them off one by one, until finally the civilians need an army to take him down, but of course they cannot. In other words he ""Just. Won't. Die!"", an archetype reserved for comic book heroes, James Bond and monsters.The wanton destruction we see in monster horror is often random and without justification. Monsters like Jaws (1975), Godzilla (1954) and IT (2017) seem to exist exclusively for the purpose of killing and destroying. Similarly, Rambo's spree of destruction seems equally random if you view it from the perspective of the police. Here is a random drifter who comes into town, won't abide by some simple (albeit rude and uncalled-for) requests by the town sheriff, and instead of accepting a $250 fine, induces a massive manhunt that leaves one person dead and dozens injured, possibly crippled. You might say it is a response to police brutality, but is the reaction really justified? Especially against people who had nothing to do with it. No, it's not about that. As the necessary Harbinger of Doom (Colonel Trautman, in this case) tells us, Rambo is a machine designed to kill. You cannot even aspire to kill him, you can only hope to escape with your life.By the end of First Blood, as with virtually any good monster horror, our views about the monster change. Ultimately, the monster can be viewed as innocent of its crimes. Rambo is a tortured (both literally and figuratively) soul with no purpose or place in this world. He has experienced the unimaginable horrors of war, seen his friends die in gory fashion right in front of him, and upon returning to the real world, is greeted not with sympathy but with hatred and ostracism. All of this exposition that is meant to invoke our own sympathy happens within the last 2-3 minutes of the film, well after we have witnessed the violent bloody rampage. Just like we don't blame a shark for being hungry, and we feel sympathy for Frankenstein's monster for having been created and subsequently neglected by his creator, we understand Rambo's experiences and find them justifiable in some sense.Perhaps in this way, many people will be left with the impression that Rambo is the hero of this story. I think that this is wrong, and the fact that we are led to feel this way says something about our views of trauma and the dangers of masculinity, but that is a topic for another essay. First Blood is far from a typical action movie and considerably different than the sequels it spawned. It's hard to imagine that Rambo became an action hero on par with Indiana Jones or Jason Bourne, but that's essentially what happened. It could just be chalked up to our obsession with bloody violence, or maybe rippling biceps and a cool demeanor. Whatever it is, I just hope a ""hero"" like Rambo never wanders through my town.",First Blood
306,devinshee,A Good Thriller With A Hard Hitting Ending,7,15 May 2008,"I give First Blood 7 and half stars out of 10. First Blood is the beginning of the Rambo character before he turned into a cartoon character with the other three movies, but the recent Rambo movie is less cartoony. First Blood is a good thriller, I don't really think of it as an action movie, although it is considered that, I just don't really think of it as an action movie, but there is action in it. It is mostly a thriller and a drama. But the other Rambo movies are pure action movies, and they deliver lots of it. This movie has a very powerful ending that is very hard hitting, when Rambo breaks down into anger and tears and reflects about his harsh time in the Vietnam War to Col. Trautman. It is very sad, and you feel very sorry for the Rambo character, you feel his pain. Very heavy stuff when he talks about what he went through in Vietnam with his friends getting killed over there, and Rambo gets nothing but hate when he comes back to America, and he starts to go to war with the people who hate him. The movie has very good characters, and there is interesting debates between them all, especially with the scenes between Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. The Brian Dennehy character is great at being the angry sheriff along with his other deputies. I like the jail scenes where they are treating Rambo badly and he then beats them all up and escapes. And Rambo is very quiet throughout the movie until the end. And there are some good stunts and action, and some cool explosions. It is sometimes kind of violent, but not too bad at all. I also like the scene where Rambo is hunting down the deputies one by one in the forest, its a creepy scene and I like how many different ways he takes them down. I really like the Col. Trautman character, and i like him in the other two Rambo movies. He is a good guy that really understands Rambo, and he is like a father figure to him, he is a good friend to Rambo. Its really interesting seeing Richard Crenna on screen doing his performance. And I like the lines he delivers too. And the movie has one of the best music in a movie ever, it has one of the most famous theme's, and that is the Rambo theme. I think First Blood is a good movie, but its not really a movie I would watch over and over again. I like all the Rambo movies, although they do have some weakness's, they are just very enjoyable to watch.",First Blood
307,masondbk-599-80448,This time he's fighting for his life,10,29 June 2018,"First blood came out in 1982, 10 years after the book it's loosely based on and while the basic premise stays the same the book and movie are very different. in the book Rambo is portrayed as a psychopathic Vietnam veteran with post traumatic stress disorder who isn't afraid to kill his enemies and even some civilians. His nemesis Will Teasle in the book is a tragic Korean War veteran who pursues Rambo for revenge on killing his foster father. The movie however flips they're roles in the story in the film John Rambo (not named John in the book) is a victim of misunderstanding and abuse.
Ten years after the war he is still suffering nightmares from it and is portrayed as a tragic hero who only wants to survive. the sheriff is also very different and instead of a sympathetic man who is also suffering from PTSD, he is a vindictive monster who hates Rambo instantly. At first Teasle is portrayed as a kind man who seems well respected but when Rambo asks him if he could get something to eat, we see his true nature which leads to the war. Things go from bad to worse when Teasle learn Rambo was a hero in the Vietnam war and wrongly assumes that Rambo murdered his friend Art Galt when it was only an accident. I say he hates Rambo for his veteran status because while it was never stated Teasle still is a veteran as there are war medals in his office.
As an audience we sympathize and side with Rambo since he did nothing wrong and was arrested for looking like a vagrant and even though the other policemen probably knew he was innocent they decided to harass and abuse the hero until he snaps and suddenly it's like he's back in Vietnam, fighting a war he never wanted but was forced into Rambo barely gets out at the end when his friend Sam Trautman played by the late Richard Crenna talks him out of killing teasle and if i said i didn't want to see Teasle die for his cruelty and hypocrisy, I would be lying but if he did kill Teasle, Rambo would have died. Honestly i have no gripes about the movie i think it's one of the cases where the cliche that states the book is always better than the movie is proven wrong.
Before i get to my final thoughts on this film i just want to say that i think that the scariest aspect of this move is it's brutal honesty, realism, and how it's still relevant today. I say realism because the characters are portrayed like real people. Rambo isn't a buffed up action hero who can take on a whole army killing them all while barley breaking a sweat. He's a tragic hero who just wants to be accepted in society, and with police killing and harassing innocent people everywhere now more than ever, we can relate to John Rambo and that is why he's sympathetic. this movie is well ahead of it's time, making the police the villains was a very risky move and even though Rambo's fighting people who are usually depicted as lawful authority we see early on that is anything but true. In the trailer the narrator says: ""they knew he was innocent and they didn't give a damn,"" which is a perfect way to describe police brutality.
It was Sylvester Stallone's idea to make Rambo sympathetic and while other actors wanted Rambo to be the villain like in the book and Teasle to be portrayed as the hero instead. An idea that i think is out of the question since as it is First blood is one of my favorite movies of all time. Long live John Rambo.",First Blood
308,Joe-290,Very well made interesting movie.,10,22 January 2000,"The very first Rambo film is well under-rated. Do not let the fact that it is a Rambo movie put you off that its just a dumb action. It has such great film art in it. It was great in all ways. The script, the music score and the characters and acting. All was just great. It was not until the next film that the legendary tough guy dumb adventure film became famous.
A vietnam veteran returning from the war goes to meet his last friend but discovers that he has died too along with all his other friends in the army. Now, with no where to go, not much faith in what to do, walks to a town just to get some food, where he easily becomes an enemy with the towns sherrif. His appearence quickly annoys the cop and after a bit of ruffle, Rambo is arrested but shortly after, escapes from the local police station and goes on the hide in a forest on a mountain where a manhunt groups.
The story becomes very captivating and suspenseful with some great stunts. The deprest, loner John Rambo gives a great little comment on the events that took place in Vietnam. The disrespect from the government and people of the United States of America towards the men who were forced to go out and protect their country. A movie describing unloyal people.In this movie, Rambo actually doesn't kill a single person while the legend of the story is that he takes on a hundred guys and kills them all at once is so untrue. It is a good movie. Great fun but serious all the same.This is one you have to watch.

309,megagurka,One of Stallones best performances,7,19 November 2004,"Unlike the two follow ups this is a realistic and believable action movie. Stallone is a perfect fit for the role of John Rambo, a quiet man with dark memories from the war. The movie starts out excellent with Rambo coming to the small mountain town and the sheriff, which is well played by Brian Dennehy, stops him in the street. You really feel the tension building up inside Rambo as he takes the crap from the sheriff. And then the police station scene when Rambo snaps. The rest of the movie is raw, cold action and an interesting study in a Vietnam veteran tactics when hunted in the mountains. The action builds up nicely until the somewhat overblown and oversappy end.The music is excellent with an instantly recognizable track building up the suspense and action. It really adds to the movie experience.This is one of Stallones few good, believable performances along with Cop Land and Rocky 1.

Here Rambo is a genuine, three dimensional person, a trouble Vietnam vet struggling to fit back into civilian life. As he himself says in the powerful final scene: ""In nam' I was in charge of million dollar equipment. Here I can't even keep a job parking cars!"" The film begins with him searching for an old friend, something, anything, to connect with, but instead he's run out of town for his long hair and dirty clothes by the corrupt small town sheriff, played perfectly by the always watchable Brian Denehey. Even after this he attempts to give up after one of the other corrupt local cops is killed, but Denehey will have none of it, and he and his posse then hunt him like an animal until he's finally forced back into town for a final showdown, with it's intense final scene. After sparing Denehey's life, his Army colonel confronts him to end the standoff and we hear and see all the terrible turmoil churning inside this man for so long, particular the horrible experience of his friend blown up literally all over him that Stallone renders powerfully with the lines ""I can't find your legs . . .

This is the best movie of Stallone's career as far as action goes. Nothing can compare to the over the hill mix of normal, hardcore, emotional train wreck that Stallone brings to this film. Forget fancy words, and forget fancy talk because the only words needed to describe this film...""absolutely awesome"". As I sat down one night looking for a good movie I had seen this movie in the library and hundreds of rental places but had never taken the time to see the action it was supposed to bring. Finally I sat down and watched this movie and I was blown away. I had always seen Stallone as kind of a more serious actor than what people give him credit for. Once I watched this movie, there was no kind of, this is as serious as it gets. Nothing in his career compares to the over the hill in your face sock it to 'em action that Sylvester Stallone brings to First Blood. Forget drama and suspense because there is plenty of it, and if you want action well there is more than you can handle. Of you want one movie that can bring you all the fundamentals of a good movie this is it. I think what every movie needs to succeed is this 1. a good story, 2. dramatic moments, 3. suspense, 4. and lastly good acting. well this movie brings all of this and more. It only takes a moment for this film to give you some drama. And it only takes but a moment more for the incredible acting that this film brings to finally set in.

314,TheRagingBull94,An Action Tour De Force,10,9 July 2011,"Making the perfect action film is no easy task. There have been very few movies in this genre that I deem to be truly flawless. However, as much as it means to me to call a film a masterpiece, I don't hesitate when it comes to calling this particular film a masterpiece. First Blood is a milestone in action movie making that is equally suspenseful as it is emotional and a definitive moment for Sylvester Stallone's career.The plot goes as follows. John Rambo is an ex-Green Beret who travels the country visiting old friends from Vietnam. He goes to see one of his old comrades only to learn that he has passed away. With a bleak future ahead of him, Rambo goes into a small town and is immediately harassed by a local sheriff for being a drifter. He's arrested, escapes from the police station, goes into the woods and begins a one-man war with the police and national guard.With a plot like this, you'd expect it to be a bullet-fest with no real feeling, but instead it is an intense experience because of the audiences' emotional investment in the human story embedded within whilst the violence and body count is kept to an appropriate minimum (There's only one death and it's unintentional). First Blood is not about the action, it's all for suspense, character development and how viewers respond to it.The reason why the suspense works so well is because of how connected we feel to John Rambo. We witness his response to hearing about his friend's death, get a glimpse into the horrendous things that he experienced in the war and we see the unethical treatment of him at the hands of the corrupt cops. These effectively establish him as our protagonist and we really wish to see him succeed. The rest of the movie sees him put into a series of life threatening situations that we wanna see him overcome, but we aren't entirely sure. That's the genius.Sylvester Stallone gives a performance that is equally as phenomenal as his Rocky performance. Anyone who still wishes to discredit Sly really should examine these films before jumping to conclusion. He clearly is a talented actor. The greatest moment that Stallone gives us is a powerful monologue at the end in which Rambo releases all his built up thoughts. His cries all come out as being genuine. These dramatic moments are far more powerful than any sort of explosion or special effect.Outside of Stallone, I feel the need to give my compliments to Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. Their performances as Teasle and Colonel Trautman are very strong and they are great supporters of Stallone.The movie also has several other positive points. The pacing is perfect and the hour and a half running time doesn't come off as short nor does it drag. The atmosphere of every location is evident and reinforces the suspense. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely wonderful and contributes to both the suspense and emotional impact. Lastly, the overall direction of Ted Kotcheff rightfully should be commended.Whilst the series did lose its serious tone after this and just went for straight forward action, they are entertaining and they certainly don't hurt the true power of the original movie.First Blood is a movie that hits in all the right places and then some. It has earned it's place as an endlessly rewatchable action classic that is definitive of its genre. The fact that this is not in IMDb's Top 250 list is a crime. Action movies do not get better than this.10/10",First Blood

No matter how many times you view it, it remains interesting and delivers on the goods.It is what it is. Like an old Chuck Norris movie or Roadhouse for example, it is not academy award material. Its just a great flick you can enjoy time and time again.

I think this movie is a great adaptation of David Morrel's book and all around a great movie. Acting is surprisingly good and even Sly does a great job. This movie would have probably got the credit it deserves if it was released when the war had just ended and things were still hot (maybe in the early seventies). I'm sure the impact would have been much greater back than. It is ridiculed by its violence but you actually only see three or four people die in the movie (and one was an accident)! All in all I would say that First Blood is great action movie if not a great movie.,First Blood

And all the Rambo movies (except part 4 which I haven't seen). But then when I was on a vacation I ended looking in a bookstore and found the book. I didn't even realize there was a book. So I bought it and read it all the way through. Here's what I don't like about the movie. Teasle is too much of a jerk in the movie. They basically made him the bad guy of the movie. He was not the bad guy of the book. In the beginning of the book Rambo sneaks back into town and goes to the local diner to buy two hamburgers and a coke. Teasle lets him and drives him back out of town. In the end Rambo kills everybody close to Teasle. Then Teasle gets shot in the stomach by Rambo and suddenly feels sorry for Rambo. He wants to be there for him before he dies. And Rambo both die without feeling any hatred for each other. But in the movie Teasle would rather die, DIE, than to feel sorry for Rambo. They could've at least had him apologize at the end and beg for his life. But they didn't. I understand why they didn't make it exactly like the book but I would've been happier if Teasle wasn't the bad guy of the movie.",First Blood

John Rambo, I retired Vietnam veteran, finds himself in prison for some reason that is not fully explained. He escapes and is perused into the wilderness.If you started with Rambo, you will be disappointed because First Blood is about tactics and survival, not shooting everyone in Stallone's path. Just the sheer fact Stallone looks healthy and not pumped full steroids makes this movie 10x's better the Rambo. My dad did not want see Rambo because of how Sylvester Stallone looked, which undermined Rambo, in my opinion, severely.First Blood is a thrill ride from beginning to end that shows what Rambo is meant to be in his Green Beret ways, a highly trained lethal weapon.I would recommend this movie to people who like stealthy action films and not shoot em' up fans. 9/10",First Blood
320,Diamond_Dog7,Great film adapted from an equally great novel,10,11 July 2011,"It can be argued that this film saved Stallone's career. The only successful films he had done prior to this, were the first two Rocky films. Stallone knew himself he had to break away and try something new, and when David Morrell's First Blood was being targeted for a film, this was his best chance. And boy, did it save it.Despite the film and the book being vastly different in some aspects, not to mention the ending, both are gripping, action-packed, and very engaging. Stallone was perfectly cast in the lead, Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy in the roles of Col. Trautman and Will Teasle respectively were too perfect castings. The only minor problem I have with the film, is how differently they portrayed the character of Teasle, however, it worked well in the film, but I feel if they chose to portray him how he was in the book then they would have had a much better film in their hands, and a far more better character. Crenna's Trautman too is portrayed differently, but is very well suited to the film's direction, and is simply faultless.This film set a bar for all action films to follow. And also broadly enhanced Stallone's career. Great acting, tremendous soundtrack courtesy of Jerry Goldsmith, and smooth direction from Ted Kotcheff, this film never gets tiresome, and every generation will one day stumble upon the iconic character of the mentally deranged Vietnam war vet John Rambo, and the war he waged on the police, who had no idea who they were dealing with, yet still engaged battle with him, and pushed him too far for really no reason.I strongly recommend anyone who has enjoyed the film to pick up a copy of the book. It is compelling reading as the film is compelling viewing. Reading it will help your understanding of the characters Rambo and Teasle, and the battle to the death that they are both locked in. You will be amazed.",First Blood

The powerful message at the end of the story nearly made me weep. War vets come home, get booed by people, are rejected by job employers, and end up living in the streets begging for spare change. I mean, these troopers fight for our country, get whacked by high-caliber bullets, get their asses blown off by explosions, and possibly die for us, the Americans, and yet we do nothing but shun them away from our society when they return.

325,victiminvesta,Watched it second time after 35 years,5,27 July 2020,"I recall it was kind of OK the first time. Watched it yesterday with kids on BBC America. Gosh, this movie is corny! I read on Wikipedia that I initially there was 3 hour cut and Sly hated it so much he wanted to destroy it. They cut it to 90 minutes and it found commercial success and launched Rambo franchise. But man, the movie is dumb. It starts great, but it gets stupid from the moment he escapes the police station. The music, the dialog, Sly's acting skills (dead pan looks into the camera with his bovine eyes of his) are just plain annoying.
The scenes that get me - slow motion falls, and when Rambo deals with cops in the woods. Like he is absolutely omnipresent. One minute he is under the tree and a cop walks right on to him (what a coincidence), next frame he jumps on another cop from some tree, then next frame he attacks another from behind and has time to tie him up to another tree. And of course another idiot cop would walk right into his single trap. And , then the immediacy of his pursuits. First he drives a bike into the woods , sheriff pursuing. Supposedly outside the town. Sheriff's car crashes, capsizes. Sheriff gets out like nothing happened and continues on foot with Rambo still visible (he would have been long gone, why was he waiting for the cop to collect himself?). Then the search party. How long it takes to organize one? Or get a chopper ? Why Rambo was just waiting for them to come to that cliff instead of moving out as far as possible from this place. The scene where he jumps on the boar with the makeshift spear, next frame he is hosting what looks like a ham of a hind leg on his shoulder. I always imagined that he just ripped that one leg from the live animal leaving the boar running away on the three. So, to sum up, I was disappointed overall. The content of the movie after his escape from the police station feels a bit ad-hoc and contrived with predictable dialogue and no likeable characters.",First Blood
326,Goldwaterproductions,Criminally underrated.,9,28 June 2012,"A lot of people know the Rambo series as a ridiculous 80's action series. But what a lot of people tend to forget is that the first movie in this series was not a ridiculous action movie. It's a serious, dark, thriller that has a very somber tone and a sympathetic lead character. Almost everything that Rambo is known for nowadays is completely absent in this movie. From the multitude of explosions to the high body count to the unrealistic action to the ridiculous story line is completely absent. There are only 2 or 3 explosions (not to mention they are realistically done) and only one person dies throughout the whole picture. and the action, while there isn't a lot, it's realistic. Even the story line you believe can actually happen. It's for these reasons that make this my favorite Rambo movie. And not to mention the fantastic and heart breaking performance given by Stallone. Why the Academy didn't nominate him for Best Actor at the Oscars is beyond me. If you didn't like the other Rambo movies because of their ridiculousness and haven't seen this film, I highly recommend seeing it. It's one of my favorite post-war movies if not one of my favorite movies of all time.Final rating: 9/10",First Blood

John Rambo can't cope with civilian society and society can't cope with John Rambo. What little communication there is soon breaks down and death, fear and sadness follows.Despite the shooty parts (or maybe because the action takes place to illustrate the helplessness of Rambo's rage and desperation as well as society's failure to care for their abandoned soldiers) I find it a though-provoking film an could perhaps even be called as a modern classic.The movie is good.So is the book.They are different, of course, but still: See the film.

Although the movie depicts the dark side of a Vietnam Vet returning home from a highly protest war I believe that it will serve as a reminder to those who don't have to go through such misery, that war in general always has its losers on both sides.But in Rambo's case he's justified because of a individuals stereotype.",First Blood
330,baz_dennistoun,An excellent action flick!,9,30 November 2001,"'First Blood' proved that Sylvester Stallone did not have to wear boxing gloves to be successful. Stallone plays Rambo, a character that became even more iconic than Rocky. Although the Rambo character is often seen as a symbol for the right-wing Reagan era, the film is actually based on a 1970s novel with a definite anti-war message. Its author, John Morrell, was not too happy with the action hero John Rambo had been turned into but apparently his objections to Stallone's adjustments did not make turn down the offer to write the novelizations of the two sequels.'First Blood' is first en foremost a solid action film with a gripping story line and some fine action scenes. In addition the film boasts strong performances by both Brian Dennehy as Will Teasle, the small town sheriff who makes the mistake of getting into Rambo's way and Richard Crenna as Rambo's former army superior Col. Samuel Trautman. It is a shame that the makers of the film decided to change the ending of the novel.

The movie is 95% action, and the other 5% is very touching drama. It's a message mostly lost on audiences who aren't American, but the humanity of the story is there for all. Trautman is an oxy moron - you either love him or loath him. Personally, the cheese factor of ""I didn't come to rescue Rambo from you. I came here to rescue you from him"" makes me smile and makes me very happy. I love him. I wish I was that cool. And Rambo is under his thumb! He's like the master puppeteer! Brilliant.

The movie is about a green beret named John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who returns home after the Vietnam war, only to find that nobody has any interest in befriending him due to all the negative press from the war. This cold reaction to Rambo escalates when he walks into a small, Pacific Northwest town to reunite with one of his buddies from the war, only to be told that he was killed by Agent Orange when he came back to the States. While feeling dejected and somber, Rambo wanders into town and is eventually identified by the town sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who, like many other Americans, didn't approve of Rambo's presence and insisted he leave his town. The plot escalates further when he's unjustifiably arrested for vagrancy and brutalized at the police station repeatedly by other deputies. As Rambo is getting harassed and beaten, the officers show a noticeable pleasure from inflicting pain on him. As you continue to watch this misconduct unfold, you begin to crave some sort of retaliation against this oppressive police force from Rambo, but he remains docile.

340,dzsoro,Rambo is America's Shadow.,10,30 May 2021,"""When in doubt, kill."" ~ First Blood (1982) is, in my humble opinion, a concise, near perfect film. Action-packed and laced with more meaning than you may realize. Well-paced @ 93 min. And well-shot. An intriguing premise, realistically plotted as far as the responses of the parties involved, in America. And in the end, a tragic film because of that fact.Rambo is America's post-war Shadow, all our sins abroad in the 20th century come home to roost, to shock and awe us. Altogether, anti-imperialist, anti-war, a.c.a.b. Through lines permeate First Blood. Creates a meta war between two major classes of American cinematic hero: soldiers and cops. All through its run, makes you ask *why* the fight is happening. Why are they chasing John Rambo? Shows small-town cops as a gang of tyrants, who see themselves as a hammer and treat every disturbance as a nail, every ounce of noncompliance as an absolute challenge to their authority, a capital offense. They are more than willing to fight and kill over vagrancy. And they have the resources and manpower to hunt their petty quarries to the very end, with violence constantly in hand. The police want blood. And usually, before long, they get it.Not with Rambo. The lone special forces veteran, on the other hand, with his war over and full of real horror he cannot forget - just wants peace. But all he knows his war, all he has are broken dreams. Rambo does not draw first blood; but he is more than willing and capable of giving last.In a sharp anti-war, anti-police state subtext, there are no *good* guys in First Blood, there's no good reason for these cycles of violence to be happening. It's all a waste of time, a waste of life. Egos and bullets are traded in this small fictional town of Hope, Washington for nothing at all.An action flick but also survival with strains of horror. Its plot reflects how, after Vietnam, our respect as a nation transferred from the military to the police, from soldiers to cops. And so did their power raise. Modern police forces wield the law with impunity, often placing themselves above it. In their marks, Rambo is a disdained survivor going from one hell to another, an enemy abroad and at home. He has no friends, no place to belong to. A forgotten and uncared for vet. Followed orders, murdered for his state, watched his friends die, all in a nihilistic war that we lost. All for what? To get killed over vagrancy by some fat dudes with choppers and machine guns in ""Jerkwater, USA""? Awful. His fear and rage are justified. Hunted by the cops, civilian hunters, even national guard, over nothing. Rambo's abilities are transcendent, but he suffers from psychosis and is fighting another meaningless battle. He's full of loss. And yet he still wants to win, to live. And he *can.* Because we trained him to. His war is our war. We own it.What an ending. Moving and realistic performances by Stallone and Crenna. A movie about war and masculinity and death, about America. In the end, makes you feel real sorry for our babbling, broken Shadow...{If there's any movie that didn't need a franchise, it was this jfc 😂 the existence of cash grab, high octane sequels undermine this movie's whole message...}[also, Rambo didn't kill anybody in the film.]",First Blood
341,wilkins_r,A superb action film!,10,16 May 2005,"Some people will damn this one on the reputation of the name Rambo - but it didn't earn it. Rambo II was dire, and Rambo III was even worse. But Rambo : First Blood, the first of the series, was wonderful - and like some of the best first-films followed by awful sequels, it was based on a book, while the sequels were just moneyspinners. Stallone, unfortunately, went on to do too many of these sequels - and because of those embarrassing sequel films, people will likely overlook the good films that started the whole chain off.Rambo is a superb example of just what an action film should be. The characters have enough depth to carry the story - they aren't very deep, really, with the possible exception of Rambo himself - but it's an action film, not a character drama, and they STILL manage to be much more interesting people than many, with more believable and interesting emotional motives than most of the characters you'll find in more recent Hollywood action flicks.This film has one element which, for me, really makes some of the best action films work as well as they do - tension. The tension is most effectively delivered in a fairly limited environment, and you see it in some of the best examples of the genre. This film has the town and its surrounding woods and hills. Die Hard has its single, inescapable building. Predator has its forests. The people are, in one way or another, completely tied up in that environment, too - Rambo can't (or won't) leave, because he is pursued, and he's driven to revenge. John McClane's wife is in the building in Die Hard. And in Predator - how can you escape from something you can't see, in an environment that stretches out so far? The tension is driven home, because you focus on the way the characters all interact, as they're caught up in this captive environment, rather than flashy, exciting chase-scenes.If you haven't seen this film yet (and you either enjoy or can tolerate Stallone in films), then go down to your local video store, dig out a copy, and pay the three bucks it'll cost to rent. It's worth it.",First Blood
342,Nighthawk97,Completely different from the sequels,10,7 March 2019,"Rambo nowadays is synonymous with going in guns a blazing with no regard for your personal safety.And while the sequels in this franchise did basically turn into just that, the first film is completely different in tone and execution.This is a film about a soldier suffering from PTSD in a town with an overbearing and power hungry sheriff. Rambo only acts in self defense and eventually lures the cops to the vast and open forest, his preferred hunting grounds.The action scenes are primarily stealth focused, and you get loads of really creative and suspenseful moments within them.A really great film with great performances from its lead actors.",First Blood

344,ihateleo,Not just a dumb action movie.,10,1 April 2003,"This movie may have the reputation of being a ""no-brainer"" action flick but it definately has something very important to say.This film isnt about big guns and explosions, its about the horrible affects that war can have on men and a country itself.The unfair treatment that John Rambo gets from a small town police department only sets off the mental torment that is brooding inside this man's head.Rambo suffers from Nam flashbacks and war-shock, he is a man that is in desperate need of a friend and a little gratitude from his country.All of the main actors in this film do a terrific job and im especially talking about Stallone and Crenna, you can tell that Stallone put his all into this performance, just watch the finale of the film because Stallone is able to portray his emotion in a very convincing way.This in my opinion is the best Stallone film and should be watched by everyone that is seriously interested in action or drama.Check it out for yourself.",First Blood
345,forzaeva,John J Rambo is obviously nothing but a criminal.,2,22 February 2020,"Sheriff Teasle's initial judgment and reaction is to move him on, and rightfully so.For whatever reason, no matter how 'wronged' you feel, if an officer of the law orders you out of town, you move on. Being an unemployed bum, needing a bite to eat, having been kicked out of numerous previous towns are Rambo's problems, not the Sheriff's... It doesn't give Rambo any right to neglect a direct order to vanish from Hope.What Rambo does in return makes the arrest and not stating his Miranda Rights a moot point. In most states during the time period Rambo would be classified as a vagrant, he's got no business there and is asked before the ride if he's visiting someone around town to which he replies ""no"". He's given the reason during the ride why he's not welcome and a fair warning. The arrest for vagrancy is technically correct and Teasle is not bound by law to state his Miranda Rights by default in this context.Being treated like dirt by deputy Galt doesn't excuse Rambo's actions. Quite frankly, I understood very well why Galt immediately disliked Rambo. He didn't realize Rambo refused to give his name 'cos of PTSD flashbacks, he understands this as aggression further escalated by Rambo. I'd be tempted to shoot Rambo as well, after being assaulted...Rambo does not discern hostile deputy Galt from deputy Mitch either, who is courteous and friendly towards him, he sees everyone as ""the enemy"" at this stage.Judging by how PTSD'd Rambo snaps and goes on a killing spree - although nobody except Galt is killed, the Sheriff and the rest of the deputies are wounded - proves once again Teasle's initial dislike of him is 100 percent correct. Rambo going back to town in a hi-jacked truck to 'get even' is no longer self-preservation, blowing up the ammo store is beyond reasonable, it's not like he checks if the owner isn't sleeping upstairs in the same building.He then proceeds going ballistic with the M-60. The audience might assume Rambo knows not to mow down anyone innocent in the crossfire, there is nothing to suggest he does and he chooses to wreak havoc in town rather than be on his way, in Rambo's warped perception ""the enemy"" needs to be taken down, he needs to ""win"". Once again, his choice......and this ticking time-bomb becomes celebrated as some sort of hero ? Really ?I understand that Morell's novel made Rambo less sympathetic than what we see on-screen. Props to Stallone for making a psychopathic criminal more likable.I said Rambo is a criminal for a reason. This guy is oblivious about whether his actions cause collateral casualties or not. Not someone who you'd want as your neighbor and far from someone to look up to, 'anti-establishment' or not.The character redeems himself somewhat in subsequent movies, but realistically Rambo would've either got sentenced to death or been locked up in an institution for the criminally insane indefinetely.Hence, my 2.0 rating for an otherwise fair action movie.*Edit no. 3*
I've noticed that reviews (including mine) giving 'First Blood' low ratings are downvoted on here. There are additional reasons I never thought of this as anywhere near ""masterpiece"" as some reviews claim... I never found the action sequences or the movie as a whole to be particularly well made in terms of production quality, rather so-so... A modest $15 mil budget and standards of the time taken into account. I've also noticed people slating Richard Crenna as a miscast while I found him alongside Brian Dennehy to be the best parts of the movie.",First Blood
346,StormsEdgeProductions,"A spectacular plot. You can cry and laugh at the same time whilst watching ""Rambo"".",10,3 October 2010,"I never thought I'd see an action film that would top ""The Rock"", but from the word go of ""First Blood"", I was immediately thrown back at the stunning screen writing that Michael Kozoll and Sylvester Stallone (the writers) presented director Ted Kotcheff.We are introduced to John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a retired Vietnam veteran from an elite Black Ops team. Within the first ten minutes, weaved in with incredible cinematography, we are already weeping for the character. For the whole 93 minutes, we get to experience an almost heart breaking plot, portraying the cruel attitude of close-knit, isolated American villages to outsiders. What begins as a simple, though awkward encounter between Rambo and a police chief, ends as a private war of emotions and personal grudges. Although this is upsetting, as the majority of audiences will side with Rambo, it's also disturbingly great fun to watch, with the well crafted dialogue and suspense. Watching Rambo execute his survival techniques is exciting, and educational. Sort of an every-boys-dream thing. Amongst all of this – there is more! Rambo's experiences in Vietnam come back to haunt him, further causing us to understand his situation and sympathise with him, and hating the police forces. Yet despite so much going on, so much meaning, so many messages, it has been cleverly written so we're not overwhelmed by the tons of events. It's cleverly all merged to make it fun to watch! This is one of the cleverest scripts written to date.The characters in this are some of best characters written in the history of action. Although some may describe Sylvester Stallone as wooden, regardless of your personal opinion of the marvellous action actor, I could think of no better person to play the emotionally scared John Rambo that one of the most iconic and revolutionising actors in history. Rambo is so easy to sympathise with, and we naturally enjoy following this marvellous character through the film, learning of his experiences in a very emotional ending. Then we have the heartless police sheriff, Teasle, who is blinded by his hate for Rambo, willing to stop at nothing to catch the veteran dead. To follow, there is the conflict in the police department as one of the officers doesn't agree with Teasle, and to finish there is Rambo's ex-general, caught in between the law, or protecting his old friend. Amongst others, a fine serving of well developed, believable characters who all have good points to make, is dished up for us.Director Ted Kotcheff wanted nothing but perfection from this magical masterpiece, and that's exactly what he got. With minimal special effects, Kotcheff directed the cast and crew to present a brilliant and effective film, with an explosive ending.Need I go on? It's filled with explosions, suspense, emotions. There are scenes which make us cry, laugh, feel anger, and cheer at the screen. This makes the perfect movie to watch whenever. Many-a-time have I seen this movie, and I never get bored of it. Perfection. This is how films should be. You have not lived until you have seen this film.",First Blood

348,tomlauzon,The first of it's kind,10,23 January 2014,"John J. Rambo is a Vietnam veteran, medal of honor winner and last survivor of his group. Back in a small town in the USA he finds himself an enemy in his own land. Cornered by local police who hunt him down, while he hunts them. Little do they know they're hunting the hunter and messing with the wrong man who is ready to start a one man war. This film was originally going to follow the novel and have Rambo killed by Trautman, the man who created him, trained him and led him into Vietnam as he becomes too savage to co-exist in the normal everyday life of society. This version was going to star Kirk Douglas as Trautman who kills Rambo. However, in the end the producers decided to have Rambo live to fight another day. As Rambo says himself, ""Nothing is over, nothing!""This film was the first major success of the film producers Vajna & Kassar and the Carolco company. They went on to produce the Rambo sequels, Red Heat, Lock Up, Total Recall, Terminator 2, Universal Soldier, Basic Instinct and Cliffhanger. The best of the 80's action hero's were influenced by the Rambo character and First Blood stands head above shoulders above the rest as the best and most original story.

One of Stallone's best performances so much is said without dialog. This movie had such an impact on me that later on when I became a police officer I always tried my best to treat every person that I had contact with, with tact and respect because I really had know idea what kinds of problems the other guy was going through. My problem only with the movie is that he should have died at the end by the police officers. It would have really driven home the point of the film. The action and violence of this movie set a whole new standard for action movies. I wish that they would have spent more time developing the character of the sheriff. If this movie is ever re maid it should bring more of the sheriffs personal stuff into the story. and yes it is an anti war film!

350,Rohan_Jayasekera,"Rambo: First Blood, is a faithful remake of The Courage of Lassie",2,25 May 2005,"A useful corrective to the cinematic stereotype of the traumatised war veteran. Rambo: First Blood, is a straight down the line remake of the 1946 classic The Courage of Lassie. Sylvester Stallone takes over the role of Lassie, traumatised by war service in the Pacific, who returns home and seeks refuge in the mountainous north-western US only to fall foul of a cruel local policeman. Lassie uses all her combat skills to evade the pursuing cops, but it takes the intervention of the soldier who trained her to save her from unjust punishment at the hands of the bad sheriff. The key difference between Rambo: First Blood and The Courage of Lassie, is the hero's not a dog (um); the war he returns from is Vietnam, not World War II; Elizabeth Taylor. Courage of Lassie's writer Lionel Houser truly deserves a Screenwriters Guild 'original story by' credit for this epic. Not that he'd probably want it.",First Blood
351,Beaudro,Stallone's Finest Hour,8,20 February 2016,"I've never disliked but never really rated Stallone:First Blood is the only time I've witnessed Stallone perform in a moving acting performance. This is throughout the whole movie but climaxes in the closing scene where Rambo breaks down in the arms of Trautman, the finely- tuned killing machine of his labours that despite his best efforts is still in possession of the mess of human emotion that you might call a soul. The movie begins with Rambo making his way into a small town to find his former comrades only to find that they're all dead, this opening is essential to setting a scene for the action of the movie which is brought on by Rambo who becomes a dangerous man as he walks into town on a downer, having lost those closest to him and clinging to very little; he is hassled by the despicable Sheriff Teasle. Who decides to assert his petty authority by abusing Rambo's right to move freely about the town in absence of any legislative backing. Rambo stands by his principles however and when ordered to leave the town flaunts Teasle's authority and marches back in to which Teasle pulls out his gun and arrests Rambo on trumped-up charges. The character of Teasle and his behaviour throughout the film really say a lot about the creeping in of Big-Government following the Vietnam war. In the opening scenes of the movie we see Teasle leaving the station, saying a hello to all the town's people, who greet him cheerfully as he herds them like cattle. They basically love their captor, and present no challenges to him as they rely heavily on him to maintain order in the town. Teasle however soon crosses paths with Rambo, who doesn't care for his status as Sheriff and offends his(Teasle's) masculinity. The cops in this story depict Big-Government perfectly, they're for the most-part fat, out-of-shape, out-of-touch amateurs who in the absence of any real civil unrest have taken to simply picking on citizens for not bathing regularly or cutting their hair(literally). Their incongruity to Rambo, a battle-hardened, battle-scarred even, witness to atrocities of war explodes into a chain reaction of events that spiral beyond Teasle's control. Enter Colonel Trautman who proposes to Teasle to swallow his pride and let Rambo ""slip through"". A prominent underlying theme throughout the movie is male pride, ego, in short. Rambo stands his ground as a man on the edge of society with nothing left to lose, Teasle abuses his position and in-turn Rambo's rights in order to hold onto the stature that the town's people hold him in. Trautman offers sound, sensible advice to Teasle on how to minimize the casualties only because he feels he has the upper-hand in that if Teasle persists in pursuing Rambo then Rambo(the manifestation of his own ego) will obliterate Teasle and his men(which he readily says to Teasle). Towards the end of this movie as Rambo corners Teasle in the station, basically humbling the king in his own castle you can't help but side with Trautman's advice, having seen the whole town brought to it's knees by the stupid pride of Teasle. What underwrites all the action and drama of this movie are the emotional scenes; the first when the pursuit of Rambo begins and the cops venture into the woods in hot pursuit. Where Rambo camoflauges himself and the forest springs to life on Teasle and Rambo holds a knife to his throat. Followed by tears from Teasle; it doesn't take much imagination to know he would be crying because he'd literally peed his pants. And secondly Rambo's tearful confession to Trautman, who for all his showing off to Teasle is I'll-equipped to provide the emotional support that Rambo needs then and there. One major issue of this movie is the treatment of ex-vets, I'm not pro- war, the opposite in-fact. But the majority of people in western societies just simply don't give a damn either way. However, when it comes to unjustified wars a lack of objection is all the support it needs. That said, the same don't give a damn either way attitude is certainly lacking in compassion, something returning veterans are often in desperate need of.",First Blood

As a son of a Vietnam veteran, I actually felt the pain of a ex-soldier who just needed a friend.  Although muffled in his accent, the speech about ""nothing being over"" was very strong and meaningful.  Why should someone who spilt his guts for his country be unaccepted in a society he defended?  Rambo talks about how he was in charge of multi million dollar equiptment in the service but at home he can't even be offered a job washing cars... is it fair for out country's veterans to be overlooked?

It fails every moment it promises to deliver some kind of depth and by the end I felt like I needed to format my brain to try and go back to a me that hadn't seen this disappointment.One thing that came into my mind is that this movie is what fetish is for porn, as it is really weird redneck patriotism - it's like an American soldier killing American policemen. It's really particular as to it's appeal and, if there is any, I most certainly, evidently, couldn't tell.If you're some weird retrograde overly proud north American watch it, you might like it.

The horror movie staple of being tracked through the woods is cleverly reversed, although the tension does not have time to build and thus results in a missed opportunity - similarly, brief flashbacks to Rambo's time in a POW camp look interesting but are not expanded upon.

Like Rocky people immediately think the Rambo films as over the top action films. The 3 sequels that followed were like that, but this first one is an action film, but dosen't go so far as to be over the top like a lot of other Stallone films. In fact there is a lot of drama in this movie as well. Stallone co-writes and stars as a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo who has just come home from the war. He finds out that all his friends from Vietnam are dead. He walks into a small town and gets into a fight with a police officer and put in jail. He breaks out and goes on the run. It starts out like a small feud and then comes in a way a small war with the entire police chasing this one guy. This movie is completely different than what you expect. In a way the character of Rambo is sort of an anti hero. Stallone doesn't speak too much suprisily. Despite not being as good as Rocky I think this is Stallone's best performance ever and he gives one of the most dramatic monolouges i have ever heard in a film.

As said by another reviewer,""First Blood"" is a classic.Based off of the 1972 novel by David Morell,""First Blood"" is about a former green beret of the Vietnam War,John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone). Despite the fact that John Rambo gave a strong service to America during the years that he fought in Vietnam,lately,Rambo finds his life falling apart. This is something that has personally torn John Rambo apart.And then,one day,things take a turn for the worse. This is when John Rambo is arrested by a sheriff in a small Alaska town(Hope),Will Teasle(Brian Dennehey)for vagrancy. Shortly thereafter,before John Rambo knows it,his patience and mental state are being put to a test. The result? John Rambo escaping from the police and launching a one-man war against them and the national guard. The only person who can help everyone get through it all? Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna),a close friend of John Rambo who served with Rambo in Vietnam.Let's talk about ""First Blood"" on the whole. Similar to 1988's ""Die Hard"" and 1993's ""The Fugitive"",""First Blood"" is one of the most well-written and adapted films (despite the several differences between the film and the novel). Not only is the action in ""First Blood"" perfect for any action film,it is quite suspenseful. It is not in the script just for the sake of being there. It is in the script because it needs to be there. The action in ""First Blood"" works well into the script,and is only to be found where it belongs.There is a lot of good drama and chemistry in ""First Blood"",as well. On top of everything that John Rambo has gone through in his life being richly executed drama that fits in well with the action in ""First Blood"",the scenes with the action are not just action scenes. They are scenes that contain action,drama,and chemistry. This is due to viewers of ""First Blood"" being able to watch John Rambo fight the Police and the National Guard with not only his weapons,but at the same time,his mind. The acting is in top shape,also. All of the actors in ""First Blood"" succeed in understanding their characters and bringing their characters to life with their performances. Especially Sylvester Stallone. Will Stallone ever have the presence and respect in Hollywood that actors like Paul Newman,Al Pacino,and Robert De Niro,plus several others,have earned and achieved? Surely and probably,no. But,in his performance as John Rambo,Stallone executes the drama that his performance requires. At the same time,Stallone does not fail to let the action in ""First Blood"" to be entertaining. He gives it the kind of action you would expect to see in any film that is reminiscent of ""First Blood"" (""Lethal Weapon"",""Die Hard"",etc.). All of this is what helps ""First Blood"" fully come together,and make it the great film that it is.Overall,a must see-film for fans of not only action films,but for fans of crime drama films,as well.10/10",First Blood

I'm not saying Rambo is my favorite character of his, I'm saying that Sly playing John Rambo in First Blood might just be his most overlooked performance. There's a difference between his performance here and his performance in the four sequels. To me, there's just a few issues that pop up, every now and then it seems to get a little more cheesy, kinda dipping it's toe into more standard B level action movie territory(Like The sequels) rather than the serious drama/thriller that most of the movie displays.

First Blood took my little mind by storm. I must have seen it approximately 20 times over the years and I'm still biting my nails when Rambo is being tracked by local cops.Overall this is definately at the top of my charts and I think it should be at the top of Stallone's charts along with 'cliffhanger' which was also gripping. I remember in primary school about third grade playing games and somebody would always say, ""I'm Rambo!, I chose him first!"". Rambo is definately an icon as a the toughest guy ever in a movie along with Arnie Schwarzenegger.As this was the first and best suspense movie I have seen, I now compare every other type of similar movie to 'First Blood""DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, JUST GRAB YOUR CAR KEYS HEAD TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEO SHOP AND RENT THIS MOVIE OUT...

This is not a simple terrorist vs spec ops or soldiers vs enemy soldiers or good guys vs villains movie. There is so much ambiguity in the role of both sides in the movie which makes this movie more than just the one man takes everyone down show, which, in defense, is damn entertaining here as well.
I only knew the other Rambo movies before watching this. Those were nice, bloody non stop action movies. But this one...this was thrilling. And it had a Message. Makes you think.

This is my first IMDb review so it my not be well worded, but i'll try my best. It is basically the story of a man who is mistreated by a small town sheriff. Rambo starts of as a fairly nice guy, but a scarred one. He is going to live with an old friend but finds this man to be dead. So he goes to a small town where the cop mistreats him. The main thing that sets this apart from the other Rambo films is he is reluctant to kill. Also Rambo is not a ""hero"" or an ""anti-hero,"" but an angry guy who was again, treated unfairly.

378,Abhipriyo,An action cinema's masterpiece,10,13 August 2014,"John Rambo's character, played by Sylvester Stallone, is that of a volcano under layers of snow until somebody 'pushes' it to erupt.This is more than just a thriller action film. This is a story of a mentally disturbed man wanting to find solace, a man who has had a troubled past, a man who is lonely and has a pointless life and his unending mental agony.This also a film about a man who is arrogant and pushy; the Sheriff played by Brian Dennehy, who misuses his position to push unworthy people. He plays a brilliant negative role that justifies Rambo's hell flare.The supporting role of Connell Trautman, played by Richard Crenna has defined Rambo's stature. He speaks highly of Rambo, he defines Rambo as a fighting machine who gets better with bare hands, otherwise implausible and fears hell would break lose if circumstances weren't controlled.The movie shows raw action, has fewer dialogues but pungent and precise. And a deep background score that portrays loneliness. This is one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies. This is also the time when he was looked for his macho physic which also has greatly helped Rambo's character.This is one of those films which cannot be ever made again .That time, that era won't come back and such performances cannot be repeated.",First Blood
379,moles12,"A good film, could have been much better",6,17 September 2003,"First Blood was a tremendous idea, but unfortunately was not fully capitalized on. The problem was sacrificing quality to be more mainstream and make more money. One reason I say that is because the filmakers tried to hard to make Rambo a sympathetic character. Why did Rambo only kill one cop, and the one he killed wasn't even an attempted killing? Had the Rambo character been more vicious, the film would have been much more powerful. He should have killed Brian Dennehy at the end, and then had the balls to face all the cops before eventually getting killed, taking some cops with him in the process. That would show that his situation was so bad, that he didn't want to go on living.The low-point of the film was Stallone's rambling, bore-athon of a speech at the end. The film tried to make it dramatic and powerful, but it failed miserably. Anyone with a basic knowledge of the vietnam war could tell what Rambo's motivations were. Spelling everything out is a disrespect to the audience. The people who made this film should have studied Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, and take aspects of that film into First Blood. The legendary ""Let's go"" line especially.Richard Crenna's character was pointless and the film would have been better off without it. Also, too much swearing took maturity out of the film.The positives of the film were the great action sequences. Rambo obliterating the pathetic town was a spectacular finale. The Dennehy/Stallone car chase and Stallone's escape from prison were also great. However, the scene where that fat cop couldn't kill Rambo from a helicopter, while Rambo was hanging on a cliff was contrived and totally sucked. Other than that great action.Dennehy was tremendous in his role. His treatment and tone towards Stallone in the beginning of the film set the stage and rallied the audience around Rambo. Well-done soundtrack as well.In conclusion, there's some definite quality here, but too much what-ifs.",First Blood

It lacked the cleverness, heart, or enjoyable, campy humor. What disappointing me most was the action. The only half impressive or interesting action scene in the whole film was the waterfall one. The rest was boring and uninspired. The final showdown was particularly pathetic and led me to constantly being asking questions. Why the hell is Rambo randomly shooting up the town exactly? Where the hell are all of the other cops? Why did the sheriff happen to be the only person to stay at the police station? Where is the actual action? Why am I watching this movie?Was I supposed so be impressed by Rambo? The whole traumatized Vietnam war vet angle was weak and shallow. Worst of all, the dramatic high-point of the film when Rambo breaks down and lets loose on his trauma was not only tacked-on and lame, but also, thanks to Sylvester Stallone's sputtering, almost impossible to hear.

It didn't have people running around shooting guns with endless supplies of ammo and the hero taking on dozens of men at once and never getting shot like Arnie did  in Commando. Stallone was excellent as was Brian Dennehy as the sheriff with an attitude.I'd say this was one of the most influential movies as a whole in the early eighies.

Rocky won the Best Picture award, and was lauded as a masterpiece. First Blood did not win any awards but is every bit as good as Rocky. It's a lean, atmospheric film, with Stallone expertly playing Rambo. He is unlucky and dealt a bad hand, as he enters a small American town, but he's unstable and dangerous at the same time, and it's this balance which makes the picture so enthralling. Although you route for Rambo, you wouldn't want to run into him. Brian Dennehy gives a superb performance as the Sheriff chasing him, and Richard Crenna.

You will find Sylvester Stallone as the great actor he really is in action movies and this movie is made for Sylvester as he did in Rocky.Rambo is really a guy to admire as an action hero because he is one ruff guy and there is some fantastic scenes in this movie where he shows hes skills. You will also find a connection that you would want to be like him as a lonely guy who is starting hes own war in the Forrest because the police in a small town wouldn't let him in because they didn't like his face.

I wouldn't go as far as calling him the best actor that Hollywood has ever had, but he IS so much better than a lot of people say that he is. In my opinion Stallone shouldn't make comedies, but when it comes to action movies (Rambo, Rocky, Cobra, etc.) he's definitely one of the best! Rambo was a sensational movie in the 80's, but every time that I see it nowadays I'm amazed by the fact that it is actually a very good, original story. Brian Dennehy really shows his acting skills as well, leaving the audience confused whether to have sympathy for the character that he plays or to hate the character. First Blood is a movie filled with action. Like all the action movies from the 1980's ""First Blood"" also tends to become slightly over the top in the end. Still I gave it a 10/10 for the simple fact that I wanted to compensate for the people who ""underrate"" this movie. Normally I would give this movie an ""8"".

Based on David Morrell's Novel, and directed by Ted Kotcheff, First Blood sees Rambo back from Vietnam and searching; searching for answers. Rambo has become a vagabond, a Green Beret in a country that doesn't care and doesn't want him there.First Blood is Kotcheff's Reaganite response to High Noon, just as Rio Bravo was for Howard Hawks, only this time we have moved forward 30 years and small town America isn't like it use to be. Brian Dennehy stars as the Sheriff Will Teasle, hell bent on keeping the peace, being Gary Cooper. But this is post Vietnam, Reagan era film making, the establishment can no longer be Gary Cooper, the Establishment turned into Lee Van Cleef. Rambo is the one man army, he doesn't want to kill, he doesn't want to be pushed around, he just wants to eat. But the Sheriff and his establishment soon find out what happens when you stop a wild animal from eating and this is where Rambo replaces small town America for Small town Vietnam. After some one-sided scuffles we realise the Establishment can't handle the starving beast, the beast who seeks peace. So an unwanted visitor arrives, promises to help, knows Rambo inside out, taught him everything he knows, can put the beast back on the straight -and-narrow, in comes Colonel Samuel Trautman; but in classic fashion they don't want to listen to Uncle Sam, small town Vietnam can handle their own problems and small town Vietnam want to handle their own problems. The small town forgot it was Uncle Sam who created Rambo and its Uncle Sam who must stop Rambo.First Blood is action, it's gung ho, it's sentimental and at times it's absurd but it is Rambo at his best. Before Afghanistan and Burma, before the pen was truly replaced by the sword and Rambo became invincible, First Blood is a great tonic to these heady times.

This film showed fairly simply the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. It also showed a man who was not invincible necessarily, but very capable of improvising in many situations. Unlike many other similar movies, Rambo had to make do with a knife and a few rounds from ""aquired"" weaponry. His heroism is not so much in his strength, but his fear and desperation. Almost nothing he does in this film is of the calibre of hero. Of course, the crux, when he gets Teasle in the forest and tells him ""in town your the law, out here it's me.....Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe"" is his final attempt to ""difuse the situation"" and that does seem to flex some muscle. But again, it seems more out of a desperation to stop everything before Rambo is forced to go farther than he wants and knows he can go (viz., killing people).

Only at the end, in front of his colonel, Rambo has an emotional breakdown, and the gory description he makes of his comrade's death in Vietnam leaves you speechless, revealing the traumas that make you understand his escalation of violence in the film.Simple but very human dialogues, written by Stallone, who signs the screenplay as for Rocky, which hit the mark, hitting the heart, and the stomach, demonstrating the stuff of the great author.",First Blood

409,timwit-34,Rambo: First Blood (1982) Review,7,18 February 2014,"""We don't want people like you in our town. Drifters. It's quiet, some would even call it boring, and I get paid to keep it that way"". Sheriff Will Teasle tells John Rambo as he escorts him out of town for no good reason. Little did he know he was messing with a ticking time bomb. Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam war veteran who, shortly into the film, learns he is the last remaining of his friends from the same unit in the war. After being mistreated by the local police force of the fictional town Hope, Washington, Rambo, tortured by flashbacks of his time as a prisoner of war, finally snaps raises hell on the once peaceful town.What Rambo: First Blood gets right is the action. Guns, knifes, helicopters, explosions and even jungle booby-traps. It's exciting. What Rambo: First Blood doesn't get quite as right is the script. The story starts off strong but slowly takes a back seat and becomes as bare as it can be for the action to carry the rest of the film. When Rambo is placed under arrest and taken to the police station early in the film we witness him being the victim of unfair treatment which in turn results in memories from his troubled past. I feel they could have developed his character better with more of these flashbacks and even full length scenes to see his relationship with his war friends and truly understand the reasons for his extreme actions.The film features a chase scene early on where Sheriff Deputy Will Teasle is driving after Rambo who has stolen a motorcycle. It was an exciting chase scene that slowly turns from a chase on the roads to a muddy off-road scramble. I keep referring to this movie as exciting and that's really the best way I can describe it.

410,peteycoggs,A breath of fresh air.,10,6 April 2005,"I can be harsh about a lot of things, but not this movie. By far one of Stallone's best performances, with Sly becoming a battered vet who you must emphasize with. John Rambo is a truly tragic hero, who is desperately tring to find peace in a world where men like him are disrespected and hated. The police see him as a vagabond, a shiftless reminder of all the things that are wrong with their society. Trautman considers him a failed project, indeed it is his grief more that Rambo has been caught up in this war with the authorities than that the man himself is struggling with demons of the mind.

411,smithtg83,Meet John Rambo,9,18 July 2014,"When Rambo came out in 2008, everyone rediscovered the franchise and quickly crowned the newest installment as ""the best Rambo movie ever"". Now that a few years have gone by, the name John Rambo has again fallen out of the mainstream consciousness. This is good for the people who never saw the original trilogy, because they can now discover it without suffering from popularity bias. I have always held the opinion that First Blood was by far the best John Rambo movie. It had the best story, the action was believable, the character development was good, and the acting wasn't ""phoned in"". The same can't be said for any of the other movies in the franchise. First Blood came along before the franchise devolved into a modern action movie. If you pay attention you'll realize that Rambo is trying NOT to kill any of his pursuers. The fun is knowing that he easily could, but chooses not to. Instead he eludes them using his Green Beret training, embarrassing them in the process. In the later movies it's just about explosions and body count. If you haven't seen First Blood, then you haven't met John Rambo.",First Blood
412,ramos-alexandre98,First Blood Review (Spoilers... Maybe),7,11 March 2016,"First Blood ReviewFirst Blood is an action movie that came out in 1982. This movie follows the story of John Rambo, a Green Beret who is pursued in the woods by the police force from a small town. In my opinion I think that First Blood is a pretty good movie. Although many people seem to think this movie is a prime example of 80's action cheese. I can agree with that, but I think that this movie has a much deeper meaning to it than explosions witty dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, there really isn't much dialogue in this movie. John Rambo is a very quiet person who is only doing what he has to do to survive. He speaks with his actions telling everyone to back off, as he is truly more skilled in the art of combat then the police officers are. I think that is what sets this movie apart from something like Commando or The Terminator is the main character. The 80's were a great time for action movies as they really developed into what they are today. But First Blood had something different. The character John Rambo was a Green Beret in the Vietnam War. He was scarred with the things he went threw. This really gave the character a, not-exactly relatable character as many of us have never been in a war, but relatable as in the sense that he had human emotions and was a flawed and hurt human. This humanized the film for me and made the experience that much better.Now although the movie Is really good I still think that it has it's fair amount of cheesiness throughout. For the most part I really only found myself on the edge of my seat when the action was set in the woods. The first time the police officers are ambushing Rambo and they are getting taken down left and right really gave me a rush. This ONE MAN was destroying everyone. I think that sense of epic action really dies out around the end of the second act and the beginning of the third act. By that time Rambo was just a ramped machine that was destroying everything, and that's where I think the movie was a little disappointing. Some of the action sequences were a little underwhelming during this time and I felt that the movie's pace lacked a little for me. However the closing sequence to the film where Rambo is in the city and is running around with a machine gun really brought back that action I was looking for. Although it was not balls to the wall action it was well paced and suspenseful. Watching the sheriff running around on the roof while he frantically looked for Rambo was very suspenseful. The Final thing, which I think really made this movie excel, was again John Rambo. By the end of the third act we find out why Rambo was the way he was. He had a mental condition, PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). This plot point made the machine he was into a human that most could relate with. It sent out a strong message to me and made the movie all worth while.",First Blood
413,weresmurf,"A movie that though aged, is still as relevant as ever... *Very minor spoilers*",10,3 February 2008,"My father served in the Vietnam war at the age of 21, much like John Rambo would have had he been real. In real life, my father endured a hell hole, a place he to this day, will rarely speak of without tears in his eyes, stories have been told to me about watching his friends die over there, of seeing atrocities done by both sides, a horrible horrific situation that no man woman or child should ever have seen.He spoke to me once, of returning to Australia, to a country he loved, called home. He spoke to me of feeling proud, in his uniform, having completed his tour, of stepping off the plane.And then he told me of the ridicule and scorn he received from the general public upon his return. A return where he was called a baby killer, despite never having actually killed anyone himself surprisingly, where it was simply assumed he was the one at fault, that the public would scorn him, forget he was human, treat him like a social outcast. Treat him, like an animal.Which is part of the reason he and I bonded so well over this movie when we first watched it. Sure, it's an agrandised tale of a badly treated Vet, a man forgotten by his government, much like my own father.When we see Stallone performing as Rambo in this movie, he's not fantastical, he's not superman, he's a man who's been wronged, who fights back the only way he knows how.When you see this movie, understand that this is, despite the fantastical elements in this film, a very accurate portrayal of how our veterans are treated. They're forgotten, they're given over to an ill equipped health system, be they in Australia or America, they're treated like outcasts.The beautiful thing about First Blood, when you watch it, is it's so easy to identify with Rambo, so easy to see he's just a good man, having a bad time, who reacts in possibly the worst way to whats happening to him... but that worst way, is the only appropriate way. The torture he endures under a biased prejudiced sheriff, the lack of respect for serving his country, the health system that should've picked up on his quite obvious PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), none of it was there for him.When it hits the fan, and Rambo goes on his escape, ask yourself, is he really hunting them? If they had've let him go, wouldn't it have been better for them? Didn't he just want to be left alone after all? The one message this movie, less than subtly puts across, is something we all need to learn. Whether its WW1 or 2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm 1 or 2, you're not expected to agree with the war, you're not expected to support the war. But for gods sake support your troops. Next time your national day rolls around, like in Australia for Anzac Day, take the time to show a veteran, no matter if they're 25 or 95, show them they're appreciated, let them know they made a great sacrifice, that you respect what they did.Rambo succeeds on this level, especially Stallones final speech to Richard Crenna, which absolutely tears you apart, realising this man was plucked from obscurity, trained to be a god amongst normal men, then, when the machine of war was done with him, tossed out like a little spring from the machine, useless, unneeded and no longer wanted... where was he to go? What was he to do? It's a realistic situation that many, many veterans go through, google War Veteran Suicide rate sometime, it's an eye opening somewhat depressing look at the reality of the situation regarding our beloved Vets and the torturous return to mundane civilian life they have to go through...Don't respect the war, don't necessarily respect your government. But never, ever, disrespect the men and women who fight for your right to freedom. When you disrespect our soldiers, you disrespect everything our nations stand for. And that, is criminal.",First Blood

415,Meurglys3,Not what I expected,4,28 January 2009,"I knew very little about ""First Blood"" prior to watching this movie except that Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was good at his job. I thought this was going to be a straight-forward action movie. It is not. The film opens 7 or so years after the Vietnam War ended with Rambo going to find one of his old army buddies, only to discover he died. Rambo then walks about the streets of a quaint Washington town where he is arrested for vagrancy by a police officer on a power trip. After being brought into the police station, Rambo escapes into the mountains while being pursued by most of the officers on duty. We follow Rambo as he deals with an ever-increasing opposing force.So that's the basic story without giving too much away. Now for the problems I had with the movie in order of severity. -The pace. Up until the last third, it was a chore to continue watching. The fifth sixth of the movie was such that I was indifferent to continue watching and the final sixth actually had me interested in what was happening. -Rambo's character. I understand that he most likely has PTSD. I can also understand the fact that he doesn't want to kill anyone. ****SPOILERS AHEAD****This works up until he escapes from the cave. If he really didn't want to kill anyone, he would not have jumped onto that truck and kicked the driver out. He knew that the driver would be found, he would report that Rambo is still alive, the hunt would return again and people would most likely get hurt. He then took the fight to the city which almost guarantees people will die. Perhaps he could have had a change of heart sometime through the movie, but it would have to be the very small window from the time he didn't kill the driver of the truck he hijacked to the time he decided to ram the police car off the road into that car.****SPOILERS FINISHED****-The soundtrack is often abrasive and doesn't blend well with the movie. There were many times that I found myself distracted by the music. -The final problem which is no more than a nuisance was how a police car crashing could produce a fiery explosion, but a mere minute later a large truck crashing into a police car results in no explosion.Were it not for the last 15 minutes, I would have awarded this movie 3 stars. For reference, a 5 star movie is something that I feel completely neutral towards.",First Blood

419,romeo_06062,Rambo is more than a cartoon character,8,24 April 2006,"Rambo is more than a cartoon character. He is the alter-ego of a generation. However, they could just as easily have dressed him in a suit and written nearly the same script. In that way, 'Rambo' perpetuates the stereotyped Viet Nam War veteran as a semi-literate, underemployed drifting soul. Many of the clichéd expressions used to describe John Rambo in the film are metaphors for the way real-life Vietnam War veteran were regarded: ""Crazy,"" ""psycho,"" ""loser,"" to name a few things that the character was called in the film. He added a few, (they called me)""...baby killer,"" ""In Nam I was somebody, I was in charge of million dollar equipment, I could drive a tank, fly a chopper. In the end, that he cried was out of character. Nonetheless, the character, 'John Rambo,' did what many of us wanted to do, and many did in their own way: Smack society down for using us and throwing us away, scorned. The interesting thing to note is that the character, Sheriff Teasley, is played by Brian Dennehy, an actor who lied about serving in Viet Nam when he did not. Among veterans, lying about service in Viet Nam is a shameful act. Yet the many who have done so in some way supports the idea that Viet Nam, in the national conscience, was a heroic venture.

If I had of said it out loud I would have had to eat my every word. The acting is first rate; Stallone delivers a performance that perfectly portrays a victim of a post traumatic stress disorder. The action is great while still remaining mostly grounded in reality and necessity. Moments that could have been cheesy manage to avoid being so.What is more is that it is very real. Returning to a hostile country upon repatriation is a degrading experience all to many Vietnam veterans had to live through, to the point that the war itself could be favourable by comparison. The style and tone of this movie never trivializes this important reality, nor is it exploited.To say that this movie deserves a nomination for the best movie of all time would be premature on my part, as such a statement requires sober second thought while I have seen the movie only once and last night at that.

Alfred Hitchcock believed that the good characters are not white and the bad ones are not black, everybody's Grey. But I think this is not the case. The most positive character in this movie is Sheriff Teasle and the bad one is the human society and army. John Rambo is the victim in this case, the innocent victim who became a menace to the same society who destroyed his spirit and now didn't want him back. This is why I think this is good movie who has something to say, who has a decent point of view in a domain which many productions debated. John Rambo can't be brought back to ordinary life so the sheriff does what he was told to do: eliminate any possible threats to his community.

My favorite bit is where he throws that rock that breaks the helicopter windshield and it somehow manages to cause the helicopter pilot to go mental, he then twitches the stick throwing the chief of police 100ft to his death. Great considering that in the scene before it was only hovering 30ft off the ground.

432,newton95243-1,why doesn't Hollywood make such action movies anymore,9,28 January 2008,I watched this movie as a kid and simply loved it. Ever since I have been watching action movies in particular and now I find that there aren't such classics anymore. I considered if its because I grew up but realised that wasn't so. Because I watch this movie again whenever it shows up on television. It survives test of time I think for the following reasons. This doesn't need spectacular special effects. The stunt scenes weren't conceived first and then a story woven around it(Matrix Reloaded style). There is no unnecessary female lead. There is real heroism and characterisation. The characterisation of John Rambo is perfect. All through the movie you can relate to John Rambo. Rambo is a trained killing machine who returns home after serving in Vietnam. Yet he is soft at core and would never hurt an innocent person for his own survival. He carries grief of loss of his friends and hostility of his own country men. He would never surrender if you try to push him to corner. It is evident in the scene when the police fail to make him utter a single word inspite of all their bullying. The cops have no idea whom they are dealing with and the way they try to bully around Rambo is amusing. Two scenes involving John Rambo's mentor and the sheriff are my favourites as they sum up what John Rambo and the theme of the movie. The army man tries to explain the cop how fighting in war is different from enforcing law but the the cop fails to understand.

435,revenant_krow,A film in Dire need of a remake,8,4 November 2007,"This film is raw, brutal, and in a way honest. But (SPOILED ALERT) end wrong. had it ended the way it did in the book, There would be no half ass-ed Rambo vs. Pinko travesties.As a Newly Made Vet myself, I understand the difficult, to an extent, of the balancing act of a soldier. A man goes to Basic training, it taught how to kill when ordered to do so for the service of his country. and then come home, puts away the soldier and never forgets how to gut a man 6 ways to Sunday, and is told, this is not acceptable behavior in the moral right. But I severed the moral right told to shoot to kill my enemy? For some it is far worse. Not all scares are on the outside. and many come home after having done or have had done to them Very terrible things no man should ever have to endure. All for their country right or wrong. That is a debate I'm not willing to evoke here.Rambo, John J. Of Arizona is just that sort of soldier. While he was probably asked to do these terrible thing to people and did so with out question for a country he loved so much that he served it and did so with honor. His real Goal was to server his ""BROTHERS"" in arms. to a soldier every man and woman he or she serves with is a Brother or sister as real as if they where related by blood.To come home and living 7 years of private Hell having been a POW and tortured for what we'll never know. he is looking for his place in the Society that sees him as human trash. Would be enough to brake any mans spirit.On his search for family and belonging he seeks out at very least one of his army brothers, to find him dead. his reaction is leaving the only picture of his true family behind and throwing any other connecting scraps into the fire thus severing any ties he has to the world. Stallone I found actually played this moment very well. He start hopeful and optimistic and then the curtain drop and he find him self battling his demons with no one to help him.by the time he meets the town of Hope's Sheriff, He's already lost all sight of any connection to the world. Made worse by a man who is relentlessly driving him away to the point of abusive assertion of authority. but he was not the worse character he would face. While being booked, Teasle's men are down right cruel and have no idea how to be anything but or what memories they are stoking in this already fragile mans mind.When all hell brakes loose. it is they who truly drew first blood but it is Rambo who instigated this. In my take of the story, Neigther Teasle nor Rambo where right or wrong. but what makes them so different, Teasle felt falsely justified where as Rambo made no attempt to hind his wrath true nature. He was after all build to be a killer and once a killer always capable of killing with out question. his fatal flaw is he knew nothing more then the service of violence.The Movie it self can never be made like it was ever again on such a budget like that scaled to todays movie furnaces. but the film is by far a simple story of what the human creature is really like. suppress the animal is side you all you want, we are all Killing machines inside and are all driven to violence.From Rome's Gladiator to our current Splatter Flicks. We all wish to see or do things to others living thing to destroy them. it in our nature, deny it all you want, it still true.the trick is maintaining that creature in a safe and healthy way, some fail other curb it so much they believe they killed it.Still this film needs to be retold, ended they way David Morelle wrote it good or bad. and left to the view to decide who was right and who was wrong.SPOILER: in the book, Rambo killed many that stood up to face him. if your intent was to kill him you where a dead man. He left few to live, and injured even fewer.while that sort of a character would not be your standard ""hero"" he was after all a killer of men. that what he was trained to do, that what he did for most of his adult life (age 18+) and thats is how he would die at the end of first blood.The film as it sits was good for it time and is still relevant even if you had Rambo a vet of the First Iraq conflict, or still Vietnam for that matter. and with what we can do even with practical effects (Effects done live on camera) that where hard to do at the time. the movie could be so much more as long as, Bless him for the character, Sly stays the hell away from it. We don't need Rambo 4: Old Fart's blood. We need a remake of Rambo 1 with fresh blood and a new face for the man we call Rambo. and a redefinition of what Rambo Style really means.after all Rambo is a tactical Combat Expert. one thing you see little of in the films.",First Blood
436,dannycnnll,One of the best action movies ever made,10,10 February 2008,"Note: I plan on putting only one or two minor spoiler(s) in my review.Not only the best in the Rambo series, but one of the top action films ever made. In my opinion one things my the other Rambos were good, but not brilliant, was there lack of reality. Sure First Blood is in some places unrealistic, but at the time there were a lot of stories about Veitnam vets losing their heads a bit, so tormented by what they had seen. So the film made sense and felt real. The other films though, were a bit to much like Terminator and other films. While killing hundreds of people in a fiction film like Terminatior wouldn't bother you, it didn't work well for a supposedly realistic Rambo.Now on to the actual film. It's not about how many things you can blow up in an hour, this film is based on suspense. Just seeing Rambo setting up the traps tells you your in for a treat. There's a line in the film where Rambo's master tells the police force that they are the ones being hunted, which kind of makes you realise, how hard for Rambo to fit into normality again.The acting is superb, with a notably performance near the end where Stallone breaks down and tells how sad his life is.

As the movie started I was sitting on the edge of my seat not knowing what to expect from the extremely talented Sylvester Stallone. I was also extremely frustrated with the Sheriff not letting Rambo in his town all the poor guy was looking for was a hot meal to eat. Anyway I thought this movie also portrayed the strength of the United States Military by showing a Vietnam veteran trained in such a way where he was invincible to any situation he would encounter, throughout this epic film from stitching his own wounds to making bow and arrows. May I also add that this movie also had a well balance of both violence and bullets.

440,RedCellSix,Spectacular variation on a fantastic story.,8,11 June 2003,"First Blood has its weaknesses.  There are some editing flaws that take a little bit away from the movie-going experience (i.e. the escape from the sherriff's office), as well as some assumptions that must be made about Sherriff Teasle's previous encounters with vagrants.  However, the strengths overcome such passable flaws.  The story is powerful, meaningful, and fun. The variations that Stallone made to the Rambo character are interesting in comparison to Morrell's Rambo and overall add to the style of movie that was produced.  Well acted, well-produced (for its time), and delivers to the audience.  Stallone does a fine job of getting the audience to sympathize with Rambo's (and other Vets) difficulty adjusting to civilian life after war; Dennehy makes a very good macho law enforcement officer; Trautman's quiet power was done brilliantly by Crenna.  Not a perfect movie, but perfectly balanced adventure, survival, action, social commentary, and fun for the audience.",First Blood
441,coletteandderek,One of my fav's,8,27 May 2011,"Have loved this stallone movie since the first time I saw it. I have it on my IPOD. I was watching it on TV the other night. Wasn't 100% sure where the movie was filmed then as I was watching I noticed a woman wearing a ""BAY BlANKET"" coat (a famous Canadian item) in the scene where they are setting up the police camp in the forest just after John has escaped into the forest and just before Trautman appears. Strange I have to say that I never ever noticed this before in the 20 times I have watched this movie! I too have read the book and love this adaptation. For me it is the best of the Rambo movies it is the one where we find out who John is and in the next 3 movies they get a little weird and we loose who John is until he walks down the driveway again to his home in America.",First Blood
442,damnnice,Greatest of what I've seen lately!,10,7 July 2009,"I know it is something kind of funny, to say about a movie which is more than 25 years old, but It is my first time seeing it for in -may be- 20 years.. When I was a kid, Rambo knife was so famous that almost everybody has a similar one as if they were all going hunting every day, and we, children used to love wearing head bands like Rambo's.. And last week, I had bought the DVD box set since it was on sale, for having some nostalgia. I watched it and I loved it. The movie was not about just a war machine who we loved when we were children, it was about a troubled man mutilated by the memories of war..And the ending was so good! Stallone shocked me with the great performance. I must have seen most of his works but never witnessed like this one -and I don't even remember a word of the scene from the past, being a child is something like that :)-.It was a great experience to see ""First Blood"" as an adult,too!",First Blood

Just trying to get back to normal after serving his country in Nam.One small towns sheriff department wants to start a war, they drew First Blood, not Rambo... but he ended the war!

444,Charlesesmth,Very gritty !,10,25 March 2021,"I flew the Hughes 500 bringing a fallen policeman back to the river.
Brian Denehey was in a standby tent by the River in Golden Ears Park.
Sly was a real tough guy I saw at the Denman Place hotel prior to the shoot. He was quite short and I didn't recognize him at first.
He wouldn't put on a jacket in Hope filming as he didn't want to get out of character.
Picture was written on the fly during most of filming but the end result was great.
David Caruso was very gentle and not the actor that he would later become.",First Blood

446,richc-31608,Good film!,9,21 September 2015,"Sylvester Stallone is an actor that many times is criticised, but here he is at his near full best, doesn't talk an awful lot but his emotion carries and you really start to feel for what he says(well, if you can at times make it out). I liked Richard Crenna and his calm demeanour in the film, even in the most dangerous of times he still seems to keep a straight face and mind and the actor really knows how to make himself look like a father figure.It is directed quite well and same goes for the writing, Ted Kotcheff I feel maybe didn't need to do much in scenes as Stallone just knows it all anyway but is hand is steady throughout the movie. Stallone is among the writers and he does well too, although with the 3 and the dialogues sometimes kept at a minimum, it is easy to see just how easy this was to write really. I liked some stunts but I felt more was needed in that area and more things like big jumps and run chases would have been appreciated as well.My main critical points focus on the slightly dull dialogue and parts seem a bit rushed in honesty, it doesn't hurt the film badly as I have already said, it is a pretty good movie, but it definitely makes some scenes seem rubbishy. I wasn't too keen either on the way the film has to keep pointing out Stallone is hard to kill and a seasoned veteran, it got on my nerves because we hear it 20 times when Richard Crenna arrives, and even more after just a few minutes.",First Blood
447,neil_luscombe-70222,First Blood - mindless action film,6,19 March 2016,"Not having seen any Rambo films before, but aware that it is one of the two series that made Stallone's name, I came to this film expecting top rate action if not much to think about. The action was actually less exciting than I had hoped; I was right about the lack of thought-provoking dialogue and plot. I knew that it had something to do with war but was expecting a war setting, so the idea it was a Vietnam vet on the loose in America, up against the local police force, gave little reason to like Rambo compared to if he were fighting a just cause abroad. He was psychologically damaged yes, and you feel for him, but he's still not really a likable character. Some scenes are exciting, especially early on, in the early part in the forest, but the film feels more meandering as it goes on. The police chief was equally unlikeable, and very two dimensional, always sure he can bring down Rambo despite the mounting entrance to the contrary. The best character was Rambo's leader in Nam, the only one of the three who talks sense. I'm not a fan of mindless violence but some recent action films I've seen such as Apocalypto engage the mind as well as on multiple other levels, which didn't happen here. I pitied Rambo but just couldn't really muster the will to get wholly in his corner.",First Blood
448,paladinsteve,"Excellent, will be remembered forever.",10,13 August 2005,"This film has everything I ever wanted from a one man army film, a guy wrongfully accused going on a rampage, with lots of powerful emotion and realistic action. The character played by Sylvester Stallone is done flawlessly, and every detail from the mood and state of mind to the scars and fighting ability are done to much satisfaction and detail.Although I had watched this briefly many years ago I was too young to appreciate most of the aspects from how it was made to each actor chosen for the parts and the acting itself, the most notable thing was the expression on their faces which was entirely believable.",First Blood
449,al-87841,Tells the real story of war,9,14 October 2016,"George P. Cosmatos's 1982 action film, Rambo First Blood, is seen by most as a classic bare bones shoot em up action movie, but in reality tells a commentary on the dehumanizing effect warfare can have on the men and women forced to kill or be killed. John Rambo is a testament to the true effect of war, sure he is able to single-handedly take on the US army, essentially a one man army, but at what cost. He was a war hero, he gained glory and prestige from battle, but in the process he lost his humanity and his sanity. Upon returning to the country he fought to defend, he discovers that he can no longer fit in with with the people he swore to protect. He is haunted by PTSD from his experiences in the war and the scars it left on him and is a danger to himself and others because of it.",First Blood
450,longrider670,"Brilliant film,realistic action scenes and damn good acting by the entire cast......",10,1 September 2005,"It is hard to believe this film is over twenty years old but as far as I'm concerned it is still the standard by which other action films should be judged.Many films of the same genre have been made including the sequels to this but none have come not even remotely close. I read the novel about two years previous to the films release and was astounded by how closely the script paralleled..........brilliant film,realistic action scenes and damn good acting by the entire cast.Obviously,a few changes were made for theatrical effect and for providing longevity for the studio, but all in all, I've yet to see any action/thriller since its debut that provides this much entertainment,and to think that Stallone kept his mouth closed for about ninety-eight per cent of the film,maybe Hollywood should learn something from this,(LOL).",First Blood
