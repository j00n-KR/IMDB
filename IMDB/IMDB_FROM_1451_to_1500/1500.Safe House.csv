0,bkoganbing,Joined At the hip,8,21 February 2012,"Although the comparisons between Safe House and the Robert Redford classic Three Days Of The Condor are obvious, Safe House is definitely a Condor for the 21st Century. For one thing it has Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds in it and in it for much of the film together. If they didn't have good chemistry, this film would have flopped bad.Denzel Washington plays Tobin Jones once a ranking CIA agent who went rogue after the turn of the millennium and now just peddles whatever he can get his hands on to the highest bidder. He's got something now that people would kill to have and do.After getting the proverbial Hitchcockian McGuffin from an old friend from British MI6 who gets killed in the process, Washington goes to seek asylum in the US Consulate in Capetown. They escort him to a Safe House that the CIA has there where Ryan Reynolds works and Reynolds is just feeling under-appreciated and hoping for a transfer to some glamorous station like Paris where he does have a girlfriend.Then the bad guys come and wipe out the Safe House which proves to be quite unsafe. But Reynolds and Washington escape, Washington in Reynolds custody and not sure of who to trust including each other.Washington and Reynolds work well together in Safe House. Their situation also reminded a bit of 3:10 To Yuma where Van Heflin and Glenn Ford are kind of joined at the hip and Heflin also has to deliver Ford to Yuma prison.Quite a few twists in Safe House, just the ingredient that an action/adventure film like this needs. I'd see it as soon as possible.",Safe House
1,Leofwine_draca,The usual action guff,8,21 October 2014,"SAFE HOUSE is a South Africa-filmed action flick that inevitably finds itself heavily indebted to the whole Paul Greengrass BOURNE style in the tale of a cop and a crim who have to team up when they find themselves pursued by a ruthless and murderous gang.What we have here is an entirely familiar film that nevertheless manages to score a few points along the way, mostly in the action stakes. For SAFE HOUSE is a fast paced, action-oriented movie that features a handful of breakneck shoot-outs, and a film that's held together for the most part by another assured role for Denzel Washington.Washington can do these kinds of roles in his sleep by now, and it's fair to say that the character of Tobin Frost is hardly a stretch. Nevertheless, he's the best thing in the film by far, delivering a kind of laconic toughness that really works in its favour. Ryan Reynolds is, inevitably, less impressive as the forgettable younger lead, but there are a handful of decent supporting parts for the likes of Liam Cunningham, Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Robert Patrick.While the plot is routine to say the least, SAFE HOUSE at least looks good and the cinematography is strong. The plot has its share of twists and turns to keep viewers engaged, and I thought the violent but inevitable climax was particularly decent. Not a great film then, but a solid one nonetheless.",Safe House
2,SnoopyStyle,Denzel and Ryan anchor solid thriller,8,25 August 2013,Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) is the CIA's most dangerous rogue agent. He is captured and taken to the Cape Town safe house where rookie CIA operative Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is in control. It's supposed to be a quiet post but all hell breaks loose.This is a tight little action thriller. Denzel is again his controlled best. Ryan plays the rookie well. These two have great chemistry. They put this movie over the top. The only thing that's truly missing is an IP or sequel setup for the franchise. This is a tight thriller anchored by a couple of top notch actors. They don't make quite as many of these mid-level thrillers any more.,Safe House
3,Hitchcoc,I just never cared!,6,17 July 2012,"Once again we have the CIA (bad CIA! Bad!) doing things that we can't really comprehend. Whose side are you on? Your side! No, I'm on my own. We have this guy doing incredible things. He risks his life time after time for the company and we'll dump him the minute things start to become suspect. Then we have Denzel Washington's character. Who is he? Why is he so important? He has a slip of paper with names on it. They can implicate the company. How did he get that? Why does he have this incredible power over everyone? On and on. The protagonist spends his time getting beaten to a series of pulps (somehow he can still walk) for what? Nobody trusts him. He is captain Ahab after America's most successful black actor, or is he. Where do his loyalties lie? I don't get it and I don't care. It's just a muddled script that throws in a series of narrow escapes just to sort of keep us interested.",Safe House
4,claudio_carvalho,Conventional but Effective Action-Thriller,7,16 June 2012,"In Cape Town, South Aftica, the rookie CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a safe house keeper and is in love with his French girlfriend Ana Moreau (Nora Arnezeder) that does not know about his double life.When the most wanted rogue and former CIA agent Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) surrenders to the American Consulate to escape from an attack of dangerous soldiers of fortune, he is brought to the safe house to be interrogated by the specialist Daniel Kiefer (Robert Patrick) and his team. However there is a breach in the safe house and mercenaries break in the place expecting to capture Tobin Frost and they kill Daniel and his men. Matt escapes with Tobin and he contacts the CIA senior management Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard), David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) and Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga) that give instruction to Matt to reach another safe house with the prisoner. But Tobin warns Matt that there is an informer in the CIA and he shall not trust in anyone.""Safe House"" is a conventional but effective action-thriller with the usual shootings, car chases and explosions. But the great cast, with the charismatic Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds; great veteran actors Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard; the always excellent Vera Farmiga; and the gorgeous and unknown Nora Arnezeder, makes the difference. The Hollywoodian commercial happy end is unrealistic but certainly will pleasure a great number of viewers. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Protegendo o Inimigo"" (""Protecting the Enemy"")",Safe House
5,nogodnomasters,YOU'VE DONE A FINE JOB. WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE,8,10 December 2018,"The action/drama/mystery film opens with a quick character build up of the multifaceted CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). He operates a safe house with nobody in it. He wants a European field assignment, but lacks department seniority.The movie switches to Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) obtaining an embarrassing electronic file from the MI6 in South Africa. ""Frost"", because he is cold. Denzel uses his expected savvy to escape. He is a rogue super agent who free lances, buying and selling information. In order to escape the bad guys, Tobin surrenders to the CIA. Now the questions are: Was this his original plan? What is on the file?Tobin is taken to our aforesaid safe house for intense interrogation.I loved the opening of the interrogation scene. The interrogator says, ""I'm here to advise you of your rights. You're being held under national security order 600 which means you have none.""Frost is too important of a person and the top secret safe house comes under attack. The young low level highly trained Matt Weston is now on the run with a man who is a master manipulator of people. To our list of unanswered questions we now add, ""Who is the mole?""Ryan and Washington give us excellent performances. It had elements of the Bourne series that made this story interesting, but it doesn't quite measure up to that film. Cliche ending. I would say if you are a fan of the trilogy, check this one out.Multiple chase scenes, torture, killings, shoot outs, minor ""roof top"" jumping, car wreaks without explosions.1 f-Bomb, no sex, no nudity.",Safe House
6,kosmasp,Anything but safe,7,28 May 2012,"Great role for Ryan Reynolds and a good movie too. As another reviewer did write this has really good action and stunt scenes that support the story and will keep you on your toe (or on the edge of your seat, depending which you prefer). But for all the good things this has going for it, there is still something missing to make this really special. I can't put my finger on it, but something or somethings just don't really click.This might seem minor to some, but some others (including myself) would love to like this movie a lot better. All the ingredients seem to be in place, the result is more than satisfying and still it seems as though it looks better than it tastes (hopefully that won't make you hungry, but understand what I'm trying to say)",Safe House
7,classicsoncall,"""This ain't a test. This is the real thing.""",8,30 September 2021,"""Safe House"" combines the conventional twists of an espionage thriller with fine acting by the principals. I don't care much for the characters Ryan Reynolds portrays in his super-hero flicks, but he works well here opposite Denzel Washington as the rogue CIA agent who turned traitor ten years earlier when he effectively went off the grid. What's most effective is how all of Tobin Frost's (Washington) warnings to Matt Weston (Reynolds) eventually materialized, and aroused in him the suspicions about how dirty the entire espionage game can be. That idea is reinforced by the forger Carlos Villar (Rubén Blades), when he tells Weston that 'everyone betrays everyone'. When supervisor Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard) eventually tells Weston that he's done a fine job and the CIA will take it from here, Frost's words of advice crystallize in his mind, helping him determine a course of action that will bring down dirty agents across a host of international agencies. I thought the writing was cleverly done here in a way that's not confusing for the average viewer, which is often the case when a film tries to do too many things at once. The only thing I would question is Weston's resolve to reunite with girlfriend Ana (Nora Arnezeder) in Paris at the end of the story. It's one aspect of Tobin Frost's advice that would be bound to earn him some trouble down the road.",Safe House
8,jboothmillard,Safe House,4,16 September 2012,"I saw a trailer or two for this film, and I think I saw a review about it as well on a film programme, it certainly looked like it could be good, and the critics gave it a relatively good review, so I was looking forward to seeing what it was like. Basically in Cape Town, South Africa, CIA agent Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) is being chased by men who want to kill, and he is believed to have turned rogue, so he deliberately gets himself arrested at the American Consulate to escape the soldiers. Low level CIA rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is the guard, or ""housekeeper"", of a safe house, and has to lie to his French girlfriend Ana Moreau (Nora Arnezeder) about it, and Frost is brought to this safe house to be interrogated Daniel Kiefer (Robert Patrick). Shortly after arriving however the safe house is stormed by the men who were chasing Frost and they kill everyone there, apart from Frost and Weston who manage to escape, and they go on the run, and they realise there was someone on the inside of the CIA who told the killers where Frost was. They are told to report together to Langley, but Weston recalls something that makes him realise that Frost may be holding something back, he confronts his contact Carlos Villar (Rubén Blades), they go to another safe house guarded by double-crossing Keller (Joel Kinnaman), and David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) is revealed as the inside after killing his supposed partner Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga). Everything comes to a head inside the safe house where there incriminating evidence files about Barlow, and he and Vargas (Fares Fares) show up to kill Frost and Weston, and after the true villains are killed in a big fight Weston gets the files for the police to prove the thing going on, Frost dies, and after all the stuff is put to rest and whatever Weston is forced to have to disappear after being promoted, including leaving Ana. Also starring Liam Cunningham as Alec Wade and Sam Shepard as Harlan Whitford. Washington gives a relatively good performance as the man you're not sure is a criminal or an ally, Reynolds is also alright as the rookie forced into a dangerous situation, I will be honest and say that the story got pretty confusing for me, because of all the law and political stuff, it was only the chases and gun play and explosive stuff I could concentrate on and find entertaining, it is an alright action thriller. Okay, in my opinion!",Safe House
9,rmax304823,The Frost Identity,5,7 January 2014,"It's becoming increasingly clear that you can judge the age bracket of the audience a thriller is aimed at by counting the minutes until the first high-speed car chase. This one take about twenty minutes.I see no reason to bother too much with the plot. You've seen elements of it, in one or another form, a dozen times before. A young, naive agent in the CIA finds himself on the run from both the evil doers and some secret squad within the company. I rather enjoyed it the first time I saw Robert Redford do the same number in ""Three Days of the Condor"" thirty years ago. I was thoroughly entertained when a variation on the theme was performed in ""The Bourne Identity."" This film borrows from both, as well as from every other thriller recently committed to celluloid. It tries with desperate enthusiasm to disguise itself as something original. The setting is Capetown, South Africa, and environs, but the armature beneath the overstuffed costume remains visible.What can you say about it? Ryan Reynolds has the features and personality of a nonentity. Denzel Washington makes a decent prize captive. I didn't care for Robbie Coltrane as a heavy. And the chief hood looks Arabic, only with an enormous nose that belongs on some giant condor. Like Cyrano's, it marches on before him by a quarter of a mile. No kidding. If you want to see a REAL schnozzola, you can't miss this picture. We don't see much of Vera Farmiga and her twisted beauty. And Reynold's girl friend is given one or two scenes to sob through. She's a dish and should at least have been permitted to remove her hampering outer garments.Oh -- the fights are long and brutal, just as the krav maga duels in ""The Bourne Identity"" were short and brutal. This one paints the walls with blood. And there are many gun shots, all of them loud. Don't miss it if you like blood and loud gun shots. I can't think of too many other reasons to recommend it. It's strictly a commercial product and I don't actually believe it was aimed at a select audience, just at the shekels in their pockets.",Safe House
10,blanche-2,probably was best to see in a theater,6,7 July 2013,"Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington need to go to a ""Safe House"" - if they can find one - in this 2012 film.Reynolds plays Matt Weston, a CIA rookie in charge of a Cape Town safe house. A rogue agent, Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), is caught and brought there and after that, this is no safe house. Everyone wants what Frost has, including mercenaries who enter into a shootout. Frost and Weston take off for another safe house. As these things go, it's not long before Weston isn't sure who his friends are, especially when some of Frost's predictions about how the CIA will handle his escape turn out to be true.I saw this as a rental, and it's probably the type of film that needs to be seen in a theater. There are car chases, shootings, beatings, and gunfights galore - solid action - probably better experienced in a theater.Washington and Reynolds are both excellent, and create great characters. The rest of the characters aren't well developed - understandably, since Washington and Reynolds have the most to do.The script is derivative and predictable, but the ending really wasn't. This is an entertaining movie if you like constant action. Unfortunately for me it wasn't as compelling or surprising as one of the Bourne films.",Safe House
11,tavm,Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds make an intriguing team in Safe House if you don't let the shaky cam bother you too much,7,12 February 2012,"All right, I just watched this Denzel Washington-Ryan Reynolds spy drama with my movie theatre-working friend just now. The conversations between them were quite intriguing and the things the Washington character said and did certainly caught your attention. And there were plenty of chase scenes and gunfights to get one's juices flowing. But the shaky cam angles get confusing after a while and to tell the truth, I was a little bored to the point that I fell asleep some of the time until the next gun shot was fired. In fact, I had to ask my friend what happened near the end when I woke to the next shot. Still, this was quite entertaining and Denzel always gives a good performance. So on that note, Safe House is well worth a look.",Safe House

That guy is none other than our hero Denzel Washington.Ryan Reynolds enters the film as an agent assigned to Washington and winds up fleeing with him.Wait until you see what they mean by Safe House?

16,zardoz-13,"""Safe"" Just Makes You Chafe!",7,17 February 2012,"Swedish director Daniel Espinosa's predictable spy versus spy saga ""Safe House"" resembles ""The Bourne Identity"" in several respects. The chief difference is Denzel Washington doesn't play an amnesiac ""Bourne"" again hero. Instead, he is a rogue CIA agent at large who tops Langley's most wanted list who remembers everything rotten about the Agency. Like the ""Bourne"" thrillers, this nimble actioneer concerns corrupt CIA superiors who want Denzel dead because he has damaging information about them. Mind you, this isn't the first time that the CIA has been depicted as crooked. Movies such as ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""Scorpio"" appropriated that plot back in the early 1970s. Of course, the Agency isn't corrupt, only some powerful individual at the top. When freshman scribe David Guggenheim isn't creating veils of mystery, Espinosa does his best to captivate us with brief, brutal, and breathless combat scenes that rival the ""Bourne"" franchise. Lenser Oliver Wood enhances this violence with the same jittery camera-work that he used in the three ""Bourne"" movies. Three-fourths of ""Safehouse"" depicts heavily-armed gunsels shooting to kill and wielding their fists like cudgels. If you get in the way of these dastards, you die! Any movie where Denzel snaps a guy's neck and abandons his corpse in a toilet stall isn't designed to market action hero figures. Indeed, nothing about either Denzel or the tenacious thugs blasting away at his heels is frivolous. ""The Green Lantern's"" Ryan Reynolds co-stars as a character roughly similar to the guy that actor Ethan Hawke played opposite Denzel in ""Training Day."" ""Safe House"" emerges as one of those male mentoring melodramas where an older guy grooms a younger guy for the grimy world of espionage and corruption. The Central Intelligence Agency has been trying to nab the elusive Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington of ""American Gangster"") for nine years since he quit their ranks. When he shows up at a rendezvous with a shifty British Intelligence agent, Frost's enemies miss him, but put a slug in the MI6 man's skull. A desperate Frost scrambles for the safety of the American Consulate where the authorities immediately take him into custody. Meanwhile, Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a naive, straight-arrow CIA operative itching for the opportunity to prove himself. Instead, Langley has assigned Matt to serve as a glorified custodian for one of their safe houses. Twelve months later Matt is still waiting impatiently for a posting as a field agent. Trouble is he lacks the experience that would make him eligible for a better posting. Life in Cape Town, South Africa, where Matt is stationed as a 'housekeeper' bores him to tears. Despite friendly reassurances from his immediate superior David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson of ""The General""), Matt feels like he is stuck in a dead-end assignment. When he isn't supervising the CIA safe house, Matt cavorts with a gorgeous French gal, Ana (Nora Arnezeder of ""Paris 36""), and fills her ears with lies about his work.When CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford (Sam Sheppard of ""Black Hawk Down"") learns about Frost's capture, he sends the treasonous Frost to Cape Town for safekeeping. Frost's unexpected arrival at Matt's safe house catches the newbie agent by surprise. He watches with obvious misgivings as a group of ruthless CIA agents, led by Daniel Kiefer (Robert Patrick of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""), subject Frost to some grueling water-board torture. As it turns out, Washington didn't use a stand-in for the torture scenes. Anyway, Kiefer's men get nowhere with Frost. Suddenly, another gang of gunmen burst in with guns blazing. They wipe out everybody. Things don't look promising for Matt who is supposed to protect Frost. Frost reminds Matt that the killers want him alive, but they won't display any charity toward Matt. Matt ushers Front at gun point from the safe house. The two men form an uneasy alliance as they stay one step ahead of the tenacious villains. Gradually, Matt learns what a CIA agent has to look forward to in his line of work. Frost plays along with Matt as they hide out from the gunmen. Gradually, the renegade agent lulls Matt into a false sense of security before he surprises him. When they venture out into public, Frost alerts the police that Matt is armed and dangerous. The Cape Town police force seizes Matt while Frost vanishes into thin air. Not surprisingly, Matt's superiors in Washington are livid with rage. Not only does Whitford put Matt's boss Barlow on a plane to South Africa, but he also has a snooty, suspicious associate, Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga of ""The Departed""), accompany him. Catherine strongly suspects that Frost has turned Matt. When Matt calls Whitford and explains what happened, Whitford orders him to stand down. Nevertheless, Matt sets out to recapture Frost. He isn't ready for what he learns about either Frost or his superiors. ""Safe House"" benefits from on-location lensing in Cape Town. Everything appears genuinely gritty and none of it looks familiar. This isn't the kind of spy thriller that boasts exotic locations, desirable dames, and cool gadgets. Espinosa, Guggenheim, and Washington—who doubles as one of the executive producers—are gunning for realism, and they achieve it. The close quarters combat scenes will have you searching for bruises on yourself. Sadly, the surprises that occur throughout ""Safe House"" aren't revelations, and the ending seems straight out of ""Three Days of the Condor."" If you've seen ""Hanna,"" ""Red,"" ""Salt,"" ""Knight and Day"" or ""Haywire,"" you know what comes next at every turn. ""Safe House"" isn't as good as some of Denzel's earlier films, and he generates little sympathy with his martyred shades-of-gray character. Poor Vera Farmiga plays the most thankless role in the action, while Brendan Gleeson and Sam Sheppard turn in sturdy performances. On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds delivers the strongest performance and emerges as a contender. ""Safe House"" is best watched as a rental.",Safe House
17,Boba_Fett1138,"Liked its action but the movie itself, not so much.",6,13 February 2012,"This is one of those very typical modern action flicks you could easily do without. It's certainly not bad but it most certainly isn't great or very memorable either.The one thing I still did really liked this movie for, was its rawness. It's a very raw shot and feeling movie, in which the action is mostly being realistic, instead of very over-the-top or spectacular. And yes, the action moments are definitely the highlight of the movie and the one thing that makes this movie still worthwhile. It is very obvious that director Daniel Espinosa had watched a lot of Tony Scott movies. But just like most Tony Scott movies, this one is very mediocre.You could like the movie for- and say it is being original for not having really a clear main good and bad guy in it. Basically nobody in this movie is fully good, which also provides the movie with a couple of twists and surprises, in its story. You are constantly torn between who to pick sides with; the Denzel Washington or the Ryan Reynolds character, who are in a cat and mouse game together and have about an equal amount of screen time. I however would in this case preferred it if there was a more clear good guy and a truly evil and obvious bad guy because now you don't really know who to really root for. This really doesn't make this movie the most involving one.You are also really never getting into the story because of that. It besides just simply doesn't have a very interesting or original story to begin with. It really also isn't told in the most intriguing way and the movie actually more often comes across as messy and hard to follow. Or maybe this is just because I really couldn't care about anything that was happening in it.The actors still know to add to the movie though. Denzel Washington always has been great in these type of roles and Ryan Reynolds is also OK enough, just never really all that likable. It also has a solid supporting cast with actors such as Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard, Liam Cunningham and Robert Patrick involved. Just don't expect anything too great from them though, since all of their roles are quite limited.All in all, really nothing too bad but it still remains a movie you could very easily do without ever seeing.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Safe House

19,view_and_review,"It's Denzel, Nuff Said",7,5 June 2014,"I started watching this movie with a bias in its favor to begin with. I like both, Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington so I was expecting it to be good.Ryan Reynolds plays a CIA (or FBI) agent that is putting in his time babysitting a safe house. Denzel is a rogue agent that appears on the grid after years of being hard to catch.The movie was as advertised. A good thing you can expect from a Denzel crime/action thriller is that the acting will be good and the action won't be over the top. There will be enough action to keep you locked in but not so much where you mentally check out and don't care about the story. This wasn't the best Denzel movie, but at least it had a good cohesive story and some substance.",Safe House
20,neil-476,Chase thriller fails to realise full potential,7,1 March 2012,"Ryan Reynolds is Matt Weston, an able but under-used CIA operative whose assignment is maintaining a CIA safe house in Cape Town: he is going stir crazy, because nothing happens. Having been introduced to Matt, we are then introduced to Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a CIA operative who went rogue some years ago and has since made a living trading sensitive information. Frost is in Cape Town to do a deal with a rogue MI5 agent: when the Brit is killed and Frost himself in extreme danger, he hands himself in at the US Embassy. He is taken to the safe house to be interrogated by a specialist team. Only the safe house turns out to be not as safe as expected, and Weston has to go on the run with his prisoner.For everything which is good about this movie - and there is quite a lot - there is also something which leads you to go ""Yes, well..."" The photography, for instance: while the close-ups are striking, there are too many of them, particularly during the action sequences (full of Bourne camera jitter again, of course). The set-up is good - we learn that Frost is an ace manipulator - but then he does hardly any manipulation. What we get is chases. Well staged, but non-stop. Only in the last 20 minutes do we get action outside the framework of a chase, as the resolution pays out.And we also get one of those things which annoys me quite a lot in films - a character who might as well have ""misleadingly suspicious"" tattooed on their forehead (even though, to be fair, that leads to one of the most surprising moments in an otherwise fairly unsurprising film).I must mention the absence of bad language (except in the song over the closing titles) - very welcome, and the film loses nothing through its absence.This film is enjoyable and entertaining, but you can see in it the potential to have been quite a bit better.",Safe House
21,AlsExGal,Tense action thriller,8,21 October 2017,"Denzel Washington plays a rogue CIA agent hotly pursued by enemy agents who hands himself into the US. embassy in Cape Town as a way of escape from them. He is then taken to a ""safe house"" where he is to be interrogated but things go awry when the house is attacked by other agents wanting him. A young inexperienced CIA agent (Ryan Reynolds) must then try to take control and get the rogue agent to another safe house.This is the kind of film in which the audience doesn't know the good guys from the bad, including the CIA agents. There are double crosses and tons of explosive action, with plenty of hand held camera fast edit action scenes from director Daniel Espinosa (there's a certain edgy power here, though too much of it can get on my nerves after a while). There is also a harrowing waterboarding scene.Washington's character, while considered a traitor to the U.S., is also regarded as a legend within intel circles, having been successfully on the run and eluding all attempts to capture him for a decade as he spills out secrets on various intelligence agencies for the money. Washington plays him as a cool professional, virtually unruffled by all around him, even during an interrogation in which illegal methods are employed against him.In a film in which so many characters are scummy or potentially scummy, I found myself rooting for Washington. Rogue agent or not, he is one cool customer, and I had to admire his style. Of course, Washington is a powerful screen presence. Any time he's on screen it's all but impossible to take your eyes off him.Ryan Reynolds, as the somewhat naive CIA agent dealing with him, is adequate, no more.

It's ho-hum because of the simplistic and predictable script from writer David Guggenheim.To offset this substandard script, director Daniel Espinosa leans heavily on near non-stop action sequences. Luckily he has DP Oliver Wood (first two Bourne movies) to bring intensity and variety to the action. Denzel plays the veteran rogue agent who turns himself in to a U.S. Consulate after a decade off the grid. We learn he is a U.S. traitor of the worst degree. Reynolds plays a rookie agent assigned to a going-nowhere ""safe house"" in South Africa. To say the action is lacking on his assignment is a bit of an understatement. That is, until Denzel is transferred to his site.We learn a few things in this movie. First, ""Safe house"" is evidently CIA verbiage for ""all hell breaks loose"" in the form of massive gunfire and violent deception. Second, if you are an agent in charge of escorting one of the world's most dangerous men, you would prefer your bosses not send the two of you into a crowded soccer stadium to pick up a GPS device. Things are likely to go wrong. Third, it's not wise to walk in on Denzel when he is in a bathroom stall. Fourth, if you are Ryan Reynolds, your on screen girlfriends can be as beautiful as your real life girlfriends, and no one raises an eyebrow.The film does remind us that it's always cool to see Sam Shepard and Ruben Blades. Where have you been hiding Mr. Blades? The rest of the strong cast includes Brendon Gleeson and Vera Farmiga as dueling Langley operatives, Liam Cunningham as a (surprise!) bad guy, Joel Kinnaman (from The Killing) as an agent, and Nora Arnezeder as Reynolds' hottie.Being a fan of this genre, it is quite disappointing to see such an obvious and basic story. The overload of car crashes, gunfire, and hand to hand combat doesn't offset the fact that everyone knows early on how this is going to end. So even though Denzel makes an enjoyable good guy turned bad, and Reynolds shows he is way above the idiotic Green Lantern, this one just doesn't offer much more than your average video game.",Safe House
23,morrison-dylan-fan,No Church In The Wild.,7,6 July 2012,"Having always enjoyed David Fincher's under rated 2002 Thriller Panic Room,I became very keen on taking a look at this movie,when I watched an interview with the writer of the film, (David Guggenheim-who if his IMDb pics are anything to go by,maybe IMDb CEO Col Needham's alter ego) saying that he wanted to try and create a thriller which would be entirely based in an isolated safe house.The plot:After going rouge 15 years ago due to feeling that he was being used more for the CIA's own agenda then for what he was meant to be doing,former CIA agent Tobin Frost appears from out of the wilderness,and turns himself in at the US embassy in Cape Town.Wanting to extract information from Frost about his alleged criminal activates over the last 15 years,and to also try and find out why Tobin has decided to give himself up now,the CIA decided to take Tobin to an disclosed safe house for ""negotiation of info"".Sitting round expecting just another lazy day,safe house ""land lord"" Matt Weston is given the wake up call of his life,when he receives a phone call from a CIA official ordering him to get his house in order,for a soon to arrive dangerous individual.Once Tobin has entered the safe house,Matt tries to keep his eyes fixed to the ground,due to the CIA's idea of negotiating with Frost being to torture him.Prepairing to give Frost another round of water boarding,the CIA agents instead freeze,when an armed gang break in and start killing everyone in the house.Wanting to do things by the book,and to also save his own skin,Weston decides to grab Frost and make a run for it during the on going deadly shoot out, in the hope of being able to find out who gave the location of the classified,so-called safe house.View on the film:Although Guggenheim had stated in the interview that the safe house would be the main setting for this film,I was surprise to actually discover that only about 5% of the movie takes place in the films title setting.Going the other direction,Guggenheim creates a breakneck men-on- the-run Action Thriller,which despite some plot holes that are clearly see-able as the end credits start to roll, (the person who gave the details to where the safe house is,has a number of easy opportunities,where the person could kill Frost at any time) moves at a breathless pace,and introduces obstacle's for Frost and Weston to battle with at excellent moments (such as meeting a fellow ""land lord"",to facing a shoot-out in a huge football stadium.Whist director Daniel Espinosa, (whose making his American film directing debut) gives the Cape Town setting a terrific ""earthy"" feel,with people being shown protesting over job cuts,and also struggling to handle rush hour traffic,he sadly struggles to display anything else which makes him stand out,with the good rough fights in dusty hideouts,and sun lit,fast paced car chases looking like a carbon copy of director Tony Scott's work.(Who,by chance,Wassington has worked with a number of fantastic times.)Featuring in almost every scene of this really enjoyable movie,Denel Washington and Ryan Reynolds smartly make Matt and Tobin a yin and yang to each other,with Washington, (who along with being a co- producer,also,did not use a stunt double for any of the hideous water boarding scenes) giving a smooth performance that shows Frost to be someone who is desperate to always stay one step ahead,whilst Reynolds quickly throws any hint of slap-stick Comedy away,and gives a shining performance as Weston,who Renolds shows as someone who is never able to become completely comfortable with the escalating situation.",Safe House
24,anaconda-40658,Safe Bet on Washington.,6,6 May 2015,"Safe House (2012): Dir: Daniel Espinosa / Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Denzel Washington, Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard: Interesting idea about trust. Ryan Reynolds plays a safe house agent assigned to watch an ex CIA agent turned criminal, played by Denzel Washington who possesses files that are sought after by people from both sides. After a massive blood bath shootout, Reynolds escapes with Washington and from there the screenplay becomes one big chase and violent encounter after another but we know these two will be on the same side. One problem with this film is its making Washington a hero figure simply because viewers like him period. That is not to say that the film isn't entertaining. Washington and Reynolds are an electrifying pairing with Washington's soft spoken presentation that conceals a deadly consequence for those who oppose him, verses Reynolds's frantic race to maintain composure in the midst of turmoil. The ending works and director Daniel Espinosa allows for several great action sequences but perhaps supporting roles could have been broader. Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson are two effective actors but here their roles seem more like props leading to revelations that many viewers will likely already see coming. Sam Shepard is a veteran actor lost in cardboard material. While the film doesn't always work, it maintains an entertaining pace thanks to its two leads that rise above what the material might have been without them. Perhaps next time the screenwriters will spend more time in the safe house and produce a more convicting film. Score: 6 / 10",Safe House
25,FlashCallahan,I'll take it from here.....,8,26 February 2012,"Tobin Frost is a CIA agent who's turned rogue. When he is pursued by men who want to kill him, he goes to the American Consulate where he knows he will be arrested.When the CIA learns of this, it's decided to bring him to a safe house in Capetown. Shortly after they arrive, the men who chased Frost storm the safe house and kill everyone there.Matt Weston, the agent who's tasked with looking after the safe house, is the only one left, so he takes Frost and they go on the run. While on the run, Frost tells Weston that the only way those men found the safe house was that someone on the inside told them about it.Eventually Frost escapes and Weston is told to report to Langley but just as he's about to, he recalls something that Frost did that helps him figure out where he could be going.But just as he arrives, the men who are after Frost show up but Weston saves him and they head off. But Weston knows that Frost is holding something back....Denzel Washington is one of those actors that can open a movie regardless of the content. And here is another example. It's your usual story of corruption in the government, and Washington holds the answer.It's another great performance from the actor, but Frost is a different kind of character to the ones we are used to seeing.If you mix Harris from Training day and Creasey from Man on Fire, you comes up with the closest answer to Frost. The character on paper is despicable, but once the film gets going, he's not all bad after all, but still carries an evil streak with him.Reynolds has never been better than his performance here, and proves he has acting chops as well as the looks. The narrative is good, and the action is very loud and up close, but not as irritating as some are saying.So all in all, it's nothing special, you can pretty much work out who the bad guy is in the first five minute, but thanks to Washington and Reynolds, an average thriller, becomes thrilling.",Safe House
26,movieman_kev,Plays it too safe,5,13 July 2012,"Denzel Washington somehow makes this generic, cliché, predictable action film watchable, but only just. After hearing good things about this film I couldn't help but feel disappointed by how paint by numbers it truly felt. It's way too easy to stay one-step ahead of the trite storyline and at nearly two hours that gets a tad tedious. Every time Denzel isn't on camera, the film flounders desperately. Furthermore, the action sequences, while good, don't add to the low rewatchability factor. Training Day this is not, as far as Denzel Wasington flicks go, this film is one (small) step above the surprisingly abysmal John Q.Hell, I'd even go watch Unstoppable again over this one.",Safe House
27,phd_travel,NOT a must see.,4,19 February 2012,This is a slightly formula action thriller about a young CIA agent (Reynolds) who is unexpectedly made to handle an infamous rogue agent (Washington). As an action movie it is diverting but the plot is a bit predictable.The camera work is shaky and jerky which isn't right for action movies. Hard to tell what was going on and it made me vomity. The action takes place in Cape Town and the movie makers made the place look very slummy. Might have been better if they had prettier settings things didn't look so grim.The acting is okay from the leads. Denzel doesn't do much. Ryan is quite good as a newish CIA agent in over his head. Liked seeing Vera Farmiga as a CIA top woman. Brendan Gleeson was out of place.The plot isn't anything new. There are some twists and unsurprising surprises. Too many betrayals as well. The shock tactics like sudden loud gun shots were a bit unnecessary.The fight sequences and car chases are quite intense but not gruesome.Overall the film has a slightly ugly unpleasant feel and it doesn't have much new to offer the genre. Missable.,Safe House
28,gradyharp,"'People don't want the truth anymore, Matt. It's too messy. Keeps them up nights..'",5,6 June 2012,"SAFE HOUSE is a movie looking for a story. It is a film that is packed with fine actors who've proved their chops many times, but here writer David Guggenheim has simply failed to give them a plausible, sensible story and all that is left after movie's end is confusion and a lot of smoke, fire, and debris and scratching of the head. Daniel Espinosa directs obtusely.Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a bored but in love CIA rookie whose tedious assignment it is to man a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa: he longs for a European assignment but his position on the CIA totem pole is far too low for anything other than where he is, according to his boss Dave Barlow (Brendan Gleason). Things change rather abruptly when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) the CIA's most wanted rogue agent is captured and taken to the safe house. The CIA suddenly sees Matt's position as key and his bosses (Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard et al) see that they finally have caught the dangerous rouge CIA Tobin Frost. In interrogation (including water boarding!) ensues but during Frost's interrogation, the safe house is overtaken by mercenaries who want Frost. Weston and Frost escape and must stay out of the gunmen's sight until they can get to another safe house. From there on it is chase scenes segueing into chase scenes and very little makes sense to the point that few in the audience will care shat happens.Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington are always a delight to watch and even with this little bit of a mess of a movie they still make it watchable. The rest of the big name actors - Farmiga, Gleason, Shepard, Rubén Blades, Robert Patrick, Liam Cunningham (killed in the first few moments of the movie) and Nora Arnezeder are barely given enough lines to exist. But if you like action flicks, this one will likely please. Just keep expectations low. Grady Harp",Safe House
29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Safe House,6,9 February 2012,"Safe House, as its title suggests, offered no thrill a minute moment, and instead conjured up something that was pulling its punches all the way. In other words, it stuck to the middle ground, with the good and the bad all laid out nicely even if the story by David Guggenheim had tried to work in some surprises, which were really borrowed clichés from a dozen action thrillers. You'd know who's on the side of the upright, and those on the other side of evil schemers no matter how hard the characters try to hide their intent, wasting its wealth of acting talent for a mediocre storyline.Helmed by Swedish director Daniel Espinosa, this film seemed to serve as refuge for Espinosa to try and emulate the way Tony Scott films work with Denzel Washington in the lead, such as Man on Fire, Unstoppable, The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 and Deja Vu, and this went right down to having cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Rchard Pearson follow the fast cuts and edits that's styled to try and bring out that adrenaline flow they had hoped you'll feel for in the film. It tried to be gritty, being in unfamiliar and lesser seen territory of South Africa, employing a really grainy though unnecessary look and feel, as if following a documentary of one covert agent's mission, right down to quick edits and extreme close ups to try and bring out that sense of urgency, and raw power when it comes to fisticuffs.Alas these are nothing but gimmicky techniques that betray its lack of story. Beginning with an extremely lengthy prologue that can be done without a few scenes, Safe House stars Denzel Washington as the notorious Tobin Frost, an ex-CIA operative, one of the best in the business, having to turn rogue and having his head on the most wanted list. He gives himself up at the American consulate, but not before a big hullabaloo about meeting an MI6 agent and being engaged in an assassination attempt on his life. So Frost gets sent to a CIA safe house managed by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who has so far garnered zero field experience having spent the last 12 months waiting for some serious responsibilities and action. As the adage goes, beware what you wish for, as not before long a bunch of heavily armed hoodlums come gunning through the front door in search for Frost, killing every CIA operative in their wake.The film follows the formula of having Eraser, Assault on Precinct 13 and 16 Blocks all rolled into one, with South Africa being the playground, as Weston needs to move Frost from their compromised safe house to another, on one hand keeping both of them out of harm's way, and the other in Weston keeping Frost on a tight leash, where the latter's experience and immense reputation puts the rookie quite at awe yet confused, being very green in this big bad world of espionage where killing someone for information is nothing but second nature. One naturally comes to expect plenty of gun battles, danger lurking at every corner, and also some camaraderie to be developed in the relationship between rookie and veteran, giving their now on the same boat having their lives at stake against an unknown enemy.Alas the film didn't live up to its promise, having constantly gently teasing at every point only. Curiously the film began with a romance with Weston's relationship with student Ana (Nora Arnezeder) and developed along the lines of secret agent having to lie to protect her, but didn't go beyond having to show the sacrifices that are to be made. True this isn't the main emotional crux of the film, but that again didn't provide any boost to the expected chemistry between the leads. Ryan Reynolds have perfected the deer-caught-in-headlights look at being startled and blindsided for the most parts, and it's a pity that the Frost role was nothing to challenge Denzel Washington, who could and had sleepwalked through this role that straddles the fine line between good and evil. He's played characters on both sides of the law before, and this one didn't even manage to scratch the benchmark he had already set for himself.Ultimately, Safe House plays it all too safe. It didn't try to be too smart, or too action oriented, but touched on a little bit of everything to piece a movie together. Which is a pity that it could have been bolder with the kind of actors at its disposal, making the likes of Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard quite redundant (fans of Robert Patrick however should take note of his small role in the movie). At best this is a film that is reminiscent of other Tony-Scott-Denzel-Washington productions, but even then this reminded you of how successful that formula and pairing had been, and Daniel Espinosa sorely needed to be his own man here. Main theme song No Church in the Wild by Kanye West and Jay Z rocks though.",Safe House

After about 30 minutes into this movie, the constant thought that was running through my head was when this movie was going to end.

In the trailer it seemed like he would be a cold and yet slick character who knew exactly what he is doing. But that was just few minutes into the movie and he keeps making this lazy mistakes for a character who is supposed to be this legendary agent. If he at least kept his character most of the way through it would have been a more watchable more to some degree.

33,thesar-2,Bourne is Safe,5,3 March 2013,"Chop, chop, how was this not directed by Tony Scott?And even though Safe House starred Scott's long-time male interest, Denzel Washington, I'm more referring to the consistent and nauseating zoom-in's and epileptic shaky camera shots. Mercifully, Scott doesn't make the whole experience into a seizure, but this director, Daniel Espinosa nearly shook the film right out of the camera.He's pretty wet behind the ears, so hopefully with this somewhat unsuccessful box office zturn; he'll step back with more ease in the future.At any rate, this Bourne-Rip-Off follows smarter-than-thou Washington as Ex-CIA Tobin Frost selling secrets for many years and his own planned capture pits him with newbie, Matt ""promote me, damnit!"" Weston (Ryan Reynolds) and off they go fighting killers who want a damaging file. Oh, and the duo dead would be nice for the assassins, as well.Sadly, the CIA's tracking room – the suits who rarely get dirty, that is, mirrored the Bourne films, but completely without energy or a solid performance. In fact, in place of the fantastic Joan Allen from The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum was Vera Farmiga's underwhelming and, frankly boring role. This was sad, because of the two recent hits I've noticed her in, Source Code and Up in the Air, I thought she was excellent and I even wanted to go further into her catalog. This setback won't completely deter me, but damn, she was bad.I only point her out, because of her past great performances. Everyone else, including the lead, Washington, were pretty, well, plain. Heck, even Robert Patrick underperformed and appears to have aged not so well. The one stand out, and this surprised me, was Reynolds. Despite his clichéd character, he did show depth and we could carry on with his plightagain, in spite of his recycled role.Overall, the movie wasn't as terrible as I'm making it out to be; it did have its moments. It's certainly a no-thinker and the bouncy action was incredibly hard to follow at times and an absolute annoyance, but for staying in on a Thursday when you have no money until the next day's direct deposit, it's worth a viewing.

34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Decent thriller that even manages to be a little topical,7,28 October 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morningMatt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a young CIA agent, desperately angling for a big time case to be a part of. He inadvertently achieves this when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a renegade former agent who's spent the last few years selling secrets to rogue sources, inexplicably turns himself in at the US embassy in South Africa, only for an unidentified army to attack the base and lay siege to it. As the pair escape and career off on a wild chase around SA, secrets and lies emerge to Matt and he learns nothing is as it seems.Denzel Washington has become an increasingly more selective actor recently, seeming to pop up in a big event movie less and less often, probably not such a bad move in case later in his career he starts being offered more scripts that are invariably of lesser quality. And so it is that he stars in this just above average thriller, that manages to be a genuinely suspenseful, unpredictable story and even a little bit relevant and topical, given today's headlines.Judging by a large amount of the news, TV series and films at the moment, America is on high alert on the issue of Homeland Security, and it's been reported in the news the methods they use to extract information from those they suspect of breaching this for them in places like Guantanamo Bay, and in an early scene here Reynolds's character is forced to watch squirmishly as a 'water-boarding' technique is used on Washington's traitor. It's subtle little 'relevant' notes like this that give the film a neat little edge. It seems, and may well have been, set against the back drop of the 2010 World Cup, and it's a neat little air of mystery to keep you guessing if it is. The one really dud note here is the 'shaky camera' style, a modern day filmic curse, thinking it's being really cutting edge and original, but instead making you really hark back to the good old days of a smooth lens.It's been noted that Reynolds took the supporting role from a list of other, superior actors including Shia LaBeouf and Tom Hardy to name not even a fraction. That's not counting a wild supporting cast including Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Sheperd, Ruben Blades, Robert Patrick and Liam Cunningham. In the recession era, what makes this kind of film go from being direct to DVD/TV movie fodder to a big, polished big screen affair is having the courage to be relevant, topical and just a little bit unflinching, and Safe House, while not managing to be anything more than a slightly above average effort, certainly does all that. ***",Safe House

Everyone that is, apart from plucky Ryan Reynolds who is basically the CIA's caretaker of the unsafe safe house. He therefore has to rescue Washington and escort him to safety, all the time being pursued by baddies who can wipe out a professional CIA team in seconds, but can't shoot an untrained agent and his shackled prisoner.I can suspend my disbelief to accept all that. There's car chases, slick camera work, shoot-outs and punch-up - pretty much everything you'd expect from a modern action film. But it's still only average. The only thing that elevates it from being VERY average is Denzil Washington who, as usual, turns in a pretty decent performance, given what he has to work with. He snarls, charms and punches his way through most situations and Ryan Reynolds seems to have good chemistry with him in his attempts at keeping him both safe and cuffed at the same time.If anyone else was in the film it would simply be average, but if you like the sound of another car chase-laden action film with a better than average cast, give this one a go.

Unfortunately, Frost isn't so easy to contain.While the plot is a familiar broth of incriminating documents, it's the leads relationship and rapid-fire action that keeps Safe House protected.Incidentally, living in an actually safe is not a safe place.

41,tabuno,Almost Pulls Off A Bourne Identity Plus Thriller,8,17 January 2019,"12 February 2012. If not for a few flaws and a typical action-thriller ending, Safe House could have risen to one of the Denzel Washington Training Day (2001) best movies. The cinematography was excellent with a smooth editing between gritty and theatrical film processing. The beginning set up through most of the movie towards the ending had a heavy-weight, serious and Bourne Identity (2002) and Spy Game (2001) tightness and detailed script with strong CIA behind the scenes intelligence moves as well as on the ground captivating action.Unfortunately, the movie is let down slightly by (1) the overly prolong car fight between Denzel and Washington which based on Denzel's background would have ended much faster; (2) by Denzel's failure to use a radio while on the run (note Bourne Identity early scene at the Embassy), (3) by Reynold's later meeting with his girlfriend which likely couldn't have occurred the way it did, (4) overuse of extended chase/fight scenes later in the movie which seemed unnecessary and a bit unbelievable. There is also one scene which based on the experience of Denzel's character versus Reynold's character, the outcome in one fight scene seemed to be reversed to what the audience would be expected to occur. The ending also was overly extended to include an unnecessary typical American movie espionage ending (spoiler hint - Wil Smith) and that even had slight suggestion of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (2011). A possible alternative ending that would have had a much more lasting emotional impact would have been the Brendan-Reynold's meeting towards the end of the movie which still would have tied up the loose nices quite nicely.Safe House was a solid action thriller, very well shot, with good pacing, and perhaps in some ways even a level above that of The Bourne Identity with Reynold's character offered a plot and also took even more time with relational and personal issues that don't get enough screen time in many action thrillers, though again the ending seems too cute and convenient. Worth a trip to the theater or on demand in the future.",Safe House
42,nairtejas,"Same Old, Banal Story With One New, Unsurprising Feature. ♦ 56%",6,2 July 2013,"The title suggests everything, but they say - don't judge a movie by its title. So there I go.A sequence involving Denzel Washington towards the end truly says everything about the casting & their performances. Brilliant. Ryan Reynolds has pulled off this action thriller with absolute finesse. But, the supporting cast either went too cranky, or were expressionless. Or that's the way these CIA people look. Doesn't matter.What matters is the story & it is clichéd. Top to bottom. Every single detail in the plot could be found in some other run-of-the-mill action movie where some agents are corrupt & blah blah blah. It starts up well, successfully creating a suspense in our minds, but then it gradually loses pace, not with the narration, but with the scheme. ""Same old story,"" you think!Safe houses are depicted with less details and that is the feature I was talking about. Nothing interesting. Action sequences are very good, guns go off here & there, weaponless stunts are worth watching, music is upbeat, direction is good, average cinematography, predictable twists, much more predictable climax & superfluous artwork/stage-work. A critical 5.6/10.BOTTOM LINE: Nothing new, it has to offer. Not Recommended unless it is pure mêlée/weapon action you are looking for.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

43,The-Sarkologist,Found myself waiting for the movie to end.,4,18 February 2012,"I decided to see this film with my brother because the TV networks (not that I watch huge amounts of TV, but sometimes you simply cannot escape the ads) had been constantly playing the trailers, and in a way it intrigued me. However, once again, the axiom 'you can't judge a book by its cover' or in relation to movies, 'you can't judge a film by its trailer' come into play.This is a spy thriller, and I must admit that I am become quite bored with these type of movies. Sometimes they are intriguing and exciting, other times, as in the case of this film, they are not. I did love the James Bond movies, and in many cases a lot of these movies (and the authors of the books behind them) are trying to capitalise on the success of the James Bond franchise. However, as can be expected, they do tend to make changes to the script to set it apart from the original.As I said, some spy thrillers are really good (From Paris with Love, Chuck) but many of them end up being quite dull and long. This film does fall into the category of the 'Chuck clones' as I tend to call them. The reason that I set Chuck as a standard is because I really enjoyed the series. The clone aspect of it is that the protagonist tends to me a young man who wants to break into the spy world, and the movie is the first mission that he goes on, and upon success, he graduates to become a spy. In a number of cases though, the graduation results in huge embarrassment to the spy community (as in the case of this film).Thus we can see the quest narrative playing out again, along with the theme of the character coming out on his own. In this film, the protagonist is a safe-house keeper, and is job is pretty much to mind a safe house. However, a former agent appears in the safe house, is tortured, and in the middle of the torture, the house is attacked and all the occupants, expect the former spy and the protagonist, escape. Seeing this as an opportunity to prove himself, the protagonist disobeys orders, and goes out to complete the mission.Another theme is the idea of the passing on of a baton. We see this a number of times in Hollywood movies, where a major actor (say Sean Connery or Harrison Ford) come in as a supporting character, while a younger, up and coming actor, plays the role of the main protagonist. In a number of ways it can be seen as a major Hollywood star introducing a new actor, with a lot of potential, to take over his roles. Sometimes this happens, other times it doesn't. In my view, though, having grown up in the Eighties and Nineties, my mind tends to drift back to these famous actors of yesteryear, however the newer actors don't really impress me all that much.",Safe House
44,UniqueParticle,Amazing thrill ride,9,31 March 2021,I can't believe there was a few that gave it a 7 Safe House is an exceptional experience with some of the emotional scenes ever for an action film! Daniel Espinosa created such a gem in my opinion that is well orchestrated. Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington are a great duo surprised they haven't done more together. I own at least 300 plus movies I should own this too maybe even Life by the same director that's very good too!,Safe House
45,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Weary plot points and quite tiring, only saved by the cast and some moments.",6,1 June 2013,"Good premise, heavyweight stars, and lots of action. That's ""Safe House"" in a nutshell. However, it doesn't deliver all that much due to its heavy clichés but worst of all, they didn't have a good director behind this. My advice for him - and for what I've read his next feature will team Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy - is to watch real movies instead of MTV clips or just the latest releases. One credit behind Daniel Espinoza and Hollywood already thinks he can pull the strings and direct big caliber stars like Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. And if ""Safe House"" is a little appealing and good is because of them and the supporting cast with names like Brendan Gleeson, Rubén Blades, Vera Farmiga and Sam Shepard doing a good job. What's it about? Reynolds is responsible for taking care of one of those safe houses run by CIA to held prisoners that must be kept in secrecy due to their valuable contributions, informations on terrorism. The bad news is that Reynolds is someone who never had much of field action and now he's put into jeopardy when he's assigned in taking care of Frost (Denzel), who is about to be rescued by dangerous types with heavy artillery. Sounds a bit like ""3:10 to Yuma"" but it's not a western. But both concerns trust issues in face of danger and sometimes the help may come from the least expected person. The agent's mission is to transfer Frost from their uncovered safe house to another safe location, and discover which information the man is hiding.Nothing new but a little fun to watch. Tiresome, rushed, confusing and mumbled with its few words (awful sound editing/mixing), ""Safe House"" has some inspired moments (the dumb mistake committed by the agent in the stadium, which resulted in a great sequence; the house fight towards its conclusion, just to mention a few) but that's that. A movie this huge should be more ambitious instead of being shallow and bland, lacking of intelligence, and surrounded with predictable parts. And it's a strange action flick that generates more sympathy with its ""villain"" than for its dramatic hero. Washington easily steals the show from Reynolds (one of the very few roles of his I didn't care much for him.) and he's the reason why you should watch this film. Couldn't end this without a minor rant about the terrible editing. Action means following the action, not necessarily being the action. We need to see what's going on, eyes were made to see, analyze, view and not just go up and down, back and forth trying to understand what's going on. Espinosa and many other young (sometimes even veteran) directors fail to comprehend that. No planning, just a bunch of shaky camera held by someone suffering from delirium tremens and they think you have a movie. No, you don't have a movie. Almost there... 6/10",Safe House
46,zkonedog,Lacks Plot & Is Not A Psychological Thriller As Advertised,3,8 March 2017,"I went to see ""Safe House"" in the theater for two reasons: 1. I like psychological thrillers (what this movie was advertised at); and 2. I am a fan of Denzel Washington. Sadly, the film fails miserably to succeed on #1 and only gives glimpses of #2.For a basic plot summary, ""Safe House"" sees known criminal (and former CIA operative) Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) walk into a U.S. embassy for protection after a secret information- selling deal goes bad. While the CIA tries to figure out what Frost is really up to, he is broken out of a secure facility by the men pursuing him, with only rookie CIA operative Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) able to ""protect"" him.What needs to be cleared up right away, however, is that ""Safe House"" is NOT the psychological thriller as advertised in the trailer. Every single ""psych"" moment is shown in the trailer...there is nothing more. Instead, it is a straight-forward action/adventure romp with plenty of bullets, car crashes, and fisticuffs to satisfy the adrenaline junkies.Where this movie fails miserably, though, is that the plot and direction are an absolute mess from beginning to end. Though containing all the trappings of an interesting movie, all the wrong aspects are focused on. What should have (and could have) been a tense psychological thriller instead is one prolonged action scene after another with tiny little ""plot moments"" thrown in between them so that the whole thing doesn't fall apart.About the only redeeming quality of the movie is Denzel. Though his character is regrettably given very little to do throughout the movie, he still shines as the ""tough guy"" in a number of scenes (again, though, nothing that isn't shown in the trailer). After taking a break from his ""Man on Fire"" or ""Deju Vu"" type characters, it seemed as if, in ""Safe House"", Denzel was venturing back into that territory once again.Overall, ""Safe House"" will only be enjoyed by those who like having their senses stimulated at the cinema. It does contain pulse-pounding action, but those looking for any plot or character development will be severely disappointed and should look elsewhere for a Denzel fix.",Safe House
47,Floated2,"Gritty, Intense and Keeps you Entertained",7,12 December 2013,"Having passed upon seeing Safe House, I didn't have such high expectations as I was expecting another typical big budget action thriller. However, upon viewing Safe House, my expectations were met and a little more. Safe House is fairly predictable and doesn't contain the best story but the film has a certain charm that is lead by its lead actors Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. Right from the start, Safe House wheels you in and it becomes a great thrill ride.Safe House was far grittier than expected and more so than the typical Hollywood fares nowadays. It fits its R rating appropriately as it doesn't shy away from the violence. The stunts are also well performed. Washington and Reynolds is what specifically makes the film great as they made a great duo and made their roles believable as ever.The film really picks its pace once we see the first encounter between Washington and Reynolds. We then see how they communicate as it is clear they do not like one another, then as the film progress they become closer (which is expected). Including some great action scenes such as a very thrilling car chase scene where Reynolds kidnaps and takes Washington with him, realizing they are being chased by folks of the mafia government. The film really hits at the scene where Reynolds takes Washington to the sporting event (about 50 minutes in), and we witness the havoc commencing. It follows by Washington escaping, under the loose and Reynolds being taken by the police. From there on out is where I think the film picks up.The ending could be seen as a cop out and is fairly predictable, where they could have went another direction, as the rating lowers for myself. However it was understood why it all happened. Safe House is what is advertised. As a rewatch 11.25.20' and over 8 years since the initial theatrical release, Safe House holds up well and is a great and thrilling ride.",Safe House
48,TheMovieDiorama,Safe House is a well acted action thriller.,7,9 March 2018,"I mean if you are going to bring in Ryan Reynolds, Denzel Washington, Brendan Gleeson and Vera Farmiga...you're pretty much halfway to making a good film. Yet somehow this still fell short from being great. We follow Washington who plays a dangerous renegade with important information. On the run from mercenaries that raided a safe house, Reynolds attempts to prove himself by bringing him in. Full of espionage, double crossing and a damn convoluted plot in an attempt to make it engaging. But in actual fact, it's just generic. If you've watched this, then you'll probably remember nothing about the story. Seriously, give it a shot. Acting though was spot on. Washington and Reynolds made for an uneasy chemistry and the two work well together. Kind of like a master and his apprentice, except this master is on the opposite side of the law to his apprentice. Farmiga, criminally underrated by the way, was underused. Her character was pretty much pointless which infuriates me every time I watch this. Gleeson was good, but again was underused until the final act. The action scenes were great, the first act is definitely the most lively. A car crash, a raided safe house and a car chase in Cape Town. It was exhilarating and Daniel Espinosa filmed it rather well. Sound mixing was noteworthy, the gun shots were loud and piercing which always gets me pumped when watching an action flick. The locations were varied, from the streets of Cape Town to a football stadium filled with hooligans playing vuvuzelas (do you remember them? Flipping awful things). Just nothing felt fresh. It's a ""been there done that"" scenario too scared to try something new in case the film doesn't make back its budget. If the plot was engaging, this would've been a great surprise but sadly it's just good. Entirely watchable and well crafted, but nothing outstanding.",Safe House

The twist (the bad guy) is too easy to detect right in the beginning but anyway, good action and a fast story that doesn't drag around make Safe House no Oscar material but a fine entertaining joyride.

50,Ed-Shullivan,Smash..... Crackle.....Flop,2,3 September 2013,"What a waste of time this movie was. They must have paid Denzel Washington a Kings ransom to star in this piece of crap, thus my summary statement. The entire movie was a continual barrage of loud and colorful gunfire, with Denzel and Ryan running from an endless stream of bad guys, and in some cases supposedly good guys turned bad guys. As for Ryan Reynolds, the guy absorbed maybe a thousand punches in an endless stream of boring hand to hand (and kicks) combat in which were landed square hits to every limb on his body. Reynolds was hit with clubs, shot at, cut and even stabbed with glass shards, and when the war was over, there was that good looking Hollywood star, Ryan Reynolds without a single scar or bruise. Heck he wasn't even limping. What a true action hero. NOT!!!I can just envision some of the cast members such as Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard, Denzel and Ryan sitting around after shooting was completed and telling each other, ""how the heck are we ever going to sell this crap to the critics and the public?"" I won't expect to see any of the aforementioned actors working again any time soon with the director, Daniel Espinosa. It would appear to me that Daniel spent the last ten years playing XBOX war games and his idea of a fascinating action/thriller is a continual barrage of guns and bombs exploding, and crowds of people at wide open sporting events in South Africa running away to avoid the mayhem. As for me, I left for a bio break and when I returned the scene I left just seemed to be looping, and I could not wait for the movie to end.I would not waste a dollar on renting this movie. As for the copy I purchased I plan to re-gift it to someone I want to get even with one day.",Safe House
51,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A notch above the typical CIA action-thriller,7,11 June 2012,"Let's hope that Hollywood's portrayal of the CIA is off, otherwise at this point every person with an appetite for action-thrillers knows exactly what goes on at Langley. ""Safe House"" is the latest ""Bourne""-inspired romp featuring armed-and-dangerous Americans running, driving and parkouring through an exotic locale. Mostly well-paced and featuring an unusual relationship between leads Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington, ""Safe House"" entertains and carves out its own niche, though it ultimately stumbles over its (and its genres) own predictability.The story gives us Washington just how we like him—morally unpredictable. Tobin Frost is a longtime CIA field agent gone rogue who delivers himself into the protection of the U.S Consulate in South Africa to avoid some men who want him dead. Doing so puts him back on the CIA's map and he is subsequently delivered to a local safe house attended by aspiring field agent Matt Weston (Reynolds). When the safe house is compromised, the two go on the run, but Weston must also keep the dangerous Frost in his custody.David Guggenheim's screenplay doesn't hide much from the audience here: if a CIA safe house has been compromised, than somebody can't be trusted, and the folks at the top (Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard) are so cardboard that it hardly matters who's to blame. Still, the ride there will suffice, especially when it features the Reynolds-Washington dynamic.Washington is the archetype of ambiguity, which ironically makes him a little less ambiguous, but few do what he does well as well as he does. Reynolds refreshingly averts from his sarcastic hero routine to play a man who rises to meet the stakes while sticking to his guns all the same. Reynolds' caliber wasn't needed for the role of Weston by any means, but he does it well and proves his likable qualities.Their exchanges mostly consist of Frost trying to impart his broken view of life and the Agency unto Weston and then we wait to see if Weston breaks. The only real uncertainty is what Frost's next move will be as he tries to shake his ""escort."" With a traitor in the CIA, we also know that wherever they go, someone will be after them.Director Daniel Espinosa might not be a graduate of the Paul Greengrass School for Shaky Cam, but he definitely audited a good number of classes to say the least. Perhaps it's the absurd degree of hand-to-hand combat featured in the film that evokes the ""Bourne"" comparison (or the chase atop the slum houses), but at the least it does not cheat on the action. There isn't much spectacle, but that's what makes it more in the thriller vein as well.In general, Espinosa gets above-average grades for delivering the kinetic style necessary to make a basic riff on the cat-and-mouse thriller entertain. He would certainly do better with better material at his disposal.There's just enough fresh material in ""Safe House"" to keep the story interesting and the leads certainly help with keeping us invested in the outcomes of their characters. That's more than most standard-order action-thrillers can boast, and ""Safe House"" deserves at least that much credit.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Safe House
52,imseeg,Jason Bourne CLONE,7,5 May 2018,"Safe House is best described as a fullblown Jason Bourne copy. That's it's strength and it's weakness. It has got the same sort of chases, suspense, shootouts and an underdog character who wins in the end, just as in the Bourne movies.The good: acting in ""Safe House"" is VERY good though. Denzel Washington really delivers. And so does Ryan Reynolds, for his standards anyway. And however much it looks like a copy of another Jason Bourne movie, I do keep watching this movie year after year, with much enjoyment, so it is pushing all the right buttons...The bad: there is way too many shaky cam action. Even in dialogue scenes the shaky cam keeps hovering around. There are no breathers in this movie. I need that to appreciate the action that follows. Now there are just too much fighting scenes following each other without any breathers, to a level where the overkill of action even becomes tedious at moments.Conlusion: sometimes it is just nice to see a good B-action movie just for the sake of it.

With hundreds of thousands of films already in existence, and everyone of them trying to be as original as the last, there aren't a lot of fresh ideas out there to be toyed around with. That being said you'd expect a movie with big stars and a big budget to have at least one. This unfortunately, did not.For what it lacks in originality, its adequate action sequences keep it from being unwatchable. The memorable dialogue is minimal, and the actors put in a lazy performance. Reynolds never commits himself to the role and Washington does it about as 'by the book' as is possible. None of the supporting roles are in the least bit memorable.The filmmakers would've been well advised to take notes of 2006's Blood Diamond considering what I think they were trying to achieve here. Unfortunately though it appears they didn't and what results is the audience being left with a 'seen it all before' feeling afterwards. Disappointing.",Safe House

Anyhow, the related events-actions created are exciting, chases and crosses/double-crosses are catchy and clichés used provide additional value to overall thrill (I can imagine it is tempting to use demonstrations, crowded stadiums and slums for unexpected twists and turns). Tensions are present throughout the movie, only the ending has slower aspects and some levels - probably left this way for a possible sequel.The cast is splendid, starting with Denzel Washington (as Tobin Frost), who is really a talented and versatile actor; besides, his character's past lets him credibly participate in the following events. His chemistry with Ryan Reynolds (Matt Weston) out there and logically changing; btw, I am not much into Reynolds as actor, but he performed well here (although I would have preferred e.g. Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing this part). The movie contains also some great supporting roles, e.g. Vera Farmiga as Catherine Linklater and Brendan Gleeson as David Barlow.

56,dfranzen70,Another solid spy movie with top performances,7,19 December 2012,"Safe House, ironically titled, is a slice above your standard man-on- the-run thriller, combining parts of the Bourne films with, well, every government conspiracy movie ever. What makes it work are the flawless performances by Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds and a strong supporting cast (Brendan Gleeson and Vera Farmiga). It does have its twists, and they're plausible. It's a violent, searing, and gritty film that grabs you by the shoulders and shakes real hard.Reynolds is Matt Weston, which sounds like a superhero's alter ego. Weston is a CIA employee who runs a safe house in South Africa. Nothing ever happens in the safe house. Until one fateful day, when one of the most wanted men in the world waltzes into the U.S. Consulate in South Africa to turn himself in. That man, Tobin Frost, is a notorious seller of secrets, a man known to have sold out his country years ago. And of course, he's the best agent ever, as they typically are in these movies, and here he's played by Washington, who actually is one of the best actors ever. Now, a contrived script would have us believe that Frost is innocent, that this is all one big frame job to cover up something or other, but director Daniel Espinosa never pretends that Frost is anything but a bad guy. Well, maybe not terrible, but most certainly not a moral compass. So when he's dragged to Weston's safe house and then - to Weston's chagrin - waterboarded, your first thought is that this may as well be SOP for the CIA, as far as we know. The CIA wants something from Frost, but he's calm and collected, and his chief captor (an oily Robert Patrick) is not. And then, making a tough situation untenable, the house itself is attacked by unknown outside forces. Someone else wants Frost. Safe house, indeed.All of this leads to Weston and Frost on the run from pretty much everyone. Back home, CIA chiefs Farmiga and Gleeson argue over whose fault it is that Frost has been compromised, and Sam Shephard, playing their boss, tells them to skedaddle on over to South Africa. Okay, he didn't say ""skedaddle,"" but he could have. Weston loses Frost, finds him, loses him, and so on through a series of entertaining action scenes in which civilians and cops alike are shot down, which rarely happens in these movies (usually, stray bullets just miss everyone). And it's on to the new safe house! Should go swimmingly.This is a very good pairing, Washington and Reynolds. Both are versatile actors, playing comic, dramatic, good guy, bad guy, jerk. Reynolds is believable as the newbie who wants to get away from South Africa and be somewhere with his French girlfriend. Wouldn't we all, Matt? But darn it, he just can't get a break until now. And Washington, who's more frequently the good guy hero (when he's not the down-and-out loser for whom one feels sympathy) is outstanding as the wily, conniving, but moralistic Frost. His ultimate motives are unclear, and that unpredictability plays in nicely with Washington's portrayal.Safe House is solid, riveting action that, although it has the veneer of a derivative plot, escapes the land of the cliché thanks to powerful acting, a tight script, and a genuinely nice twist near the end.",Safe House

And Ryan Reynolds' performance is wonderful too. However, what makes this movie so good is the story itself. It more than just about good guys and bad guys. It deals with broader themes. There are violent scenes but they are not gratuitous; they fit into the story. Also, the movie has great continuity. The story unfolds at the fast pace, which befits the nature of the movie.

The storyline follows a former Intelligence agent turned rogue for his own profit. When one of his missions goes wrong he's captured and sent to an overseas Safe House to be questioned and interrogated. Shortly after arriving the Safe House is attacked leaving one man to protect the former intelligence agent. He will find it hard to keep the former agent captive. This movie is directed by Daniel Espinosa (Child 44) and stars Denzel Washington (Training Day), Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern), Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), Vera Farmiga (The Departed), Brendan Gleeson (Troy) and Sam Shepard (Mud). The setup for this movie had a lot of potential as the opening action sequence and escape scene was well executed with great intensity and violence. As the primary storyline unfolds the movie gets ridiculous and feels like it is trying too hard. Washington was solid in this movie and delivers his character well but Reynolds felt like he was trying to find himself in the cinematic universe and seemed lost and out of place. The military leadership conversations were boring and every decision and effort seemed unrealistic. This is a very average addition to the action genre that I wouldn't go too out of my way to see.

I'm your house guest.¨ I can't remember ever watching a Denzel Washington film and being disappointed; he always seems to bring his game or at least choose interesting projects because I always end up enjoying his movies. He is one of the best actors of our time and he is really entertaining. Safe House may not be original or have the best script in the world, but it does have plenty of thrills and good performances to keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the movie.

This is a movie that won't stick with you long, but it is good enough to entertain you for two hours and put a smile on your face. I know I can always count on Denzel Washington, and this movie is also powered by Ryan Reynolds performance as well. Both actors bring their A game and deliver a solid entertaining film. I don't know how relatively unknown Swedish director, Daniel Espinosa, got such talented actors to star in his film, but he can be thankful for it because this movie probably wouldn't have worked without them. The script written by David Guggenheim isn't original, several scenes are predictable, but that didn't ruin the film for me. I still had a great time with Safe House. I really didn't like some of the shaky camera work, but I guess it's a trend for several directors these days.Denzel Washington is Tobin Frost, a former CIA agent who is now one of the most wanted men in the world after going rogue and selling classified information. He runs into a former MI6 agent in Cape Town, South Africa who gives him a disk containing what would seem as some very important information because as soon as he receives it he has dozens of people shooting at him and running after him. Frost has no other alternative but turn himself in at the United States consulate office before these men can get to him. Frost is taken to a Safe House which is guarded by rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). Matt's contact is David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) who lets him know that the guest will be arriving soon. When Frost arrives along with the CIA team they are ambushed by the same men that were after him before, and Matt has no other choice but to escape with Frost before these guys get to him. Matt has to deal with protecting Frost while at the same time not allowing him to escape and also figuring out who he can trust in the CIA agent because apparently someone is trying to get to them. Matt is forced into having to protect the enemy, but he will soon find out that the enemy could also come from within.Safe House will probably be one more of those movies you will forget all about because it lacks originality and has nothing memorable about them, but I guarantee you will be entertained during two solid hours thanks to some good performances from Washington and Reynolds. There are also some interesting secondary actors like Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Ruben Blades, Robert Patrick, and Sam Shepard who bring their talents to the table, but the truth of the matter is that the success of the film relies entirely on Reynolds and Washington who have proved yet again to be great and entertaining actors. These guys are doing what they do best: action thrillers and despite not having remarkable material to work with they still manage to entertain and keep us at the edge of our seats. Safe House is an enjoyable film, but just don't expect much more than that. Not among Washington's best work, but even mediocre Washington can carry a movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Safe House

In saying that though there was also nothing memorable here, one of those heavy action movies that I will forget completely in about a week.It actually reminded me of that British military/special ops show that ran on Cinemax (Strikeback), kinda gritty, violent, high-speed and bloody but also mindless.Of course I enjoyed the cast, Denzel Washington always preforms and Ryan Reynolds does a great job as the man out to prove himself by bringing him in. I really enjoyed the power struggle between the two of them and wow do they both get beat up by the end of this.Reynolds plays a rookie CIA operative, frustrated by his inactive, backwater post who finds himself on the run with a rogue former intelligence office (Washington) after the South African safe house comes under attack by heavily armed mercenaries.

Denzel stars in high calibre, expensive big pieces of exciting & thrilling entertainment & that's what movies was always about to me & i love Denzel like i do Will Smith, both legends of Cinema.Safe house is another high quality action Thriller with a great Denzel on top form again & this time he plays a rogue agent who is wanted all over the world & has been given a file that can unleashe all the corruption from the highest people in all governments, so he is a wanted man dead or alive.Denzel is teamed up with Ryan Reynolds as a young C. I. A agent who is in charge of looking after Denzel from the safe house that was Seiged to next safe house miles away, it's a good part for Reynolds as the kind of rookie agent that is way out of his depth & I'm not a big Reynolds fan but he is very good here & gives a great performance, he was also very good in Smokin' Aces, i like Reynolds when he's not trying to be funny, he's better doing action & more intense that silly.Safe House is a beautiful looking film with a gritty look & vibrant colours & fantastic bursts of explosive action & blood shed & some cool bit parts for some greats like Robert Patrick & Joel Kinnaman but the cast is solid throughout & the exciting thrilling chase scenes are fantastic, this is a well crafted sweaty actioner with two Class leads forced to work together with lots of people hunting them down to kill them.I love films like this & Denzel lifts it to a higher quality of action film.Safe House probably won't ever be an action Classic or anything but its still alot of bloody fun.As said its got a nice little role for one of my personal favourite actors: Robert Patrick. This guy is a great supporting actor or ""Character Actor"" as they say & he always gives a decent intense performance & does so here. It's always great when Patrick pops up in a movie.",Safe House
63,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Nothing great, but well worth a watch",6,22 July 2016,"Safe House is cut from the same cloth as many a spy movie, but this horse doesn't have quite as much pisss and vinegar as other ones in the stable, notably the Bourne trilogy. It's more of a slow burn, peppered with a few purposeful action sequences and quite a lot of time spent with Denzel Washington's world weary spook Tobin Frost, a veteran operative who has gone severely rogue after escaping the grasp of a nasty CIA interrogator (Robert Patrick). He's soon in the hands of rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) who has been left to guard an agency safe house in Europe, now overrun with shadowy special ops dudes out to snuff Frost. The two of them are forced on the run together, and attempt to smoke out those behind the chaos, who turn out to be a little closer to home than they thought (don't they always, in these types of movies?). Weston is young, naive and idealistic, Frost is bitter, jaded and ready to burn the agency down around him for what his career has made him do. They're a formulaic pair made believable by the two actors, both putting in admirable work. Brendan Gleeson is great as Westons's dodgy handler, Vera Farmiga shows moral conflict in those perfect blue eyes as another paper pusher in Langley, and Sam Shepherd smarms it up as the CIA top dog. It was nice to see Ruben Blades as well, who doesn't work nearly enough, and watch for a sly cameo from Liam Cunningham as an ex MI6 agent. It's not the greatest or the most memorable film, but it does the trick well enough, has a satisfying R rated edge to its violence and benefits from Washington being nice and rough around the edges. There's a downbeat quality to it to, as Weston watches the futility inherent in the life of a spy unfold in Frost's actions, which are leading nowhere but a self inflicted dead for a cause that's bigger than both of them, but ultimately leaves them in the dust. Solid, if just above average stuff.",Safe House

The story presents nothing new and is about the usual stereotypes: the good one turn out to be the bad ones, the bad ones turn out to be the good ones, the weak ones turn out to be the strong ones and so one. I think you get what I mean. The movie has no big surprises after all.But if this kind of movie is well done, it can still merit a rating of eight points. I only give six point five and for this site seven points because of the mediocre camera work that was shaking and irritating at some points of the movie.The rest of the film is quite decent. The locations are interesting and the movie takes place in Cape Town in South Africa and not in Europe or North America. The fighting and action scenes are very well done and with the visual and sound effects in cinema, it's a pleasant entertainment to watch this movie for sure. It's a good flick to change your mind, to relax and to take a break from your everyday life for sure. The acting is also rather good with two strong lead actors that are a very cool Denzel Washington and a sympathetic and determined Ryan Reynolds.The only little flaw is that I would have liked to know more about both characters, especially about their past and what really led them to do what they actually do in the movie.The movie simply has not the greatest script to stand out among many other similar flicks but it's still a good film.

Now I am a fan of both Ryan and Denzel's work in the films they have appeared in before, but this one is just nonsensical.

68,AudioFileZ,Well Paced Tension With Good Chemistry From Washington & Reynolds,7,27 December 2013,"Though you've seen this story before, intelligence agencies running amok complete with moles, here you get compelling performances by Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. Set in the post ""wiki-leaks"" aftermath, but before the Snowden debacle, it would seem the timing of a story about a host of rogue agencies and agents, who answer to no one, isn't too far fetched if somewhat hackneyed.Safe House takes the viewer on a ride. Starting with Denzel's character, Tobin Frost, securing an ultra-sensitive file of who's who among international spies, it simply doesn't take but a few minutes to segue into heavy action. The filming of Frost's escape from a cadre of eastern types immediately engages the viewer. As Frost exhausts his ""outs"" he simply finds himself at the doorstep of the American Embassy in South Africa. Frost, a turned ex-CIA agent, realizes he'll be arrested. He'll take this outcome over the sure death which was quickly closing in. Being an extreme high-value target with, perhaps, a most damaging piece of in tel, Frost is moved to a ""safe house"". Naturally, the safe house is anything but and true to the steady pace of the action it quickly goes sideways. Enter Matt Westin, the safe house host, whose boring job is about to boil over into deadly territory - so much for boredom. What follows is a harrowing run from those who would seek to kill Frost with Westin still believing his job is to bring in Frost.The problem is a mole from within constantly gives Frost's location away. Combine that with a CIA director who would rather ""kill 'em all"" instead of risk the file seeing the light of day and everyone is expendable. Thus, as Westin seeks to bring Frost in he begins to realize the real enemy isn't Frost. It's the excellent interplay between Denzel Washington's Tobin Frost and Ryan Reynold's Matt Westin that keeps a story you can basically guess urgent. As already mentioned, the story is constant motion. Inserted are some fully realized excellent chase scenes both on foot and in vehicles. Yes, these scenes are done really well as they drive home the dire situation Westin's job has suddenly become.The ending has a few twists too which make for a satisfying finale. All in all, a recommended spy conspiracy film despite a lack of originality. Well done.",Safe House

72,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Safe House (2012),6,17 June 2012,"Safe House represents a high pedigree of action talent, but unfortunately plays it far too safe in its execution. Ryan Reynolds plays a CIA agent, though in actual fact he spends most of his time just waiting for a phone to ring as he is in charge of a safe house. After twelve months of nothing, one of the CIA's most wanted men, a turn-coat agent played by Denzel Washington, is brought to the house. The place soon erupts in gunfire, and Reynolds must protect Washington but feels unable to trust his own team. The film craves to be Bourne, with rooftop running chases, expert car chases, gritty cinematography and well executed but scrappy fights. In fact the fights here are excellent, as they demonstrate some good choreography, but at the same time incorporate some rough edges, for example ear twisting and rubbing glass in peoples faces. It really does make it feel as though these guys are trained, but the fights are real. The car chases are also highly exciting, with practical effects really adding to the carnage. Reynolds is excellent as Matt Weston. He plays a man bored of his current position but scared when a chance to prove himself arises. He feels like an actual human, being brave and kicking arse, but also fearing for his life. Washington plays his usual role, and almost comes across as a MacGuffin. Still, Washington putting in no effort is better than some actors on their best days. The film's real flaw is being too similar to previous efforts and having a pointless ""mole"" plot. We are only introduced to two characters it could feasibly be, all the other name actors pop in for a cameo before being killed off. So you have a 50/50 guess at who it is, and even that's pretty obvious to work out. A great film for Reynolds, and some brilliant touches throughout.

76,bob-rutzel-1,Terrific Thriller,9,6 June 2012,"CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a housekeeper of a Safe House in Cape Town, South Africa and is bored with the inactivity the job entails. That is, until Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) a rogue agent and traitor comes there for interrogation. Then the house comes under attack. The question is why did Tobin Frost turn himself into the US Consulate in the first place and who is after him? And, why do the CIA bigwigs believe Frost is a traitor? And, how did the bad guys know that Frost was in the Safe House? Inquiring minds want to know. And, so does Matt.Most of the movie shows Matt and Tobin Frost on the run with exciting car chases, and shoot-outs. In some cases they help each other, but both know Matt still has a job to do and that is to bring Frost in. All of a sudden, Matt is finding out his job isn't so boring after all. There are some twists that seem contrived just so we, in the audience, didn't know who or what to believe: the good guys or the bad guys and, just who are the good guys and bad guys anyway? We like it best when we know who is who. Bummer. In many ways Denzel Washington is like a George Clooney in that their facial expressions say more than their words. And, that is what we have here. We are told Denzel's character, Tobin Frost, is a traitor, and the evidence presented is overwhelming, but when we look at Tobin's face, we feel there is something more going on. And, that boys and girls, gives us hope.All in all, this has good excitement, tension and suspense and the moments we wait for most are when Denzel's Tobin Frost speaks. We go to a Denzel Washington movie to hear Denzel Washington talk and watch his facial expressions. Now you know why we pay the money. For a token admission fee what we get back is pure gold. And, that is what we have here. This is not to take anything away from the rest of the cast and Ryan Reynold's Matt Weston, but this is a Denzel Washington show. The entire cast and Reynolds did good, but we paid for Denzel and were not disappointed. Violence: Yes, strong too. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, but not much.",Safe House
77,moviexclusive,"The high-octane action it packs from start to finish promises a thrilling, adrenaline-pumping ride- but this is no Bourne despite its ambitions at being so",7,8 February 2012,"You can gauge how enduring a movie will be just by looking at the number of films of the same genre that boast a similar style, and when it comes to CIA espionage thrillers, it's safe to say that the Bourne trilogy has become something of a cultural touchstone. There are plenty of similarities between Swedish director Daniel Espinosa's first Hollywood film 'Safe House' and the latter two pictures of the Bourne trilogy- and we're not simply talking about the fact that both of them centre around an expert CIA operative (think the best of the best) gone rogue.The enigma in this case is a certain Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), who dropped off the grid nine years ago but has since re-emerged in Cape Town in possession of some sensitive intel courtesy of a contact that he has in MI6. When his contact gets shot and he ends up cornered following an intense foot chase by some armed mercenaries, Tobin checks in at the U.S. Consulate and is immediately picked up by Langley. As the bigwigs (played by a classy trio of Sam Shepard, Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson) scramble from back at headquarters behind their computer screens, Tobin is transported to a safe house for interrogation- though as the extraction team led by Robert Patrick's Daniel Kiefer quickly discovers, their tactics are no match for the man.Little is particularly inspired in David Guggenheim's story, but if there is one thing that he gets right, it is turning this CIA thriller into an odd-couple pairing. So at the safe house, Tobin will meet rookie agent Matt Weston, a low-level ""housekeeper"" who can hardly wait for his Langley boss David Barlow (Gleeson) to transfer him into the field. The encounter between the grizzled veteran Tobin and the naïve newbie Matt turns out something like Denzel's Academy-Award winning movie 'Training Day', and Matt quickly learns over the course of one harried day that things aren't always as simple as they seem.Their initial mutual distrust makes for gripping viewing, as Espinosa keeps his audience on tenterhooks wondering when and how the wily Tobin will give his captor the slip. That waiting pays off immensely when Tobin finally pulls the rug from under Matt at a crowded Green Point Stadium (one of the Cape Town's landmarks on account that it hosted the 2008 World Cup) in a thrillingly-choreographed sequence that is quite simply the highlight of the entire film.But every subsequent skirmish with the same band of mercenaries who raided Matt's safe house for Tobin leads Matt to question if there might be some truth in Tobin's accusations of corruption at the highest level, especially since their assailants always seem to be one step ahead of them. It's no secret how it turns out, and indeed when the big reveal comes, it's probably safe to say that you would have already guessed it.In place of a plot with little surprises, Espinosa has opted to emphasise Matt's transformation from fresh-eyed agent to disillusioned operative, pausing for effect during some crucial scenes for his audience to appreciate Matt's predicament. His efforts at character development are only half-successful- not only is there little time in between the exploding mayhem, the lacklustre script that possesses none of the dramatic heft compared to 'Training Day' does it no favours as well.Worse still, the intriguing psychological interplay between the two characters is replaced halfway through the movie by an altogether more straightforward cat-and-mouse game as both men team up to stay ahead of the mercenaries. The action after this point is relentless, exploiting the locations in and around Cape Town for maximum thrills- and while action junkies may find good reason to cheer at the non-stop on screen bombast, others looking for the smarts and flair of the Bourne series will likely be disappointed.That doesn't mean that it doesn't try hard to emulate the franchise; besides being shot in the same shaky-cam style (right down to having the same d.p. Oliver Wood), the action design- from Denzel's fighting style to the use of locations (a chase along the rooftops of a shantytown outside the city is particularly reminiscent of 'The Bourne Ultimatum') also hews closely to that in the trilogy. It still manages to get your adrenaline pumping all right- especially given Espinosa's keen sense of pacing- but the sense of déjà vu that one gets after watching this film is unmistakable.There's however no mistaking Washington's distinctive presence- though the 57-year-old actor can't match the physical agility of Matt Damon, he looks just as formidable and commanding with his signature poise. From critically-acclaimed dramas in the 1990s, Washington has in recent years- under the stewardship of Tony Scott- redefined himself as a compelling man of action, and this latest performance looks set to cement that reputation. Reynolds is on the other hand too nondescript to make much of an impression, his blandness even more pronounced next to Washington.Pity then that with such a gifted actor like Washington, this isn't the thinking man's action movie that it aspires to be thanks to lazy formulaic scriptwriting. It is nonetheless an assured Hollywood debut from Espinosa following his critically-acclaimed Swedish hit 'Snabba Cash' (or 'Easy Money'), and more than offers tense thrilling action for those in need of an adrenaline fix. The next Bourne it definitely is not, despite its obvious attempts at trying to be so, and this remains safely in the territory of slick action thrillers with more style than substance.",Safe House

At the core of 'Safe House' is actually one of the best spy/action storylines I've ever seen as it effectively takes an outsider right into the thick of the action so that the audience are truly scooped up and given a new angle to take. This not only allows for great opportunities to build tension though; it also allows the film to become, in some places, a rather neat commentary on espionage itself.

Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington together in a gritty, action packed thriller? Only good can come of this. I was partly correct. Upcoming A-lister Reynolds and veteran heavyweight Washington do make for a fantastic pairing on screen; they both share a natural appeal that reels you in. Unfortunately the material doesn't match up to their dedicated performances. David Guggenheim's predictable screenplay is lack-lustre at best; his ending is especially routine and lacking imagination. Behind the camera, Swedish director Daniel Espinosa does a better job, proving in his first American production that he can handle action scenes both small and large with flair and assurance. However he can't avoid a few missteps, most notably the ""frustratingly inaccurate henchmen"" syndrome that sees them hit everything other than our heroes. If you can look past these clichéd hang-ups and the grossly unoriginal storyline then Safe House will be your perfect night out at the movies.",Safe House

Also, if you've ever heard of Wikileaks or Anonymous, or Watergate or the Pentagon Papers (should I continue?), you know the movie before it starts.

Since I am straight, I don't think of him as dreamy, just possibly something more than another vacant Hollywood prettyboy. But, I digress. I taped Safe House a year ago off of one of the Fox movie channels. I got around to seeing it today. If I pretend not to have seen another spy movie in my almost 60 years, I guess the flick is okay.

There are also are some well choreographed fight scenes as well as some thrilling car crashes. The whole thing is watchable and likable, certainly similar to many thrillers seen in recent years. The movie's strength are the cast and the action's technical quality. During the third part twists are revealed and motivations are explained but the result is still effective. Although part of this has already been seen. To sum up I reckon everything works as a standalone piece, with good acting performances and hard action.",Safe House

When he is hounded by the criminals all over for his life and has nowhere to go , he surrenders himself to the US embassy in Capetown. He is held in a safe house whose keeper is young CIA agent Ryan Reynolds( Matt Weston) and has to look after the rogue assassin until the CIA team arrives and began their investigation. However , the house comes under attack and soon the rookie agent is on the run to track down Tobin Frost.So , when you hear about a movie starring Denzel Washington , immediately one thing comes to the mind – ""this is gonna be entertaining as hell"". Same thing goes here . The movie is full of cat –mouse chases with perky twists and turns good enough to quench your thirst for action thrillers. Of course , we have seen Washington playing baddie role in previous flicks ( Training Day ) but actor successfully comes out with yet another superb role. Direction is good with few scenes captivating and interesting. Screenplay is effective with few loose ends. Action sequences are mindblowing and has been picturised appropriately. Cinematoraphy is eye-catching. Background gels with the film. Story is well told. Coming to the performances , it is Washington's show all the way. He emotes so well through his eyes and expressions that leaves an impact. Ryan Reynolds is superb as a rookie CIA agent who needs an opportunity to show his potential. Overall , a fantabulous action thriller that is sure to be enjoyed especially if you are big fan of veteran actor Denzel Washington",Safe House
86,TheUnknown837-1,"I would rather sit through—and modestly enjoy—""Safe House"" again than revisit the number of the really bad films that we've gotten in the last six months.",7,17 June 2012,"Daniel Espinosa's ""Safe House"" is a thoroughly derivative and unremarkable thriller that works a lot better than it really deserves to. It has very little imagination; even the big plot twist reserved until the third act is in sight from ten miles away. The direction is mime-filmmaking eerily akin to Paul Greengrass. Even the acting, you could say, is not really remarkable. That is not to say that the performances by Denzel Washington, Ryan Reynolds, Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, and the rest of the cast are bad. The acting is not bad at all, but most of these folks are insistently reliable; good acting tends to come as a given whenever they are tied in with a project. The only big surprise is that Mr. Reynolds has finally put himself in a tolerable project. Last year was not his brightest. First he took the lead in ""Green Lantern,"" which was promising but very dull. Then he starred alongside Jason Bateman in ""The Change-Up"": a vile and disgusting excuse of a comedy that was my personal pick as the absolute worst movie of 2011. But now he puts his talents to better use. Alas, ""Safe House,"" though unimpressive on many levels, is nevertheless a modest success.Denzel Washington, being Denzel Washington, gets top billing. But the real lead belongs to Mr. Reynolds, as the story is more about his character: a timid man working secretly for the CIA, running ""safe houses"": disguised facilities where government captives and refugees are escorted and contained until further notice. Except for an opening sequence, the filmmakers choose to follow Mr. Reynolds and tell us far more about him than anybody else on the screen. He's the only one with any real sense of being a human being; Mr. Washington is the typical subhuman vigilante with a laconic sense of humor. Here lies one of the movie's weaknesses, one that threatens to collapse the whole project. Mr. Reynolds's dramatic dynamics, detailed as they are, do not have much passionate architecture. His relationship to his French fiancée (Nora Arnezeder) feels more forced than romantic. In a movie like this, where character background seems rather irrelevant, the old-fashioned approach with deliberately bland history—than is, history that is given to us—seems to be more suitable. As it does not get in the way of what is really happening.What is ""really happening"" are the entertaining routines of the espionage thriller. The captive and captor trying to outsmart each other and then teaming up as the plot thickens around them. The film's best sequence takes place in the middle, where Mr. Washington and Mr. Reynolds try to outwit each other in the midst of a crowded stadium, each of them relying upon the actions of the volunteer police officers watching them. In regards to the predictable plot twist, it also comes to aid the filmmakers. Let's face it. Sometimes familiarity enhances the fun of watching a movie. When it's done with a certain level of energy, and is acted as well as it is here, all those checkmarks on the list of clichés can service the enjoyment level. I'll admit it; sometimes I enjoy the pleasure of being smarter and more insightful than the characters.The action sequences, both on foot and on the road, are very well-filmed and entertaining. Foley used for the gunshots is appropriately sharp and ear-ringing. And even though director Espinosa is merely imitating Paul Greengrass, he does it fairly well. I guess I cannot really compliment him as anything more than a mime, but if you had told me that Mr. Greengrass himself had made ""Safe House,"" I would have come close to believing it. The screenplay even has cutaway scenes to a government facility in Virginia, eerily akin to the Treadstone scenes in Mr. Greengrass's two Jason Bourne movies. The only lapses would have been a couple of missing key shots, such as a shootout between Mr. Reynolds and a rogue police officer, in which we cut from a man shooting to an immediate shot of a body on the ground. Some atrocious jump cuts of Mr. Reynolds watching a water-boarding torture at the beginning are also giveaways.Overall, the movie is worth seeing once. Since 2012 is already off to a bad start, a decent but unimpressive movie that tells you nothing new is worth the price of a theater ticket or a DVD rental. In a better year for the movies, ""Safe House"" might have been filed away. I would rather sit through—and modestly enjoy—this again than revisit the number of the really bad films that we've gotten in the last six months.",Safe House

But sadly on the other hand this is a messy directed, somewhat lazily written film that hampers the commitment of the cast.

The romantic subplot is virtually nonexistent, the lighting is bad, the color looks like bad Kodachrome. However, Denzil Washington is compelling as usual and Ryan Reynolds is, as always, engaging. Nobody else is really on camera long enough to make much of an impression, except Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleason and Sam Shepard. The only thing that struck me about Farmiga is that she looks surprisingly bad, a pity because she was so stunning in ""Autumn in New York"" and ""Touching Evil"". Gleason does his best with a thankless role and Shepard can do this kind of character in his sleep. So again, we are left with another fine performance by Denzil Washington to keep this movie from being pretty much a total loss. I give ""Safe House"" a weak ""6"".",Safe House

And the urban legend put forth in ""Safe House"" is that of the Honorable, Small-Potatoes CIA Operative who Brings Down the Temple of Corruption, Returning the CIA to Honor and Dignity and Service to the Proles whose Taxes Pay their Ways.Perhaps you think this is a paranoid analysis. You're not paranoid if they *are* out to get you, and I'm not paranoid if this is pretty much the way the story winds up. And this *is* how it winds up.I think it's another case of (as J.R. ""Bob"" Dobbs said) people ""Paying to Know what they REALLY Think."" People will pay to watch violent action--sure, they will!

I'm afraid to say that I didn't find too much originality in Safe House. It felt very much like a paint by numbers approach to movie making that left you feeling slightly cheated by the end of the movie.Matt Weston is an inexperienced agent who is charged with looking after the CIA's most wanted ex agent in a Safe House. Ryan Reynolds plays Matt Weston and Denzel Washington plays the rogue agent Tobin Frost. Obviously this is not going to be a straightforward task and Weston desperately wants to prove himself, so he can further his career.

Then the trailer gave away it was all out action, but it still looked cleverer than it really is (and I think I know what to look for in those nicely packaged samples).The only original thing was to have the action unfold in South Africa, still it was nothing more than a gimmick. The only plot point is about CIA not having backup teams available so far down on the overlooked continent, but aside from this the action could easily have been relocated to LA. When there's a furious car chase in a Bourne movie you know it's a different country, but Downtown Cape Town, sunny highways, what's the difference?Safe House, the title, is still high concept, too bad they just used it as a starting point to yet another overblown actioneer. Characters are flimsy, even more so as they run to give and get lots of blows and run here and there until it's time to kill those who get in the way of a simplified ending.Lots of dumb violence - I mean violence is not dumb with Jason Bourne, it's realistic, sharp and short - and then cut to a nice cute clean ending.

96,JohnRayPeterson,"Safe House, safe script; Action and Characters you want.",7,29 May 2012,"In some instances, having a good idea of how the movie is likely to go can be a killjoy; then again, if it indeed has a predictable ending, it can be overlooked and the movie made watchable when the following characteristics are the movies finer points, namely: the movie has very good and relentless action or the movie has extremely interesting characters. As interesting as the characters are, this movie is not a pure psychological drama, so once we are past the basic prologue scenes you'll find it does provide almost non-stop action, which a good action thriller should give the audience. The movie is of course not so predictable that you'd feel cheated out of the 'thriller' aspect of it.Denzel Washington plays the role of Tobin Frost, a veteran intelligence operative who is wanted as a traitor by the US, since he went off the grid ten years prior. He resurfaces after getting his hands on the most incriminating bit of information, the kind that would ruin the careers of high-ups in international intelligence, including the CIA. Not since his role as ""Creasy"" in ""Man on Fire"" did I find myself cheering for the bad guy, who, after all, is not as bad as the system. Frost seeks refuge at a US consulate in South Africa, to dodge assassins; he is moved to a safe house where the CIA hopes to extract information from him. The minder of the safe house is Matt Weston, played by Ryan Reynolds; he was bored out of his mind until he got called into action. He has all the skill sets to be an operative and has been preparing for that.When the safe house is besieged by the same assassins, Weston is left to deal with Frost. All the while at CIA headquarters, the team that heads the safe house operations starts budding heads with other CIA sections and from that point, the story becomes rather predictable. Yet, the characters of Weston and Frost, in addition to those of Barlow, played by Brendan Gleeson, and Linklater, played by Vera Farmiga, sort of keep you interested in watching the rest of the action. The supporting cast of Farmiga, Glesson, Sam Shepard, Robert Patrick and Ruben Blades certainly adds a bankable element to the production. Washington and Reynolds do justice to their roles; their characters are compelling enough.There are no big surprises plot-wise, but it's actually that tried and true paradigm of corrupt security intelligentsia that we find comfort in seeing again in the throw of much action. Why make up a nonsensical plot when we are already sold on a given premise? I got what I expected and watched it for that reason; I'd be hard pressed to be too negative. I'll go out on a safe ledge and recommend it to anyone who enjoyed ""Man on Fire"".",Safe House
97,ersinkdotcom,The perfect example of the ride being more exciting than the destination,8,8 June 2012,"Universal knows the right combination to get attendance in theaters. First, take two actors guaranteed to pull in not only male fans but tons of female ones as well. Second, add car chases, gunfights, and other high-adrenaline action staples. Lastly, you toss in a little intrigue by not telling us in the trailers who the villain is necessarily. ""Safe House"" succeeds using of all these key ingredients.Writer David Guggenheim keeps the ball rolling for action fans with this entertaining thriller. Unfortunately, he underestimates today's sophisticated audience and blows the climax of the film with the identification of the rather typical real bad guy. For regular watchers of movies with twists, nothing that happens will leave them shocked or appalled. This is the perfect example of the ride being more exciting than the destination.

They can find any information they need in seconds. They have instant access to data bases you didn't even know existed. They can do anything really. Instantly accessible CCTV, internet and telephone tapping all play a huge role in these movies. There are always flunkies sitting at screens and then an intense older man or hard-nosed woman standing around shouting orders at everyone. Put me though to Langley!These agencies seem to have endless cash and will not hesitate for a second to do anything. Send a team to Zurich! Deploy the jets to Zambia! Moreover, in these movies the agents often have superhuman intellectual and physical abilities, far beyond that of trained athletes and martial arts experts. They jump from roof to roof, get injured in the knee, smash their heads against doors, and yet press on. They all fight like Bruce Lee nowadays. They can fly helicopters, drive like stunt men, do daredevil tricks with motorcycles. They have superb memories, training in explosives, knowledge on how to disarm nuclear weapons. These people are not only highly trained, super fit, super smart sharpshooters trained in martial arts to an unearthly level, they're also sort of invulnerable. At least in the Bourne movies there was a reason for it, but in a lot the movies in this genre the spies just naturally are all like this. They're superheros really. And of course there's always a rogue element: it's always the case that someone has become, will become, or is suspected of being, not what he seems. The viewer is invited in virtually every film to try to figure out the twist. In the CIA you can't trust anyone, can you. It's almost a rule now. Nothing is as it seems.These films are a combination of the ""Spy"" and ""Superhero"" or ""Martial Arts"" genre, but with ""Science Fiction"" technology thrown in. And the rogue element has some of the ""Mystery"" genre in it. Also, in these American films there are almost always intense shoot outs and chase scenes. Everything happens very fast. Lots of crazy driving, crashes and near death escapes. That makes them ""Action"" films. And of course they're shot in ""Exotic Locations"" So let's rearrange the initials of all these genres to call this the ""MASSFLAMES"" genre.The ""massflames"" genre has crept up on me. Every other movie seems to be like this nowadays. It sells. Apparently there are people out there who need to believe that security agencies and their staff have this unthinkable power and ability. Movie goers are willing to spend money to see this kind of world.Anyway, this is that kind of movie. You could have taken all the characters and put them into a Bourne movie. It was competently done. I have to admit though that the shootouts and car chases turned me off. I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. At first I thought that the Ryan Reynolds character was going to be different. The poor sod was stuck in Cape Town(!) Despite being in the CIA, he seemed like a normal bloke in a boring job. But then....nope, he turned out to be like the rest of them.I was disappointed with the failure to show more of Cape Town and South Africa. This movie could have been set anywhere really. You couldn't say at all that this movie was about Cape Town. Or even showed it. The location added nothing to the film, except in the most superficial sense. I didn't hate the movie. It had a few visceral pleasures. If you're a teenage boy, you'll enjoy this movie. Although you could also just go to another ""massflames"" movie. They're all the same really.",Safe House

However, not long after Frost is brought to the safe house, it is compromised by a gang of mercenaries who are trying to kill Frost. Weston manages to escape with his prisoner, however not only does this rookie have the responsibility of dealing with one of the CIA's most wanted rogue agents, he has the added task of trying to evade the mercenaries who want Frost dead. What was supposed to be a routine ""interrogation"" at the safe house has now turned into a deadly game of cat-and-mouse.While not the best movie of this type, Safe House is still a pretty decent, fast paced action thriller that is well played out with both Reynolds and Washington delivering good performances. Washington brings a nice sort of menace - but nothing evil - to the character of Frost and we know how well he plays those parts because he's done it before in Training Day.The story is well written that keeps you watching, even if it does tend to get a wee bit slow in places. I know that films can't have a good story AND be non-stop action at the same time, but there's just something that it lacks to make it that much better.There are a few wee twists and turns, and I guess the main one is pretty predictable, but even with this it's still a well-structured plot and as the movie goes on, you actually start to wonder who the ""bad guys"" of the film really are as well.All in all, Safe House is a good movie to watch, like I say, and if you enjoy good action thrillers then you won't go far wrong with this one.",Safe House

Washington stars as Tobin Frost, a fugitive who hands himself into the CIA when a band of not very merry men try to send him to hell in a blaze of gunfire. When the highly trained, heavily armed, ready-for-anything and evidently inept CIA operatives protecting Frost in a safe house (I know, let's set the film in a safe house and then name it, um) are wiped out by the bad guys, agent nobody (Ryan Reynolds as Matt Weston) takes it upon himself to protect him.Frost runs away, Weston pursues him, Frost tries to run away, Weston handcuffs him, the bad guys try to kill them. The bad guys try to kill them again. And again. And again. And that's pretty much it. It's flawed, there are plot holes big enough to drive a tank through, it's entirely predictable and, surprise, surprise, Frost has a decent side to him, but it is fun.

108,HelenMary,doesn't let up the tension. Reynolds & Washington are firmly on the action hero map!,8,8 July 2013,"Denzel Washington in a film more or less guarantees it's gravitas and/or watchability; the man is an acting demi-god. Ryan Reynolds is always good for a laugh, good to look at and is very slick but I'd not seen him do mega-action before (Green Lantern doesn't count): CIA agent running tough throwing himself around with die-hard commitment to role ie all physicality and gung-ho! Welcome to Safe House. Oh my goodness what a roller-coaster film. Wish I'd seen it at the cinema on the big screen, and the DVD had been of sufficient quality to not interrupt the flow of action.The chemistry between Reynolds and Washington is brilliant. At first I thought that being on set with Washington was upping Reynolds' game but soon I realised they were both acting their socks off and the emotion, action, stunts, fight scenes and general all guns blazing and car chases were just superb. Clever, intelligent and twisting plot (okay not totally unpredictable) with clever use of time wobbling to make the story a fraction less linear and not spelling everything out (other than explaining that Hamburg is in Germany and Paris is in France (!)); it didn't treat the audience like idiots, and you had to jog a bit to keep up.Brilliant film with some really incredible acting... can't emphasise that enough. Brilliant stunts, great fight segments, edge of the seat stuff. Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepherd, Brendan Gleeson and Robert Patrick were also very good, as well as Nora Arnezeder as Reynolds' French girlfriend. A very international film, filmed in South Africa predominantly, about a supposed rogue CIA agent who has a list of world wide agents and their dirty laundry that could compromise many Agencies - about who wants to keep it out of the light of day and what they will do to protect their reputations.Oh just watch it. If you like Speed-type fast paced action, intelligent plot, Pelican Brief type intrigue and slick fluid acting/direction/script reminiscent of Ronin or Bourne you'll really get a kick out of this. Reynolds and Washington were a powerful on-screen duo. Really entertaining and enjoyable (although stressful and a little uncomfortable at times.) Must see.",Safe House
109,Ramascreen,"Denzel and his rules, mentoring yet another rookie",5,13 February 2012,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --Here we go again with Denzel mentoring a rookie by sharing some of his ground rules. SAFE HOUSE is very formulaic, it only makes you think like it's smart and if it weren't for the intense, unforgiving gunfights, one of the most exciting I've seen in cinema (Tombstone's gunfight still takes top honor) SAFE HOUSE probably wouldn't have much going to help me recommend it to you Training Day, Unstoppable, and now SAFE HOUSE, you'd pair up Denzel as a seasoned, experienced character with a rookie or a newbie who eventually steps up to the plate. Denzel is back as Mr. know it all, Mr. one step ahead of you, and he'd proudly preach it too whether or not you'd want to hear it. Ryan Reynolds plays the next Pine or the next Hawke, and just like those other guys, Reynolds' character is fully equipped with the knowledge and is highly skilled but now, situation has shifted to where it forces him to put his own skills to the test. The rookie is always motivated to prove himself worthy and the unlikely mentor, who's used to working alone and has all kinds of ethos, is always entertained by the idea of having a protégé. By the way, why can't Swedish director Daniel Espinosa find his own tone, his own style? Why does he have to make the film look as if it was helmed by Denzel's go-to director, Tony Scott?! It even has that A-D-D feel to it.I don't necessarily think David Guggenheim's script is all that clever, it's not terrible, but it's nowhere near impressive. Don't get me wrong, the concept is fantastic, a CIA house being breached and you don't know who's responsible and who else may be on it, the line between bad guys and good guys get blurred, those are necessary elements for a pulse pounding thriller. But those of us hardcore fans of thrillers, may it be political or whodunit crime, would easily notice that all that Guggenheim did was put all the CIA smart vocabularies and slang into Tobin Frost's lips (Denzel) and then have the CIA repeats the same thing in their own little playroom and then Guggenheim would throw a series of massive chaos in between. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the bad guy either because you'd always go with the one who seems to be the most supportive, the one who wants to see the protagonists find safety, just so that they may get to them in time and retrieve whatever it is that they withhold, so SAFE HOUSE is exciting but it's hardly smart and it's certainly nothing new. -- www.Ramascreen.com --",Safe House
110,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: Safe House (2012) – USA,7,7 May 2012,"Matt Weston: How am I supposed to get more experience by staring at four walls all day?Safe House is the kind of film that could have been great and ended up being just good. It is a shame as for a good three quarters of the film; it simply oozes with sublime confidence. However, it fails big time in the finale and resulting in a film of unfulfilled potential. With the likes of veteran Denzel Washington and the uprising Ryan Reynolds, one would expect better. Still for the majority of the film, it works and it may seem half baked, some credit should still be due.Denzel Washington does well without being stunning, but it is Ryan Reynolds that handles the difficult role well enough to carry the film. Years ago nobody fancy the guy of romantic comedy range to do anything substantial. In this film, Reynolds is able to balance subtlety required of his role to compensate the tension surrounding the situation.All in all, Safe House is a good movie, but it plays far too safe, far too predictable and far too cliché to be anything beyond its worth. It is a real shame as the filmmaker tried so hard to create a premise that could well have finished with a big bang. Unfortunately that is not to be, but sometimes like life we just cannot finish what we started. Therefore, we should appreciate a good 75% of this flick and forget the rest. Yet another film which shows the notion of what could've beenNeo rates it 7.5/10www.thehkneo.com",Safe House
111,Chris_Pandolfi,A CIA Agent Comes of Age,7,12 February 2012,"It might be a stretch to think of ""Safe House"" as a coming of age film, as it's structured and edited in the same way as an espionage action thriller. True enough, we have car chases, brutal hand-to-hand combat, gunfights, and a plot involving the acquisition and transportation of a secret file, which of course has dangerous international ramifications. But when you narrow in on the lead characters and really focus on their dialogue and actions, certain themes become unavoidable, the transition from innocence to maturity most of all. We all have idealistic notions of the passions we pursue; CIA operative Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is eager to leave the confines of guardian work in a South African safe house and be promoted to an active field agent, not only because he feels he's qualified but also because it would be far more stimulating. By the end of the film, he learns a life lesson that most people learn: Not everything is as glamorous as it might initially seem.Here enters an ex-CIA agent named Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), who has gone rogue and is suspected to have leaked sensitive material to a number of international criminal contacts. Although physically in the custody of U.S. officials, it would not be accurate to say that he was apprehended, as he mysteriously entered the U.S. embassy in Cape Town of his own free will. The interrogation, which involves the controversial waterboarding technique, doesn't go very far; the safe house is breached by a band of rebels looking to kill Frost. With no one left alive following a bloody shootout, Weston is forced to take custody of Frost and transport him to a new safe house. Weston will spend the rest of the film trying to prove his worth as a field agent, all while dealing with his superiors back in Washington, D.C. One is his mentor, David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson), who wants Weston to follow protocol. The other is Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga), who orders Weston go off the grid and await further instructions.Adding interest to the story is the fact that Frost is a master of psychological manipulation. It's next to impossible to read him. For most of the film, all we know for sure is that the wheels in his head are constantly turning. The fact that Weston is a hotshot rookie presents Frost with absolutely no challenge, which of course makes his schemes much easier to carry out. But I'm making it sound like Frost is an evil mastermind, like a James Bond villain hell bent on world domination. The simple fact is, Frost knows too much. It would be inaccurate to call him a teacher, as he never sets out to educate young Weston or anyone else. Having said that, the more the two of them come into contact, the more Weston learns about his place in the CIA. Each small revelation is like a knife whittling away at his idealism.Admittedly, the film gives us nothing new in terms of plot or theme. And the action sequences, while technically competent, are both routine and expected. Some even fall victim to editing that's a little too choppy to effectively convey the chaos that's unfolding. There is, however, wonderful chemistry between Reynolds and Washington, who play off of each other like opponents in a battle of wits. They're also quite good individually. Reynolds' is at his best during a scene in which his character must admit to his girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) that he is in fact a CIA agent and that, for her safety, she must leave the country. Up until then, his line of work required that he repeatedly lie to her, even about personal matters. The reason this scene works so well is because it emotionally exemplifies Frost's influence over Weston.As for Washington, I don't think there was a single scene in which he failed to draw me in. Frost is a fascinating character – intense and deeply focused, an expert at what he does, a man of many secrets who's motivated not by malice but by disillusionment. There never seems to be a moment when he doesn't have the right tool for any given job. This would include a micro syringe that he uses to inject a tiny capsule into his side. His relationship with Weston is more complex and infinitely more compelling than that of hero/villain. Both men are driven and talented, but only Frost is smart enough to take advantage of Weston's eagerness. He will eventually regard Weston not with friendly admiration, but rather with detached appreciation, as if pleased that Weston is starting to understand where Frost is coming from.The nature of Frost's mission is not especially original, which is probably why the obligatory plot twist it ties into failed to impress me. It did, however, pave the way for an ending that was, in its own conventional way, highly satisfying. Whether or not the ending is happy is open for debate. It's divided into professional and personal resolutions, both of which force us to consider a number of possibilities that are not all pleasant. As entertaining as I found the plot, it was the casting that made ""Safe House"" a worthwhile experience for me. Apart from Reynolds and Washington, I was also impressed by performances that aren't given much screen time but add credibility to the film. One is by Nora Arnezeder, who plays Weston's girlfriend as a woman who genuinely has no idea how to feel. The other is by Ruben Blades as Frost's old associate, who lives in a Cape Town slum. Watch him as he and Frost share a glass of wine; even the subtlest lines can have a tremendous impact.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Safe House

Otherwise it just looked like another CIA agent discovers a cover-up movie. It is that. But because off Washington, and even Ryan Reynolds involvement, its a bit more.Flick sees Reynolds as a CIA agent stuck guarding the Safehouse of the title, until Washington becomes a prisoner there, freed by a fire-fight that takes place shortly after his arrival. The Film basically follows Reynolds discovering the horrifying truth behind how things work in the government as he tries to escort the older more experienced Washington too safety, discovering he isn't perhaps as bad as he seems on the way either.""Safehouse"" is trying to be a great movie. Washington leads a first class cast, with Ryan Reynolds also proving too be a great actor when he wants to be here.

Well this was my expectations from Safe House. I wasn't expecting really anything at all, maybe some slight thrills, but nothing amazing. Maybe a solid 7/10. But when I was in the theaters, movie playing, I was surprised of how good this film was. The plot was a simple, overused one. It's been done so much times before, but thankfully Safe House did some good to these films... The acting was really great. Ryan Reynolds may be a ""pretty boy"" in the cinema, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's a bad actor. In this film, he plays an interesting character, while the chemistry between him and Denzel Washington grow more and more engaging. Denzel in this film was simply badass, and you'll be questioning whether he is good or bad. Although the plot is a bit cliché, the movie keeps twisted and turning with some crazy things going on. It's surely a seat-grabber, and I was at the edge of my seat. I also enjoyed the effect they gave on this film. The color contrast was increased a bit, and when zoomed in, they gave it a grainy effect. I also want to comment on people saying this was shaky. I'm guessing they've never seen those found-footage films, or even the movie Contraband used a faster technique. I found the fast-paced camera fit the movie, and to be honest, it wasn't shaky at all. All in all, I recommend this film. There's little flaws here and there, but they won't affect your viewing. If your a fan of these films, and even had some reconsideration, I advise you to check it out. It was great. 8 stars for being awesome and -2 for being a bit cliché. 8/10.",Safe House

""Safe House"" is an overlong, underwhelming generic spy thriller. There are car chases, double-crosses, prolonged fight sequences--all of which add up to very little. The pacing is uneven, the frenetic action is rarely suspenseful, and it drags out to an improbable conclusion. ""Safe House"" has an A-list cast, but can't compensate for a weak story line that doesn't deliver anything substantial. Ryan Reynolds gives a fine performance, but others are simply going through the motions for purposes of refreshing their bank accounts. Denzel could play this role in his sleep, and at times, he appears he is doing just that. ""Safe House"" tries to be a little different by not transforming into a buddy film.

Here the dumbest of dumb are playing against a little less dumb and then playing against an almost normal human being, well almost human on the odd occasions. And, regrettably, the acting is pretty average across the board because the script is so poor in places.It is watchable, pacey at times, but continues to irritate as the plot kind of spins nowhere fast. Denzel Washington is his usual self and does try to introduce some style to the proceedings, but he is let down by some awful support. I'll not spoil anything but just warn anyone tempted by this film that, in line with a lot of TV series' season finales the end is the kind of cliff edge that reeks of a sequel. Personally I felt the script could have been condensed into one episode of a TV series which could have been made to last another twelve instalments or so.

121,troy-manatunga,To this critic it is nothing more than an average day at the movies.,6,2 September 2012,"Denzel Washington is the Godfather of the Black American actors of today. There is not an argument that Denzel is on the pinnacle of the list along with Freeman, Whitaker, Murphy & Smith. Something obvious in all Denzel movies is that he likes being the underdog who fights for a cause or the normal average citizen who saves the day. The story of Tobin Frost (Denzel) is no different. A CIA agent who goes rouge for no particular reason turns up at the US consulate in Cape Town South Africa and gives himself up to the law. It has been 9 years since Frost went dark and has been allegedly accused of trading high risk government secrets with organizations with destructive agendas. Wanted in 4 continents Frost is an agent who is the best at what he does and is slippery as an eel.Denzel who plays the calm, tactful and observant Frost is escorted to a safe house in a nearby location by an extraction team of the CIA. The Safe house is a secretive bunker maintained by the US Government and is used as a detention facility to hold wanted criminals around the world until they can be legally escorted to the states. The safe house is been looked after by a CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). Weston who leads a double life in Cape Town does so in order to protect his girlfriend from unwanted exposure into the matter of the CIA. The Dirt hits the fan when the Safe house is infiltrated by a group of armed men who are after Tobin Frost as well. The sole survivor Weston (obviously) has to now protect Frost until he can hand him back to law all by himself.SAFEHOUSE whilst better than GREEN LANTERN is much worse than UNSTOPPABLE. Predictable at every turn SAFEHOUSE isn't the least bit mysterious as the genre specifies it to be. Ryan Reynolds plays a great Weston and it seems like the man is moving on forward from the disaster that is GREEN LANTERN. Unfortunately for Reynolds SAFEHOUSE will not be the movie that will sling shot him back into the major leagues of Hollywood following his dive in GREEN LANTERN. Much of this blame lies on the predictable and monotonous tone in the screenplay. David Gugenheims script does not have the niche that requires landing the motion picture alongside with movies such as TRAINING DAY or THE RECRUIT. Instead SAFEHOUSE will hover amongst movies such as HENRYS CRIME & THE TOURIST. Daniel Espinosa isn't a popular name amongst the movie making gurus. However I for one do not judge a book by its cover. Rupert Sanders amazed me with his debut in re-inventing the tale of Snow white, similarly Daniel Espinosa certainly does have his strengths. His action sequences and car chases are gnarly and thrilling. They remained intense right through out and it felt undeniably real. Espinosas work into exploring his cast is where there is potential room for improvement. To put all his money on the 2 stars alone is not wise on a screenplay that isn't as powerful as HEAT. Things I liked about this movie; attributes you may enjoy as well. Starring Denzel Washington & Ryan Reynolds.  Set in the beautiful city of Cape Town and some of the aerial shots are breathtaking.  The Range Rovers used by the CIA.  The Make up during the more violent scenes.  Denzel and Ryan's acting is very interesting to watch and is the only saving grace in its 115 minutes  No action movie has been released that is worthy of espionage royalty for 2012; therefore this can play to be interesting and does come close to MAN ON A LEDGE.Thumbs down on the following The plot parody; rouge agent who actually can be a nice guy and the bad guy is always the most obvious person.  The script is limited to Denzel and Ryan. If more prominence was given to the actors to grow and explore in the plot maybe the screenplay would have had more clarity.  The waste of talent in terms of Vera Farmiga and especially a great actor as Brendan Gleeson.  What ticked me off the most is when Ryan falls out a window it does sound of glass shatter; it's an EXPLOSION!Heads up to our readers, don't be fooled by the Trailer and have high expectations also do not under estimate it.

Throughout the movie both protagonists showcase their characters correctly and seem to be on the same level. As far as supporting cast goes, the roles are handled very well by experienced actors such as Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard. However the star of the film has to go to its great action sequences which offer high octane chases and gritty combat scenes.

Can you seriously tell me you had high hopes for this film? The plot is super thin, the characters come right out of a buddy buddy action film, and it's just straight up boring. The idea, the conflict, just everything about it puts me right to sleep. Not only don't I get the plot, but I don't get the motives of the characters. Maybe that's just me, but i'm sorry, this just did not interest me at all. Not even the ""guns blazing"" action scenes were enough to keep me alive. Watching Ryan Reynolds for an hour and a half in a coffin is much more entertaining than this.Reynolds character makes no sense to me. He runs a safe house, but wants more out of life. Is that it? This guy runs a safe house, so that's why it's called Safe House? Um...sure. And Denzel Washington...good guy or bad guy? NO IDEA!The plot just doesn't explain itself very clearly. I never know where it's going. My guess is they just got all these well known actors together, and play act a typical crime story. Also, it's just so forgettable. I watched it last night, and the only thing I remember is that it had Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington in it, which I all ready knew anyway.Is it me, or did this film remind me completely of the Bourne trilogy. For real, it's shot like the Bourne films, the Reynolds character is similar to Bourne, (except not as bad-ass) and it has nonstop gunfights and chase scenes. This movie pretty much is a rip-off of Bourne. They looked for a story, then pasted it on a poster with different actors. I wouldn't be surprised to see a Safe House 2. Either way, their attempt to recreate Bourne failed miserably. You can't hold a candle to Bourne, you just can't. Washington and Reynolds are both awesome, but Damon is the true Jason Bourne, and nobody should forget it.All together, it didn't please me. I like Denzel Washington and I like Ryan Reynolds, but put them together, and everything is a hot mess. I say see it if this interests you no matter what. I'd say it's at least a rental just to see what the deal is. I would not pay money to buy this, or see this in the theaters. But for $.99 at the rental store, go ahead.

Ryan Reynolds is Matt Weston, an upcoming and coming rookie CIA agent whose current mission is to serve as an ""inn keeper"" at a CIA Safe House in South Africa. It's a menial thankless job, with very little action, and agent Weston is eager for reassignment. On one quiet night, agent Weston's life is turned upside down when his safe house is used to debrief the CIA's #1 rogue agent, Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington). During this interrogation, the safe house is overrun, and all the agents inside are killed except for Weston (Ryan) and Frost (Washington). Following CIA protocol, Weston was to ""secure"" the package (Washington), and await follow-on instructions. Up to this point, the movie is moving along just fine. And I have in qualms with the film or plot line; however, I really hate stupidity in films (except in horror films, when stupidity = higher death count. Hey what was that outside? I don't know lets go check it out.oh, no!!!) Anyways, I digress However, stupidity in a thriller just makes me think that Hollywood thinks I'm an idiot, especially when stupidity is used to place our characters in more turmoil, in order to move the storyline along. Case in point, agent Weston (Ryan) is able to successfully secure Frost (Washington) is some fleabag hotel, off the ""grid"" as instructed. He makes contact with his superiors, and is notified that another CIA team is en route, but it would another 12 hours (not 12 days, not 12 years, but hours mine you) before they could be on ground and that he would need to continue to safeguard the package (Frost) until relieved. Again, no problems. However, what follows next is the most asinine chain of events that I could ever image. Instead of staying put, off the grid, and staying safe; agent Weston is instructed to take the #1 CIA rouge agent (Frost) to an 80,000 fan soccer game to get follow-on instructions to a new safe house GUESS WHAT???? Frost (Washington) escapes!!!!! Can you believe than???? REALLY????? I WAS SHOCKED!!!!!! But anyways, the film is fine. Of course, there's deception, intrigue, dirty agents, a mole, and all the other stereotypical characters that you have come to expect in this genre of movie.

125,Simon_Says_Movies,Fulfills Its Popcorn Intentions But Little Else,7,12 February 2012,"Safe House is a movie that fulfils its popcorn intentions, but metaphorically brings to mind the image of a bobble-head – a bloated brain supported by little else, springing uncontrollably in different directions. When the action ramps up, Safe House is at its best, providing ample energy, a plethora or gunplay and a number of gritty combat sequences. When pausing to forward the plot, spew exposition or focus on perfunctory romances, it grinds to a halt. Safe House would be better viewed with a remote equipped with a fast forward button nearby.Thankfully for Safe House, the sequences with action outnumber those without, so it comes out on top on a percentage basis alone. What makes it slip just out of the realm of solid praise is that it really fails as a tense, psychological duel of wits. I mean c'mon you have the one of the coolest actors working today (Denzel Washington of course) trying to escape his confines with only a lowly safe house guard (Ryan Reynolds) in his way – use it! The trailers and radio ads prominently feature the line ""I'm already in your head"", but the movie itself offers little in the way of subtle manipulation or mind games. All we get are a few scenes where Washington's Tobin Frost intimidates the crap out of the inexperienced operative and forebodingly warns that the CIA will screw him one day. Now that I've kicked this movie while it's down, let me tell you what it does very well: bloodshed. I already mentioned the ample high-octane set pieces, but of course volume of action does not always translate directly to a solid film (""Transformers"" springs to mind) it has to bring something to the table. Safe House earns its R-rating in many an instance with sometimes uncomfortably realistic shootouts, brutal interrogations and wonderfully choreographed (but wince-inducing) hand- to-hand combat sequences. If you think that John McClane looks rough at the end of a ""Die Hard"" flick, wait until you see how Reynolds looks when the credits roll. Refreshingly, this is not the kind of movie where a character is shot, grits his teeth a little bit, holds his wound and then ten minutes later they have apparently forgotten about it. You feel every punch and when somebody gets stabbed they writhe on the floor in pain and when somebody gets shot they are likely not getting back up. There are also a handful of lengthy chase sequences through the streets of Cape Town, a soccer stadium and the slums of Langa and in all instances deliver. They are easy to follow, high-energy and far more real-world than we're normally accustomed when talking about a Hollywood car chase. In all of these sequences (automotive or otherwise) we have Reynolds front and center. Safe House is really a Ryan Reynolds movie masquerading as a Denzel Washington film, though that is not to say Washington is relegated to a just supporting role, it is simply more focused on our in-way-over-his-head rookie than the lethal pro. Reynolds is the surprise here, not only holding his own against the veteran but delivering his best mainstream performance to date (there is not a hint of his wise-cracking The Green Lantern or Deadpool characters to be found here). Curiously, there were very few one-liners delivered by Washington and though he oozed charisma through his presence alone, I would have liked to see a little more sizzle; one more duty that lands on the script, which just offers nothing in the way of interesting dialogue, insights into the mind of a killer or even a brisk pace for that matter. As a movie to pop in the DVD player with some buds, however (one that you can tune out the downtimes between action set pieces) it delivers absolutely and does offer one of the rarer instances for Washington to do his bad guy thing – a welcome sight.Rating: 6.5/10",Safe House
126,djderka,Thin plot and mindless action...don't join CIA,5,8 November 2012,"I have a good idea for a script. Let's have some rogue agents in....um...EPA, (no)..hmmm (Forest Service), (no)...oh oh I have it THE CIA. Brilliant, except it has been done about 1,000 TIMES !!!Those films could be used as an anti-recruitment drive for ""The Agency"" as it is often called. I have never seen an agency eat it's young so quickly. Would anyone join an agency were the attrition rate is about 90%. They have a mortality rate higher than Lobster fisherman.The action was fast in this film, but the passing of the film was slow as molasses because of super thin plot.I love Denzel, but I think he was phoning this one in, probably because he had about 8 lines of dialog. Plot: rogue agents try to kill off agents with inside info. Really! Not exactly original there buddy.For much, much much better films please turn to:Three Days of the Condor (with the great Robert Redford) The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (with Sir Richard Burton) Scorpio (with classic Burt Lancaster) Ipcress File (with the wonderful Michael Caine) Bourne Identity (with the intense Matt Damon) Tinker, Taylor Soldier Boy (with Gary Oldman, Colin Firth Spy Game (again with Robert Redford)In fact, most other films surpass this one in dialog, script, story, camera work, action, music and well most every category. I gave it a 5 tho because the director found the on button for the camera and did spend hours on the set.Gotta go, MegaPython is on SY FY.",Safe House
127,Sci-FiHorrorFan,A very entertaining movie! and Denzel Washington delivers!.,8,25 January 2013,"I quite enjoyed this movie i thought it was exciting and fast paced right off the bat and it kept me watching. i thought the acting from Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds was great and i like Denzel Washington and he never fails to shine in his movies and this one was no different. what i liked about this film is that it had some good Action scenes but it also had a good level of mystery and i like that in a movie. I also liked the idea of Ryan Reynolds character turning from good to bad and going after Denzel and then turning good again and in the end the two guys end up becoming friends and they helped each other out and i thought that was a cool idea. In this movie Ryan Reynolds character plays a safe house keeper and Denzel is a CIA agent who went rogue a long time ago so the CIA is after him and Denzel is on the run from them. I found this movie very exciting and suspenseful and it had me on the edge of my seat especially the car chases and fight scenes,and i must say Denzel Washington was a Badass in this film! he was a very cool character and he knew how to fight!.I also found his character funny and witty and i didn't care if he turned Rouge or not i still really liked his character and i was cheering for him throughout the whole film!. He was one of those characters where you didn't really know whether he was good or bad or maybe a bit of both but i did not care i still wanted him to get away. there were a few scenes in the film that showed some interesting chemistry between Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) and Ryan Reynolds. I thought the film had some good character development and an interesting plot.the film has some small problems but they did not bother me much because i found the rest of the film so entertaining and Action packed and when films are like that i can ignore the little problems. There are so many things happening in this film that its hard to notice problems especially when you like the story and care about the characters which i did. there was a very cool scene in the movie when Denzel completely evades and out wits these men that are after him and he escapes and gets away and the men end up attacking the wrong person because the man was wearing the same coat as him!.HA HA i found that scene funny!. that was a very cool scene and i enjoyed that part of the film and i loved how Denzel just calmly walked away with a grin on his face. He was definitely a cool character and i liked how Ryan Reynolds kept running after Denzel and he was so determined to catch him! no matter what!.Ryan was a little over the top in his chase scenes but they were fun to watch! and i liked how the guy never gave up even though Denzel got away from him every time. All in all this was a very exciting movie and it has allot of Action and good fights! and Denzel and Ryan are fun to watch and this film is definitely worth a watch i thought it was very good!.",Safe House

132,julian-mumford,A worthy entry into a crowded genre,7,26 September 2012,"Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is working as a low level staffer for a NGO, he has boring days and advises his very hot girlfriend Ana (Nora Arzeneder), all the boring office gossip and sicknesses.Matt is lying, he does have a very boring job but he works for the CIA as a ""Housekeeper"", effectively running and maintaining the titular ""Safe House"" in Cape Town, South Africa. Not the glamorous Paris posting he yearns for and hassles his boss Barlow about (Brendan Gleeson).One day is the same as the other, repeatedly bouncing a rubber ball and checking in with Langley with codewords and other spy stuff. Matt's boredom is suddenly interrupted by an urgent message that a ""Guest"" is due very shortly, shepherded by an extraction team led by Daniel Kiefer (Robert Patrick).Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) a notorious ex-agent gone rogue, who has been selling secrets to the highest bidder for years. Tobin walked into the Cape Town US Consulate seeking protection from assorted bad guys hot on his tail.Taking a note from the Donald Rumsfeld welcome handbook, Tobin is barely through the door before he is being water-boarded, apparently to persuade him to divulge his secrets. Cape Town of course providing more interview ""options"" than a debrief Stateside, where do these filmmakers get such ideas from.Meanwhile, the assorted bad guys are heavily armed, have located the Safe House and pay a visit. Ultimately Weston finds himself on the run with a very dangerous man, attempting to stay one step ahead of a very persistent and knowledgeable enemy, led by Vargas (Fares Fares).Weston has to warn off his girlfriend, initially with platitudes, ""I may have to work late"", almost with machine gunfire in the background.The movie is then one long chase and is very effectively shot in a shaky, Bourne, realistic anti-Hollywood style, with some decent real car chase work. Washington speaks in his usual quiet manner, flashing that Hollywood smile and acting all knowing, which in this case, proves to be well founded.You are never quite sure who is on who's side, the Washington contingent act out the usual ""situation room"" clichés. Barlow and his colleague Linklater (Vera Farmiga) are then dispatched to sort out the mess.It is good to see different locations, although the violence and choice of locations are unlikely to cause an uptick in Cape Town tourism.The actor with the most to do, is unquestionably Reynolds and he surprises, creating a very believable character, in a unbelievable setting. Clearly basic CIA training is quite comprehensive, if this depiction is to be believed. At times he appears suitably terrified, although with the physicality, gunfire, explosions and choreographed fight scenes, there will be an element of truth in his actions and reactions.This is a violent film, the body count is high although not unduly gratuitous. The story is relatively predictable but is filmed with style and commitment to the action on display. Both lead actors would consider this a solid entry on their resumes, as mentioned Reynolds perhaps with more to gain in broadening his range.Sam Shephard as the control in Washington gets to chew the occasional bit of scenery but the film largely focuses on the interaction between the leads and their fight against a seemingly endless supply of faceless baddies.Summary A solid action thriller with decent performances, not the most original story but the setting manages to disguise the fact we may have seem similar before.A worthy entry into a crowded genre and certainly worth two hours of most film fans time http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Safe House
133,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: CIA corruption in action.,8,12 February 2012,"What a ride, Safe House put the suspense in suspenseful, the thrill in thrilling and they can shoot me with a Wash-Rey any day. I was thrilled that the trailer did not give away everything, I knew that Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) was on the CIA most wanted list, but I wasn't convinced that he was a rogue agent but perhaps a covert operative until all was made known in the end. Personally I would never give up the goods of any movie, since I consider spoilers to be like roaches on a birthday cake, nobody wants cake touched by roachesI digress. Once again Ryan Reynolds (Matt Weston) takes on a green role, figuratively this time not literally and it suits him much better. Given that he started out as a comedic actor, it was amazing to have witnessed his transformation into a credible thespian that can hold his own against Mr. Washington. Matt is a safe house keeper and he is given the task of hosting Tobin, which is when the education begins. This is my first issue with the film, the subplot was very similar to Training Day in that Matt is inexperienced and is acquiring some vocational lessons and a number of life lessons in a very unconventional manner. Tobin takes Matt through a series of exercises in deception and as revealed in the trailer, gets in his head. The audience also gets in Matt's head, while being pursued by gunmen and under constant duress from fear, desperation, feigned ignorance and finally confidence his face conveys a whole gambit of emotions so that as he went through it all, I went through it all. Fortunately for me as a viewer, the South African gun men have very bad aim or this would have been a very short movie. It would have been nice to see more from a seasoned actor like Sam Shepard (Harlan Whitford), he seems to now only be type cast as some top bureaucrat barking out orders, and I hope that this is not the beginning of a long run of typecasting for Vera Farmiga (Catherine Linklater), I have seen enough of her in this government subordinate role, she's so much better than that. My second and only other issue with this film is that the females Catherine and Ana (Nora Arnezeder) Matt's girlfriend did not make much of an impact on the plot or the entertainment value of the movie, overall this was a totally male dominated story, but I liked it and I give it a green light.",Safe House
134,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: SAFE HOUSE (2012) Review,5,13 April 2012,"Swedish-born helmer Daniel Espinosa (2010's EASY MONEY) makes his first Hollywood directing debut in SAFE HOUSE -- a cat-and-mouse thriller that apes the hyperkinetic feel of Tony Scott, shot in a gritty style of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004) and THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (2007). With two idealistic pairing of Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, it's easy to expect that SAFE HOUSE would be an edge-of-the-seat crowd pleaser -- at least for its pulse-pounding first 30 minutes. But the movie gradually loses steam and hardly recovers, with haphazard pacing and overlong exposition. Blame it on the first-time screenwriter David Guggenheim who doesn't offer nothing new or surprising to his generic screenplay. Everything here plays by-the-numbers. Even the action are getting lackluster at each passing moments, right until the lazy and surprisingly anticlimactic finale.",Safe House
135,CowherPowerForever,"Time's a-wasting. Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock...",8,29 December 2014,"The 2012 Denzel Washington film Safe House is a film I have enjoyed watching a few times over the past couple years since its release. The film is action packed, with practical effects, and the acting for the most part is top notch. With Washington making so many great movies over the course of his career this film will get overlooked by many, which is a shame. I will be breaking down this film as well as the Blu-Ray special features. The following is my review of Safe House.The film was written by David Guggenheim and his script was on the Black List for some time before it ever took off. This was his first major film and has since wrote the Nicolas Cage direct to home video movie Stolen. Thankfully it did get made as Guggenheim wrote a pretty good story. The film follows Matt Weston(Ryan Reynolds) as he is working at a CIA safe house. His job has normally been business as usual with nothing out of the ordinary going on. That is until one day former CIA agent Tobin Frost(Denzel Washington) pops back on the CIA radar. Frost is then transported to the safe house where Weston is working. Things eventually go north during Frost's interrogation when a terrorist group breaks into the safe house. Weston has to now protect Frost so that nothing happens to him. The story features some great story twists and turns that will keep your interest. So many of the films Washington does these days can be considered more of the same, but this film is very much different in terms of overall story. David Guggenhiem wrote a great story and one that will very much keep your attention.The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa who made his major Hollywood debut with this film. He is currently working on one of the most anticipated films of 2015 called Child 44. Before this film I personally didn't know much about Espinosa, but after watching this film, I knew I was watching a great director at work. There are some very intense moments of action throughout the film. Most of the first half hour of the film has mid to high level action scenes. That really builds the momentum for the rest of the film. Not only are there some bigger action scenes like car chases for example, but there is also some intense hand to hand combat scenes. The action is done very well and is a great joy to watch. The acting is another area that is good overall. The film stars Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington in the lead roles with other great actors like Sam Shepard, Brendan Gleeson, Liam Cunningham, Rubén Blades, and Robert Patrick taking up some important secondary roles. An interesting fact is that Denzel Washington was actually waterboarded during this film. No stunt double on that scene. I don't say the movie has great overall acting because I've personally never been a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds. I don't think he is a bad actor, but I just find his style to be wooden or the same in every film. Espinosa for the most part is able to bring the entire cast together for a nice well rounded film from his directing to the acting performances. If you are a big action fan like myself, this is one film you surely shouldn't miss.The film was scored by Ramin Djawadi who is known for scoring films like Iron Man and Pacific Rim(one of my favorite scores). While this film is much different compared to those two films I mentioned, his effect is still very good. Not great like on some of his other efforts, but his score adds some nice depth in the action scenes and in the build up to the end of the film. I would personally say the score is good, but not great, but those who like a good score won't be disappointed.In closing, after having already watched this film a few times since its 2012 release, I must say that the film is still as fun as ever. The action scenes are amazing, and minus some less than perfect acting from Reynolds, this film is a must see film. Denzel Washington fans, like myself, shouldn't overlook this film especially with Washington making many great films lately. As I said this is a must see so do so as soon as you can. You won't regret it.As I said above, I will also be going into the Blu-Ray special features as well. The Blu-Ray for this film features seven featurettes and runs for a total of about fifty minutes. So overall no bad at all for a film like this. The behind the scenes material really breaks down some of the bigger action scenes and combat scenes to show how they were filmed. This is great to see for special features fans like myself. Some other features break down the story and the CIA aspects and how the film makers really wanted to be authentic. This home video release is truly a good buy if you come across it at a good price below ten dollars. It is well worth adding to your collection.8/10",Safe House

137,chaz-28,Middle of the road action film draws superior cast but does not use their talents,5,8 March 2012,"You don't see too many action films set almost entirely in Africa. Indiana Jones spent some time in Egypt, Jason Bourne dropped in on Morocco, and I suppose Congo took place in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Safe House spends almost all of its time in Cape Town, South Africa. It's about time they gave Paris, Rome, and New York City a break from being the ubiquitous action cities. Unfortunately, the originality fissured out after location scouting.After noticing how much money Unstoppable made, it appears the filmmakers here found a way to team up Denzel Washington with another young, white male with model looks but instead of Chris Pine, this time we get Ryan Reynolds. Matt Weston (Reynolds) is a CIA field agent but way down on the totem pole. This is his first assignment and he is in charge of a safe house in downtown Cape Town should real CIA case officers ever need a place to hang out for a few hours. After a sharp and noteworthy chase scene leads off the film, rogue CIA agent Tobin Frost (Washington) finds himself arrested and being tortured by some very grizzled agents in Matt's safe house.How he ends up there is enjoyable for the audience so I will not reveal it here; however, the script and film really trail off after such a smart beginning. Tobin's interrogation is interrupted when a skilled team of bad guys loudly infiltrate the safe house and Matt, for a rookie, does an admirable job getting Tobin out of harm's way while every other CIA agent gets mowed down. Now on the run in Cape Town, Matt has to protect both Tobin and himself from a very determined mob of assassins. Tobin does not want protection though; he wants his freedom and sees young Matt as not too difficult an obstacle to overcome.Matt is scrappier than his experience lets on though. He keeps up with Tobin and back at CIA headquarters, his boss David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) sings his praises to an agency which is no longer sure whose side Matt is on. Matt's skeptics include the high-ranking Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga) and the very high-ranking Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard). How did Safe House score such a formidable cast and what are they all doing slumming in this middle of the road action thriller? This is fair game for Reynolds and Washington, but Safe House is an odd choice for Gleeson, Farmiga, and Shepard. They get limited screen time and no dialogue to show off their skills. Was it just the quick paycheck? There was a lot of thought put into the fight scenes though. Instead of routine punches thrown and absorbed, the guys here are really getting scratched, cut, bruised, shot, etc Action films usually let their heroes gloss over any pain they might feel or just walk it off, but Matt and Tobin thoroughly endure every bad guy they come across and never come out clean on the other side. Unfortunately, the camera work which filmed these impressive fight scenes was hand-held to make them scene more frenetic and shaky than they should be. Nobody likes the hand-held camera, especially when the cameraman is running down the street along with the action. It is annoying.I do not recommend Safe House but it is only a marginal non-recommend. The fight scenes are original and exciting but the cinematography and the feeling that I've seen Denzel do this before hurts its cause. Also, enjoy the casting but know that they do not belong here.",Safe House
138,Treyroo,"You've seen it before, but if you liked it...",6,24 November 2012,"You're in a position that requires very little of you and have been for some time. Then you hear your significant other is getting a new job nearly 6,000 miles away and begin angling for a transfer but before you can get it you are dropped in a situation unlike any you've ever been in. What do you do?Matt Weston (played by Ryan Reynolds) is the guardian of a CIA safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. While he is required to conceal the true nature of his workplace and his employer, once he's entered the office, turned on the lights and locked the door behind him, he's done just about everything he needs to do that day. Meanwhile, the Agency's most wanted fugitive, CIA agent turned traitor Tobin Frost (played by Denzel Washington) has been arrested in a nearby embassy while trying to escape the men who'd already murdered his business contact. Senior management at the Agency is stunned and determined to find out what Frost (Washington) was running from in addition to ascertaining the true extent of the damage he's already done since going rogue more than ten years earlier. However, before Frost cooperates, hostile forces break through the facility's defenses and assassinate Frost's armed escorts. Soon Weston (Reynolds) is on the run with Frost in tow all while trying to keep them both alive and deliver Frost to the intended destination.If you've seen Enemy of the State, Man on Fire, Unstoppable, or Spy Game, you'll no doubt recognize the directing style of Tony Scott in this latest film starring Denzel Washington. The problem being that the director of this film is a man by the name of Daniel Espinosa and while I am a fan of Scott and his films, it shows a considerable lack of imagination on Espinosa's part to direct his films in a near-identical manner. Putting that aside, Washington is exceptional as he often is, Reynolds is surprisingly good and spares us the sarcasm we've come to love and expect from him, and supporting players Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Sheppard make the sub-plot almost as interesting as the main story. I enjoyed it a lot.",Safe House
139,bdgill12,"Predictable but Entertaining, Excellent Performances",7,22 February 2012,"I'm of the opinion that out of all the movie stars and would-be movie  stars in Hollywood, Denzel Washington is one of, if not THE, safest  bet. I say this because I don't think I've ever met a person who  dislikes the man. In a culture that is built upon strong opinions and  holding to said opinions fiercely (this is the backbone of the industry  in many ways), it is a remarkable feat to put together a 20+ year  career like Denzel has without drawing the ire of someone or some  group. Age, race, and gender seem to matter not when it comes to  Denzel, whose films almost always find a way to exceed expectations  whether they are magnificent (Training Day, American Gangster) or  wholly lackluster (John Q, Unstoppable). There is an overriding sense  among a high percentage of moviegoers that if Denzel is in, so are  they. Safe House, a solid if uninspired action thriller, has proved  this theory to be true.   Instead of the undercover investigations and shoot outs he expected  when he joined the CIA, Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) has been relegated  to manning a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. He is bored and he  wants some action, a desire that is all too well fulfilled at the  outset of the film when former CIA agent-turned-traitor Tobin Frost  (Washington) is brought to his house for interrogation. Soon after his  arrival, a militant force arrives to take possession of Frost, killing  the highly-trained team that brought Frost into the house. With no  other option, Weston grabs Frost and makes a bolt for it, barely  escaping the unknown villains who killed his comrades. With no other  teams in the area, Weston's superior, David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson),  tasks him with keeping Frost alive and in custody until he can be  collected, a proposition which turns out to be much more difficult and  complex than Weston would have ever imagined. With the assailants hot  on their trail and Frost crawling deeper and deeper in Weston's head,  the young agent must think fast and learn on the run before he becomes  another casualty of a dirty battle that Frost has sucked him into.  There are a few departures from the main storyline at work within Safe  House but these distractions are only there to lengthen the film and  add some uninteresting depth. This film lives and dies on the  performances of Reynolds and Washington, both of whom come through  beautifully. It's been a rough year for Reynolds whose star status has  been thrown into serious question with the failures of Green Lantern  and The Change-Up. This role, however, is a better fit for him,  allowing him to share the load with an established genre veteran  instead of being relied upon to carry a major film on his own. I was  pleasantly surprised at his ability to give Weston more depth than what  you usually get with this sort of film and I thought he hit the right  balance between being a half- terrified, inexperienced field agent and  being that hardened, ""see this thing through to the bitter end""  character that Safe House had to have. Washington, meanwhile, is a tour  de force, exuding both charisma and menace in just the right amounts.  Always a commanding presence on the screen no matter what his role,  Washington is at his best when delivering his lines in that quiet,  calm, measured manner which he has become famous for and this is a role  that calls upon that ability several times. I can't say that this is  one of Washington's best portrayals and it's certainly a safer choice  than I'd like to see an actor of his caliber make, but it is  nonetheless a reminder of exactly why just about everybody digs what  this guy has been selling for two decades.   Every other element of Safe House plays second fiddle to the work done  by the two leads. The action is intense and somewhat gritty; when a  shot is fired, you feel it as much as hear it, a characteristic I quite  like in a serious action film. The plot itself is rife with  generalities and clichés, making the film about as paint-by-numbers as  they come. Personally, though, I didn't get caught up in these  half-hearted missteps too often. Better choices could certainly be  made; the major ""twist"" could be seen from a mile away and the  conclusion was unsatisfactory for me. But given director Daniel  Espinosa's relative inexperience behind the camera and the sheer power  of Washington's star appeal, these are issues I found easy to overlook  as the film progressed. It's nothing new and it's not a film I want to  watch a dozen times over but for what it is, Safe House provides an  entertaining and appealing experience.",Safe House
140,garethvk,Great Cast and premise but horrible camera work and tons of plot holes.,6,10 February 2012,"In a complicated deadly game of international espionage things are rarely what they appear to be. Take the case of Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), a young man who, for all intents and purposes, appears to divide his time between his adoring French girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) and a South African hospital. But if one were to pull back the curtain they would learn that Matt is actually a CIA agent who spends his time watching over a safe house, an assignment of painfully tedious monotony.In the new action thriller ""Safe House"", Reynolds eschews his typical charming, cocky, wisecracking on-screen personas to portray Matt as a mature young man with ambitions both inside and outside of his job. Matt longs to be assigned to a more glamorous position and is hopeful that when his 12 month tour in South Africa is up, a more exciting post awaits him in Paris. It doesn't hurt that a Paris post will also allow him to be closer to his girlfriend when she returns to Europe in the near future. But his boss David Barlow (Brendan Gleason) isn't as optimistic.As his frustrations at the lack of mobility grows, Matt soon finds his quiet world torn asunder by the arrival of Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington). Frost is a former agent who went rogue and is considered an extremely dangerous and high-profile target. Having eluded the CIA for years, he only draws even more suspicion when he surrenders himself to a US consulate in South Africa. The CIA knows they have to act fast to determine what Frost knows, and quickly whisk him away to a safe house for intense interrogation. But the CIA aren't the only ones who want to know Tobin's secrets.Although Matt is highly trained for his job running the safe house, he is very green when it comes to the reality of having to defend his domain against a surprise attack which leaves Tobin and Matt as the only survivors. Forced to flee and with nowhere to turn, Frost tries to convince Matt that they have been set up because someone in the agency does not want Frost to talk. At first skeptical, Matt is forced to step outside of his comfort zones and confront a deadly array of assassins as well as the threat posed by Frost himself and the unseen elements working against them. In a frantic race, Matt must keep Frost and himself alive as they attempt to reach safety and get to the truth behind the deadly game in which they've been cast.Washington and Reynolds worked very well together and had a very natural, unforced chemistry. It was very nice to see Reynolds take on a grittier and more intense role than we have seen from him previously. Washington is a true artist at playing taciturn and wiley, and no one else can portray the pain and shock of being shot as subtly or as convincingly as Washington with just a simple change of expression. That being said, the film had a number of issues. First and foremost, plot holes that you could drive a truck through and gaps in logic that really require the audience to take some serious leaps of faith. While there was some intense action, it was difficult to appreciate when it looked like the camera was being kicked around the floor during fight scenes, giving the film a very jerky quality. The film also suffered from some pacing issues with parts of the movie dragging as it worked toward an extremely predictable conclusion, one that I figured out very early into the film. There is some fine supporting work in the movie, particularly that of Gleeson and Arnezeder, as well as Ruben Blades as an old cohort of Frost's, but it is not enough to help the film live up to its intriguing premise.3 out of 5 stars",Safe House
141,tstudstrup,An R-rated bloodless cliche actionmovie.,1,21 September 2018,"This is swedish moviemaker Daniel Espinosa's first american movie. He gets a big budget and an R-rating but mucks it up anyway.Despite the rating there is never any blood when people are shot and no swearing. Whenever someone is shot it is either off camera or shown from a distance This might as well have been a PG13 movie. I know people are gonna say: so what? But it matters to me. Because I expect a movie to have no cencurship when it gets an R-rating. For some reason Espinosa decided tyo make this movie cencored, despite the rating. I hate the MPAA. They have ruined so many good movies in collaboration with greedy prodycers that wanbt a PG13 rating to get a younger audience. The movie itself is the generic actionthriler where the main character works for a government agency that cant be trusted. It feels like a Bourne movie, because of the plot and the shaky cam. I hate the Bourne movies and I hate movies like this that just copy other movies in terms of shaky cam and evil agencies. Sam Shepard plays the cliche government man for the 100th time. Good actors like Robert Patrick and Vera Farmiga are wasted here. Ryan Reynolds does a good job here, proving once again that he is a good actor. However if you wanna see a similar but much better movie that has bloood and humor and better action skip this and watch The Hitmans Bodyguard instead.

👨‍⚖️ Review : Safe House is an engaging action thriller filled with adrenaline rush you might have missed. With brilliant cast Denzel and Ryan this is probably one of the best action thrillers directed by Daniel Espinosa. A Fugitive on the run when a safe house is attacked and A Cop chases him , with simple premise the movie is extremely engaging.Denzel Washington is amazing throughout. His facial expressions and the goatee are enough to give that suave, convincing look of a man on the run... and a man who kills only professionals. Ryan does manage to stand at par (if not above) with Denzel Washington.Loads of gunshots, ruthless cop-criminal Q&A sessions, cars ramming into each other, long chases through the streets of Cape Town and the slums of Langa, smart and snazzy action cuts involving solid hand punches and enough energy to keep spirits up for the viewer.

You have Ryan Reynolds and you tell him to be serious, you have Denzel Washington and you have him reign it in? It just seems like Denzel is on autopilot for the entirety of the movie. I don't think anyone had a fun time making this movie. If I were a betting man I'd say the filmmakers knew this wasn't going to be a hit and treated it as such, just a movie to fill a release date and garner the studio a few extra dollars based on it's star power.

147,MovieSonic,The only thing good about this film are the fight scenes...,6,25 May 2012,"This film had a lot of hype and I was really looking forward to watching it but what a let down it was !First off; yes it is entertaining and worth watching but you can't call a film 'good' when it has absolutely no originality, incredibly bad excuses for why things are happening and is instantly forgettable.The film wasn't as suspenseful as it should have been because the plot was so obvious and I already knew why everyone was after Denzel.I knew who the real 'bad guy' was and I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end...and I was right every time.Question: (which will make sense after you watch the film)Do the C.I.A. only have three teams then?!Also;The excuse for not going to the U.S. Consulate was RIDICULOUS!!!!But obviously they needed a reason otherwise the film would have just ended there (again; becomes clearer after watching).I'm not usually someone who cares if plot lines aren't believable and I usually ignore holes in story lines but there are limits and this one was so unbelievable and ridiculous that for once, it actually affected my enjoyment of the film. I can't call the film good because it was too absurd and too predictable.Had it done anything differently, anything at all, and tried to be even a little bit realistic (just a little), I would have rated this at least an 8 because Ryan Reynold's acting was superb, Denzel is cool as always, the fight scenes were fantastic and the film 'looked' and 'sounded' great.It's just a shame it is essentially a re-make of every other film in its genre and made no attempt at realism.Fun but forgettable 6/10",Safe House
148,culmo80,Predictable to the end,4,14 March 2012,"This film wasn't all that fresh; we've seen it before in several other films. the Bourne Series, Body of Lies, Green Zone...you name it, there really isn't an original part of this film.Essentially, Ryan Reynolds plays an aspiring CIA Case Officer who has a dull assignment in South Africa. Meanwhile Denzel Washington meets with an MI-6 contact who gives him a microchip. The MI-6 contact is soon killed and there is a chase scene which forces Denzel to head to the US consulate. It is soon revealed that Denzel's character used to be a CIA Case Officer who ""turned traitor"" many years ago. When the CIA take Denzel to Reynolds' safehouse, it is promptly attacked by well-trained guys who take out the rest of the CIA team but Reynolds and Washington escape. Several chase scenes ensue, intermixed with scenes of bonding/confrontation between Reynolds and Washington. Add in a girlfriend for Reynolds who doesn't know what sort of work he does and you get the picture.Obviously, there's someone within the CIA trying to get Denzel and obviously, its one of the big bosses we see at Langley. Obviously, there will be a sort of mentorship between Denzel and Ryan.Look, this might have been a decent film if they had gone in a different direction, but it's a tired plot line, where evil intelligence agencies get ""truth to power"" in their faces. Obviously Denzel's character is supposed to be some sort of PFC Manning with Wikileaks. Nothing specific is ever discussed, just ""corrupt intelligence officials"" from all over the world.The sideplot with the girlfriend was about as predictable as it gets, from beginning to end. Then there are the loose ends. Reynolds was on video fighting with police, and he killed and officer...yet he just gets away clean? I don't think that would happen in real life. Had they written a better plot, they could have just avoided the second ""fight"" with the police at the stadium and it would have not affected the plot...at all.Anyway, plot aside, the action is hard to follow sometimes as it looks like its being recorded on some guy's iPhone or something.This really isn't worth going to the theaters for...wait for Netflix or onDemand or something.",Safe House
149,athomed,We have a last minute reservation,6,5 April 2012,"You know this kind of movie. The kind where you see it in theaters and root for the good guys in the numerous action sequences, occasionally muttering ""Yes!"" under your breath when one of the villains you can't stand finally catches a bullet. Then when you get home you have to read the synopsis on Wikipedia to find out for sure just what the heck happened in the movie.The gist of the movie is Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a low-level CIA worker. He's a ""housekeeper"" at a safe house where ""guests"" are detained and questioned. It's quite boring work until one day, a guest arrives and it's Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), the agency's most notorious traitor.The cast here is excellent. How can you not call a cast headlined by Washington excellent? He's one of the few from this acting generation who stands as tall as the Golden Hollywood stars of America's cinematic past. Reynolds is good enough. Green Lantern flopped; Scarlett Johansson dumped him; we can forgive Mr. Reynolds and it starts with this movie.While the cast is great, the script and direction lacks. The movie buzzes around fine for the first 70 minutes or so before the sub par script begins to labor. The movie still manages to accomplish a lot of what it set out to.",Safe House
150,TroyeEvans,Delivered Thrills,4,19 February 2012,"""We'll take it from here."" The film revolves around this saying. What we are given is, to a certain extent, a captivating crime thriller that is about the betrayal of agents. The storytelling is done through one main storyline with occasional emotional moments that are nothing intense.Do not be misled by the title. ""Safe House"" is not a ""Die Hard style"" thriller that takes place at a certain safe house. In fact, it is a chasing game that takes place across different territories. Denzel Washington plays a familiar role, the dangerous target pursued by the CIA. His encounter with Ryan Reynolds, a CIA safe-house keeper, removes the curtains to his escape from the CIA and the chase begins.On a deeper level, the movie unravels betrayals among agents, and a list kept by Washington soon becomes the focus of the film. The information on the list is so important that it even causes more betrayals and unexpected actions.""Safe House"" may be predictable at times and its theme may be one that has been used many times before, but still it manages to be captivating and thrilling as a whole. The power of Washington's great performance and Ryan Reynold's realistic portrait adds to the power and thrill of the film. This is not a typical Ryan Reynolds role, so taking that into account, his performance is really a breakthrough one.",Safe House
151,slayerjmk95,A Great Action Thriller Tribute,8,10 August 2012,"Safe House stars Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington in the lead roles of Matt Weston and Tobin Frost, one being a CIA operative in the field (Weston), but stuck inside a ""safe house"" in Cape Town, Africa. The other (Frost) is a rogue CIA Black Ops agent with information that could topple agencies and governments alike.A simple and known conspiracy story, this film is basically a large tribute to the Bourne films, as it has quite a bit of hand-to-hand combat that is very realistic and intense chase sequences that are realistic as well, as that was a HUGE focus of the Bourne films. The script for Safe House is very well written, one that i can remember greatly because of its similarities with the Bourne franchise. The action, effects and directing are all top-notch, with the director Daniel Espinosa taking the same direction Paul Greengrass did with The Bourne Ultimatum and Supremacy; a gritty and fast-paced atmosphere, with the camera shaking and moving every second, but not in a bad way. The music by Ramin Djawadi is very good as well, achieving its own mood and tones that are reminiscent of, say, Tony Scott's action packed films like Unstoppable. Denzel and Ryan were great working together; I never would have saw them in a film like this and be so great in it.Overall, Safe House is a good action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat with its great acting and intense action sequences, while thrusting you into a rich yet already-known story that you can't take your eyes away from. I'm a fan of the Bourne films and books, but this movie really did it for me; i find it as good as the Bourne films. A must-see for action-thriller fans8.5/10",Safe House

While I don't have problem with staggered jump cuts and stuff that makes you dizzy but ""feel the action,"" my issue with CIA-based plots & characters is guessing who's the traitor and things ain't what they seem and the usual tropes.

Great cast that also included Robert Patrick, Brandon Gleason, Sam Shepard, as well as a minor role for Liam Cunningham and Joel Kinnaman.

154,SteveMierzejewski,Safe House arresting,8,27 May 2012,"I figured this would be a routine action movie so, when I started to watch it, I went into the kitchen to feed the cat, figuring nothing much would be happening in the first five minutes anyway; at least nothing that I couldn't figure out later on. But, I was wrong. I had to start the movie over again as I had no idea what was happening when I returned. Yes, you have to pay a little more attention to the story line than you may think. This is not a series of car crashes and explosions loosely connected with a feeble plot. For the most part, this is a believable, interesting, and somewhat complex story.I say 'for the most part' it is believable. Denzel Washington plays a character similar to, but less sinister than, his Academy Award winning character in Training Day. However,I have some trouble with Ryan Reynolds playing a tough guy. I've known a number of tough guys and, let me tell you, Ryan Reynolds is not a tough guy. Yes, I understand, the movie needs a naive guy who gets caught up in something that's way over his head. Sure, you can't pick a better actor than Ryan Reynolds for this kind of part. He has carved out a niche as the naive, reluctant, action hero. But, then, suddenly, he becomes as tough and as ruthless as any character you'll ever meet. The transformation is close to miraculous. Had he been more bumbling, it would have been a bit more believable. I'm not faulting Reynold's acting ability here. I think he does good work, only the transformation.That said, the action scenes are good and you feel they are part of the movie rather than just tossed in to wake up the audience. Yes, some things are hard to swallow (He's sure lucky not to hit any people or cars when he's driving at 100 mph through the middle of a city!) but acceptable. You kind of see the end coming but it's all right. Perhaps the relationship between Washington and Reynolds could be developed more, but, again, it's all right.I don't want to give away the ending here so all I will say is that I salute the producers for not hinting at Safe House 2. So many movies these days just set us up for their sequel, which ruins the integrity of the movie we've been watching. In fact, we are now led to expect this in this film genre.So, should you watch this? Yes. And you will probably enjoy it.

155,sanddragon939,Nothing spectacular...but a Safe Bet...,7,19 February 2012,"'Safe House' may be a variation of the classic 'spy on the run' routine, but its an interesting variation nonetheless. Ryan Reynold's character Matt Weston is a low-level CIA agent trapped in a rundown job manning a seldom-used safehouse in Cape Town, when he finally gets an unexpected 'visitor' one day-none other than one of the Agency's most wanted, rogue agent Tobin Frost (played by Denzel Washington). Frost however is the target of mercenaries, and when they attack the safehouse, Weston is forced to go on the run with Frost and figure out what the hell is going on.Its a film which had a hell of a lot of potential, plot-wise, but somehow ended up being a bit TOO predictable. We had the usual chase scenes, fight scenes, shoot-outs, CIA handlers desperately trying to track down their agents gone 'off the reservation', and of course, a traitor. We also have the tried and tested sub-plot of the spy being in love, knowing that in his line of work, normal relationships are difficult to maintain...All of it is done reasonably well, but there are a half-dozen films which have done each of these, well, better.Where this film stands out is in the performance of the leads. The evolving relationship between Weston and Frost truly forms the core of the film. In many ways, Reynold's slightly wet-behind-the-ears and naive rookie is the perfect foil to Washington's jaded and driven character; and both men do arguably benefit from each other's worldviews through the course of the film. 'Safe House' is ultimately the perfect way to spend a Friday or Saturday evening if you've got time to kill...but its sure no Bourne Ultimatum, or even Salt for that matter.",Safe House

One of the most dependable is that the villain or bad guy or bully is a professed Christian. I know, that's shockingly original. The other tip off of horrendously lazy and creatively bankrupt thriller writing was displayed in this film (and has been done to death by others): *SPOILER, SPOILER* THE VILLAIN IS A BAD CIA AGENT. Whoa, never saw that coming (in the first four minutes of the film). And, the writer/producers just kicked up their laziness a notch by *SPOILER SPOILER* giving us the CIA willing to cover it all up to protect their reputation. The director tried for a more interesting approach to telling the story, by playing with the chronology of time for short periods within select segment, but, believe me, this was no ""Memento."" I kept watching, hoping the movie would be better than it was. It could have been really good, I mean, look at all the acting talent that went to waste, like Brendan Gleeson and Reuben Blades.

160,lekgolah,"Overlong, humourless, seen-it-before action.",4,18 September 2012,"The concept for Safe House sounds cool and exciting with lots of promise - A CIA agent's safe house in South Africa becomes under attack when an important person is interrogated. From there, the agent must keep the VIP safe as they are chased through SA until the CIA can get a team in and rescue them. Sounds simple enough. The story has plenty of opportunity for some fast-paced action and with Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds leading the way this could be really good. Training Day in South Africa? Far from I'm afraid. Despite starting off with a lot of unnecessary shaky hand-held camera angles, the film soon gets going as Denzel is captured and brought into the Safe House. From there he is questioned and things start to look bad as a knife is brought out when... mysterious bad guys break in through one single door and manage to kill everyone except the leads. The film could have had a mini Assault on Precinct 13 style action scene but it is poorly handled and gets the film off to a bad start. Sold as a straight-forward action film, it does just that but despite a few impressive hand-to- hand fight scenes, the action is just poorly shot and that really hurts the film, particularly towards the end. It is also just too long at 115 minutes for such a paper thin story. Sam Shepard, Vera Farmiga and Brendon Gleeson are given little to do with roles that should have gone to smaller actors, so you don't see how truly wasted they are. Denzel is always great in whatever he does but the film remains humourless throughout it's running-time, when the role needed a touch of charisma to help make it more enjoyable. Reynolds (who was great in the mediocre Smokin' Aces) manages to give a decent performance but again, without any humour in an action film like this, it becomes over- serious and tedious towards the end.If the film was shorter, the dry, serious tone wouldn't be as much of a problem but as it is, this has been done before and has been done better.",Safe House

162,MosHr,Denzel Bourne : Twice the shaky cam and very little of the style and wit,4,7 February 2012,"First thing about watching ""Safe House"" in the theaters: do not, I repeat DO NOT, sit in the front half of the cinema; I would suggest sitting in the back row unless you want to get nauseated and dizzy. Why? The shaky cam is really bad on this movie. Even in the non-action scenes, the camera is never still and constantly moving. During action scenes the camera all over the place creating headache inducing jerkiness and bobbling that can only be described by comparing it to symptoms of deadly diseases. The constant camera movement in the non-action scenes is also so bad that during each and every conversation in the movie, it's slowly rocking side to side for absolutely no reason, giving sea-sickness.Add to the shaky cam that half the movie is a close up of a close up. The faces take up most of the screen and go beyond even the field of vision. On top of that, add the way too much frequent cuts. It's a real eyeball and brain buster.However, if you're one of these people who are immune to shaky cam, the next topic is of course Denzel. Denzel gives his greatest hits: the Denzel-against-the-world Denzel, the Training-Day Denzel and the drama Denzel. Denzel is supposed to be playing a character Tobin Frost, but it's like we are watching Denzel Washington do his thing rather than Tobin Frost.Safe House borrows heavily from the Bourne movies, not just the shaky cam but the large screened command centers at the Pentagon and the mannerisms of the staff there. Another Bournesque element is the fights between trained agents; however in this movie, they just seem to be of lower quality with slower labored movements and the scenes reduced to a frantic blur. The singular car chase scene despite being the highlight of the action sequences, is also unsatisfying.The real oddity of the movie is how philosophical it wants to be about lives of CIA ""employees"". The movie gives us these long sullen monologues on relationships, pasts and futures, innocent victims etc. These musings would probably have some gravity if any of the characters were more than half dimensional and possessed some sort of personality. What we end up in the movie are a bunch of really big talking heads, sprouting lots of hollow dialog and adding to that headache.Other minor things, the water-boarding scene that the trailer alludes to completely flubbed. It is as exciting as watching someone water their lawn.Speaking of product placements, ""Safe House"" has been commandeered as a product placement vehicle for a certain brand of car that only makes boxy SUVs. Each and every car in the movie is of this brand; I mean every government car, every bad guy car, all 3-4 cars jacked along the way is a boxy SUV. This way too silly and distractingly sticks out.In summary, Safe House would have been a mediocre but watchable movie without the shaky cam. With the shaky cam, it's just a big headache inducing mess. Devout Denzel followers might get something out of it but for most action fans, I would suggest waiting for the DVD version which it is more suited for.",Safe House

And as expected Denzel steals the show, and he and Reynolds work well together. I think it's well directed, I like some of the cinematography which is gorgeous, and I like its dark gritty atmosphere. Now the problem here lies in the script, it is so predictable and paint by the numbers. The action is at parts choppily edited and that annoys the everlasting hell out of me. Overall its great cast, pacing, and action help elevate Safe House from its script to it being the status of a Above-Average action movie.",Safe House
164,Mrbigham13,Good not great.,7,29 October 2021,This is a fast paced action thriller all the way. The thing I liked most about it was how tense and unfunny Reynolds was for once in his life. He's like a bad joke that never ends if you've ever seen literally any other Ryan Reynolds movie. Denzel steals the show as usual and Shepard plays the perfect CIA asshole. It's a very good film. The only thing that keeps it from being great is the lack of character lovability. Yes I like Reynolds and Washington but I don't Love them. All in all you're still getting a very solid CIA thriller that's worth seeing to the end. I'd even recommend this for a second viewing sometime down the line. Check it out.,Safe House
165,ticket_for_one,Safe as houses,6,27 February 2012,"Had no idea Denzel was approaching 60. He doesn't look 60. Anyway he's still got the swagger he's always had and continues to play great characters and remains a phenomenal actor. Arguably, he's the best actor of his generation. I'll skip the synopsis. Ryan Reynolds seems to have put his Van Wilder and Two Guys and a Girl days behind him. Yeah sure Green Lantern was a mess, but if can display more of the depth he showed in Buried, he'll be on Washington's level soon enough. I thought this was decent thriller but it looked as if director Daniel Espinosa went to the Tony Scott/Paul Greengrass School of directing. He uses a very erratic grainy style of filmmaking which is watchable in some scenes and unwatchable in others. That being said, the set pieces are excellent and you'll get a mixture of gun play, car chases and realistic fight scenes. Performances are OK. Denzel (more or less) moonwalks his way playing the anti hero. Reynolds does a decent job playing the reluctant Bourne safe house keeper and able support comes in the form of Sam Shepherd and Rueben Blades. But like most films Safe House isn't perfect. Vera Farmiga is wasted and boring. And Brendan Gleeson huffs and puffs and occasionally says something to remind you what part he plays in this film. Great actors, wasted in this. Script is dry and unimaginative and the entire story was predictable and poor. Safe House does have wonderful cinematography, capturing the beauty and modernisation of Cape Town. The scenes with Farmiga and Glesson are too similar to Joan Allen and Brian Cox's those in The Bourne Supremacy. Clashing over policy and protocol and looking to get brownie points from their superior whilst trying to out-do each other. And....I have nothing else. Safe House is worth the release, but it's nothing to jump out of your seat for. Good DVD on a rainy Saturday night.",Safe House

Turns out there are bad people who do government spying, they appear to be, hope you're sitting down, duplicitous, greedy, violent. I know, who would have thunk it? The movie essentially has a bunch of murderers of one CIA stripe killing a bunch of murderers of another CIA stripe, that's pretty much the beginning and end of it. Nothing else at stake, no giant Maguffin, nuclear annihilation, the discovery of the holy grail, whether Lindsey Lohan will ever pull out of her dive, nothing here. And really good actors doing mostly nothing of interest in service to nothing of consequence. No one was seen in a good light here, oops, save the French girlfriend and one simply perfectly shot aerial scene of a car going vertically up the screen through fields, a relatively short shot, but magnificent nonetheless, painterly, in fact.

167,facebook-124-955845,a film Denzel Washington fans will love,7,11 February 2012,"2012 has started off with some fairly enjoyable action films, such as Contraband, Red Tails, Chronicle and The Grey; and we're only 6 weeks into the year! Safe House, the new film starring Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, continues the hot streak Hollywood has been on.Director Daniel Espinosa has a small directorial resume, none of which have been studio pictures. Safe House is the first studio film for Espinosa, and he does not disappoint. Similar in directorial style to Tony Scott, a frequent collaborator with Denzel Washington, Espinosa uses a choppy camera style, a number of close range fight sequences and doesn't waste any time before kicking things into high gear. There's no shortage of action sequences, ass kicking, and gun fights; but some of the best parts of the film revolve around the intellectual back and forth between Washington and Reynolds. The best thing Espinosa does is allow the film's stars to do what they do best, keep us engaged.In Safe House, Denzel plays Tobin Frost a rogue ex-CIA agent highly sought after by the United States for trading top-secret information. Ryan Reynolds, proving that he's capable of being more than just comedic talent or a guy taking off his shirt, although he does it not long into Safe House, plays CIA agent Matt Weston. Reynolds' Weston, an inexperienced agent for the CIA, has been biding his time working as watch guard over a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa while awaiting a field promotion. After Frost turns himself in to the American Consulate, he's transferred to the safe house for interrogation. Unfortunately, or more like unsurprisingly, the safe house turns out to be not so safe forcing Weston to flee and protect Frost; unbeknown to Weston, Frost has plans of his own. Although we're meant to dislike Frost, Washington makes it difficult because he's at his best when he plays flawed characters; especially ones with questionable morals. Washington has always brought a level of intelligence and charisma to his characters and Frost is no different. Denzel Washington has made high quality films for over twenty years; beginning with Glory and continuing with Safe House. Unfortunately for Denzel, there's an expectation for him to be great or close to it, in every movie he appears; in Safe House he doesn't disappoint. Supporting roles played by Sam Shepard, Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson and Robert Patrick are very well cast and do not disappoint.As much as I enjoyed Safe House, this was not a perfect picture. The relationship between Weston and his girlfriend Ana, played by Nora Arnezeder was unnecessary. It felt forced and like a cheap attempt to include a love story or romantic angle to a movie that didn't need it. Another issue I had was with regards to the choppiness of the camera-work. It's becoming something we're seeing more frequently in action films, and often times distracting. The biggest issue however, was the level of predictability. By no means am I saying that every film needs to have a red herring, but at least make an attempt to force viewers into thinking a little. Although not perfect, Safe House is a very likable film and one that most action film fans will like; and one that Denzel Washington fans will not want to miss.Grade: Bvisit our site at www.twodudereview.com",Safe House
168,socialmedia-437-956449,Beautiful but lacks enough dimension,6,15 August 2012,"Denzel Washington, who turned 57 last December, has been leaping through explosions and returning gunfire for a number of years now. ""Safe House"" follows ""Unstoppable"", ""The Book of Eli"" and ""The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3"". Many of his friends might describe this turn of events as a career crisis. Yet he appears in rude health. In ""Safe House"", Washington, who plays a former CIA operative Tobin Frost, leaps from rooftops. He races from city to township in a 4X4. He runs and kicks and tackles any number of anonymous henchmen. It is exhausting just to see him.""Safe House"", directed by Swede Daniel Espinosa, is the latest addition in a series of conspiracy thrillers – ""Wanted"", ""Shooter"", ""Knight and Day"" – that could make for an interesting alternative to the traditional bankers away day. The story, or the glue which holds together a series of tense and sometimes rewarding action chases together, starts in Cape Town where Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), is charged with the security of a safe house. When we first meet Frost, members of the CIA are attempting to extract information through waterboarding. The film-makers have not sought to consult any real victims of water torture. Throughout the ordeal, Washington maintains a look of mild bemusement.From then on, the story shifts into acceleration mode as the building is infiltrated by hordes of gun wielding mercenaries seeking Frost. CIA officials are killed and Weston escapes to deliver Frost to another secure location. We are treated to a quick tour of Capetown – Weston loses Frost during a shootout at a football match, only to find his quarry mired in another gun battle in a shanty town. The viewer barely has time to admire Cape Town's sparkling underground railway system. There is, of course, a point to all this aerobic exercise. Weston is concealing a microchip, implanted in his skin when we first see it, which contains the names of corrupt Mossad, CIA and MI6 agents. He plans to sell the information to the highest bidder.If all this sounds like an appetizer for the next round of Jason Bourne films, it is worth noting that cinematographer Oliver Wood worked on the Matt Damon trilogy. Here, he and Espinosa use multiple cameras to duck and weave between shots, going in close for fight scenes, far and wide for chase sequences. The result isn't narrative bedlam: the timing of the action scenes is crisp and the chronology of each fight sequence, often seen through multiple views, is both coherent and rational. The film which looks as if it was sandblasted of color, looks visually beautiful.Apart from an occasional pause, Washington has little chance to deliver a nuanced performance. We learn that he once survived a CIA-backed sabotaging of an airplane, in which his wife and children died. Their deaths have led to him becoming a rogue operative. This is an all too brief attempt at three dimensional rendering and we are quickly whisked away from Frost's grief when the film returns to a whiplash inducing sequence of hand-to-hand combat. In comparison, Ryan Reynolds plays rookie to Washington's seasoned veteran, both in character and as actor. He has little cause to extend his range beyond a worried, bloodied grimace. Many talented individuals were undoubtedly involved in the making of ""Safe House""; as the credits rolled across the screen, I couldn't help but notice the long list of stuntmen and choreographers credited. In the end, the actors are merely props, arranged to be shot, stabbed and strangled.",Safe House
169,giantpanther,"Decent Movie, but a waste of some real Talent",5,10 February 2012,"My rating of 5/10 is at once both generous and not. Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington do the best they can but ultimately the director hits the wrong tone and the cinematography is at times distractingly bad.Here's what the previews led me to believe, Reynolds is young and driven but inexperienced as the keeper of a safe house, Washington is an old professional rogue agent who will offer him advice. None of that advice was ever really shared, I thought a certain bond would be formed between Washington and Reynolds or at least a hesitant mutual respect but none of that took shape.I kept waiting for that point where one character proves to be more than what we were led to believe early on that they were, but no. Washington and Reynold's characters of Weston and Tobin stay the same throughout the whole movie, Weston is none the wiser because of Tobin and thats all there is to it.Still there's enough basic action and minimal suspense to keep you entertained during a matinée showing so on that level I can't knock the film. The problem is there were several moments where I was left wondering why not a little more exploration into these characters or the story.Also while watching the movie I just assumed it was PG-13, I never pay attention to the ratings but none of the violent fight scenes were that particularly violent so I told myself oh it must be because they needed to maintain the PG-13 but no, this movie is an R and yet they still avoided showing brutal fight scenes. All of the violence was so rapidly edited together and shot from such obscure angles that you can barely even tell what is going on.I give credit to Washington and Reynolds for doing the best they could to overcome weak direction, editing, cinematography, and screen writing.",Safe House
170,knowyourmovie,A satisfying and engaging but purely entertaining crime thriller,7,8 March 2012,"Hollywood critics did it again. They disapproved a good movie ""Safe House"" and expressed their disapproval in the numerous negative reviews filled with their favorite pseudo-professional jargon. Although that was certainly not the first and not the last time the critics made fools of themselves, nowadays such blunders can be costlier than ever. In the times when over a hundred of ""Safe House"" audience reviews are readily available on IMDb and over a hundred and twenty pages of them are easily accessible on ""Rotten Tomatoes"", do we even need to torture ourselves and choke over all the indigestible nonsense the professional Hollywood critics produce?Of course, they will say that their opuses are different: highly professional, deeply insightful, and incredibly original. Well, reading some of their ""Safe House"" reviews made me seriously question these statements. For example, should a professional movie critic know that ""Safe House"" is a thriller, and a thriller is a genre that uses suspense, tension and excitement as the main elements? If so, have the critics ask themselves a simple question: ""Does ""Safe House"" have enough suspense, tension, and excitement to keep the audience glued to the screen?"" For the vast majority of us, common people, the answer to that question will be a profound ""yes"", but not for the delicate professional critics elite, of course.Some of them whine that the story, written for ""Safe House"" by David Guggenheim, is very basic, almost non-existent. Well, yes, the sheer abundance of the exciting action, the thrilling suspense, and the strong tension does not leave much room for a profound ""story"" in the movie. Instead, it has the most amazing car chase scenes far surpassing the ones in the critically acclaimed ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"". Is that really that bad? Should they have replaced all these boring, annoying car chases in ""Safe House"" with some deeply convoluted ""story"" in order to appease the critics?Other professional critics complain that the Daniel Espinosa's movie lacks suspense. One critic even wrote that ""Safe House"" almost did not have any suspense at all. How very interesting! I think this looks more like a possible individual medical problem – something wrong with the vision or with the image processing in the brain. A third group of critics maintains that ""Safe House"" lacks intrigue and admittedly, they are mostly correct. The lack of an intrigue, however, is hardly noticeable in the middle of all the thrill and excitement brought by the movie. Finally, certain critics distinguished themselves by achieving something almost impossible for us, lowly earthlings: feeling unhappy with the acting in the movie. According to their displeased grumbling and mumbling, Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds did not have enough opportunities to show their acting skills and did not have enough good scenes together. What these critics seem to forget is that the main goal of the movie was to keep the audience engaged and excited and not to provide Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds with a chance to demonstrate all the numerous facets of their remarkable acting talents. In addition, ""Safe House"" does not aspire to be a multi-dimensional drama or a new ""Training Day"". As a purely entertaining thriller, it does not call for any unwarranted depth or any excessive complexity. Overall, for a thriller the acting was definitely above the average, if not spectacular. Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds did a great job, well-supplemented by Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard, Fares Fares, and Robert Patrick in supporting roles.Having said all that, I did not want to leave you with a false impression that ""Safe House"" is flawless. It is not a masterpiece, but simply another enjoyable and entertaining movie that received unfairly harsh reviews from many professional critics. If thriller is among your favorite genres, ""Safe House"" definitely deserves a closer look from you.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",Safe House

172,CagedinSanity,Nothing you haven't seen before.,3,23 February 2012,"I wanted to like this. I really did. I love Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds is good enough not to be type-casted while still holding onto his own style.Unfortunately, nothing works here.This movie is incredibly simple to summarize, due to it's simplicity. Ryan Reynolds plays a caretaker of a Safe House. He's a CIA agent trying to prove himself, and that chance comes when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington, and the only character who's name I can even remember) is caught through some suspiciously specific circumstances comes his way.Sounds cool, right? It's not.Specifically? It's nothing we haven't seen. Corrupt government, predictable plot points and you'll figure out who the bad guy is halfway through the movie, which takes away some of it's sting. It predictably tried to make us think the woman-agent (I don't even know their names) was working against the office but it wasn't, because the movie pressed to much into her ""hardass"" attitude. It wasn't believable.The biggest disappointment was the whole plot point, the MOVIE'S TITLE, was barely utilized. I went in expecting a psychological thriller, maybe 60-75% of the movie taking place in the Safe House as Tobin Frost messes with the minds of everyone around him. That's what the trailers implied anyway. I got no such thing.Instead, the Safe House is broken into within minutes of Frost entering the building. There's a second safe house later in the movie and it, too, serves little point except the placeholder of the climax. All in all? I doubt we get 10 minutes worth of what is supposed to be the movie's title. Frankly, the movie should have been renamed.Let's not forget that Frost barely proves his reputation, which we get in a quick scene of exposition as it explains that he ""rewrote interrogation protocol"" or something. At most, he says about four mindscrewing lines to Reynolds' character, and not much happens with it.It just felt everything this movie was supposed to be was abandoned.That's what I didn't like. The fight scenes were fine, the actors were fine, even (some of the) writing was fine. But when I left I found it difficult to like this movie.",Safe House
173,amahlanand,Not the Safest Bet,5,8 June 2012,"Welcome to Denzel Washington's world of thrillers part umpteen. The report card this time though is quite mediocre. Why? Simply because the script unfortunately doesn't beg to differ from genre convention and makes use of overused and overdone story arcs.If you ask me, the whole CIA conspiracy thriller concept is just beginning to become stale. There really is limited variation possible. It takes little thinking here to anticipate the next stages and the vital plot points not to mention the people of interest. Films like these tend to promise much and leave you half full. It took eons to ascertain why, what and how and as a result, all you can see on screen for a majority of the movie is people running around helter skelter with no solid reasoning or basis behind it. Just trying to capture someone doesn't tell the full story. It doesn't even reach the threshold of mindless action, I didn't find anything novel and cool about it in any way from that perspective. If the nifty almost intentionally slack camera work was supposed to make it feel different, I couldn't quite see it.If we saw any dissimilarities from the status quo, it was in all likeliness, in the acting. Seldom do we see 'Mr. Thriller' Denzel Washington in an antagonist role and this time, his character Tobin Frost was a scheming, mind manipulating character rather than the regular crook we've seen in Oscar winner 'Training Day' and 'American Gangster'. He isn't the most extroverted actor, but his skill lies in how he can create a dangerous personality without coming out of his shell. I'd sum up Ryan Reynolds in two words, nervy and shaky. But those characteristics drove an inspired show as the naïve rookie. As a pair, they were okay I guess, but brilliant, no. I always admire Brendan Gleeson's involvement as well in spy, conspiracy thrillers and it was good to see him more heavily used. Shallow as a conspiracy thriller and devoid of mentionable action, it just didn't have anything to set it apart. Feeble scripting makes it your average joe thriller albeit far from compelling.",Safe House

Sure there's lots of action however let me give you an example of why this was a poorly written movie:So he (Ryan Reynolds) is at a stadium surrounded by thousands of people watching a soccer game with a gun pointed at the bad guy (Denzel) just so Reynolds can find a locker with a cell phone when he SHOULD have just left Denzel in the dang car, like he did in a previous scene. So of course Denzel claims he's being kidnapped, then Denzel gets away even though he's cuffed and escorted by police officers, and of course Reynolds magically found him in less than a minute at this huge stadium. Nothing in the whole stadium scene was believable. I quit watching after this scene.I already had my doubts about this movie when Reynolds escaped the breached safe house with Denzel in the trunk. The bad guys perforated the car they were in with hundreds of bullets yet neither one of them got hit.

Safe House is able to do it to a point. The greatest success of this movie is the usage of modern film techniques. Too often the bulging budget and ability to edit in effects makes action/thriller movies extremely unrealistic. Safe House does the opposite. It takes all of these techniques and uses them to make the movie raw and real.The actors were hand-picked perfectly for their roles. Ryan Reynolds is the actor you have to use when you want to put a likable, relatable family man in a difficult situation. As a CIA operative caught up in something far outside his experience, he fits in perfectly. As for Denzel Washington, there is little that he can't do. For the unique character of Tobin Frost, there is no better man to fill the role. Together they form a storyline that merely needs to be able to stand on its own two feet. The storyline does stand on its own. That being said, it is the weakest part of the movie. The twists have all been seen before. This movie doesn't offer new plot points to the old conspiracy theory movie. It merely adds new characters. The new characters are great, but it is not enough. In order for the movie to be great, it needed to give something new to the story.I must say that the end was beautiful. Without giving anything away, it was gracefully preformed. It wrapped up the loose ends that too many other movies simply leave hanging. It adds a whole other dimension to Ryan Reynolds' character. It will, without a doubt, leave you wanting more but somehow completely satisfied.Safe House is worth a trip to the theatre. With thrillers such as this one, the action is better on the big screen. Between the action and the actors, you will not be disappointed. Next to Liam Neeson's The Grey, this is one of the best action movies so far this year. The thing is, it could have been even better.

Running Time: 1hr&57mns.My Take: **1/2 (out of ****) There are times where I feel really dumb at the movies. Does that make sense? I will elaborate: You attend a feature film presentation, ready to become immersed in the picture. You cleared your mind of conscious thought and let the transpirings of the screen happen. The audience around you appears to be having a good time. They laugh on cue and seem to be following the film fineeveryone, that is, except for you.This is the overall experience I had while watching the latest Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds picture ""Safe House."" It is a film of visual brilliance, quick action cut-away shots and high tension. These are the usual ingredients of pot-boiler international intrigue movies. There is no reinventing the wheel for the genre, except of course for studios to put out a movie that is better than the last one to make it stick with folks long after it is over. To achieve this, the film must adhere to attention to detail and have a visceral effect on its viewers. There are numerous variables to make this kind of movie work.""Safe House"" opens with the pursuit of the international criminal Tobin Frost (Washington). He's a former CIA agent with a file of grave importance in his possession. Their contents, if discovered, would cause irrevocable damage to global security, foreign and domestic. After he arrives at the American embassy in South Africa, he is relocated to a CIA safe house in Cape Town for interrogation.Running this safe house location is the low-level ""housekeeper"" Matt Weston (Reynolds). He is young, brash and idealistic. After his safe house is raided by the unrelenting mercenary Vargas (Dares Fares), who will stop at nothing to take Frost down, Weston takes Frost prisoner and they go into hiding.The chase is on. While Weston is retrieving a GPS device to track the detrimental file, Frost uses his cunning and ingenuity to escape. The CIA headquarters is abuzz with how to track Frost and secure the stolen file before it is too late. CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard) is adamant for the file to be accounted for and never again see the light of day. He asserts that whoever is possession of the file will have many enemies.""Safe House"" is a thunderously paced ""cat and mouse"" picture. The cinema photography is unique from other action pictures. While the use of ""documentary style"" camera technique is nothing new, I enjoyed the infusion with the warm kelvinesque colors throughout the picture. The stark beauty of South Africa is presented strongly and boldly.This film features great action sequences and the acting talent pooled together is quite impressive, though most of it is underutilized. Why are the versatile Ruben Blades and Vera Farmiga (""Up in the Air"") wasted here? Their characters are set up with the promise of seeing them more, then nothing. What did I miss here? ""Safe House"" is the American film debut for Swedish filmmaker Daniel Espinosa (less than Swedish-sounding?). He allegedly drew from several decades worth of international intrigue thrillers as the inspiration for his own offering. Espinosa stated he wanted his picture to have relatable qualities for U.S. movie-goers, calling it ""a classic American tale."" But is it really? As I watched ""Safe House,"" I felt like I had seen all of these elements before, but in better movies. That's not to say these elements couldn't have worked here. They actually do, but to a very limited effect. The show stoppers on ""Safe House"" are coherence and cohesion. These are imperative to make any movie work as a whole.Coherence: ""Safe House"" is so quick in pace I honestly felt like the filmmakers left out plot points. I had a hard time keeping up with what was going on. I definitely was never sure of what was going on. Maybe, as I watched the movie, I might have been distracted. Then again, maybe not. As I mentioned at the opening of this review, I felt dumb trying to put this film together. If the reactions of other moviegoers in attendance is any indication, there seem to have been some people who seem to have gotten it. I wish I were one of them.Cohesion: This is one of the most disjointed, ""all-over-the-map"" movies I've seen in many a moon. I never knew how the scenes pieced together or why.""Safe House"" might be a good time at the movies for the right demographic. It has some really great factors, though I felt it never came together. It felt scattered, disconnected and clichéd. Based on that, in good faith I cannot recommend this film. I know I'm not totally alone, as many people I quizzed after the movie felt the same way I did. Whew! It's not just me. If you saw ""Safe House"" and enjoyed it, I'm glad. For me, it was an incoherent editorial mess that begged to be more than the sum of its parts.

He is stuck with the boring job of sitting in a ""safe house"" - a secret location for detaining prisoners (""house guests"") until they can be moved to a more secure location.Things are pretty boring until Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) is brought it. Frost is a notorious double agent known for his ability to evade capture. No sooner is Frost secured in Weston's safe house than a bunch of bad guys storm the place to capture Frost. Weston takes charge and ushers Frost out of the building. Weston wants to get Frost to a new safe house but he is nagged by the question of how the bad guys knew where to find Frost – there must be a mole in the CIA. Now Weston must deliver Frost, discover Frost's secret, and expose the CIA mole before they find him. And we're off""Safe House"" uses the device of the mature, older, agent as mentor to push the Weston character to look at himself and ask hard questions: Is this the life I want? Will I ever have a decent relationship? Who can I ever really trust?Denzel Washington walks effortlessly through the role of Tobin Frost. He manipulates Weston by forcing him to think about things that, as a younger man, Frost had to confront himself. I haven't seen Washington in a movie in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised to see the actor that I remembered from such fine movies as ""Philadelphia"" and ""Crimson Tide."" He was just as good as ever, and had mellowed with age. Ryan Reynolds held his own against Washington, playing the younger, inexperienced agent who learns fast. Reynolds has had a lot of screen time recently in such movies as ""Green Lantern,"" ""The Proposal,"" and ""The Change Up."" He usually plays a comic character – which is appropriate as he holds a comic resume (""Van Wilder,"" and TV's ""Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Place."") Here, he plays a full-on action hero to Washington's more experienced mentor.The dynamic between these two players is exciting to watch. There is no apparent competition on-screen (which is so often the case when mega- personalities come together). Instead, there is a wonderful creative collaboration that results in an entertaining action flick.Sadly, the surrounding plot is pretty predictable and does not support the two players. The action is acceptable, but the real movie is about the older, wiser man guiding the younger man. Perhaps it isn't just the characters who are playing out the mentor/mentee relationship, but the actors as well.So, for a predictable action/spy plot with two fine actors playing their roles perfectly, I can only recommend that you wait for the instant download.",Safe House

There were a couple of scenes which do get you on the edge of your seat. If you're an action movie fan like me, then there is enough to satisfy. I should also like to emphasise that its about time that they put in proper action scenes since many action movies as of late don't seem to have scenes like this anymore making it all the more frustrating.

Ryan Reynolds is not weary believable as a CIA operative on any level, he's hero characters are never the take charge kind of guy. They are always kind of wussy characters who just end up being at the wrong place at the wrong time.

All fight sequences are tense and gritty, including a brutal one involving shards of glass that'll make you wince. I was a bit dubious about pairing the excellent Denzel Washington with the less inspiring Ryan Reynolds; however they work well as a team.

Even the sound effects--the sound stage I believe is the correct term--are so realistic and very effective in making you feel every bullet whiz by and thud into a door frame or shatter a window. When Ryan Reynolds grapples with an assailant they are so convincing in their struggle, that you can feel the stress and strain of every muscle pushing back the blade from plunging into your throat.While I most certainly enjoyed watching ""Safe House"" (and my 7/10 score reflects that), I was disappointed with the identification of the 'baddy'. At the very beginning of the film I knew it would be him. When it was finally revealed to us that it WAS him, it felt cheap and clichéd. Perhaps I've seen too many of these type of movies, but I can spot basically from the actor choice who it will be. Maybe I'm wrong in knocking a point off just because of my jaded cynicism.

The camera-work is often wobbly, which is acceptable in small amounts during action scenes because it makes the scene more realistic, but in this one it's just used too much and sometimes even outside of action scenes. And the acting...again, I was really expecting more. Denzel Washington is a personal hero of mine, but in this film he either doesn't get enough dialog to display the talent he has, or he has somehow lost it. And Ryan Renolds...well I never really liked him, but I thought he'd be perfect for this part.

Denzel captivates in every scene and is fully believable as a world-class killer. Denzel alone is worth watching the film.Ryan Reynolds is good as the inexperienced CIA agent who is pulled into a harrowing adventure for which he is unprepared. The chemistry and interaction between Denzel and Ryan was great. Despite their differnet and contrary objectives, you can't help rooting for a positive ending for both of them.The directing was frenetic, as the director used many camera techniques to highlight the chaos and action.

He looks like a Shakespearean actor in the midst of an amateur play. Ryan Reynolds does create a character, although I found it not quite believable that a rookie government agent could be quite so Terminator-like in his determination to carry out his mission; he never falters.

Safe House is not meant to be exceptional. It's meant to be a good movie within a defined genre with a flair that hasn't been done before.I'm not sure whoever decided that all movies must be original, who was that all you reviewers? The movie isn't really original, though the concept of a safe house and its keeper is interesting and hasn't been done before like this. There is nothing technically wrong with the movie, and even though you may hear about ""plot holes,"" there really are none. That's just ignorant people's way of saying they didn't like it. Everything is explained clearly, to the point of excess. It's obvious at almost every turn what the next step will be in the movie. Maybe not specifically, but not much is left up to the imagination. And don't get me wrong, it's not by poor design that you cannot figure out till the end who the real nemesis is. The movie tells you step by step what's about to happen next.Maybe we're at the point in filmography where that's considered a bad thing. We're also in a point in filmography where subtitles are apparently too much hassle, and few people see films outside their native language. Tis a sad day, my friend.This is not an exceptional film, but it is a solid one. If you want to be mentally challenged, you should go read a book. This is a good flick with a good amount of action, and a somewhat believable storyline. It's certainly not perfect, but it's certainly solid.

But i still watch them all, they are typically good entertaining thrillers.When I saw the cast of this movie and the preview the expectations were set high: besides Denzel, you have Sam Shepherd, Vera Farmiga, and the promising Ryan Reynolds (typical Hollywood thriller formula to pair a more veteran and a youngster actor to please several generations). On top of that, a promise to see a movie filmed in a non-traditional scenery, South Africa.However, this movie was a big disappointment, with a ridiculous/old plot (all about CIA agents, rogue and silly ones), stepping into each other, confusing. Bad acting by Reynolds, not impressive Farmiga and Shepherd, all in my mind caused by bad direction and writing. Still typical thriller with decent car chasing and (predictable)twists, but none of that seem to really surprise or excite the audience, especially with the expected ending.

However due to a series of events, Reynolds' character ends up having to try to subdue Frost until he can be handed into the CIA's hands. A pretty typical storyline and a few twists and turns which many will probably figure out halfway through the movie.

It was all swell having the action but without a decent, easy to understand plot, what's the use? Second thing was the fact that it was so boring for at least the first hour, there were ""split ends"" everywhere and it just seemed like there was nothing going on, the film never really got started until an hour into it. After the hour, it got slightly better, the action was good and it started to get a little credit. But not much because of the sheer rubbish plot, the confusion, and everything else. Surely the producers saw these holes? The only real good bit about this film was Ryan Reynolds, he had a very good part in this film and played it well, Denzel Washington was good as well, but still lacked the ability to releases his full acting potential because of his characters constant characteristic changing.This film truly was a waste of money and certainly isn't full of potential like i thought it would be.

Ryan Reynolds plays a rookie CIA agent named Matt Weston who has been waiting for his 'big break' to care for a fugitive in his safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. His wish is finally granted when Tobin Frost (Washington) comes along. Frost is a former CIA agent who went rogue because he was against the corruption in the government.When Weston realizes that he has come into contact with such a frightening, powerful fugitive like Frost, it's easy to see that he may not be as prepared as he thought he was. The only thing that could make him more nervous would be an attack on the safe house, which is exactly what happens.The mercenaries who attack are after Frost for a reason Weston is unaware of. Since Weston is the host of the safe house and Frost is the houseguest, Weston is responsible for Frost. If anything happens to him, Weston is at fault.Weston decides to find a way to escape while making sure Frost does not leave his sight. Frost entertains himself by constantly getting in Weston's head, drawing connections between the two of them.As usual, Denzel Washington's performance is exceptional. The audience finds itself hating Frost at one moment and feeling sympathy for him at another. Ryan Reynolds does not seem like the type of actor who could play a rugged CIA agent. However, it is a pleasant surprise to see him toughen up and not be the comedic pretty boy again. Reynolds' performance is much better than expected.The only negative aspect of ""Safe House"" is the unoriginality of the plot.

The rookie turning out to be a veteran but can he be turned? There are no major surprises apart from you ending up routing for the heroes and hoping they both make it through.I love the fact that the movie takes place in Cape Town, South African rather than the usual US or Europe. Just like Man on Fire which I believe was filmed in Mexico. It kind of brings a new look and breath of fresh air to action movies adding that realistic feel to it.I think the combination of two quite distinctive however really cool actors played well. While one actor plays an expert and considered the best in his field, the other finally gets a chance to prove himself and you get to enjoy watching him instinctively utilize his CIA training and natural talents. I would have loved to learn more about Denzel's character however it's still a good movie worth watching.

Ryan Reynolds was pretty good too.Daniel Espinosa's methods of directing this picture maybe controversial,but i like it.he moves with the camera,he give you the feeling of being in the middle of the action with the loud sounds of the gunshots,the accidents and the ongoing action. the script was not great,it had flows,some of the story event were not that convincing,not that captivating but also some were pretty realistic and i like this,also Denzel and Reynolds made this film fine through their finesse. i believe Denzel Washington and tom hanks just take the script,eat ,digest it and instantly become the characters they are performing.they are an amazing exceptional actors.",Safe House
213,dreamflix,Denzel is Bad as Good,8,19 February 2012,"You want action and a story line? Go see this. Like Denzel? Like Ryan Reynolds? Go see this. It holds up.Denzel plays such a slick character. I could make guesses as to why he'd choose to play this part. Probably because he's oh so good at it! The previews leave you with that - is he good, is he bad, in this role. Then you go see the movie and find out. It leaves you talking good things, which is good. Go see something you don't like and you'll end up talking things you don't like.Here come the spoilers. The film is set in Cape Town, So. Africa. Tobin Frost(Washington) is a former CIA agent gone rogue about 10 years ago. Seems he was selling off intel. But one last sell goes bad and he coolly walks into the U.S. Consulate for protection. That takes him to Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who was getting punch drunk bored being caught up in a Safe House. He'd been asking for a new assignment, but his boss, Barlow (Brendan Gleeson), kept saying any day now. Reynolds has a girlfriend, Ana, who'd just been accepted an oncology internship in Paris.Frost messes up Weston's day when he enters the Safe House. A group of agents, led by Daniel Kiefer (Robert Patrick - older and stouter since his Terminator/X-File days). Kiefer and his boys waterboard Frost, who seems to get happy about it. By now the War Room back at Langley is all fired up because they've got Tobin Frost, an agent who psychologically tested off the charts years ago (in 1983 according to them. They date Weston being born in 1982). Then more action. The Safe House is attacked. All agents down except Weston and Frost and the two of them are off. There's a great car chase scene through the city and expressway. When things quiet down, Weston and Frost exchange words here and there. Washington is on top of his game, playing against Reynolds, the younger actor. Yet, it comes through in the script as well. There's Weston, born in 1982, and Frost joining the CIA in 1983. You may go back and think about some of the roles Washington has had over the past ten years. He was the antagonist to Ethan Hawke in Training Day, and won an Academy Award. Then he was with Mila Kunis in The Book if Eli. Then there was Chris Pine in Unstoppable. Now, he's with Reynolds in Safe House. It's as though it's the younger actor's training day with Washington in each film. In each of these entries, it's his mind against the youth. Of course in the Book of Eli, as a blind man, Washington could still hold his own with his stick. But you look in his eyes in this role and you can see the thinking man. Reynolds is thinking, yet he's still fresh and young. All of that plays into their respective parts.Vera Farminga brought a familiar part to this action story. She was good as the agent Goodwin in Source Code with Jake Gyllenhaal. She talked him through his mission. In this role, she's again as an agent with the stuffy, dark suit. Linklater (Farminga) banters back and forth with Barlow over whether or not Weston has gone rogue himself. She thinks he has and Barlow says he hasn't. They continue this even after they arrive in So. Africa.The title of the movie let's you know that the major action begins and ends in the Safe House. It makes you want to see more what Denzel can offer, as he is definitely on top of his game in this movie.",Safe House

His relationship with his partner is going smoothly unlike his career where he complains to his boss about passed over for promotion. Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) is a wanted man for selling secrets. Action, espionage thriller that is claustrophobic and fast paced. Subtly is nowhere to be seen. The action sequences get monotonous - punch, punch, bang, bang, repeat, repeat. Everyone performs well enough but it feels as though they are well inside their comfort zones. The performances are not memorable but the material they are working with is somewhat banal. The script is okay but the storyline lacks any real originality.

216,afh179,Clever action-packed thriller with a great turn from Reynolds,7,4 March 2012,"A new Denzel Washington movie is never a bad thing, especially when it's an action flick. Ryan Reynolds is always good too, but the role of Matt Weston is a different one for him. I'm used to the Van Wilder Ryan Reynolds, so I wasn't sure if his performance would fall flat or if he would be able to hold his own, especially opposite the great Washington. But hold his own he did and then some. He was perfect for the role of a low-level CIA agent tasked with looking after an international criminal named Tobin Frost (Washington) in a safe house. When the safe house is attacked, Weston escapes with Frost in tow and from there the film turns into an action packed thriller with multiple twists and turns. The film's first 30-40 minutes is slow, almost painfully so. There was more than one instance where I regretted paying to see it, and I considered leaving the theater at one point. But I stuck around and gave it a chance and I was glad I did. The first portion is needed to set the film up for the last hour and a half, which is loaded with gunfights, car chases, and plenty of surprises. The performances are great, especially from the two leads who work very well together. I like this type of roll for Reynolds, and I wouldn't mind seeing more rolls like this to come from him in the future. There's nothing new or groundbreaking about the movie, but that's to be expected. It delivers what it set out to deliver ; an entertaining and exciting popcorn-muncher with an exceptional plot and exceptional performances.Overall: 7/10",Safe House

The film is basically non-stop action, with a basic story/narrative around it 'Safe House' follows all typical action film conventions so don't expect anything amazing or unique, there's a not-so-predictable twist within as well. The film contains average acting from all, although I do think Denzel Washington was the best. The film also has good cinematography, using quick, short shots to keep the viewer engaged with the action.

Oh and Ryan Reynolds, who (whoda thunk it) guards a safe house for the CIA when a criminal (Denzel Washington) comes to visit, turning his life upside down.So little happens in the first five minutes, but then so much in the first ten. It catches you off guard somewhat. Reynolds' uncertain jitteriness alongside Washington' calm coolness is at times hilarious, yet so fun to watch. Although Washington is considered the experienced criminal, rookie Reynolds puts up a pretty good fight (well he is like twenty years younger, not that you'd know it).I think the makers of the film hoped by adding a football game half way through that it would turn it into the perfect guy film.

It's pretty much action packed right from the get go and though it presents few surprises in terms of how the plot evolves, at no point did I start thinking about remembering the milk on my way home.I must say Ryan Reynolds did a very good job in shifting from being the dorky female fantasy you'd be familiar with from his comedies to a more serious, take no BS action character. His role as the rookie is what you'd expect when you're playing against a legend like Denzel Washington, and his character's progression from newbie on a newbie assignment to someone who kicks a bit more ass is pretty much textbook as far as the genre goes. But still, I got the sense that seeing Ryan in similar characters in the future would not be totally wrong.Denzel's performance was good, but felt perhaps a bit like he didn't need to put in the effort. Like he was doing this while thinking about going fishing on the weekend.

Exposing one of the corrupt agents was obvious but I do think if there was a sequel it would have been better than this in terms of exposing the corruption and expanding on it. You could have the main character, Matt on the run as he has exposed the files and ""these corrupt individuals are tracking him"" and he goes to Paris to track his girlfriend and protect her due to her relationship with him. It would have been a nice sequel to explore, even a trilogy. I think this film was good enough to expand on further but with that being said, I enjoyed this film.",Safe House

This old police saying (with a twist) certainly fits in this movie's review.The movie starts promising but soon after that you realize that this movie will be nothing new. We've seen it all before. There are so many plot holes that makes you wonder if they writers gave any credit to the viewers intelligence when they wrote it. On top of that, the action sequences are nothing to brag about. Plus the shaky camera style doesn't help. There is also a pretty useless romantic subplot that doesn't add anything other than useless minutes to a movie that shouldn't have been more than 80 minutes.Ryan Reynolds has a pretty good performance, but Denzel Washington's action performances are really getting old and clichéd. Don't get me wrong, he was once a great reliable actor, and still is a great actor, but the amount of average action movies that he has been doing lately makes me wonder if he has some gambling debts to settle. The rest of the cast seems a bit out of place. With that said, not all is bad. If you are the action type you will probably be a bit entertained, just don't expect to be blown away.

233,TypedbyTara,"Not so ""Safe"" House",7,21 February 2012,"If you are like me, you were probably pretty pumped when you first saw the trailer to this movie. It featured intense action sequences, heavyweight actors (Reynolds&Washington) and one sick beat (provided by jay-z and kanye west). The movie did not disappoint.The movie followed a simple plot line that was easy enough to follow: Tobin Frost (Washington) is a former C.I.A agent who betrayed his country by selling important and top secret information. He is captured and ends up on the doorstep of Matt Weston (Reynolds) and young but capable agent who is eager to prove himself within the agency. The pair go on the run after a group of gunmen attack the original Safe House. Weston's new mission is now to maintain custody of Frost and move him to the next Safe House-a feat which proves to be easier said than done. Reynolds and Washington play their roles perfectly and in a very convincing manner. The movie had everything a good action flick should: Fiery Explosions, lots of shootings, and plenty of intense, martial arts hand-to-hand combat scenes. However, there was nothing overly special about this movie, it was simply a very solid production. Is it worth seeing in theaters? I would say yes, just because the acting is so superb, Frost is a total bad-a$$ and Washington's charm only adds a certain ""like-abilty"" to the character. However, if you do choose to wait until the movie comes out on DVD then your not going to be missing anything by not seeing it on the big screen.",Safe House

Denzel was the more skillful one, of course.

Allow me to diagram the plot for you: 01. A hit squad - hired by the CIA - knows where their rogue agent is and converges on him to kill him.02. Rogue agent escapes, only to turn himself in to US government.03. Bumbling CIA team tries to make him talk, only to be ambushed by original CIA team.04. Rogue CIA agent is saved by silly patriotic CIA agent.05. Bumbling CIA leaders argue.06. Silly patriotic CIA agent tries to turn in rogue agent only to be attacked by original CIA team.07. Rogue agent escapes and is later recaptured by silly agent.08. Silly agent is attacked by another CIA agent.09. Silly agent learns CIA is corrupt.10. Rogue agent dies and silly agent goes rogue.So, in other words, the CIA attacks the CIA to try to prevent the CIA from learning that the CIA has dirt of the CIA. Yeah, that makes sense!In addition to all this garbage, the CIA strike team kills a boatload of innocent civilians, does millions of dollars of property damage, gets two of their top people killed, and then just lets the guy with the damaging intel just walk away at the end. So what was the point of the whole movie?Also, if the CIA knew where rogue agent Denzel Washington was at the beginning of the movie, why didn't they just kill him up front and be done with it?Duh!The only saving grace this movie has is Denzel Washington who, as always, is a fine actor who conveys depth, empathy, and strong acting. Ryan Reynolds' acting, however, is pretty awful. Throughout the whole movie, he looks constipated and is entirely unbelievable.The sub-plot, if you want to call it that, with his girlfriend is completely pointless and adds nothing to the film.

241,speteman,An intense up-close and personal look at field operations in the CIA,8,19 February 2012,"(I am keeping this review a bit abstract because I find seeing movies with very little information removes having expectations.)As to the plot, it is not really that complex -- there is a basic objective for the main character, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, that he strives to achieve the entire movie. Along the way, he encounters some very old and recycled obstacles. Despite that, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Here's why:1. The story was told from a different angle than most other spy/intelligence thrillers. It uses safe houses as a primary backdrop which is interesting and fresh. The movie doesn't focus on catching spies, but rather what happens after they are caught.2. The acting was very intense, close, personal and extremely believable. I have never seen an spy movie played as emotionally, and as intensely as Reynolds and Washington do. Many movies tend to glamorize the agents in some way, either by giving them super-human abilities or foresight to avoid danger, but this movie plays it straight up. I feel this is exactly what it would like to be in their situation. Several of the fight scenes were gritty, brutal, and exhausting as men grapple for their lives. I was taken back to the mano-a-mano fight scene in Saving Private Ryan towards the end of the movie, or the locker room fight scene in A History of Violence with Viggo Mortensen.3. The scenes were shot usually very close up. There is no hiding from the cameras for the actors, and they do brilliantly. Even in car chase scenes, you feel as if you are in the moment.At the end, you get treated to a movie that is well-paced and emotionally taxing. You feel as if you experienced the journey with the characters. This is exactly what I want from a movie.As to criticisms, the recycling of predictable plot mechanisms like questionable motives of superiors at CIA headquarters, an attempt at suspense related to who the puppet master is, etc., are bearable because they only last for short periods during the movie while the main story unfolds.Denzel renews my respect for him as a very strong actor, able to play a very complex character, albeit in a very subdued way.

I didn't know if it was the case with 'Safe House', since, hey, it's Denzel Washington. That man doesn't just do any role.I just got back from the movie theater, and am I glad that I was wrong. The movie is fantastic, electrifying. Do know that I don't just 'get off' on any action flick. In most cases, I just watch and forget. This was actually, fantastic. I don't have a single bad word to say about it, the way it was directed, acted or anything else. Everything was simply fantastic.I realize my words sound absurd, and the score looks the same, but it really is worth it. I didn't see an action movie this well written, and this well acted in a really, really long time. Of course, by the end of the movie, any experienced watcher will figure out the ending by himself, but even though you 'get it', it's still extremely fun to sit through and see how the pieces connect.I really hate long reviews, so I'm trying to make this one as short and sweet as possible. Lastly, have in mind that not one cast member failed his role. Ryan was fantastic, even better then I could've imagined (a nice showing of his acting skills after Green Lantern and Change-Up), and Denzel, what to say that hasn't been already said about that man's acting.

He plays the same role in every movie and every movie he's in sucks.Also, I'm a fan of the whole shaky camera since it makes you believe you're right there in the action a movie provides to you but 'Safe House' uses it waaayyyy too much, even for scenes where it's just a bunch of people talking.

His ability to deliver on a range of emotions and captivate the audience with masterful artistry is second to none. It is this same powers that are called upon to salvage this movie. The lead actors being him and Ryan as Frost and Weston respectively are able to deliver a memorable performance , conveniently papering the cracks over a watershed storyline, cliché plot and atrocious camera work.The fight scenes are nicely intense with clever use of tight angled action shots and booming sound to make you feel as if you were in Cape Town itself. And really that is as good as it gets. For those looking for an overly complicated script riddled with sub-plots and nerve wrecking twists and turns, you will be disappointed.

When I saw it available on HBO MAX, I decided to give it a go. I wanted an action movie so why not. It's a lot better than an eh. It's the action sequences that raise it from that particular type of groan. Very well cut together and the pacing is tight once we get past the 20 minutes it took to see the story up. It needs more substance. It has a good central theme-juxtaposing the young naive rookie at the start of his path in life with a man who had once been on that same path but veered off it wildly some time ago-but they don't do enough with it, but they could have if they had gotten the two characters together earlier on and kept them together instead of separating them for a good chunk of the second act. Denzel's on the mark as usual but Ryan Reynolds is humorless, which works for the character, but not for Reynolds. He doesn't have a lot of versatility. He's naturally light and breezy. When he plays against type, it comes off as awkward, like something's missing. You're waiting for him to make a joke or make light of a situation and when the film ends and you realize he didn't so much as crack a smile. I don't know why I'm saying ""you."" These are my expectations of him. Probably unfair to him, but I doubt he gives a damn.

Denzel the most wanted CIA traitor is housed in his safe house. Whe the place is suddenly attacked in a gritty brutal action scene, Weston has to think on his feet, stay and fight or flee with CIA's most wanted.Denzel brings his usual sophistication to his role, he is well known for his low no-nonsense delivery of lines, believable with the right amount of grit. Reynolds is surprisingly good, he brings a face to the rookie CIA who has to learn the hard way trial by fire. It's almost metaphoric, Denzel being the seasoned veteran on CIA just as in life an ward winning talent working along side the newbie agent, newbie actor to action scene Reynolds. It has a refreshing scene showing the edgy shanties of Cape town you don't see in other films. It relies solely on the acting of Denzel and Reynolds and they equally carry their role. In the end it's about the betrayal, and framing of CIA where Denzel actually was good guy that the organization turned against and now on the run with damage provoking information It's up to Weston (Reynolds) to keep his integrity by blowing up the conspiracy. One of the most memorable lines---we'll take it from here--meaning you have been betrayed--cool. I enjoyed it, the action scenes are gritty and believable and keep you in the edge of your seats. I loved it I don't know what these other clowns are whining about, you try directing a movie, great action packed movies, great acting by the two leading actors, a lot of time depth is lacking in action movies, you actually feel for Denzel and Reynolds, go now and watch it!!!Reynolds should do more gritty roles and action, it actually suits him, stop with the comedy and Hollywoody movies like green lantern; good movie!!!!",Safe House

Denzel is a an actor of such prowess that in Safe House he delivers the traitor + wanted + spy + intrigue guy, right out of the same layers we have always been delivered. This spy guy is purely seasoned, mysterious, hard boiled yet humanly, normally responsive and fascinating. Denzel shows more changes in expressions, more dramatic 'unlike him' scenes even though you think he has done everything already; it's a new lane to us. He has so much acting ability! He brought reminders of other characters he has played as well as expressions that make you remember some other actor. He does it on purpose. He is an actors actor.This character, Frost,is a dangerous man with a 'specific skill set' and it is exciting as all get out. I have been trying to tone down my violence appetite but had to say this one was worth cheating with because of the acting and the story. And the casting. Can't say enough about the choices they made for supporting. Ryan Reynolds goes out of the romantic comedy idea I have for him - I hope he learned a lot working on this movie with Denzel. Ryan is so clean cut he can't help himself yet this role fit him so well. He stays on/with 'Frost' relentlessly. Very physical work and he is out there on his own and determined to catch his man. What will happen is anyone's guess. The two keep you caring about that, about what happens - you are so in the moment with them. Denzel has a river of talent underneath and a catalog to prove it.

Beggars belief. Is Hollywood really this ignorant to the real world? Do they not understand that there are other countries much older with culture and traditions that go back way beyond their comprehension? It's like they said we'll have a football match to add authenticity or diversity to this production. Then asked if anyone knew anything about it. Evidently not.OK, the movie was same old. America is great everyone else is stupid. We rule the world so there. I'm a little sick of it to be honest. I've lived in America and believe me it's not that great. They live in wooden houses, don't have affordable health or education systems in place. Don't understand the concept of chip and pin. Spend Billions on invading oil rich countries but can't control their own borders. Makes me wonder how many terrorists have sneaked over the border with the latins. Where's the CIA then? Surely to have an intelligence agency you have to have to some intelligence? Or maybe they can't see the wood for the trees? The movie was full of this kind of action. The shooters can hit a target from God knows where and God knows how far away when it's a small (non American) character but can't hit a barn door from 5 feet away when it's the American heroes who are the targets.Just for once I would like to see the American movie makers be humble or eat humble pie like their nation has had to do on many occasions in real life.

Safe House sticks to the tried and true plot structure of this sort of movie, complete with that ""wait, who's the bad guy?"" twist and a super secret file that someone is killing to get their hands on, but it's engaging and both Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds are perfect in their roles. Very believable and you'll feel loyalty for them both. Oh and there's a romantic side story but it's almost, if not completely, irrelevant. I believe it's just supposed to give Reynolds' character some depth. You know, so we care about him.Anyway, gun fights aplenty and fantastic car chase (and crash) scenes will distract the audience from a few nonsensical plot holes. And just when I thought there was a lull in the excitement, about an hour fifteen in, crazed gunmen burst into the scene and startled me out of my lazy blinks and wandering mind right back into the action.

(Spoilers),10,4 August 2013,"*Contains Spoilers*A great Hollywood entry for Swedish director Daniel Espinosa, after his big hit Snabba cash. I must say I didn't expect much of this movie, but boy was I surprised. It was a gripping and dynamic action thriller, that wasn't a swing and a miss like many of the Hollywood action titles, that came out in 2012. Denzel was perfect like always and his part fitted him great, but the actor who really surprised me in this one was Ryan Reynolds. He absolutely gave everything in this movie.. acting wise and action wise. His character had so many transformations throughout the film, that they made my head spin more than those brilliant action sequences made by Espinosa and his crew. Another cool part were Liam Cunningham, Robert Patrick and Joel Kinnaman's(the next Robocop) cameos, which were placed perfectly and did helped with the slick transitions in the story. Gleeson was cool as always.Maybe, the only thing that I disliked in the movie was Vera Farmiga's part. Yeah, I must admit her death was important to the story as a whole, but as an individual character, her role was very unimportant and I think that they had to give the part to an less famous actress. That's my opinion. I must say, this movie is very underrated and I do recommend it to every fan of the action thriller spy genre, because I guarantee that it won't disappoint your expectations.

263,peoplecart,"Safe House, more Propaganda?",5,28 May 2012,"The 2012 Safe House movie, directed by Daniel Espinosa and featuring Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, seems to be just another exercise in state propaganda.It's been established that the Pentagon helps movie production that positively portrait it in return for access to locations (Langley, US Consulate) and military props/personnel (google Operation Hollywood) Although Safe House does have a lot of dirty CIA agents, the overall message is not one of condemnation.So first, let's start with the clichés.Cliché 1: Homicidal Arab Vargas the leader of the bad guys throughout most of the plot looks like an Arab - just in case the stereotypemurderous Arab routine wasn't drilled hard enough into our skulls. Turns Vargas is played by Fares Fares a Swedish film actor, born in Beirut, Lebanon, of Assyrian/Syriac origin. Sure there are other bad guys in the movie, but the one people will come away with is the Arab one.Cliché 2: Waterboarding The script writers didn't mess around with the CIA interrogation, they went straight for waterboarding Denzel. It seemed so expected to us that it's nearly routine. The message is clear: mess with the US gov and you'll get waterboarded.Cliché 3: The Patriot In the end, Ryan decides to do the right thing and send the compromising documents on dirty CIA/MI6 agents to the main stream media. This is completely unrealistic. Agents with the CIA sign documents that they will let Langley vet everything they write publicly about the CIA. There is no way Ryan would release these documents (from his own cell phone WITHIN the Pentagon offices) as he would face life in prison.The US gov has shown repeatedly that it is not friendly to whisleblowers. Ask Robert Manning or any other poor sod who decided to go that route. It's suicide - and not just professionally. The Obama administration is even worse then the Bush on whisleblowers.Also, it appears Ryan is still working with the CIA after this. Wasn't this experience enough to prompt him to quit? Didn't he shoot an innocent cop? Isn't he unsettled that both MI6/CIA agents could turn at any point and that the Mossad is busy building blackmailing files on everyone? Can he not see the problem is systemic to spying agencies in general? I guess not...Cliché 4: Whisleblower-friendly Main Stream Media In the end, Ryan decides to do the right thing and send the secret documents to the media. The movie shows how all the mean TV channel over the world blast reports about it, that everyone involved is arrested and the world is all the better.Are you kidding me??! The media would not touch this. They would clear it first with their government handlers before disseminating anything. It would all be denied or maybe a few scapegoats would be slaughtered to appease the masses.The main stream media (MSM) is sitting on plenty of stories, such as Oklahoma city, 9/11 or the US gov handlers allowing the underwear bomber onto the plane in the Dutch airport. They never mention these stories even though the evidence is overwhelming. If they have to talk about an undesirable story, they often resort to ridicule or minimization.The MSM is also restricted as to what they can talk about. In the UK, they have D notices issued by the gov which squashes any mention of certain stories. In the US and other countries, it is exactly the same. The MSM would never publish a story not pre-approved as they wouldn't want to bite the hand that feeds them - after all most of the news comes from the govs. Want to be invited to the Whitehouse press conference after publishing forbidden documents? Ain't' gonna happen. It would be suicide for a newspaper/TV-station to do this.Random Thoughts One thing that struck me was how the CIA agents seem to travel in style: private jets, Range Rovers etc... They have manned safe houses all over the place. How much does all this murderous immoral nonsense cost the tax slaves? Oh and why did they have this eye-candy French chick? She brought nothing to the plot.Still, there's some decent fights/chases but it's hard to appreciate when you know most tax cows watching this won't see the propaganda behind it...",Safe House

The action is non-stop and certainly intense throughout. The fight choreography is also extremely well done, while they don't adopt the ""Bourne"" method of just shaking the camera rapidly throughout the scene to give the impression of quicker and more complex fighting moves. The fight scenes with Ryan Reynolds, in particular, are shot in a way that show each individual move, which was incredible to watch.As for the acting, Denzel needs no description and was absolutely ideal for the role. I knew exactly what kind of stellar performance I was going to see immediately upon his first line with the MI6 agent. Ryan Reynolds was the surprise here, as I had little to no respect for his acting ability prior to this role. His casting as the protagonist actually slightly deterred my interest in seeing the movie initially. I've now been on the Reynolds bandwagon since viewing Safe House due to how well he portrayed this character.

270,Mooviepedia,"""Excellent action scenes help overcome a weak script and make for an enjoyable spy thriller.""",7,16 February 2012,"www.mooviepedia.comSafe House is sure to please those seeking an entertaining action film in the vein of the Bourne series. It is solidly crafted, with a fast pace, expertly staged action sequences, and compelling performances from Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds in the lead roles. What it lacks, however, is anything to distinguish itself from the seemingly dozens of other recent entries in the spy genre, and more discerning action fans will likely find the film to be a bit of an empty experience once the spectacle has worn off.The plot centers on rogue CIA operative Tobin Frost (Washington), who has spent the last decade selling US intelligence secrets to the highest bidder. When he is finally captured in Cape Town, South Africa, he is transported to a quiet safe house run by inexperienced agent Matt Weston (Reynolds). Before Frost can be fully debriefed and interrogated, the safe house is overrun by heavily armed thugs intent on capturing Frost and killing anyone who gets in their way. What follows is essentially a ninety-minute game of cat and mouse, as Weston tries to get Frost to another safe house before their pursuers catch up to them. The premise is far from original, but such an obstacle hasn't stopped other recent films from finding a fresh way to tackle the material (last year's thematically and stylistically shrewd Hanna comes to mind). However, screenwriter David Guggenheim seems content with Safe House's bland setup, and rather than infuse the script with depth or even genuinely surprising plot turns, he uses the story beats as excuses to set up the next big action scene.Of course, many greatly enjoyable action films have taken a similar approach, but they usually don't pretend to be much more than showcases for gunfights and car chases. Guggenheim, on the other hand, seems to be reaching for something a little deeper, even though he fails to find it. Tobin Frost is a character designed to encapsulate Guggenheim's criticisms of the CIA's shadowy practices. This much is evidenced during several monologues (which, to his credit, Washington delivers well) in which Frost slowly reveals to Weston why he betrayed his country. His motivations essentially boil down to the fact that the CIA lies to its operatives and isn't above killing to protect the reputations of its highest-ranking officials. These ideas have been explored so much more astutely in countless other movies and TV shows that Safe House seems imbecilic by comparison. The arguments Guggenheim presents are overly broad and not given enough attention, so Frost's speeches end up becoming mere filler in between action scenes.Although Safe House fails as a critique of modern American espionage practices, it still wholly succeeds as an action movie. In his first Hollywood film, Daniel Espinosa admirably creates loud, intense action sequences that have a palpable sense of immediacy. The shooting style he adopts most emulates that of Paul Greengrass, with the combination of urban shootouts and hand-to-hand combat playing out like blend of Greengrass's Bourne films and his Iraq War thriller Green Zone. Whether it is the white-knuckle close quarters gun battle in the initial safe house attack or a foot chase through a shantytown, Espinosa keeps his camera moving but also allows the action to remain discernible. Those who hate the recent shaky camera trend in action movies (myself included) will find it put to surprisingly effective use here.Despite the glaring script problems, Safe House is still a solid action/spy thriller. I suspect that most audiences won't even notice the thematic issues and will like the movie a lot more than I did. The action scenes have a ""wow"" factor that is guaranteed to win over action fans, and Washington and Reynolds overcome the script's shortcomings enough to sell both the action and drama in near-equal measure. I certainly recommend the movie for its entertainment value, albeit with the caveat that it provides nothing below the surface; the visceral action makes for a two-hour thrill ride, but once the excitement fades from memory, so does the movie itself.3.5 out of 5",Safe House

Denzel Washington is a massive asset to the big screen, whether he is playing a high school basketball coach, a crooked cop or a drunken body guard he plays it so well his performances are believed by all.This movie focuses around a Safehouse a place for holding criminals of the CIA before they are prosecuted or put on trial or transported to where they need to go. With Denzel being portrayed in the initial part of the movie as the bad guy he plays this role to a tee, you never quite know what to expect. As the movie unfolds it becomes one of the mentor and mentee approach with Ryan being the new rookie looking after the Safehouse and Denzel developing from prisoner to mentor as their relationship forms even more mystery unfolds as to who are really the good and bad guys.This movie was excellent for me on all facets and ends well being wrapped up nicely which is always the most challenging in movies like this.

The main message of the story is determination and taking charge of situations. It also plays with the force of authority, which sometimes may result flawed. The characters are bland, except for the protagonists. Denzel and Ryan play their roles in an effective way, but the crossover of Gleeson and Farmiga are not necessary, not at least on a extent. It also seemed as if the director was rushed in the filming process, taking off all the suspense and sense of the movie. Some scenes, such as when Tobin and Matt talk several times, are completely dull, since the action taking place on the conversations is unnecessary. The positive things about the movie are the action scenes, which are delivered with such a powerful touch. The whole scene of the safe-house attack was impressive. I want to mention Robert Patrick, whose character is in a small but important portion of the movie. He chews the scenery, for real. He basically applies the ""I'll take it from here"" to Reynolds' character. And as of his involvement in the defense of the safe-house breach, it was superb.

276,or243,"Mindful of Action, Mindless of Everything Else",6,26 February 2012,"BOOM, BANG-BANG, POP-POP-POP, BOOM! &c. As such, for a flabby 117 minutes, Safe House proceeds, leaving one's ears ringing but eyes fixated.A self-indulgent and proud-of-it action bonanza, Safe House's grainy cinematography depicts CIA rookie Matt Weston's (Ryan Reynolds) desperate struggle to survive, as he attempts to transport the most- wanted Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) from an ambushed Safe House to a, well, safe Safe House. Considering the appraisable coherency of my plot description, it's a shame that the film makes no such effort in clarifying the tortured narrative: we are simply left to deduce, from the familiarity of its iconography (complete with gun-toting Arab mercenaries and corrupt American bureaucracy), what's going on. But why concern yourself with what's going on, when, really, you're there (as I was) for the explosions, thrills, and the unimpeachable Denzel Washington. Any man named 'Denzel Washington' is bound to be cool, but the actor's effortlessly suave and engagingly modest portrayal of the ex-CIA-man (turned traitor) Frost is helplessly cool. Combined with that typical underlying pathos and affability, Washington's reprisal of the anti-hero (as opposed to sheer villainous) character is welcomed. (He can add it to the list including Training Day (2001) and American Gangster (2007), albeit, in terms of quality, beneath these.) Swedish director Daniel Espinosa has torn pages – quite loudly – from Tony Scott's book, who, in turn, is Washington's usual go-to director for action. Sub-Scott, regardless, Espinosa relentlessly pumps the gauge of (entertaining and well-orchestrated) action, complete with car chases and crashes, infinite ammunition, intense close-quarters combat, and thunderous sound-mixing (my ears really did ring!). I yawned at the prototypical political coda disturbing the general mindlessness of the story. National Security is a disgrace, I know. The CIA is a hotbed of corruption, we get it. (But think, if it wasn't, you'd eliminate an entire generic motif!) The only glimpses of integrity offered by the narrative are those nuanced psychological instances of irony, as when Reynolds's rookie forces himself to torture an aggressor for information, having previously condemned the water-boarding of Frost. But they're scattergun in approach, and not as interesting as guns. I should (re)mention the cinematography, and commend the brave decision to purposefully dull and degrade the image, removing the gloss, and echoing (with deep nostalgia) those long-gone action extravaganzas of the late-80s and 90s. However, the film craves very little comedic relief (even Reynolds' tones himself down to become near-tolerable!) and stays away from awkward one-liners. Not much is said, in fact, as it flicks back-and-forth from Washington-and-Reynolds and the CIA headquarters, itching for the next startling explosion of action. This much can be said for Safe House: it'll keep you crunching the popcorn as it crunches through skulls, without even making you hesitate to consider how dissatisfying popcorn (or skull-crunching, for that matter) actually is. And so, I'm resolved to reward Safe House six stars: one for the choreography of the action, one for the anchoring performances, and one for its marvellously indulgent dedication to an increasingly gadgetised genre. But, left wanting narrative and stylistic fulfilment, I must keep them other four stars in my pocket.",Safe House
277,Someone_Who_Knows,Pure Adrenaline,10,11 February 2012,"Denzel Washington is at the top of his game here. The scenes seemed real and believable, and Denzel looks like he really was a CIA agent named Tobin Frost.The fight scenes could have been choreographed with more detail, allowing for the camera shots to be filmed better, but even with this setback, the chase and fight scenes were adrenaline filled and well worth experiencing.I do think that the movie should have ended differently. The movie perpetuated the idea that, ""no good deed shall go unpunished"".For some reason, this movie feels like it may have been based on or inspired by real events, but maybe they couldn't say that because it would be a breach in national security.To sum it all up, Safe House is a much entertaining, pure adrenaline, action/thriller movie that is well worth going to see.",Safe House

Ryan, playing a seemingly an honest and determined Host, of a Safe house, and Denzel a devious mastermind out to destroy the lives, of the corrupt. It's only in the last few minutes of the movie that you realize what is actually going on, and this could have been great if the movie had some real suspense to it. Even a twist would have spiced things up. Like if Ryan turned out to be the bad guy.If this was a thriller, then Hannibal was a love story.

However, he played his role very well and I would like to see him more movies like Safe House. I did not have any high expectations before going to the theater but I left very satisfied. This is not a movie that will win any awards or get a lot of recognition for great performances, but if you want to be constantly entertained and see a lot of action, you will definitely enjoy it. It reminded me of a cross between Die Hard and The Departed, however The Departed was a more in depth film encompassing a better overall cast and storyline.

It's sort of a benchmark for me in spy-thrillers. When I saw the trailer of Safe House, I was impressed and was so tempted that I downloaded it in 15 minutes and was watching it by the 20th minute. The film started rather slowly but that was fine, most films do. there were, however, some points in the middle and the second half of the film where I literally yawned. Being a Bourne film, I really loved the action sequences, they were fast, logical and impact leaving ones. The story, however, I won't say straight but rather conventional, we have seen the similar thing in spy-thrillers, tinker tailor soldier spy being the last such film I saw. Acting was awesome, at least on the part of Denzel Washington. Story could have been more compact, thrilling and could have a good ending..

Basically this is your 13 in a dozen movie. I'll explain why: Movies like this have no real message, nothing to express or to make clear. Their main purpose is to entertain. Every element in this movie is building upon this idea: Easy to recognize 'bad guys' consisting of stereotype eastern Europe folks, African militia wielding 'bad guy' weapons such as AK-47's, and doing all sorts of 'bad guy' stuff.Some sort of character development, rookie becomes master..No plot of real interest. Did we really care about the list of corrupt agency agents? Only served as excuse for the 'action' going on.Typical 'hot' girl of the main character. She had no purpose story wise, but like noted before, the movie is to entertain.Anchor actors, we recognize people like D. Washington and associate 'good movies' with them. This movie, like many others, tries to exploit that.Effects to make the fighting look like 'extra heavy'. Some movies resort to over the top CGI, this movie liked to shake the camera instead on every fighting scene.And many more.So in conclusion, the movie is not 'bad', its just that it has been done a million times before, and when you are sensitive for noticing these 'details' mentioned above the movie won't appeal to you.5/10",Safe House

Phased by the presence of a notorious criminal, Weston becomes nervous and confused.

This sends Weston to a dizzying panic and eventually escapes along with Frost.""Safe House"" is a exhilarating action thriller with explosive stunts and sequences. The team behind the film stages multiple exciting scenes that involve beat down rooftops in the rural areas as well as heart-stopping car chases along the streets. Frost is an intelligent man. Being a former intelligence, who's gone rogue, he knows the rules and procedures. Most of the time, he's fascinated by watching Weston carry out his duties. Weston is continuously conflicted, looking for ways to hide Frost. Yet, Frost never makes it easy for him, as he tries to escape as well. Weston communicates with one of his supervisors, David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson), to determine their next move. But, the gunmen are determined to kill Frost, forcing Weston to take matters into his own hands.Denzel Washington is an actor full of intensity. He can sit there and watch Reynolds do his thing and still convey the deepest of his character's emotions. He gives Frost both a terrifying presence and a sympathetic feel. Ryan Reynolds, on the other hand, manages to stand along Washington and give the same intensity. His wits and charisma works perfectly for his distressed rookie persona. The film succeeds best because of this tandem, allowing the actors to build a good enough relationship to carry out the entire film.""Safe House"" is a great action thriller with non-stop action. This is the first mainstream feature for Daniel Espinosa and he comes forth as promising due to his skillful camera work with the action scenes. One of the most impressive is the rooftop chase at night. The editing is pitch perfect as it allows the audience to feel the danger of the situation from each point of view.

In fact, most of the rest of the movie his him fighting for his life to get to the NEXT safe house. But I won't ruin any more of the plot—it's actually pretty good.This was the standard CIA/MI6 anti-James-Bondey kind of movie that stars a spy who knows too much about about his own organization and wants to take it down. There's no frills, and we know what is going to happen, but we watch anyway because it's exciting, and gripping. The movie is very well shot, and looks good. There is a lot of film grain in the dark rooms but I actually don't mind—I guess because I think it looks pretty.

Unfortunately, there were only glimpses of the Denzel attitude and flair that we've come to love. There were some though, and we had a good laugh at his nonchalant humor in the face of life-threatening danger. Denzel was more of an anchor and a side kick to Ryan Reynolds, who didn't exactly steal the show as much as not let the show flop through an admirable display of fight and car chase scenes.I try to avoid watching trailers of movies I want to see because I don't like having the action spoiled. For movies like G.I.

One of my more disappointed moments though was how easily the safe house was overrun. ***Minor Spoiler Over*** This movie reminded me of The Bourne Identity, combining chase scenes, extended hand-to-hand combat and a conspiratorial theme. I was impresses with these aspects of the movie, so that similarity was a plus. There were long, conjoined fight scenes that made me cringe in my seat from how bad these guys were getting beat up. As long as you understand Denzel is not the main character and therefore expect him to play a big role, then you'll likely walk away satisfied from the action and twists of plot. The South African setting was a nice touch (crowded soccer stadium, shanty town), though not fully utilized as most of the fighting was indoors.

That promising actor really took it to a whole new level this time. The rest of the cast consisted of great and amazing actors such as Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard, Vera Farmiga, and Robert Patrick, but their roles literally and merely reflected STOPGAPS. No conflicts, no turning points, nothing that justified their motivations. The movie is too predictable, especially with all these thugs chasing our characters and running around. I you saw the Bourne films, you'll feel that Daniel Espinosa tried, and tried, and tried again in an awful way to copy-paste that movie beautifully done Paul Greengrass. Overusing the shaky-cam technique, the director dizzied us the whole movie with car chases, obscure fighting scenes, exacerbated with deafening shootouts. Furthermore, you'll notice that you will have to force yourself to focus on the characters mouths to understand what they are saying. The script focuses on an action-thriller-Hollywood movie lacking substance. We could tell that the screenwriter is young in his ink where the story should not dictate the character's motivations, but it's him that should define the story motivated by his quest. While watching the movie, ask yourself what is the quest of Denzel? What is the quest of Vera Farminga? What is the quest of Brendan Gleeson? Where are the conflicts, obstacles? This movie seriously lacks of respectable dialogues, cinematography, and editing. It's not about the legendary Tobin Frost, but about the legendary Denzel. Don't waste your money.

His part is very well written and interesting allowing Washington to really show of his acting skill. The film is based on an idea that i have seen done before which is the safe houses. The scene's in the safe houses are very good but the best scene is the chase through the slum houses. The film surprised me with it's twist's and also a great ending.

The surprising one to me was Ryan Reynolds, he was really really good, and expected him to be the good natured great looking pal he plays in most movies, but instead he really showed some real depth and feeling to his character.You could almost see the character is his eyes, frustrated, under- utilized, but potential is there, and just needs a scenario to bring him out. Did like the way the building of the two main characters happened, Sam Shephard was also great but wish his role was a little more significant.

As good as the director was regarding the close up scenes and the emotion that Ryan and Denzil portrayed, the bond between them was still tentative even at the end.

331,moviegoer347,Not a Typical Action Movie,7,16 November 2012,"Filled with unexpected events, Safe House is an amazing movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The main actors, Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, the outstanding set, the theme and the intricately woven plot all add to this suspense-filled movie. While some elements of the movie are somewhat outrageous and extremely unrealistic, Safe House is successful in its purpose to entertain the audience because the character development is dominant over the special effects and overrides all of the fancy stunts.Both of the main characters, Washington and Reynolds were both brilliant in their roles and definitely made this movie. If it were not for these two actors, the movie would not be half of what it turned out to be. Washington plays an ex CIA agent, Tobin Frost, who went against the CIA and tried to sell top-secret information of the CIA. Reynolds plays a new CIA agent, Matt Weston, who is working at a safe house in South Africa and trying to climb the ladder of the CIA. This is a different type of role for Reynolds as he plays a very serious role rather than staring in a comedy. The entire movie revolves around Reynolds trying to catch up with Washington after he escapes from the safe house when it is attacked. The acting by both of them is spectacular as they both reveal realistic facial expressions and dive into their character's personality.While the relationship between the two main characters is the main point to this movie, the director's eye for the set and the details of the movie top it all off. The set and the location of the movie, South Africa, make the movie seem more realistic rather than if it was filmed somewhere else. The grey, dismal effects of the camera and the different effects of the editing add to the suspense of the movie. The movie was shot intentionally in dark areas which made the movie more dramatic and suspenseful. Additionally, although not as effective as the dark colors of the scenes, throughout the fighting and combat of the movie there is intense, fast music playing which adds to the drama of the plot. The worn out location of the safe house makes the movie more realistic and makes it seem as if you are actually there.Although most of this movie is centered around fighting and intense action scenes, the best part of the movie is the developing relationship between Tobin Frost and Matt Weston. At the beginning of the movie, neither Tobin nor Matt trusted one another as they both thought that they were both going to go behind each other's backs. At one point in the movie when Tobin escapes from Matt's watch, Matt goes behind the CIA's orders to not go after him and let them handle it. When Matt finds and helps Tobin escape from trouble, their relationship changes as they both realize that they are on the same team. Along the way, Tobin teaches Matt different things about being a CIA agent and ultimately helps Matt in his career. This theme of trust and who to trust continues throughout the movie, as this theme is the central point in this movie.Although I would not recommend this movie for a younger audience because of the various violent scenes, I would definitely recommend it to an older audience because it is filled with suspense and has many unexpected surprises. You will not regret watching this movie.",Safe House

Action continues in this movie with the car chases, and escaping from the rooftops. There are some references to other Denzel Washington movie such as Training Day, and American Gangster where Denzel Washington shows the same confident, strong, and manipulative character.

However, do not proceed expecting to see a Bourne movie, because this is not a Bourne movie. Personally, I love the Bourne movies, particularly Identity and despite the similar scenes of hand-to-hand combat we see here, Matt Weston (Reynolds) is not a professional assassin. Having said all that-please do watch this, because despite everything said heretoforth, this is almost as good as Bourne Identity. There are obvious flaws at the outset which even the most naive and inexperienced of movie fans will notice. Fiirstly, the whole 'not telling the girl you're madly in love with that you work for the CIA' cliché. Even though your CIA job entails house-sitting, literally! Secondly, the '""give me a chance to prove myself"" cliché whereby said person almost immediately gets a chance to prove themselves? And thirdly...so he escapes with Tobin Frost (Washington) but, realistically, he isn't going to shoot Frost so why doesn't Frost just walk off. OK! Moaning done. Now for the positives. Reynolds is terrific as the lead, a man you really believe in and cheer on. The action sequences while not spectacular are great and there are plenty of them. Shoot outs, fist fights, car chases and rooftop running. Denzel Washington is of course great as Frost, as is Gleeson as Barlow though you do feel they could both have played these parts with their eyes closed and hands tied behind their backs. That isn't a criticism of them, just a reminder that at the end of the day this is just a very good action movie. And does a superb actor like Denzel need to keep making these 'good' films? What I really do love though, and is a highlight of the movie, is the chemistry that builds between Weston and Frost as the movie pushes forward. Never is this more noticeable than when Weston saves him in Langa. Way before the end looms into sight, you've worked out who the bad guys are and probably what's going to happen but it's still thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying. The end scene between Weston and Frost is again noteworthy and the intelligent handling of the 'incriminating file' storyline (again, Bourne-like) is wonderful and intriguing. Please do watch and let me know if you think Weston does the right thing considering the possible consequences. After all, he is no Jason Bourne!7/10P.S.

336,jakkanadar,"Not the greatest movie, but excellent!",8,1 December 2015,"I have read the comments here and was shocked, and not so shocked at some of the negative reviews. The movie is well written, dialogue and character development is superb. Not to mention, while albeit somewhat predictable, the plot progression is perfectly paced. Tobin Frost, played by Washington, was slightly disappointing in that he does not get into the heads of others nearly as well as his reputation would have suggested. The depth of his character only comes into play after a majority of the movie is completed, but the depth is extreme to those that have the mental capacity to understand it in it's stoicism. He needs a little work on his action sequences in this film, nowhere near up to par with previous performances this phenomenal actor has portrayed. Matt Weston, brought to life by Ryan Reynolds, green and ambitious agent that he is brings a dynamic that would be hard to replicate. His side-plot with the girlfriend was woefully lacking but it did not detract from the movie. The surprise was how well he enacted the hand to hand combat sequences, I am a trained martial artists of over 14 years in direct instruction and, I could only take a couple exchanges apart and find major flaws. Now to touch on the pseudo-buddy cop dynamic between these two, it is quickly established and honorably brought into the light. Without going into my past, I can say that I have had similar, albeit under very different circumstances, friendships of necessity that came into existence in very nostalgic to myself ways. The dialogue between these two is not award winning, but is completely believable and realistic. While the plot points have been done before, this movie still does them well. It did not bring anything new to the genre but it exemplified it with great care and nearly flawless execution. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants an endearing and entertaining ride. I know a couple guys that have worked on the covert side of the military, each of them said these two reminded them of one CIA guy or another they met throughout their careers which to me is high praise for this type of movie.",Safe House

340,vinnysboy,"""Safe House"" versus ""Easy Money""??",1,15 July 2012,"How can the same director be responsible for both these films? ""Safe House"" seemed to be shot by a cinematographer with both Parkinson's disease and ADD. The script was implausible and generic, with no value whatsoever, like a meal at Mc Donald's. Unfortunately, the average movie patron in the U.S. would prefer a Big Mac over something more tasty and substantial. ""Easy Money"" on the other hand was brilliant on every level, with a real story, real actors, and confident direction. The international cast was pitch perfect and I look forward to buying the DVD for my library. It's a shame, but even Denzel Washington's detailed character work could not save ""Safe House"". Put him together with the amazing Joel Kinnaman sometime and you might have something!",Safe House

It keeps you interested for the entire runtime, the writing is very good and the casting is top notch. It is a definite recommendation.",Safe House
