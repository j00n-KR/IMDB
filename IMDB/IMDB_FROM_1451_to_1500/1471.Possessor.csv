0,SnoopyStyle,interesting Cronenberg,7,22 August 2021,"Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) is the Possessor. She's a corporate assassin who uses a brain implant to take over other people to do the killing. Her boss is Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Her next take-over target is Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) who is dating Ava Parse (Tuppence Middleton), the daughter of tech tycoon John Parse (Sean Bean).This is a Brandon Cronenberg film. It has his father penchant for blood. It's a fine sci-fi flick with a dash of style. The filming does need something more. I can't quite put my finger on it. It has style but it needs more. It has moments of intensity but it needs more. It has ideas about control and self-identity. I'm not completely bought into the character Tasya. I don't know who she is and quite frankly, she may not know herself. That would have been an interesting idea if it's clearer about being murky. All in all, this is more interesting than not. There are enough in here worthy of the Cronenberg name.",Possessor
1,nogodnomasters,I'm just fine,7,5 January 2021,"Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough ) is a paid assassin. The company that she works for gets top dollar for their high profile kills. Tasya enters and controls the body of another person, someone close and unsuspecting to the target. Once completed, Tasya kills herself and enters back into her own body. Except she has trouble pulling the trigger and needs help, like suicide by cops. There are issues with re-connecting as Tasya loses a piece of herself and is out of sorts for a spell. After she did one job, she quickly turns around and does another one, never admitting how hollow she feels. Her job is to enter Colin (Christopher Abbott ) the drug using boyfriend of Ava Parse (Tuppence Middleton ) daughter of billionaire CEO John Parse (Sean Bean) who is not a nice guy either. The client is the son who will inherit the fortune if his father and sister are both dead.Of course the ending has issues. It is a good concept that has been done in similar ways. Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott did a good job of people who are not always all there mentally.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Tuppence Middleton + others)",Possessor
2,kosmasp,This body of mine,9,29 September 2020,"The title is a bit of a give away I reckon, still I had no idea what I was about to watch, because I had not read anything about the movie. I only knew that some very fine people were involved behind the camera and obviously after seeing it also in front of the camera. Spiritually speaking there may be some things people may want to know or ask - either themselves or the movie itself.There are some things that might be tough to comprehend, but the movie is still easy to follow. Even if I reckon you can have your own thoughts about what the movie is ultimately saying - or what exactly the ending means. Is it good or bad ... and what is that even to begin with? And also what a fun thing to see the word uncut next to it's title on imdb ... having seen this at a festival, I know for sure it was. Hopefully you get the chance to watch it like that too (even if it is at home) - because there are quite some disturbing scenes in it. A few involving violence and blood too (there's also some nudity and some strange ... intercourse ... well then again, some may call it fun, who am I to say how you'll perceive it?) ... not for the faint hearted for sure, but the name Cronenberg should be a hint at that",Possessor
3,BandSAboutMovies,I wanted to like it,4,6 November 2020,"The same thing always happens. A movie gets hyped, I buy in and get excited, then watch it and am mildly interested in it and wonder what all the fervor was all about. It happened all over again with Possessor (or Possessor Uncut), which is not the alternate title to Horror Express (©Bill Van Ryn for that joke) and it's not one of the movies within a movie within Popcorn.The film starts interesting enough, as we watch a woman (Gabrielle Graham) insert a needle inside her head and attach it to a machine. She then goes to work at a party where she repeatedly stabs a man, then nearly turns a gun on herself before the police shot her. It turns out that she's controlled by a possessor named Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough), which means that she can directly implant her mind into someone else and use them to kill people.As her boss (Jennifer Jason Leigh, always a welcome actress) talks her through the end of the assignment, Tasya must identify objects from her past to prove that she is still herself. That's another lie, as she can barely speak like a normal human being when she meets her ex-husband (Rossif Sutherland) and son.But there's no time to consider that. There's another job, as they have been hired to kill the owner of a data mining company, which excites everyone because they'll be able to control the company by blackmailing the man who hired them. They use the owner's daughter Ava's boyfriend Colin (Christopher Abbott) for the hit, but for the first time, the company doesn't have all of the answers. And even after he completes half the job, killing his girlfriend - yet only wounding her father - he takes back over and causes Tasya to vomit blood.Can Tasya complete her assignment and get her mark to kill himself so she can be released? Or is this her final possession? And how does her son get involved?The main reason most have discussed this film is because it was written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of, well, you know. This definitely has style, the colors and camera angles are gorgeous but there's an icy edge that ill serves the movie to me. It's as if we are as much on the outside looking in as the titular possessor. I wanted to feel more, to get really excited about it and to find a new favorite, but it was just good.And I learned, yet again, that hype can really sell a movie, but once it's playing in front of your eyes, it's your call whether or not you really enjoy it. But hey - your experience may vary and you might completely adore this. Also, knowing me, once Brandon Cronenberg's second movie is hated by everyone else - see this same story played out in Under the Silver Lake and Southland Tales - I'll fall in love with one of his movies.That said - it has a psychic possession threeway, so there's that. And oh yeah - of course he points to Argento as an influence, which makes sense, as this film is awash in dream imagery and primary colors. There's also female as male as female - or whatever the possessor is - full frontal nudity, if you're looking to get your mind blown.There are some great ideas and images here, so I'll definitely keep an eye on what comes next.",Possessor

5,george.schmidt,Overrated,7,6 January 2021,"POSSESSOR (2020) ** Andrea Riseborough, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Christopher Abbott, Tuppence Middleton, Sean Bean, Ayesha Mansur Gonsalves, Raoul Bhaneja. Filmmaker Brandon Cronenberg proves the apple doesn't fall from the tree (his dad is iconic director David) with this ambitious but muddled sci-fi terror flick about an assassin (Riseborough) employed by a secret agency infiltrating the mind of potential victims assigned to kill with albeit trippy visuals the sum of its parts is at best provoking yet somewhat uninspired and frankly dull. While there's enough visceral graphic violence to satiate the typical gorehound the movie itself is listless and its leads do not resonate sympathy or empathy whatsoever.",Possessor
6,evanston_dad,Just Terrible,2,21 January 2021,"A fellow film reviewer described this film as ""droning,"" and that word perfectly captured how I felt watching it. And not just this film -- it applies to a whole genre of (usually) horror and/or sci-fi films that pick dreariness as their primary aesthetic. Recently, films like ""Mandy,"" ""Color Out of Space,"" and ""Relic"" are good examples, just to name a quick few.""Possessor"" actually has a good premise, but it moves at a funereal pace, the tone is relentlessly one note, and everything is set to a droning (there's that word again), atonal, synth score that's probably meant to make everything happening on screen feel more portentous but instead makes it all feel ponderous. This is also a nasty movie, full of gratuitously graphic violence happening to flat, vaguely unpleasant characters who aren't given any inner lives by the screenplay. These people could be anybody, and they feel like creations made for the express purpose of having bad things done to them. There's a great premise at the heart of this film, but no actual ideas springing from that premise. It's an exercise in nihilism.An all around gross movie experience that left me feeling icky.Grade: D",Possessor
7,trashgang,"not an easy one, weird story, offending nudity and extreme gore",7,9 November 2020,"I went totally blind into this flick only had a recommendation from an Australian girlfriend to watch this.Not knowing the director it was funny that I immediately thought of the weird horror flicks of David Cronenberg. Let his son be the director of Possessor.Is it an easy flick? Not at all, flashy and nerving editing and a storyline that some will turn this off. Slow builder as it is it do offer a lot. I was into the story but still some moments it made me think who was who.Why I watched it was the fact that the Australian one said, its gory as hell and I must admit. If you aren't used to the in your face on-camera gore it will turn your stomach. But not only that. There's a lot of nudity and in one shot genitals are shown from male and female. So on that part some could be offended.So after all, not an easy flick on all parts. But if you digged the David flicks from the horror heydays than try this one. And for the gorehounds who are already licking their fingers to search the gore. The things going on with Sean Bean. A must see.Gore 3,5/5 Nudity 4/5 Story 3/5 Effects 5/5 Comedy 0/5",Possessor
8,deloudelouvain,The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.,6,4 January 2021,"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You can see where Brandon Cronenberg got his inspiration from. Like his dad he has his own view of making movies. The story is interesting but I can't help it to think the movie could have been better. So for the writing Brandon Cronenberg did a good job, for the directing it could have been better. The acting was good and that from the entire cast.

9,siderite,Too Cronenberg for no reason at all,6,5 March 2021,"The son of David Cronenberg wants to to a movie like Existenz, but he ultimately fails to do so. The acting is good, but the plot is really drawn out and says almost nothing in the end. Also, as many others noted, there is some gratuitous gore and violence put in which doesn't really advance the story in any way, and that extends to some other things as well.The entire thing revolves around people that ""jockey"" other people in order to do very mundane things like assassinations. The very idea is lacking imagination, considering that the premise of this film is killing people for other people that want their money and the very obvious alternative is to jockey the people directly and take their money. And then there is an entire exploration of what it means to inhabit other people's lives and minds, but it goes nowhere other than hallucinating some images.At least the end was good because the jockey finally got back on track and remembered her work ethic! I am kidding. The end was bad.Bottom line: an overly long film that shouts ""Cronenberg!!!!"" but needed very little of the signature characteristics of a Cronenberg movie to tell this story. I hope Brandon will find his own voice rather than bank on the same ideas his father explored. Or was it really Brandon? Maybe his father was jockeying him!",Possessor

12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Gets under your skin.,7,4 July 2021,"'Possessor (2020)' is a cerebral sci-fi thriller about an assassin who uses brain-possessing technology to inhabit the body of a scapegoat and use them to eliminate high-profile targets in an almost undetectable way. Its concept really is killer, the kind of thing that could be a catalyst of any number of narratives. As such, one could consider it to be vaguely generic. However, Cronenberg avoids the usual trappings of the trade to deliver a visceral experience that's thoroughly and unapologetically distinct from its peers. It's an almost invasive picture, one that assaults the senses with shocking sequences of sex, slaughter and strobe-infused insanity. Yet, it's far from mindless. Its focus is firmly on the mind, which is visualised with nothing other than some of the most inventive methods I've seen on screen (and most of it is in-camera, too). It's often a rather disturbing affair, using both its visuals and plot to perpetuate its underlying sense of dread. Its infrequent but inarguably wince-inducing brutality serves to punctuate this, blending what could be considered 'genre schlock' with existentialism in a surprisingly effective way. The picture is enjoyable and compelling right the way through. It truly is unique and it gets under your skin. It does have a couple of small issues, the most pertinent being the fact that its characters themselves are actually relatively flat. Still, their enigmatic nature arguably makes for a more suspenseful and intriguing picture; they fulfil their function and don't allow the audience easy access into the thing's harsh, amoral world. Overall, this is an effective and engaging piece of science-fiction. It isn't for the feint of heart but it is for fans of bracing, beguiling cinema. 7/10.",Possessor
13,Cineanalyst,This Is Not a Pipe,8,14 August 2021,"Some artful notions swirling around in this one, ""Possessor,"" but not necessarily always amounting to much. A conclusion of a loss of empathy seems especially trite to me. There's so much more potential here than some character arch. More than the satire on the real world, too.We've got mind-body duality of implanted techno body horror (from the son of the master of the subgenre) instead of dreamscape ""Inception"" (2010), but nonetheless for some generic corporatist plot. There's a bit of ""The Puppet Masters"" or ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" to the scenario, as well. An actress (Andrea Riseborough) playing a character that also is an actress--practicing her lines, fine-tuning facial expressions until literally embodying her character. It's even in her name, Tasya Vos, meaning ""resurrection"" and ""fox,"" a symbolically trickster animal. A character who wears other people's faces like a mask and whose nightmare is that one of those people wears her face literally as a mask. Body and mental dysmorphia that becomes bizarre digitally dysmorphic cinematic imagery. Seeing artifacts that aren't there. An identity crisis fully emerging from wearing virtual-reality-like goggles to spy through customers' webcams through the eyes of the body that's consciousness has been hacked via Vos hooked up to another virtual-reality set. It's the sort of film-within-a-film that's within yet another film that really makes a character question their reality.This is what got me wondering, then, about those objects Vos looks at in her debriefing meetings with Jennifer Jason Leigh's Girder (which may mean ""satirist,"" by the way). Interesting how Leigh has been cast in so many such detached, clinician-type parts, at least of late: ""Annihilation"" (2018) and ""Awake"" (2021) being two of the latest movies I've seen with her, in addition to ""The Woman in the Window"" allusion to her part in ""Single White Female"" (1992). This is also the actress from ""eXistenZ"" (1999), ""The Machinist"" (2004) and ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008). There probably aren't many actors out there more trained in the ways of reality-bending cinematic reflexivity. More interesting methinks than her ex-husband's use of meta-narratives as realistic movie therapy sessions.Cronenberg to Cronenberg, but for the actors, Leigh's satirist grooms another actress as her successor. She monitors her character possessing via virtual-reality headwear, illustrates her slasher exploits with bloody big-screen images, and presents her objects from her past--nominally to distinguish her own identity and reality from those she possesses--but, Girder actually advises Vos to detach herself further, from the family connections that distract her from her work. Noah Baumbach should take note.All of which makes me wonder about those objects, a pipe and a pinned butterfly. The latter seems to fit the transformation and resurrection themes well enough, but that pipe. And, boy, is there a lot of vaping in this one. A tobacco fix that isn't tobacco. A pipe that isn't actually a pipe. People possessed who aren't actually themselves. Consumers and voyeurs, not people. Pornography instead of sex. Dead images in lieu of reality. Ceci n'est pas une pipe à la René Magritte. This is The Treachery of Images. This isn't reality; it's a representation, surreal, virtual, a movie. ""Pull me out.""",Possessor
14,A_Different_Drummer,Textbook disconnect between critics and public,4,4 November 2020,"It is almost as if, with the advent of streaming media, the critics are desperate for an actual feature to gush over. They picked the wrong movie. There are clever bits here and there, but the directors endless love affair with the tropes of low-budget film making, static scenes, dim lighting -- all these will ultimately disappoint. And the gushers would do well to remember that the director's father may have started with low-budget productions but eventually graduated to blockbusters like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE.

15,851222,Pretty interesting concept in a bloody and goory movie,7,15 November 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.I mainly saw ""Possessor"" (2020) because in its genre description it is said ""Horror"", and horror being my favorite genre i picked it up. After seeing ""Possessor"" (2020) i can safely say that it is not a horror movie, not a conventional at least. ""Possessor"" is a very bloody, goory movie story and concept of which more then once reminded me of ""Inception"" - but only on a concept level, because later movie is a masterpiece and ""Possessor"" was just OK. I also liked that it was unpredictable later in a story. Where this movie did suffer was its storytelling i think - i did get the plot but it could have been told say much more involving.Overall, the director and writer Brandon Cronenberg clearly took some inspiration from ""Inception"" and from works of his famous father David Cronenberg (sudden and bloody violence) made a not bad movie overall. I liked of unpredictable it was and somehow bold, cold and bleak - but it a good way. ""Possessor"" is not the best movie around, but it was not bad either.",Possessor
16,westsideschl,Dont' Buy It,4,29 March 2021,The premise that you can implant a device to which someone remotely can imagine suggestions that somehow make it to the implant & alters behavior to the extreme.

17,cruise01,Waste of time,1,4 February 2021,.5 out of 5 stars.Possessor is one of the worst psychological sci fi horror films that is weird to even explain. Director spends more time trying to cross boundaries on trying to take the audiences into a weird and disturbing direction. Its low budget. Independent. And one of those films that will take you on a unsettling trip.Plot is weird and dumb. The script and characters are forgettable. Acting is tedious. With a forgettable cast. The film does lack thrills and suspense. And in the end. You would be asking yourself on what are you watching.,Possessor
18,eddie_baggins,Daddy would be proud,7,6 December 2020,"There's no doubt that daddy would be proud.Seven years on from his impressive debut with cult horror Antiviral, son of David, Brandon Cronenberg returns with another horror filled sci-fi Possessor, a grisly, bloody and original offering that feels as though its been born straight out of the 80's genre cannon too hit us hard with its unflinching violence and examination of a tech-filled world gone bad.With its bleak aesthetic and even bleaker narrative that focuses on Andrea Riseborough's mentally withering Tasya, whose job is working for a shady organization using advanced technology to ""possess"" human hosts and carry out assassinations for high paying clients, Possessor is a typically Cronenberg experience that isn't one you'd call enjoyable in the essence of the saying but its a constantly engaging one that pulls no punches as we go down a dangerous rabbit hole with Tasya.Promoted heavily as Possessor Uncut in many markets, there's a reason the marketing behind Cronenberg's film has honed in on this aspect of the film as much like his father before him Brandon is able to shock and surprise viewers with Possessor's often unexpected bursts of wince-inducing violence and terror, that while not frequent in the film, make themselves well and truly known when they arrive.The films more notable arrivals that include these blood splattered moments and some fairly confronting examples of on screen nudity go a large way to enlivening an otherwise fairly subdued and somber offering with Possessor in no real rush or worry when it comes to getting things done fast or developing characters further than a surface level but thanks to the work of the always good Riseborough and another solid turn from rising star Christopher Abbott, Possessor feels a cut above similar low-budget affairs that don't often feel as polished or refined as this.There's not many elements of Cronenberg's film that haven't been explored in some way, shape or form in other films and more likable characters wouldn't of hurt the films chances of being slightly more memorable but there's enough here to once more suggest that the youngest Cronenberg can live up to his father's significant reputation as a boundary pushing director.Final Say -A grim and brutal affair that is the very definition of sci-fi/horror, Possessor is a another solid piece of work from Brandon Cronenberg that hints at the possible greatness that is to come from the up and coming director.3 1/2 cocktail parties out of 5",Possessor

22,jtindahouse,Great concept but I wanted more out of it,7,6 November 2020,"I'm very glad I got to see the uncut version of 'Possessor'. I think almost every film performs better when we get to see what the director actually wanted to put on the screen, rather than what the rating system necessitates they include. The version I got to see was extremely violent and featured graphic nudity (relevant to the story). It made for a much better movie than what I assume the alternative is like.This movie has a fun concept. Going into someone else's body and then assassinating people - how could a movie go wrong with that right? And the movie doesn't really go wrong, but it did let me down that it kind of felt like it did the most expected thing with it. It went in a direction which I feel is what 99% of film-makers would have gone in. I was hoping the film would hit me with a twist or a hook at some point, but it never really came. I guess I just wanted a little more out of the story.The film does get a little confusing towards the end, but not enough to ruin the film for you hopefully. And it does clear itself up in the end.

23,jadavix,More interesting than entertaining,7,7 December 2020,"""Possessor"" is one of those movies that is more ""interesting"" than ""good"". In that way, it reminded me of ""Under the Skin"". The ideas thrown up on screen are interesting, the imagery is surprising, as is the score, and the violence is heavier than you expect.It's pretty strong stuff, but it doesn't have a gripping story underpinning the bizarreness we're watching. As such it didn't really grab me.It's hard not to compare this work by Brandon Cronenberg to that of his father, the legendary David Cronenberg. Consider ""Videodrome"", for example. That was, if anything, more out-there than this, and yet it worked better, due to James Woods' performance, and a stronger narrative presence. Here, the stand-out is Christopher Abbott, but his performance is occluded by too many other actors. The woman who invades his head is not strongly established enough.",Possessor

This British/Canadian science fiction/horror is the most brutal movie that I have seen for a while and knocks spots off the vast majority of today's offerings. Directed by Brandon Cronenberg, he certainly is a chip off the old block (David). I have to admit that the plot is not always to follow, I am sure that repeat viewings would help make things clearer (alternatively read a full synopsis). The violence and gore is extreme, plus there are a few scenes of very strong sex and nudity. The sets and locations look good and the acting is excellent. I found the movie impressive and look forward to watching it again, however this is most certainly not a film for everyone.",Possessor
25,kevin_robbins,This is a very smart and entertaining film that is definitely worth your time,9,7 May 2021,"The Possessor (2020) we recently rented off Amazon Prime for $1.99. The storyline is primarily about a high profile agent who uses brain implant technology to get access to other people's bodies to conduct assassinations for high profile/paying clients. The more missions they conduct the more they deteriorate themselves putting the agency and tasks at risk as their own mental state crumbles due to the technology. This movie is directed by Brandon Cronenberg (Antiviral and son of David Cronenberg) in his second major motion picture. This picture stars Gabrielle Graham (Shadow of the Moon), Hanneke Talbot (Ready or Not), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dolores Claiborne), Daniel Park (12 Monkeys) and Andrea Riseborough (Oblivion). First off, I love this movie. The kill scenes are often subtle in their execution but also very intense. The delivery of the debilitating factors of the technology is also well delivered in both the storytelling, special effects and acting. Everything about this movie is well thought out and executed. This is a very smart and entertaining film that is definitely worth your time. I'd score this a 8-8.5/10.",Possessor

28,kirbylee70-599-526179,HIGH TECH HIT,7,21 December 2020,"One of the greatest directors from the 70s forward who put forth the idea of science fiction with body modification and manipulation was David Cronenberg. Imagine being the son of Cronenberg and having to live up to his record of films. It appears that his son Brandon is doing just that and succeeding. His latest film does just that and more, creating a science fiction premise that is frightening and fascinating at the same time.POSSESSOR takes place in the near future and opens with a brilliant yet violent segment that shows what the film is all about. A young woman named Holly (Gabrielle Graham) is seen inserting something into the top of her skull and reacting to the probe emotionally. Shortly after she is attending a party as one of the hostesses there when she takes a knife and kills a high profile attorney in one of the most brutal and bloody sequences seen. Afterward she points the gun in her mouth but doesn't pull the trigger. Instead she points it at the police who kill her.But it wasn't really Holly who was responsible for the brutal killing. In reality she was being manipulated by Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough), a professional killer who works for a company that implants her consciousness into another person using them to pull of the contract. Having done this many times this last hit proved problematic because Holly was resisting Tasya's plan to kill herself. Rather than inform her superiors Tasya keeps this to herself.Tasya takes a short time off to visit her husband Michael (Rossif Sutherland) and son Ira who she has separated with. To do so she has to prepare herself, teaching herself how to speak and interact with normal people. It seems the mechanics involved with her profession are taking their toll on her. Unable to connect as much as she'd like, she leaves early and returns for her next job.The next assignment is a top priority one. The man being targeted is the owner of a massive corporation, John Parse (Sean Bean). They've been hired by Parse's stepson Reid (Christopher Jacot) to kill both him and his daughter Ava (Tuppence Middleton) so that he can take over the company. Tasya's company wants the hit done as well so they can use the information to blackmail Reid.To put her in place Ava's boyfriend Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) is captured and linked with Tasya. She now controls his body seeing what he sees, manipulating him when called on to do so. In the meantime her body lays in stasis back at the company's facility being monitored. But things don't go as planned. It seems that Colin keeps trying to regain control of his mind as Tasya works to continue manipulating him.Simply getting through the day becomes difficult for Colin/Tasya, at one point with him blacking out. Trying to recognize people and not making him seem different in his behavior is a struggle. All of this leads to a dinner held at John Parse' home. The question now becomes whether Tasya can control Colin long enough to pull off her mission or not and if so can she return to her own body?I wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching this film. I knew it premiered at Sundance but that doesn't always mean a movie is good. Sometimes those films can be critic darlings but audience dead weight. Fortunately that wasn't the case here. While the progress of the film is steady the pacing is a bit slower than most. It doesn't hurt the storytelling going on here but some people might not be willing to go along for the ride without that breakneck speed they're used to. That would be their loss.The story is compelling on various levels. There is Tasya who you want to understand and figure out why she does what she does. There is Colin who is fighting for his life here inside of his own skull. There is Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Tasya's controller who has concerns for Tasya. There is Ava who seems the most innocent of the entire group. And there is John Parse, a jerk who at points seems worth killing. All of these characters combine to make an interesting story. And the acting on the parts of all involved make them come to life, becoming believable.I'd love to say I love the film but in all honesty I really just enjoyed it but found it not a movie I'm likely to revisit. It is worth one viewing at least and will keep you guessing. The version being released is unrated due to a combination of gore and nudity so keep that in mind. Not one for the kids. On the whole you might enjoy this one if you're a fan of sci-fi.",Possessor

30,kluseba,Numbing dystopian science-fiction story with sudden outbursts of violence and surreal pornography,8,18 November 2020,"Possessor is a Canadian science-fiction thriller directed by Brandon Cronenberg and starring actresses and actors such as Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Abbott. Even though the film is a slow burn, it includes quite a few graphic scenes and also features some pornographic elements. This is certainly not a movie for children or teenagers or the whole family.The story is quite intriguing and includes several twists and turns that end up being somewhat difficult to follow towards the conclusion. The film presents a secretive organization that uses brain-implant technology to temporarily inhabit bodies of other people in order to commit unsolvable crimes. Tasya Vos is shown possessing the body of a hostess who suddenly grabs a knife and murders a businessman. In order to pull out of the foreign body, Tasya Vos is supposed to make the hostess commit suicide but she hesitates and gets shot by the police instead. The demanding job has taken its toll on Tasya Vos who asks for some time off to rekindle with her estranged husband and son who know nothing of her job. She realizes that she has become hesitant, isolated and depressive but accepts the next job nevertheless. Tasya Vos takes control of a young man who dates the daughter of an ambitious businessman. She is supposed to murder the daughter and her father and make the boyfriend commit suicide. The job however becomes more difficult than anticipated when Tasya Vos discovers details about her host that she wasn't briefed about beforehand. Things quickly spiral out of control and take an unexpected personal turn.This ambitious movie convinces on numerous levels. The story is certainly intriguing and keeps you guessing how things might unfold until the very last scene. The film has a gloomy, mystyerious and numbing atmosphere from start to finish. Especially the cold sound effects and efficient lighting techniques enhance the film's dystopian vibes. The acting performances are stellar and especially Andrea Riseborough convinces as conflicted lead character whose life is spinning out of control. Despite its slow pace, the movie grabs the viewer's attention with sudden violent outbursts and pornographic elements that might however feel unnecessarily exaggerated at some points.The film's biggest downside is its own ambition. The final thirty minutes introduce a few too many twists and turns that can be understood when analyzed in hindsight but that harm the film's flow. The movie's eventful resolution doesn't blend in with the much calmer exposition, rising action, climax and even falling action. The director should have taken more time to properly tell the ending of the story instead of rushing to the conclusion.Overall, Possessor is a very atmospheric dystopian science-fiction film with an interesting story, intriguing characters and vivid outbursts of violence and some surreal pornographic elements. The movie isn't always easy to digest due to its overall slow pace contrasted by a rushed finale but there are enough creative ideas in here for the film to deserve more attention and acclaim. If you are a genre fan and like the works of Brandon's famous father David Cronenberg, then you should rent or stream this movie.",Possessor
31,Pairic,Who Are You?,8,14 March 2021,"Possessor: ScFi but ventures very much into Horror territory. An assassin can take control of other peoples bodies through implants in the unwilling hosts brains. This film is spectacularly violent from the beginning as we see the assassin (Andrea Riseborough) in action, the victim is slashed to death but the killer hesitates about committing suicide and dies in a shootout with police. In fact the assassin has suffered identity problems lately. We see her practicing the host's accent and mannerisms before she takes control but once she is back in her own body after the mission she has to do exercises to get her own voice and identity in place before meeting her family. Unwisely she agrees to another mission too soon. Her target is a billionaire, using his daughter's boyfriend as a mule. Things do not run smoothly. Possessor explores the dangers of two personalities in the same body, what happens when the original fights back. The loss of control of identity may also be inflicted on he Possessor. A thriller with many twists and savage deaths and assaults inflicted with guns, knives and cleavers. The blood runs freely unlike the streams of consciousness which get blocked. Impressive scenes of how the brain visualises the rebuilding of identities through facial reconstruction and the donning of masks. Like the selfhoods Possessor operates on several levels (it's even set in an alternative 2008) but it's a fine SF/Horror Thriller. Written and Directed by Brandon Cronenberg.

34,TdSmth5,Doesn't offer much,4,3 January 2021,"A girl sticks a wire into her brain and connects it to some device which causes her to display a variety of emotions. She then follows a friend to a party where she sticks a knife into some guys neck then stabs him enthusiastically and repeatedly into the chest. Then she grabs a gun, puts it into her mouth, can't pull the trigger, instead commits suicide by cop.Elsewhere a woman has some device removed from her head and undergoes a mental test. This woman, Vos, was the one controlling the girl's actions. Vos wants to see her ex and her son, even though her handler tells her they are not together anymore. Vos wants out, but there's the proverbial one last job which is huge and very important and lucrative. Vos spends a night with her ex. It's clear she's not 100% OK. Suddenly she says she's ready for the job.This new job entails taking over the body of Tate who is involved with his boss's daughter. The boss runs a data mining company. Vos's outfit aim to take control of this company once Tate kills his boss, the daughter, and himself. So others from the group kidnap Tate, implant the thingy in his brain, Vos is placed in the device and now she lives over Tate's life. The wife right away notices something isn't right with him. He goes to work which involves using VR to spy on people's life via the cameras that everyone has at home. But it's affecting his/Vos's brain. Still she pretends everything is fine. Then the big day comes where she's supposed to take out the boss. Things of course don't turn out as planned and things even backfire.Possessor borrows then the whole Assassin's Creed idea, puts in some dull scenario and lets it play out for an excessive 1 hour 43 minutes. Nothing wrong with the idea in itself, but here it's not well done. The cast is unappealing, you can't really connect with any of them let alone care for their fates. Visually there's nothing interesting. The sci-fi aspect is minimal. There's not much horror or thrills either. It rather plays out like a drama where you don't have a stake in the outcome. Direction is off the mark. Given the story, it should have worked to make us care more for Tate (or Vos for that matter), but it doesn't. Overall Possessor is a missed opportunity.",Possessor
35,aidanratesmovies,"Life, Death, and the In-Between",8,24 March 2021,"Although it can have some troubles along its wild and twisted road, Possessor is an incredibly unique and dark little horror tale that is able to transport the audience to a reality that is not only incredibly interesting, but quite well developed. To start off with my problems of the film, I have to talk about the pacing. It isn't necessarily that the film is too slow, I was fine with its cautioned and careful approach to telling its tale. The problem I have with the pacing is that it limits a grander story to be told, stretching out its tale for runtime when it could have been a lot more telling its story in half the time. It has such a brilliant premise, and it varies on how well it executes it throughout, but in terms of pacing, I feel the film could have been quite a bit better. The acting in the film is extraordinarily strong, so many well written moments and horrific scenes throughout. Brandon Cronenberg largely takes a page from his fathers sort of storytelling, while also proving to be quite original, despite his similar if more modern style. I love how Cronenberg decided to go with practical effects over CGI, giving his film a gory and horrifyingly grounded quality that we don't often see in horror today. The worldbuilding is incredibly well done, and the depth of the characters is immeasurable. Besides some structural issues, I really did enjoy the film, and am excited for what Brandon Cronenberg will make next.
My Rating: 8.5//10",Possessor
36,valleyjohn,Like father like son - Sadly.,5,27 December 2020,"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree in the case of Possessor . Directed by Brandon Cronenberg son of David , this is unmistakably a Cronenberg film and that's not necessarily a good thing for me.Possessor follows an agent who works for a secretive organization that uses brain-implant technology to inhabit other people's bodies - ultimately driving them to commit assassinations for high-paying clients.I'm not a fan of films that leave the plot up to the viewer to decide what's going on. I think it's lazy film making and it annoys the hell out of me and this is one such film .
What it lacks is structure it makes up for in sex and violence but again , that's not enough to make this film any good .I idea of an assassin being transported into someone's body or into another time has been done many times before and better than this .
I'm not saying it didn't have a glint of promise, it did , but the ambiguity of it all made it into a movie that I will very soon forget about .",Possessor
37,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting Blend of Sci-Fi, Body Horror and Espionage",9,20 October 2020,"This was a movie that its trailer was being shown at the Gateway Film Center before some of the movies I was going to see there. I caught the name of it, that it starred Andrea Riseborough and was written/directed by Brandon Cronenberg. I've seen a couple of his films, enjoyed what he's been doing and Riseborough has been in quite a few genre films lately as well. Aside from that, I came in pretty blind to be honest. The synopsis here is we follow an agent who works for a secretive organization that uses brain-implant technology to inhabit other people's bodies - ultimately driving them to commit assassinations for high-paying clients.We start this off with Holly (Gabrielle Graham) sticking something in the top of her head. It is connected to what looks like an older looking dial and whatever it is, it is hurting her. She then goes off to what I'm assuming is work. She focuses in on a water fountain, but the water is moving backwards. I'll get into the significance of this shortly. Katherine (Hanneke Talbot) then calls out to her to see what is taking her so long. She then goes into work and heads directly for Elio (Matthew Garlick). She doesn't waste any time stabbing him in the neck and then repeatedly until he dies. A pistol is taken from her purse and there is hesitation to kill herself, where a policeman shoots her as well.It then takes us to Tasya Vos (Riseborough). She is answering questions about items being taken from a box by Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh). This really seems to be cognitive test. Tasya does raise some concerns, but everything from the tests seems to be checking out. They are working as a group of assassins. As the synopsis states, this seems a lot like Assassin's Creed. Instead of sending them into the past though, they're taking over other bodies, controlling them and killing assets. Tasya is the best in the business currently, but her concerns make Girder question her. They have their biggest job coming up and they're needed.Tasya then has an interesting scene where she is practicing what she will say. We see the reason is that she is a bit estranged from her husband, Michael (Rossif Sutherland), and her son of Ira (Gage Graham-Arbuthnot). This is brought up during her tests where it was thought they are no longer together, but it appears they are working things out. It seems that Tasya left, probably due to the nature of her work, where Michael wants her to move back in. She is breaking down mentally and this seems to be part of the reason she's staying away.Despite what she is going through mentally, she decides to tell Girder she is in for this next job. It seems that Reid (Christopher Jacot) wants to take over his father's business. In order to do so, John Parse (Sean Bean) needs to be eliminated along with his daughter Ava (Tuppence Middleton). Her boyfriend, Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott), is the person they're looking to take over. They want it to seem like he's acting different and be made the scapegoat. If they pull this off, they will control the business.Things become problematic. Colin is breaking the control that Tasya has over him. She thinks it will be fine, but when it comes time to act, the worst thing possible happens and it is a battle to gain control so she can make a clean break mentally or their minds could completely melt causing disastrous things for both parties and their lives.That's where I'm going to leave the recap as that gets you up to speed without really getting too much into the spoiler section. Where I want to start for my analysis is that it is fitting that Brandon Cronenberg did this movie. While I'm watching it, I got vibes of him meshing a couple of his father's movies together with Scanners and Videodrome.To break that down a bit farther, I'll start with the first part of the statement. Much like Scanners we are dealing with espionage. If memory serves me there, that is part of what they were planning to use those with this psychic ability. Here we are getting something similar, but in the sense that they're controlling the body of someone with a machine. I don't want to spoil the older movie, there is a bit with melding of minds as well and 'sucking of brains'. We see that Tasya's losing grip with reality and that allows Colin to fight back. It isn't done cheesy either which works.Then to the other part of it with the Videodrome reference. This company is going for a new world order which draws parallels there. We also get some body horror in this movie. I was expecting with some of Cronenberg's previous films and heck, his father is a master of this subgenre which is partly why I'm comparing to take elements from two of his films.I should probably shift really quickly to cover this aspect of the movie with the body horror. It was interesting, because I debate whether to call this a body horror film or not. The movie has a few different places where we get really graphic elements, but it doesn't feel like that type of movie overall. There is a scene where someone is attacked and their face is mangled. That looked real. Any of the other attacks fall into this as well. There is this interesting flesh melding scene and having Colin wearing Tasya's face like a mask. It all makes sense to the story while making it that much creepier. I do have to give credit to the cinematography here as well. They have blurry images and making it feel like we're experiencing when these people are confused as to what is going on. This was a strong part of the film for sure.To just back a bit to the story elements here, I really like this idea of assassins using people's bodies. I've already given some examples of different things that are using similar premises here so I'll shift over to the element of the brain's melting together. Tasya is great at what she does. She notices different things that should stop her from doing what she does, but ignores it. That is my take on the things defying the laws of physics like gravity. Colin seems to be pretty strong willed as well. I think that it makes for an interesting climax that went places I wasn't expecting it to. It is a bit long though. I did find myself waning in interest a bit in the middle until it pulled me back into everything in the end.I think that I should take this to the acting of the movie. Riseborough is an actress that I didn't know about until recently and she really just impresses me with the roles she's taking on. I don't want to come off as mean, but I don't find her attractive. She plays well though this disheveled look of someone who has gone through a lot. She also plays well here of being just worn out. Leigh is solid in her smaller role. Abbott is really good as well. I've seen him before and the other movie he did a good job there with his performance. Middleton and Bean were both really good as well. The later really being a jerk and he plays it so well. There is this weird dynamic of how the rich live, which makes sense why Tasya feels so out of place and Kaniehtiio Horn, Deragh Campbell and Dorren Lee help to build this gap. Sutherland and Graham-Arbuthnot are also both solid in their roles.That is really all that I wanted to go over for this movie. If you couldn't tell, I really enjoyed the concept and the story that they were building. The acting was good in carrying what they were going for and the realistic effects give it a body horror feel. I think the cinematography was also really good for helping it. The soundtrack fit for what was needed. I didn't have any issues there. If I did, it does run a bit long and I did lose interest just a bit for a stretch. It does pull you back in. This will be a movie that I will need to revisit though as there are some things I need to rewatch now knowing what happens to ensure I didn't miss anything. I would rate this as a good movie though. Not one I could recommend to anyone, as there are some vicious scenes. If you get past that, it looks at some interesting ideas for sure.",Possessor
38,davidmvining,Interesting,6,28 April 2021,"I don't think this movie fully works, but I don't want to dismiss it completely. It's aggressively unpleasant for long stretches with a wildly unappealing main character and some unclarity about who's who for a while, but the main character has an emotional (or one might say emotionless) journey that's well built around unpleasantness and the unclarity actually feeds that some of that at the same time. I'm mixed on this, having never really engaged with it on any level while watching it, but having learned to appreciate it on a certain intellectual level as I considered it after it was over.Written and directed by David Cronenberg's son, Brandon, Possessor is a weird science fiction horror film of a woman, Tasya Vos, who remotely controls the bodies of unsuspecting individuals to commit assassinations for contracts. The movie begins with her towards the end of one contract, controlling the body of a young hostess that she forces to stab a lawyer to death horribly. There are interesting details here. She has a gun, but she chooses the much more brutal knife killing. When the man is dead, she places her hand in the blood almost celebratory fashion. More importantly to the story, she brings the gun to her mouth to hill her host, breaking the connection and allowing her to go back to her normal body, but she can't make it happen. Whether it's her own inhibitions or the host fighting back is never made clear, but Vos ends up getting released when the police show up and kill her host in a brief shootout.The thing about Vos is that she's an inhuman monster, but she's still clinging to her humanity. A test her handler, Girder, puts her through after every job has her reviewing random items to see if she's fully in control of her identity and facilities, enough to identify objects that are hers from those that are not. One particular item, a butterfly killed and mounted when she was a child, elicits words of regret over the action from decades before. She goes back to her separated husband's home, being in the middle of an effort to reconnect with him and their son, and she practices her basic greetings down the street. When she makes love to her husband, she's completely checked out until she decides to mime interest. She had asked for time away from work, but one evening at home and she calls Girder asking for the next job.That job involves the future son-in-law of the founder and CEO of a data mining company. The objective is to possess the son in order to kill the CEO, using his strained relationship with the father-in-law as the pretext that will sell the crime to the world. Here is where we see the process from the beginning, where the subject, Colin, has to be kidnapped with some minor brain surgery in order for the process to work. We see the unsure first steps of Vos learning the small details impossible to pick up in surveillance, the unsteady steps into a relationship she can't understand, and her trying to do his job at the data mining firm for him.All through this, I was cautiously engaged, waiting for the movie to make something of itself. The ideas were percolating, somethings in vivid visual form, and I kept watching. The montage of melting skin into wax that reincorporates to show Vos taking over Colin's body is vivid and striking. The data mining job is invasive and voyeuristic involving using personal cameras in people's homes to track what kinds of curtains they have. All through this, Vos is having trouble keeping control, leading to Colin blacking out at one point.The extended middle section of Vos wrestling with Colin is where I think the movie gets held back. We never get a good handle on Colin, so the fight with Vos never gains any real concrete feeling. All we really have is the idea that Vos is struggling to control herself. That may end up being the overall point, but Colin fighting back in some way indicates that he should have been a greater focus, perhaps creating a direct contrast between the two in terms of views towards humanity. With Colin being such a non-entity through this, until he does gain some control after the assassination and is just panicking, the conflict feels underused thematically, leading to a thinner conflict that means less that it could.The finale of the film leads to Vos abandoning all that's left of her humanity completely. She can't pull the trigger with the gun in Colin's mouth, but Girder commits an act of shocking violence. It's hard to take, but it does ultimately have a point, exemplified by the moment of Vos looking over her items post-mission and leaving out the mention of being regretful of the death of the butterfly, meaning that she's abandoned her humanity completely to become a better weapon. I think it's safe to assume that she'll have little trouble pulling the trigger on her next mission.It's the story of an inhuman monster becoming more inhuman. I can appreciate that, but it's a hard pill to swallow. Mix in the intentionally uncomfortable imagery (Vos fighting Colin while Colin is making love to his fiancée is probably the central example), and this becomes a hard movie to get into. Vos isn't a character to invest in as she starts bad and just gets worse. Her fight with Colin is indistinct because one side of the conflict is underwritten. However, I can appreciate it, after the fact, on a certain intellectual level about Vos's journey. This is a flawed movie that I find interesting to consider. Brandon Cronenberg could grow into an interesting filmmaker.",Possessor

40,vengeance20,"Gory, But Boring.",3,24 February 2021,"Got around to watching this last night & thought it would be an alright watch.The film follows a woman who enters into a simulator where she possess a body of another person in order to assassinate high profile targets. But one day, when shes possess a host during a routine assassination, the host begins to fight back & the 2 personalities begin to clash.I found the film to be somewhat dull & boring. I mean, the opening was good as with the other gory visuals, but the narrative of the film was little to non existent. It basically wasn't obvious what was going on from the start, the pacing itself didn't help this either.There wasn't even a backstory as to why the target was being assassinated (i.e. who he was & what his beef was with the host the woman was possessing) in the first place, why the simulator started to go wrong or even a successful assassination from before to show what could happen if done right & what could happen if went wrong, the latter is all we saw. There was a lot of questions that were left unanswered & the bleak, weak feel of the film didn't help keep you interested in order to figure out what was what.The ending was just weird, the latter act blurred the lines too much to the point where you couldn't follow the story anymore & just was waiting for it to end.

I think it loses some steam in its final act and doesn't manage to stay as satisfying throughout. And while the violence is horrific and convincing, during the last brutal stabbing scene (yes, there is more than one), it kind of looked like the stabber is holding back from hurting the stabbee, which took me out of the moment.There's some sense of ""that's it?"" due to the ending feeling like it came so soon, as well as that great premise fizzling out a little in the final half hour, but the journey (rather than the destination) is almost always unnerving, engaging, and visually appealing (maybe the extra headroom in a lot of closeups bothered me a bit, but there was a reason for it).I feel like Brandon Cronenberg's future movies have the potential to improve on this and be truly great, so looking forward to whatever he might do next.",Possessor

But not exactly a Dad and Son reunion with Sean Bean.Anyway, I liked the premise of this Sci Fi film. Suppose for an instance if science advances enough that an assassin can feel, smell, talk, and commit an assassination of key influential targets paid by governments or business competitors by using another living and breathing person like an avatar and get away with it. With an implant inserted into the host, that person's thoughts, behaviors and actions can be control by a remote counter agent much like a military pilot flies a Predator drone to drop munitions from thousands of miles away. If scientist figure out how the brain works, this could be the next deadly military weapon.",Possessor

What kept me around till the end, though, was the gore. Yeah, I'm guilty of being a gorehound, and ""Possessor"" delivered. There were two blatantly poor aspects of the film i wish they'd worked out. 1. Ridiculous framing of characters. An artistic choice to be sure, but a poor one. The effect just came off as annoying. 2. The design of the ""transference"" chair, or whatever it's called, wasn't bad, but the use of 1950's electronica for other devices in the films only betrays the fact they had very little money to begin with and hoped no one would notice. (Everyone did). So, to recap, come for the violence, but skip if confusing stories annoy you.",Possessor

50,kuarinofu,"Themes are there, but focus is not",5,4 November 2020,"'Possessor' is quite unique.It's a 20 minute short that feels like it's played on 0.25 speed.Getting over all the artsy imagery and cinematography is the easiest part since it is mostly hereditary. Some of it is well-thought, some is there just for style points.The film is well-acted, the score is great, and although it feels low-budget, this never hurts the film.Yet enjoying the story is almost impossible. I can buy some sort of alternate universe with such technology, even though this doesn't make sense in most of the cases they use it for. But having no characters and very limited dialogue that feels like copywritten descriptions of human interactions...I'm not sure I'm up for that.Maybe it was intentional but besides the fact that that our main lead is slowly losing her human qualities only saving the bloodlust is not enough for me to care.It really feels like nothing besides ""you know what would've looked cool"" shots and basic allegories are in this film.I mean, I think this was intentional and the film is just the way they wanted it to be, but again, it's just not interesting or engaging.Top it all up with lots of scenes where everyone moves like they are submerged into water and here you go - a very basic idea, hidden behind so much stuff that goes nowhere it just feels like you're wasting your time expecting something interesting.",Possessor
51,msbreviews,POSSESSOR is one of the most visually shocking films of 2020!,8,30 December 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)In a year where the horror genre didn't have that many great representatives, Brandon Cronenberg's remarkably captivating concept is an instant attention-grabber. Boasting two phenomenal performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott (Colin Tate), Possessor is one of the most visually shocking films of 2020.From the extreme gore to the unrestrained depiction of insanely violent murders, Cronenberg fills his movie with creepy imagery that will definitely trigger many viewers to simply give up. Its slow pace helps establish the never-ending suspenseful atmosphere, which ultimately delivers some of the most intense sequences I've seen in a long time.Despite the interesting narrative and its eye-opening developments, Possessor fails to keep the momentum going throughout the entire runtime. The weird imagery helps with visual storytelling, but it reaches a point where it becomes too distracting and unnecessary. The third act is also quite predictable, contrasting with the somewhat surprising first half.In the end, it's still one of my favorite horror films of the year.Rating: B+",Possessor

I found it fascinating that the film makers did not shy away from the murder scenes which is more explicitly gory than you would expect. The storyline is great and it is interesting to see the internal conflicts between the host and ""possessor"" play out for the viewers to see.However, half way through this film the tables are turned & this begins a cat and mouse game between possessor & host. The prize is who becomes triumphant & takes control & it is a matter of life and death...They assembled a great cast with cameos from the reliable Sean Bean & watchable Jennifer Jason Leigh.

60,sweidman-28016,"A Mind-Bending, Visual Experience",8,20 October 2020,"""Sometimes that small thought is all it takes to lose control.""Now this is something unforgettable. Since I've been waiting for this ever since Sundance. As the son of David Cronenberg, he lives up to his fathers name. Following his footsteps, this is a visual heavy film. Everything is shot beautifully, even if what's on screen is horrifying. Warm colors are brought out making a vivid picture. Then there's the added visual horror elements. There's only a couple scenes using visual effects that were most interesting to look. Not too much detail is put into it but it feels strange just looking at it. I'm not sure how to explain but it works in this situation. Everything else is done with practical effects. It gives it a more authentic and unsettling feel. The score helps set the offsetting tone as well. And since I saw Possessor Uncut, there's no holding back with the gore. I don't know any place that isn't playing this version but all audiences are warned beforehand. Some may call me a sociopath, but I'm glad they didn't hold back with this. With this story, the excessive gore made the experience so much better. Anyone who is freaked out by gore will definitely not enjoy this, especially the third act.Though Andrea Riseborough is billed as the lead, I felt most of the credit should go to Christopher Abbott. Not that she didn't do well because this is a great performance by her with the screen time she gets. But Christopher Abbott drives the whole film. He has two characters with three different personas. To break it down there is himself, Risenborogh in him, and the third act turns everything crazy. He deserves so much credit as it's his best performance to date. A good chunk of the horror doesn't come from the gore and visuals but rather the characters. Seeing them evolve into their sinister selves over the course of the film is quite interesting. You don't know who you should be siding with. All have evil roots and it's tough to connect with them. But you can't help but hope everything goes well on Risenborough's part.As Cronenberg's second feature film, he proves to be another master of horror. I have yet to see Antiviral but I've heard good things about it. And this isn't necessarily just horror. The sci-fi element bends the genre into a mind-bending film really. With every film of this type, there's always questions to be answered. Possessor does get caught up with how confusing it can get. I mainly understand most of what happened but a little more information would have been nice. Especially the beginning. There isn't much exposition on what we're getting into with this company. The film just starts and keeps going. I'm fine with this but a little more information would be nice. Overall, Possessor really did it for me. As a mind-bending, slow burn, gore-fest this won't hit well with all audience. This is for certain people and those people know who they are. I'm eager to see this again and I hope that is soon.",Possessor
61,PedroPires90,"Great visual, great ideas, no soul.",5,11 December 2020,"I definitely have a problem with this Cronenberg. At least, this is a better movie than Antiviral, it has a better plot, but unfortunately the best part of the movie was the opening scene (the final scene was fine, but kind of predictable and I didn't care that much anymore at that point).I can't say that this is a bad film. There are good ideas here, good acting, good shots, great visual. But it lacks...soul. It's sometimes too empty, has serious problems with his pace (no, I don't have a problem with slow burners, it's my fave type, in fact, but we need more tension to build that). Most of the time, I feel that Brandon care much more about how the film looks like and how the pseudo-cinephiles from Sundance will react to it than to tell us a compelling story. I get that he doesn't want to give us an easy story, wants us to feel uncomfortable, but jeez...look to movies like Burning (Chang dong-Lee), Midsommar (Ari Aster) or Uncut Gems (Safdie Brothers), and you can see that you can build that, without being bored.",Possessor

But almost as much as I enjoyed this movie I also hated it for the lack of an explanation. At times it would seem as the man has taken back charge of his body and then he would do something the girl would. Then why her boss went inside the boy was beyond me. Nothing was explained and in the end just made for a whopping mess. I am sure someone will get this movie or see the movie in relation to them but I just could not. This movie was a thinker without any help or ideas given at all. I do not recommend but at the same time I do. This has to be the first movie I am indifferent about.,Possessor
64,TwistedContent,"Like Father, Like Son - In the Best Possible Sense",8,4 December 2020,"""Possessor"" had the weight of being one of my most anticipated horror movies of 2020, and the good news is - it landed its place in the top echelon of the horror movies of 2020. Not to minimize that, but with the kind of year we've had, it's not saying all that much... Brandon Cronenberg, bearing the name of his father, the legendary David Cronenberg, is very much set on his own path to success and creativity in horror, but the numerous similarities are there - body horror, fascination with technology and people's growingly bizarre relationship with it, futuristic ideas, down to certain kinds of atmosphere etc. Like father, like son, beautiful minds.The story of ""Possessor"" might not be the thickest of plots, but it's full of unease, exploring themes like cyber surveillance, the obsession of wanting to live a life different than one's problematic own, and the question we can never truly answer - just how much a human mind can handle without breaking. A secretive organization uses brain-implant tech that makes it possible for a person to inhabit the body of whoever they choose. They have high-paying clients ordering assassinations via this method, and Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) is the one on the mission, hijacking the brain of a billionaire's son Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott). It's not that much the plot that engages, but rather the enjoyable and scary weirdness of what's happening to these characters. The performances of ""Possessor"", especially those of Riseborough and Abbott - next in line Jennifer Jason-Leigh & Sean Bean, - are highly commendable and is one of the strengths holding ""Possessor"" together so well. This whole goodie package is also wrapped up in an aesthetic equally as bizarre - cinematography, special FX, in-camera effects and a solid musical score by Jim Williams (""Kill List"", ""Raw""), together provide a sticky and impeccable audiovisual atmosphere. By all means, ""Possessor"" is an arthouse horror. Last but not least, ""Possessor"" is a true dessert for the gore hounds, the violence is used with a sure hand and to much effectiveness, all practical and very grisly at times.""Possessor"" didn't 'knock me off my feet' as I might have expected while hyping myself up, but it's an impressive effort, a horror film that will more likely than not gain a cult following. I hear Brandon might make a sequel set in the same universe, though personally I'd like to see yet another separate idea of his in realization. My rating: 8/10.",Possessor
65,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Cronenberg Jr.'s first masterpiece! SO BRUTAL!,10,9 October 2020,"Wow. Brandon Cronenberg has done it. After his debut film, Antiviral - an admirable, but not quite accomplished attempt at picking up where his father David left off - he has created a fully realized and fully original vision in POSSESSOR. Not only do the concepts and aesthetics meet Cronenberg standards, but the levels of brutalism and discomfort are SHOCKING - this might be more brutal than ANY movie that David Cronenberg ever made, yet it feels like it's made in a completely inspired manner and with genuine purpose.I started watching this movie at home late one night, and found it fully intriguing, and even kept thinking to myself ""whoa - this would be a great movie to see in the theater"", but got sleepy about halfway through and decided to call it a night. The next day I realized it was playing at theaters nearby and decided to head to the theater to get the full experience! And holy cowgirl am I glad I did! The first half was five times as enjoyable the second time, in the theater, and the second half blew my mind - I was definitely shouting multiple things out, squealing aloud in the theater - but I did have the whole room to my self. I've gotta say, I believe it is my favorite film of 2020 thus far, but I know that will not be the case for everyone - however, psych-horror is my absolute favorite sub-genre of film, and David Cronenberg is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time.Each passing segment sets up a new concept of intrigue, each a bit harder to swallow than the last. The film is actually quite a heavy experience to watch - not only does it make you think, but as you start figuring out what's going on, your brain will make you feel like you don't WANT to see what's going to happen next - so it's mostly a wholly discomforting, or ""challenging"" viewing - I felt genuinely terrified more than once. It's really impressive. And everything is tied up with a really bleak, disgusting little blood-bow in the end. The vile nature of humanity on full display (if you can comprehend what you just watched - it is clear through some reviews I've read that not everyone understands it).Visually, it's very locked in. There are near-future sci-fi set pieces & props, segments of hallucinogenic hacked-up surrealism, and as I mentioned, some of the most gut-wrenching violence I have seen in a movie in quite some time. It's not for the weak of heart - absolutely not.The whole cast annihilates. Sean Bean was fantastic in his role. Tuppence Middleton was perfect (what a name she has). Christopher Abbott was frighteningly discomforting. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always a pleasure. AND, of course, the new RABBIT'S FOOT of psych-horror, ANDREA RISEBOROUGH, the new queen, apparently has what it takes to bring all new visionary directors from their iffy debuts to making their first masterpieces with their sophomore efforts. First, she did it for Panos Cosmatos with MANDY, and now, she's done it again for Brandon Cronenberg. She is good luck, she is a force of nature, and this movie is a masterpiece.",Possessor

You can see where Cronenberg wants to play with sci-fi, horror and even reality. It's a daring vision and one you won't soon forget (if you have the stomach for it).

67,euroGary,"Style over substance, but definitely watchable",7,22 October 2020,"'Possessor' opens with a young black woman going to a party and committing a particularly bloody murder there. Failing to commit suicide, she is shot dead by police just as her consciousness is extracted from her body, returning to its true home, an older white woman named Vos (Andrea Riseborough). Vos is an assassin, who when assigned a hit 'body hops' into the body of someone who can get close to her target. But when assigned to kill a wealthy businessman (Sean Bean, once again in danger of failing to make it to the end of a film), the choice of his potential son-in-law, Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott, most recently seen by British viewers in 2019's 'Catch-22' mini-series) proves to be a mistake: Colin's consciousness fights back when Vos invades his body.Riseborough is an actress who generally I can take or leave, so it is ironic that in portraying an icy-blooded hitwoman she provides her most human performance: in the climactic scene, when she and Colin tussle for control of the latter's body, she seems so reasonable that the viewer almost wants her to win. Abbott arguably has the more difficult role - having to portray both Colin and Vos-as-Colin; it is difficult to say if he is totally successful, but how do you judge success in a role like that?Writer/director Brandon Cronenberg certainly likes his weirdness (there are lots of hard-to-define images in this) and is liberal in his use of fake blood. Possibly there is slightly too much style over substance in the film, but for the most part I found it an interesting watch, and certainly it is worth repeated viewings. But I would have liked more detail on some points: for instance, Colin's day job seems to involve spying on people's soft furnishings, but surely that can not be the case? Oh, and I could have done without the flabby male nudity! Seen as part of the 2020 London Film Festival.",Possessor

70,fciocca,"An ethereal movie with lots of good ideas, but the development is mediocre and disappointing",5,6 November 2020,"The incipit is really good: an agency that perform contract killings, use a very innovative technology that implants a device on the brain of a designated target that allows to the killer to remotely wire. Therefore the person is replaced, his free will is canceled and the killer is then able to complete the assignment, without being directly involved. The concept is really good, but the movie has a lot of issues.The movie has an ethereal kind of narration, which is a good choice, considering the main theme, but the pace is too slow. The director, which is also the main screenwriter, wanted to experiment, by creating strange effects and applying weird sound design and music, which I personally appreciated, but the story is not going on. There are a lot of stuff that are not explained: we never know what this agency is, why it exists, is it some kind of secret government project? Who are these agents? Why they are doing what they are doing? Do they receive a special training? Because none of this is clarified, I did not care about the context nor characters, I could not bound with them. The main character, Tasya Vos, played by Andrea Riseborough, has clearly some personal issue with the ex fiancée, or maybe husband, I don't get to know, but why her relationship is broken? What happened? Is it because of her job? You see how many questions I am writing in this review? There tons of plot holes.After an interesting and involving intro, the screenplay starts to crumble. I have understood that the director wanted to keep a mistery-vibe, but you cannot keep your audience completely blind for the entire movie. There was a lot of potential, but it was wasted, because the director decided to play too much with visual effects, instead on focusing more on the story.",Possessor

Director: Brandon Cronenburg
Starring: Andrea Riseborough, Christopher Abbott, Jennifer Leigh, Gabrielle Graham, Hanneke Talbot, Sean Bean etcOverall rating 91/100Possessor follows an agents who works for a secretive organization that uses brain implant technology to inhabit other people's bodies ultimately driving them to commit assassinations for high paying clients, but as tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) begins to lose control as she struggles to supress violent memories and urges, she finds herself trapped in the man of a mind whose identity threatens to destroy her. Wow what an amazingly creative and interesting movie possessor was, let's get started on what made this movie something special.First of all, the plot itself was very unique and creative, the cinematography was excellent, as well as the set pieces, use of gore and remarkably interesting and fun set up. The idea was incredibly unique, I rented this movie due to the premise, it was truly something I had never heard of before and its uniqueness and creativity drew me in, and the movie certainly didn't disappoint with a fresh and unique script and story world that was just excellent. The cinematography was genuinely some of the most creative things I have ever seen, the use of colour and props in this movie was astounding and there were some shots involving both of the main characters which have really stuck with me which rarely happens with a movie for me. The set pieces as well were absolutely beautiful, it truly made the movie feel like a really expensive blockbuster movie it was excellent, there was just some truly beautiful set locations that were great backdrops to the fantastic scenes of the movie. The use of gore was also highly effective, the movie was extremely graphic in places and for me it completely worked with what the movie was trying to convey, it made the scenes more powerful and was done to resemble the mental instability of Andrea Risborough's character. I also found the set up for this movie absolutely fantastic, having the movie throw you straight into the action with the movie got me intrigued and wanting to know more about the characters and the plot, it was highly effective and the performance from Gabrielle Graham was fantastic.My next few positives would be the building of tension and uncomfortable tone, the script, performances, and clever plot points. The movie did an excellent job at building tension, the movie had slight hints of the mental instability of Andrea's character through the perspective of the other main character and the use of scenes between both of the characters got more and more intense and the movie just did an excellent job at being wildly unpredictable, The movie also did an excellent job at establishing a very uncomfortable tone the obscene usage of gore and the disturbing cinematography it really got under my skin in the best way possible. I also thought the script was absolutely fantastic, the dialogue was cleverly written and excellently delivered by its actors and it had some really insightful commentary on a lot of things within society that I found really interesting. And the movie just had extremely clever plot points, the movie was like stepping into the future I could see the brain implant technology and where the male main character worked as real things in the future and having Colin's (Christopher Abbott) mental instability reflected with Tasya's was a very clever idea.My two negatives for the movie that stopped it from reaching its full potential would be that the beginning felt rushed and lacked a more in depth look at the story world and plot, and the two main characters lacked depth. For me, the beginning felt slightly rushed, the movie didn't spend enough time developing the story world and plot before diving straight into the main plot point of the movie, it would have been nice to learn more about the antagonists and the characters in general and how the missions worked just to get a more developed story world. I also thought that both of the main characters lacked some character depth, the movie laid out the groundwork for depth to both characters with their families but never truly went all the way, there was depth to how they reacted and their mental battle, but it would have been nice to have been slightly more connected to both characters.My final few positives would be the development of the plot and characters, the clever links between both main characters as well as the powerful ending. I loved how the plot of the movie was structured and how it was developed, having half the movie be normal business for everyone involved and then suddenly have a complete switch with the psychological battle between Colin and Tasya was really well thought out and the development of Colin's character as he slowly was turning into Tasya the deeper he went into her mind was fascinating as we got to learn more about both of the characters at once, this is what made the links between both main characters slow clever, Tasya's unstable and violent thoughts were being conveyed through Colins actions and it was very cleverly written and showed visually as well. I also thought the ending was powerful as well, it was cleverly written, visually stunning and the hidden messages whilst using blood and different characters was ending with the clear different in Tasya's attitude towards death as she cut all personal ties was powerful.Overall, Possessor is one of the most creative and visually striking movies I have ever seen, with excellent attention to details with the script and fantastic performances. Despite sometimes perhaps feeling more like style over substance when it comes to it's characters.",Possessor
73,Rendanlovell,Hm,7,5 May 2020,"This should be retitled,""Too Much but also not enough"". There are so many ideas pulling the movie in so many different directions. It's ideas the movie, but rarely does an idea get fully realized here. This has me torn on how I feel. On one hand, there is a unique tone to this. It's like Assassin's Creed meets inception. People possessing other people's bodies to preform hits on specific people for political or social gain is a solid premise on it's own. Throw in some great ultra violent gore effects, good performances, and some moody, atmospheric music and you get some really striking scenes. On the other hand, the movie is overly ambitious. There's so much it establishes there's no way it can accomplish it all, and it doesn't. This is exemplified in the first act which feels horribly rushed. We get less then 20 minutes establishing characters, premise, and themes. It feels like it can't wait to move through the set up and what results is a lack of investment from me. We hardly know who anyone is or why they are doing anything. The main character is having a psychological melt down as a result from over working inside this possessor machine but she only takes like a half day off to recover. Then she's right back to work. There's barely motivation for this and in her half day off all she does is sit around at home with her ex. You needed more scenes explaining to us what lead to her breaking up with him and more establishment of why she would want to go back to him. We don't know these people or their story and we leave them so quickly it's hard to care about them at all. We literally get one scene of her away from her work, and it's nothing out of the ordinary as far as normal day goes. Why is she a workaholic? Her home life seems fine to me. Why won't she tell her superiors that she's having a mental breakdown? Is it supposed to be a metaphor about her dependency on work to avoid her real life? If that's the case then why don't we get more scenes showing why she would be avoiding her life? It's a messy movie, full of vague characters and even murkier story progression. Even though the first act is rushed, at least it sets some interesting things up. The second act is where the movie really faulters though. It feels like the same scenes happening over and over again. It gets really tedious watching a character saying the possessed person is acting weird over and over. There are some cool, trippy, drug like sequences showing the main character having more internal breakdowns but I got the point after the first time. Yeah she's not stable enough to be in there and the longer she is, the worse it will get. I get it. We don't need to see it 27 times. This is weird because the first act has the exact opposite problem. Like Inception these people are trying to accomplish something by manipulating others for their gain. Unlike Inception, where the first half of the movie is establishing characters, story motivations, and potential speed bumps, Possessor only seems interested in establishing the story speed bumps. We don't get a clear sense of character motivation or why the story is happening in the first place. This possessor company wants to own this large tech company? But why? Who knows! The real story is about the Possessor and the Possessy who go to war over who should have control over the body. So why even mention that they want to absorb this tech company? Instead, say that she needs to kill these people just because they are evil or corrupt. That wouldn't change what the movie is going for and it would clean up the story a bit. The whole point is the struggle between the possessed dude and the possessor and coming to terms with the horrible things that happened. It's kinda like watching someone with split personality disorder. Which, again, is an idea that could've and should've been fleshed out. It only comes up near the end and is wrapped up so quickly I don't know why they even bothered. The first act is completely rushed, the second act is drawn out to no end, and the third act introduces more things it can't quite pull off. So...eh?*2nd viewing edition*
I liked this way more on second watch. Maybe it's the uncut version or maybe I just got it this time. The biggest theme explored is the idea that sometimes it's hard to tell who we really are. Are we so inspired by others to do things that we end up losing our sense of self? You could interpret this as a meditation on mental illness but I see it as every day life. The culture is so saturated by ""hot takes"", opinions, and people ""looking out for our best interest"" that it can truly be numbing. The disassociation we can feel could be as simple as everyday little things to life altering marriage. Who knows if we love them or if someone we love loves them for us. This is all beautifully captured and comes around full circle at the end. Again, it's possible I just didn't get it the first time around but, this uncut version somehow feels tighter. I was transfixed by it. The first act flows nicely, the second act escalates well, and the climax is thoroughly satisfying. Man, I think I feel a third viewing coming...",Possessor

I don't know what the budget was but this film looks amazing. Its probably a mid to mid/low budget movie but it is also very cinematic and would be epic on the big screen. The uncut version holds lots of sexuality and many erect ding dongs. There is also some extremely explicit violence. The kills are placed perfectly through out and the pacing is phenomenal. Chris Abott truly ""kills it"". Brandon Cronenberg takes sci fi horror by the balls as he follows in similar footsteps of his father, but clearly with a modern twist. I liked how this movie takes place in a sort of alternate reality. The director said its supposed to be an alternate 2008. There are retro cars, some retro aesthetics, but it all goes together famously. I couldn't wait to see this movie. I ordered the uncut version on blu ray, and waited for days as UPS failed to deliver the movie on time due to high package volume. Once i received it I couldn't wait to watch it.

With an icky insertion of a control chip in the back of the head, an innocent can be controlled remotely by another, resulting in the perfect, untraceable, suicidal assassin.The possession is tricky though, not a complete one way transferral (the technology of course, isn't foolproof) and there is some glitchy twitches as body and mind vie for control. Interesting stuff. The host and possessor switcheroo gets saucy when female Tasya (Andrea Riseborough) inhabits male Colin, (Christopher Abbott) and tries to pull off all relationship nuances leading up to the job. Brings the ""who are you?"" relationship question to a new level, not to mention the artificial intelligence doom angle all SciFi flicks adhere to.But let's not forget that this is a Cronenberg film, and that means inspite of the cerebral lure, the squeamish need to stay the hell away.

There are a few kills, around eight dead in total, one plus one at the start, one at the middle plus one serious bodily injury (that was supposed to be the most important kill, but fails almost as much as the pretpensions of the movie), and then two in the last third and three more in the end. Five are gun inflicted, but with ample blood splatters nevertheless, and glorious violentia with axes, knives and such bring death to one at the beginning, one is wounded in the middle and two killed at the very end. These are the high points of the movie. You will see stabs of anger, axes which dislodge still moving fingers, some stabs in the neck with spurting arterial juices amidst pools of blood overly abounding. The effects are good, gory but done on a high budget that 80s B-time slashers could not afford, and gratiuitous to boot. You can see the little Crony enjoys himself, as the various possessed individuals go stabby-stabby and smashy-pulpy twisting pole as teeth fly into the air and eyes bleed out under the mighty stab of the angry director. If that is not gratuitious enough, there is some seksi time sprinkled here and there for good amount of wannabe empty transgression. The victims are men, women and children for good measure whilst some are also possessed in order to bring the unstable possessor back into the line of duty. But the so called plot follows mostly one task, failed, and the main problem is that possessor can not make herself pull a trigger on her hosts, whilst having no trouble murdering in the most gruessome ways the others. This plus some light family drama, reminding us that even those soldiers that do similar stuff with CNN God on their side are humans but alas, PTSD. Something like that, this is not a deep movie so do not err giving it too much credit trying to make it more than it is, a neatly packed vehicle for the son of a great director to indulge his teen fantasies of gore and flesh and fleshy members of the elite he very pretpentiously both desipises and belongs to. Whilst his father might have had something meaningful to say, this movie does not, but the emptiness executed with some derivative style might sell for content in the age of woke-elitist despsciable critic circles.

103,RMurray847,Flawed but still very interesting sci-fi shocker,7,11 March 2021,"The premise of POSSESSOR is pretty simple, and it's a pretty nice hook. It's about an assassin (Andrea Riseborough) who does her job by being implanted into the mind of someone else and essentially having that person commit the murder and then commit suicide. The assassin pops back out of the mind, and no one has any idea that what happened was even an assassination and not just a random murder carried out by someone who has simply snapped. The person possessed has their consciousness completely suppressed.Pretty cool! But this process takes a toll on Riseborough, whose own psyche has sustained damage. Is it guilt? Is it numbness? Is it the process itself that takes a physical toll on her brain? Is she just a socio-path? When we see her spent time with her somewhat estranged family, nothing seems right or comfortable. Yet when she's doing her job, nothing seems right there either.The assignment that takes over most of the movie is to inhabit a young man (Christopher Abbott), who is engaged to the daughter of a tech tycoon of some sort (Sean Bean). She is to use this man to kill the tycoon, the daughter and then himself.The movie has ""fun"" with the notion of Risborough inhabiting a man, and also shows us the trickiness of trying to convincingly be a man she does not know and has very little information on. How will he fool the fiance? It's all very interesting, until things go off the rails. I have to hesitate to tell you more, because each viewer should find out for themselves what happens next, and then next and then next.This is a violent film and the murders are fairly visceral, although taken out of context, they are much bloodier than what we might see on some television shows. It's all in the technique. Writer/director Brandon Cronenberg wants to make us really feel the force of these killings. If you have a surround sound system, get ready for your sub-woofer to do extra work conveying the deep notes of a fireplace poker smacking into a skull.Riseborough and Abbott do a great job in this film. She's always interesting, and she is particularly so here. She can be a very glamorous actress, but in this film, she is almost aggressively NOT glamorous. No makeup (and her face is so pale!) and she's allowed to look almost completely haggard. Her huge eyes look terrifying and terrified both. But Abbott, whom I've never given much thought to, I admit, is equally good. Remember, it's HIM playing his character possessed by an assassin...not Riseborough. He does some very subtle work here.The production design is solid. It betrays its low-budget roots, but never in a way that we think the movie was done on the cheap. Lighting and effects are all ""practical"" (no CGI, and little done in post-production). It all serves the overall atmosphere of moral decay.There are some scenes that are set ""in the mind"" of the possessed. They're done very stylishly and with a lot of imagination. They also fail to be very effective. The conflicts playing out there are incoherent, and while I don't need to be spoonfed everything, these critical scenes needed to carry more impact. In the end, they are the least effective parts of the film, and that's a more than tiny flaw.I also have to nitpick Sean Bean's performance. I think Cronenberg wrote a very cardboard villain, and Bean's performance does nothing to overcome that. He overacts mightily and brings no complexity to a film where all other major characters have some depth and layers.I enjoyed the film nonetheless. It's not as creepy as some of its own advertising warns of, but it is a very interesting and well-crafted little film that is at least disquieting. And I never say this, but I really recommend the extra features on this blu ray. There are three brief making-of films here and all are well above average and actually really illuminate the film and point out things you might have missed.",Possessor

I admit I did go into this film with some hope that perhaps the young Cronenberg could live up to the family name in terms of cinematic experience to some degree. I at least hoped that it would be a reasonably good film, my expectations were definitely not all that high. I saw some good reviews, but didn't read them and just went to check it out with an open mind and a little hope. My hopes were unfounded as the film really is nothing to be excited about. In fact, I found the film to be profoundly boring. The story isn't bad really, it's somewhat interesting, but it's delivered in slow motion and with a lot of misplaced weirdness. This coming from a lover of weird films. Luis Buñuel, David Lynch and Federico Fellini are among my favorite all time filmmakers for instance. I've never been a fan of weirdness just for the sake of being weird however. Weirdness needs to be interesting, compelling to at least some degree, not completely pointless. This film seems to focus too much on its weirdness and less on the interesting aspects of the story, and to me, none of the weirdness was of any interest. Brandon may indeed one day be a director worth watching, however today is not the day. To me this film was not even in the same league as Father David's first feature Shivers.

The queasiness that comes from suspected nepotism.Then came this film Possessor. Like most of the great Tarkovsky films, it starts somewhat dull and slow by design. Then, right when you are ready to look away, drop your guard, maybe check the tiny screen on that so called smart phone you are obsessed with, it strikes with a hideous ferocity and tangible poetry. Freeze any frame and you'll find what could be a richly colorful painting and/or a Luscher psych test. You get Stendhaled inside alive. Sewn into the scenes. It will affect your heartbeat and breathing. The story is seamless. It is also cerebral and challenging. It demands attention and participation from the viewer. In its more sudden horrifying scenes I was sort of reminded of Cronenberg the Elder, who also had a way of making the darkness bloom and sing. Though in the majority of the artful, languidly paced scenes Tarkovsky constantly came to mind. Solaris and Stalker specifically. Remember only the boring get bored, and there is far too much happening, way too much visual stimulation for that to go down here.

The uncut is a sci-fi/horror, beautifully crafted tour-de-force of complexity, graphic violence and gore that will test your will and perhaps bend the mind enough to actually get, not only the premise, but at the end of the final act, you feel somewhat rattled and an odd sense of the films relevance, not unlike his fathers filmography.Niche genre, much aligned with Alex Garland in concept, and his fathers stylistic vision and fingerprints are on it, but this is Brandon's baby, and what a baby he has conceived.",Possessor
113,Mike_O_Dwyer,Possessor Uncut: Needs A Sharper Edge.,6,5 October 2020,"This is one of those dialled down chillers that plays out like it wants to be a gritty real-world drama, but has sci-fi underpinnings - which is typical of daddy Cronenberg in the 70s/80s. Possessor plays like a cross between Under The Skin and You Were Never Really Here; the protagonist may as well be an alien hit woman.Where those two films succeed are with UTS's weirdness and YWNRH's tension and mostly unseen brutality. Possessor has the downbeat atmosphere pretty much nailed on, but it struggles with ideas when it comes to depicting the weirdness of being taken over to assassinate an acquaintance and because the brutal attacks are shown in full they are really quite bland compared to YWNRH's violence which mostly takes place off screen and is stronger because of it; anyone who grew up watching Daddy Cronenberg's work won't be shocked by Possessor Uncut's gore.The acting is perfectly fine, but again, everything is very subdued tonally and for that to work there needs to be a a really strong core performance to carry it off. Possessor falls short in terms of having a memorable lead character, and it wheezes a bit in places in terms of pacing - it could easily lose 20 minutes and no one would miss them.If you're looking for a good solid B movie with a throwback style this might just scratch that itch.

I really enjoyed the concept behind this unusual sci-fi horror film.My only criticism is the the script to this movie, which is so u fortunate because it could have been a very easy fix, without really changing at all what happens in the movie. The protagonist is not clear...I believe the man fallen victim to the ""possessor"" is the obvious choice to make the protagonist of this film, but he isn't introduced until halfway through the movie. He makes an excellent flawed protagonist and this should have been used. It doesn't mean the ""possessor"" character can't be explored, even have a revelation, but let's face it. She's the obvious antagonist... and remember, an antagonist doesn't have to be a ""villain"" necessarily. They could have done this and still revealed her boss being the true villain in the end with the semi-twist.It could have been an easy fix. They just needed to introduce that man being possessed earlier on the film and take us on his journey from the get home rather than to just shove him in the middle.Think of the Fly... A movie made by this guy's dad that is AMAZING. Brundle isn't the protagonist. It's his girlfriend. Brundle is an important character, but it's really a love story when it comes down to it... driven by the girlfriend. The fly/mutation is the antagonist getting in the way. In the end, she pulls the trigger and blows his head off. It was all coming down to her in the end. This is why this movie works so well for me. It's tragic.I think this film should have had a similar dynamic... maybe it tried to.. I'm not sure. I just think it needed to be tightened up.That's just my opinion, and what I think is holding back this film from being truly great. Instead, we just get a pretty cool movie with a great concept and some good effects.

The legacy of Cronenberg is not overlooked, but I did just judge this movie based on the same parameters I always do: Story, Acting and filmography. It seems this movie was made solely for the reason to make creation that would continue his dad's legacy, shocking, unorthodox filming (almost intentionally amateuristic) and fit for a film festival but not for wide audience watching.Ok, the idea that this movie is based on (and I don't think I'm spoiling much here) is ""possessing"" another body (by an obscure and unexplained procedure) for the sole reason for that person to commit an ordered murder. Seriously if you had the technology to do that, your best use of it will be to be a contract hit-killer? why not play the stock market? affect world leaders. Contract killing is NOT a good get-rich-quick scheme- try it if you don't believe me. The story is not strong enough to keep any normal human being interested and the unorthodox camera angles and FOV is annoying, not to say displeasing. And no, I don't buy the excuse that it supposed to make you feel bad. Unnecessary blood and nudity shots, it's not scary or compelling, it is basically Garbäge.Anybody that gave this movie a 10 or say it's the best movie they ever watched- please go get your head-checked.

A mixture of veterans, Sean Bean and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and up and coming talent specifically Christopher Abbott, who was awesome in 2019's 'Catch-22'.It seems there is a touch of community nepotism from critics, actors, and even movie goers.

In the near future, assassins are able to take over the body of someone else through a cranial implant. There is a limit on the length one person can spend in someone else's mind and there are inherent dangers in the process for the assassin's own psyche.
Tasya Vos is one of the best due to her skills to possess not just the body but to really blend seamlessly into the life of the chosen possessed.
The process has left her mentally exhausted, she has been creating increasingly violent narratives to play out based on her view of how the possessed life she's taken would really act, rather than simply gunning down the target. She's starting to struggle to pick up her life post extraction as memories blur and mix with her 'real' life.

127,captainpass,"An Exceptionally Dark, Well-Crafted (and Unique) Film",10,18 June 2021,"So with the nod to the fact that this movie is set in a fictional 2008, what first caught my attention was the use in the movie of analog-looking technology for what is really a rather contemporary ""high tech"" premise: Vos / Girder using (glitchy) technology to calibrate the consciousness of the bodies they inhabit in order to conduct for-profit assassinations. For example, about halfway through the film Cronenberg gives us a good look at tools used by Vos to recalibrate her control over the consciousness of Colin. The crudely needle-like device s/he holds has a large potentiometer dial set within some type of leather case. It looks like portable 1980s headphone amp.Given the obvious budget and the exceptionally confident direction and camera work, this throw-back set design is not likely an oversight. My own view is that while the abstract buzzword at work here is ""identity"" of self, the the larger objective is an historical portrait of the control that various technologies have assumed over our lives in the last one-hundred years or so. (The obvious Ingmar Bergman-style example: the media-maker occupying your body, your eyes, your mind to bring his/her vision to life.).The fact then that ""Possessor"" pays to tribute to the video age by making the tools at issue those that look like they could have easily come off of a 1980s Radio Shack shelf is to therefore to make a point about where the problems began and where we are today: television, computers, smart phones producing a present where it is unclear where each of us begin and end. Vos and Colin blend to the point of being differentiated only by mere physicality. The ""soul"" behind each body is compromised, not sure of itself and its own experiences. As a matter of plot, it is this mixing of self and other that allows the possessed (Colin) to turn the trick and become a possessor (Vos), if only temporarily.Cronenberg's vision here is unrelentingly dark: the conflict between the ""real"" and the ""differently real"" is resolved by consuming the former: the literal destruction of one's own flesh and blood. And to what end? Money, presumably. Though even that seems like an afterthought. We exit a film where the inhabited body kills only to return to a present where the possessor is considering her next possession. She is no longer ever truly ""her-self."" And why she would choose to live this way is absolutely unclear.",Possessor

Its trailer really sold me ""Possessor"". Then, after its October release, I read reviews and breakdowns of the storyline, all sorts of exciting comments caught my attention, the likes of ""Brandon Cronenberg is cut from the same cloth as his extremely talented father""; comparisons were drawn with the likes of ""Looper"", ""eXistenZ"", and heck, even ""Inception""; The visual effects department barely relies to any computer generated imagery at all; The film contains this bizarre, organic and bloody imagery that is so reminiscent of David Cronenberg's earlier films; the film intelligently explores themes that are very ""du jour"", such as the underlying risks of constantly evolving technology, and how allowing the wrong hands to pull its strings can lead to a twisted form of puppetry that most cannot even imagine. The list goes on and on, and it sure fostered interest toward this movie as far as I was concerned.""Possessor"" tells the story of Tasya Vos, a woman who works for a company that wealthy clients hire to commit assassinations of high-profile targets. The company uses a technology that certainly is reminiscent of iconic bizarre imagery and sci-fi elements within David Cornenberg's filmography : It allows Tasya to connect to another body into which an implant has been injected beforehand, and take control of that body, which she uses to fulfill her contract, and of which she then must dispose by making that body commit suicide. Since I do not want to give too much away, I will only say that, at some point, as Tasya is possessing another body, things take an unexpected turn.Besides the fact that there are various obvious similarities with themes that were so dear to Brandon Cronenberg's father, more importantly (I think!), there are also various reminiscent story codes at the very core of the fictional universe that is on display such as how the abuse of this ""organic technology"" ends up destroying both the minds and bodies of its users. The parallel with ""eXistenZ"" immediately comes to mind, and so is the case with ""The Fly"", ""Videodrome"" and ""Scanners"". Let's make it clear, though, that ""Possessor"" clearly draws us into a world that is closer to the one we know, at least in depiction, than what David Cronenberg's marquee sci-fi films have got us accustomed to.""Possessor"" never over explains things. I think this is a bit of a double-edged sword that may please some viewers and upset others, as there are certain layers of complexity within the story that are somewhat reminiscent of ""Inception"". But unlike Chris Nolan's film, Cronenberg does not dedicate twenty minutes or so to showing characters walking through demonstrations of the particularities of the world he's creating, or explicitly explaining how the technology that is core to the story works, or the origin and reason for every tiny related detail (artifacts, implants, etc.). Instead, it lets the viewer put all the pieces together, hopefully well enough to get the idea at a more general, ""big picture"" level. As I said, I'm fine with it, but I can understand the complaints from other viewers too, especially given how much time is spent on a few other aspects that could either have been toned down (i.e., the extended sequences of extreme violence, for instance) or simply shortened (i.e., certain scenes involving Colin's entourage that do not really contribute to character development) without compromising the quality of the film and storytelling. It doesn't feel like any of the above was done at the expense of something else in particular, though, but it could have been time spent on providing the audience a better grasp on this somewhat intangible and bizarre universe in which it is set to spend a hundred minutes, and be more immersed meanwhile.Cronenberg's direction is superb, allowing this nightmarish journey to unfold in a manner that is just as oddly beautiful as it is terrifying. I particularly enjoyed all the distorted, lurid imagery and those fascinating and psychedelic sequences when the technology operates and Tasya transitions into another human body. What makes it even more impressive is that this was apparently achieved without relying to CGI, and it shows...in a really good way. Cronenberg also plays a lot with symmetry and asymmetry in the framing of his shots, and uses some slow and hypnotic camera movements, which really help create a unique atmosphere. Needless to say, he is a talented director with great visual flair. The ambient-type soundtrack aligns perfectly with the bizarre and nightmarish situations and settings, and makes for quite an interesting sensorial experience throughout.As a fan of practical makeup and gore effects, ""Possessor"" was a ton of fun to watch, and those practical effects showing the human body seriously damaged in all sorts of imaginable ways are incredibly effective. Some of the kills on display in this film had me wincing, at times, from being so nasty. It will be off-putting to some viewers, and understandably so, but the violence is an integral part of the story, and I'm glad to see that it was not delivered through a plethora of goofy-looking CGI blood spurts and splats. Personally, I did not mind how graphic it was, although I thought it might have been overstretched in terms of screen time, in proportion with how important it is as a theme within this story, and how other much more central themes do not appear to get such a preferential treatment as far as screen time is concerned.The cast is all-around great, with Andrea Riseborough as Tasya Vos, and Christopher Abbott as both Colin Tate and Colin Tate's body possessed by Tasya. Riseborough feels truly invested in her performance, and Abbott does a really good job bringing to life two characters within the same body, literally. You can tell when he's Colin, and when he's Tasya. Jennifer Jason Leigh is also pretty damn creepy in the supporting role of an executive from the company that employs Tasya.Now, on the downside, I wish there would have been a more significant amount of character development involved, although what is actually to be found is coined beautifully. And the limited amount of character development that ""Possessor"" includes really serves the story tremendously. The ending, especially, speaks volumes on that, and is as powerfully symbolic yet subtle as the ending in ""A History of Violence"", another film indeed directed by Cronenberg the father. Nevertheless, as a viewer, I have to admit that this deficiency prevented me from being emotionally attached to any of the characters. I do have this feeling, however, that this was exactly Brandon Cronenberg's intention.Overall, ""Possessor"" is a visually enthralling, nightmarish motion picture that tackles the fascinating and current topic of how dangerous technology could become (especially in the wrong hands), and successfully spins it to create a fine blend of sci-fi, thriller and horror. Despite a few deficiencies in the writing department, where it feels like certain propensities could be harnessed to his advantage in the future, Brandon Cronenberg truly delivered with ""Possessor"", and proved that everyone, especially genre fans, can expect great cinema from this filmmaker.",Possessor

Not necessarily, but your enjoyment of this movie will vary significantly depending on your taste. Possessor is a slow movie and there is no explanation that is spoon fed to the audience once you hit the end credits. I will say I enjoyed Possessor's ingredients of disturbing visuals and graphic violence. The violence is not frequent but when it happens it is bloody and may make your jaw drop a few times. It reminded my of Nicolas Refn's Drive when the killings do happen in Possessor. Some of the dream-like sequences are truly disturbing and will make you say wtf out loud. As for the story I don't want to give to much away but it takes a few interesting turns and demands your attention. If you end up enjoying Possessor then another viewing will fill in some gaps. Possessor is slow, graphic and not for everyone but I found the story/premise interesting enough to hold my attention throughout. Honestly, Possessor is messed up and I appreciate Brandon Cronenberg sticking with his vision and giving the audience a truly disturbing experience. If you can stick with Possessor you may enjoy it, even love it. Pay attention in the beginning of the film when Vos is describing how she feels about killing the butterfly when she was little.

134,TheLegendOfThe42,"Filmmaking skills are not inheritable, it seems",5,13 January 2021,"I do understand that being a world famous director's offspring can be challenging, especially if you decide to make a career in the same field. It's quite unfair to be compared to the great David Cronenberg, and after seeing this movie, I'm confident to say that Brandon Cronenberg will never reach the level of his father. A tragedy in the making.That being said, the first act of POSSESSOR is actually very decent, despite artsy-fartsy camera wiggling and overly shallow depth of field. The first fifteen minutes do a very good job of introducing the characters, the world, the whole situation in a pretty adult, straight and gory fashion. Promising, indeed.From then on, the film becomes a parade of pacing problems and self-indulgent edginess that demonstrate the director's struggle to stay on top of things. POSSESSOR is a terribly unbalanced film that seems to forget what it actually is about at times. I appreciate the boldness to show excessive violence and unfiltered naked bodies, but I still need a purpose for those things. Sadly, I didn't see the real point here.Also, I think I can't bear to see Christopher Abbott's face anymore. Especially the second act made it a point to show us a close-up in every way possible, and I wasn't even sure anymore who this film is about. Got me there, Brandon.It's still a competently made film, though. The in-camera FX were very nicely done, the acting ranging from quite good to excellent. Unfortunately, most of this becomes meaningless if the script doesn't deliver a solid blueprint, and this one really didn't. The premise is intriguing, but that's about it.Additionally, the score was pretty bland and generic, further adding to the pretty shallow quality of the film. Slow pans with boring ambient music aren't exactly cutting edge anymore. And I'd argue they never were in the first place.If the premise would have been handled by a better writer, this could have been quite something.

135,benm-41751,Unsettling,3,19 October 2020,"This movie is unsettling. To its credit, that is partially due to its commitment to the relentlessly bleak and bloody life of Tasya, a woman whose job is to use a strange machine that lets her inhabit other people's bodies to carry out violent assassinations. The film truly conveys the dread of an alternate universe where such a thing exists. The audience is in a strange position at the edge of the seat waiting to see how this woman and her overlords' missions go, yet also wondering if we should be hoping for their own demise given the immorality of their scheme. It doesn't help that Tasya herself seems perturbed about her own actions.Unfortunately, the film is also unsettling for a number of negative reasons. Firstly, it is grotesque. It features ridiculously gory violence and pornographic imagery, including a scene where a child is shot and killed and highly explicit sex scenes. These kinds of elements can be appropriate when crafting a film, but the creators of this film are highly egotistical to think that they have the skill to use these elements as anything more than shock value.Secondly, the actual writing of the film is lazy. It is premised on a fascinating science-fiction concept of using technology to control other people and have them carry out violence for you, but that is the only substance to the film. None of the people in the film seem like living humans; they are just there to either kill or be killed. There is no way to connect with or care about anyone in the film, except when you feel sorry for them being brutalized so viciously or wish they would stop committing such heinous acts. Very few things are justified in the movie. Why, in a world that mostly seems to be just like our own, do they have this incredible ability for one person to take control of another's body? Who exactly is doing this? How would this be worth it, given the monetary, legal, and ethical liabilities? Why would anyone agree to do this? Why does no one notice? Why are the victims left alone so much, without anyone there to help them? This mystifying world is actually just an empty world, like a notepad with only two pages of notes and the rest is blank.Finally, the movie veers into government-granted film student cheese. While it is stylisticly interesting in some ways, it also features a constant soundtrack of grating royalty-free ""creepy"" music and features a lot of ""eerie"" filler footage. At the supposed climax, it devolves to the point of plopping loud, scary sounds onto otherwise laughable scenes with melting masks and spooky scenes flashing by.Possessor is highly dedicated to some sort of goal to unsettle us.

It might be one of the best opening sequences of the year.For a low budget indie flick, the effects were stunning.

Cronenberg also crafts a film that is as violent as his father's films. Eastern Promises was probably the most violent Cronenberg film, and it is nice to see some of that DNA weaved into this film. It is is unflinchingly violent and very hard to watch at many times. It's slow build to these violent acts end up paying off in the end thanks to clear character motivations.My issue with the movie is that SEAN BEAN DOESN'T DIE!!! Nah just kidding. If I had one issue with it, it would be that while motivations are clear and of course this is a low stakes, not as bombastic as big budget movies plot, the plot felt a bit weak. It never felt like it amounted to anything.Full YouTube review come soon",Possessor
141,daniel-kyle,"Cronenberg Mk. 2, but not a knock-off!",10,3 March 2021,"First thing: when you are the son of Canada's most famous director, you get compared to him - unfortunately. There is no indication that Brandon Cronenberg ever benefitted from nepotism however. He created his own path from what I read in his bio. That said, I'm sure he loves and admires his father. And no doubt, the feeling is reciprocal.
Now, this movie. Wow! I'm not even going to touch on the plot. However, it is the most original and best looking movie that I have seen in years, and the music makes it even more atmospheric in key scenes. If I was a filmmaker, this is the movie that I would strive to make.
There is not a weak point in it. And it all comes from the writer-director himself. I suggest not trying to over-analyze the story and figure out every detail of the plot and characters, this movie is best absorbed intuitively. As they say: analysis kills the artist.
One last note though - there IS an interesting David C. connection: the 1999 film of his, Existenz, also starred Jennifer Jason Leigh, as a character named Geller (here in Possessor, she is Girder). Leigh was also in the recent movie Annihilation where she had a similar role, and that film is one of the closer ones in comparison to what we see happening here, though I did not like the movie Annihilation much, since the book was far superior, but that was not really the fault of director Garland who only had the first part of the Southern Reach Trilogy to work from.

Best viewed knowing as little about it as possible.Also, would highly recommend finding the 'real' copy of the movie. The version on Amazon isn't the original and some of the nudity and the worst of the violence is removed.It's still very violent, but most of the missing graphic scenes are actually contextually important, it's not really like something like Hostel or Saw where it wouldn't really make any difference on your perception of the film or the story.I was incredibly disappointed to have seen the edited version first, and then the original, which is how the director intended for it to be seen.I can understood to a degree the nudity being removed as what's altered is some very explicit material, but I thought we were past the days of censoring violence.The difference is quite noticeable and without going into spoiler territory the original is far more effective to the narrative.",Possessor

Knowing Brandon Cronenberg, I was a little confused, and was not sure at the time he was even directing films. However, I remember seeing this film's poster a few times a couple months back and being eerily curious- I never got around to it until recently! Look, to be quite honest, this is an artsy indie horror film. It's not going to appeal to the mass majority of people because of how über violent and unique it is. The premise itself is awesome sci-fi horror, mixed with this grim premise of a assassin's career and what it can do to their psyche. It's a great movie, but it's not going to impress most people. If you enjoyed films like The Lighthouse or Midsommar, you'd probably really like this movie and find it intriguing enough to sit through.

Week in, week out, month in, month out, year in, year out, a bunch of lousy, forgettable movies, but the acting was good.

In this movie, don't care about any of the characters, don't care about anything that happens, and I guarantee twenty seconds after I'm finished writing this review, I will thankfully forget this movie completely and forever. Oh, but the acting was good. Uh huh.Funny, but from where I come from, if a movie stinks or is average or forgettable, I hold everyone responsible, including and perhaps especially the actors. I mean, maybe the movie would have been better except for the actors, anyone ever think of that as being the possibility? Yet that's hardly ever put forward. Again, what is the definition? That they didn't forget their lines? That they managed to get a take where they didn't either break out laughing, or crying, that they're starring in this piece of garbage? That has to be at least eighty percent of all this good acting going on around the world, that they showed up on time and didn't burp.Just as an example in comparison, it's funny but I never have to say about the Godfather, or any classic, oh, well, what a lousy movie, but the acting was pretty good. Similarly I never have to say the opposite, oh, well, the movie might have been pretty good, except for all that lousy acting going on - I mean come on, Pacino, Brando, Cazale, Shire, Keaton, Caan, what a bunch of hacks, couldn't they do any better than that?But I'm sure it will all continue, week in, week out, month in, month out, year in, year out, lousy, forgettable movie after lousy, forgettable movie, oh, but the acting, that was just amazing.Whatever.",Possessor

Honorable mention to Panos Cosmatos who has dipped into the genre in the past; this movie is similar in tone to a Cosmatos film.This is a menacing piece of provocative work by Brandon Cronenberg that rewards the viewer for their investment. It's one layered with meaning and information that requires your full attention and repeat viewings, but one that isn't a chore to watch despite its brutality.

Tasya Vos (played by Andrea Riseborough) is an agent that works for a secret agency, that has the ability to overtake the mind of humans using a brain implant. You see Vos (as Tasya is known) in the body of a host, while inside the host's mind, she controls the brain and bodily functions of that person, allowing her to get close to the real objective of assassination. The first mission you see is a success and gets pulled out by the agency. She is then assessed by Girder (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh). Once Vos passes the evaluation, she is free to go back to her normal life.
The issues then begin to show, she starts having flashbacks/glitches. She asks the agency for another job, when really the problems she is having should be sorted, but she decides to keep these from them. We then see that next job play out, as she becomes the ""Possessor"" of Colin Tate (played by Christhopher Abbott)
I thought that it was a very slow starter but the action, violence and blood do come. I weirdly enjoyed the concept of the movie. I do like the first scene that Vos is in Colin's body, all i will say, in the bathroom, pj bottoms on, realising you (as a woman) are a man!",Possessor

169,nellz_nivlecn,Started out strong,6,8 November 2020,"The movie is about implanting another person's consciousness into another person with the objective of killing without a trace.
The main character named Tasya Vos, she's the top killer agent in her company. Not a lot went into her backstory, we do not know what was her motive or drive into doing this line of work, what we as the audience knew about Vos was that she started unraveling and became unstable at her job possibly due to many of possessing other person's body. But she hides this from her boss and continue with the next mission. This part of the movie, the introduction of our main character and the establishment of plot point was interesting. From the very opening act up until this point, the atmospheric feels is very thick, with jarring and eerie score. The cinematography and the coloring for this movie was briliantly done. The problem started with the second act, when Vos was implanted into the next target Tate. It got considerably slow and dull at times. It was so slow that it got tedious and dare I say boring. Although there is some great imaging sequence here and there, still the plot slowly advance. Also, going in from the very beginning, this movie wasnt shy about how explicit the violence could be, and yet I was caught off guard with how gory and violently violent THAT scene was. This scene was not for the faint hearted wimp like me. Until this scene then it dawned on me, this wasn't just a science fiction movie, this was a horror movie.
The conclusion of the plot was... unsatisfactory? Also left me with more questions about Vos's motive, like what's her deal? WHY WAS SHE DOING THIS WORK? All in all, I hate the violent aspect of this movie, love the unsettling eerie atmosphere, love the premise, Love the first act. Especially love the performance as Tasya Vos, credit for the actress!Will I recommend this movie to other people? Probably yes depend on the person, I could see this movie will not work for the general audiences as it could looked a lot like arthouse kind of movie.

And this causes many problems for her....This is a very provocative film. The depiction of the murder is very graphic- brutal and disturbing & there are scenes with nudity. Not only the murder or s*x scenes, but there are other disturbing scenes on the movie. There is a scene where Tate takes over his body and, he gets to see Vos's memory. The directors' depiction- Tate wears the mask of Vos and experience the exact same situations Vos experienced. - One of the most disturbing moments of the film!At the same time, the film is great on a visual standpoint. The use of red, blue lights on occasions is great & there are great shots throughout the film.There are a lot of usage of flashy images - it adds to the confusing feeling of the film.The score is fantastic - it adds to the atmosphere of the film.

The doctor and the whole organization lacks depth and motive. Yeah, they get paid... But who sanctions their operations? Are we to believe any corporation can do this without supervision, without competition? It's childish if not plain stupid. The third act which is supposed to suck us into the inner conflict of Tasya is so uninteresting that you can skip directly to the end, because there is no resolution, no big reveal whatsoever.

186,Shewattsi,An internal struggle taken to a new level,8,28 November 2020,"This is my second Brandon Cronenberg film, I watched Antiviral a few weeks back and have to say I'm enjoying his work.
Possessor takes the grotesque theme of humans enmeshed with each other and machinery and spits out a simultaneously slow paced yet nail biting sci-fi film. Both lead actors play the idea of possessor and possessed fantastically, in the latter half of the film I was genuinely on edge trying to guess which character had won the fight for supremacy.
The ending (I won't ruin it) felt like a punch to the gut, so emotionless which made it all the more horrifying.
At under two hours long, I would recommend this to anyone wanting a film that merges the boundaries of sci-fi and horror, and does so in the least flashy or blockbuster was possible. A big tick from me.",Possessor

It looks great, is full of fantastic performances, and has some really intriguing ideas and themes. My criticisms lie mostly in some of the story-telling aspects as well as the excessive violence (at least in the director's cut, which was the version I watched). I wish the film had delved more into the world and had fleshed out some of the characters a little better. I also felt that, for a film that is ultimately about the negative effects of a violent life, the movie tends to revel too much in it's gore. As someone that enjoys a good gore-y film, I actually felt that some of the scenes in this film bordered on excessive and mean-spirited and stood in direct opposition of the director's intent. Having said that, this is still a really solid, refreshing horror film and I would definitely recommend checking it out.",Possessor

I actually expected something in the lines of what David Cronenberg did when he started. Somewhere near Crimes from the Future and Stereo, with maybe a mix of eXistenZ. And of course the visuals from the trailer and the presence of Andrea Riseborough convoked the visually stunning Beyond the Black Rainbow from Panos Cosmatos (because she played in his subsequent movie Mandy). And I have to say, Brandon Cronenberg did not disappoint by delivering a great mix of just that, with that unique canadian feel. I was first amazed by the set where the first scenes take place, and then completely at home with the montage, effects and concept of the story. The long ""dive"" sequence surely again make me think of an updated version of the somewhat similar nightmarish dive in BTBR. Definitely something I'll enjoy rewatching. I would have loved for the story to dive deeper in this and have a broader spectrum, move forward with what was showed in the end, and have something even more creeper to offer, because it showed and explained so much that it could have built on it even further.

the cinematography, sound mixing, and editing were superb. every detail felt purposeful. i felt like i was part of this bad trip. i was the possessed unable to control the chaos around me.
for only being in the first few minutes gabrielle graham left a huge impact on me. the emotional range she shows in the opening scene was outstanding. i hope to see more of her on my screen. andrea riseborough is such a chamaeleon. almost unrecognizable in every role i see her in. she just becomes the character and delivers truly believable performances. chris abbott truly stole the show for me though. i was reminded of his role in piercing. he does great at playing someone so subdued yet erratic. i literally can't stop thinking about it.

There is one idea. It's not a bad idea and it could have been developed into a reasonable story, which may have made a movie.

I say needlessly gory because that sort of operation in truth would need to be done by a skilled brain surgeon. Instead, it looks like it was performed by an amateur handiman. Thus, although it's gory, it is completely unbelievable.Character development is almost completely lacking. There's a bit of information exchange when preparing to target the next victim. Apparently, although the possessor can target a victim and control them, they nevertheless have no access to their life experiences, etc. - until, contradictorily, later in the film, when they are mixed together.There's an odd scene that I still haven't figured out where the possessor, occupying the body of a victim goes to his job site. What in the world is his job? Apparently, it's identifying curtains, blinds, etc., while trying to ignore pornographic scenes.

I really, really love the category of movies this one falls into. There are not many of its kind to my knowledge.Similar movies that come to mind would be ""Only God Forgives"" or the remake of ""Susperia"" and ""The Perfection"".The Visuals are on point, the gore is great, the characters are interesting and the whole time you have this eerie obsession in finding out all there is to find out and see what the story unfolds into. I have seen this movie 3 times now and every viewing was a different kind of pleasure. Overall I'd say the second viewing was the best experience.Do not watch this movie, if:You are easily disturbed by gore or other depraved themes.You do not like to put in the effort and use the room for interpretation given to the viewer. (There are long scenes, where a character for example just stares into a mirror, during which you as the viewer have time to reflect upon what happened in the scene before and make up your mind on what must be going through the head of said character.)You like fast-paced movies that are mostly story and dialogue driven.You need your setting to be realistic, even if that means just well explained within the universe the movie created. In this case you will get the basic premise and have to accept the ""rules"" of this world, because the movie has another focus than explaining everything.Realistically this movie would be a 9, but since it is one out of a few among its genre it stands out as a flat 10 to me.Don't listen to the reviews that call this boring, if you are into slow movies that put art over plot.",Possessor

And yet, somehow, it managed to turn out mediocre in every sense, except for its gore.Even the artistic imagery, which is arguably the strongest aspect of the movie, doesn't seem too original. Nicolas Winding Refn and Panos Cosmatos come to mind, especially Cosmatos' ""Mandy"", also starring Andrea Riseborough. I swear if someone showed me dreamy sequences from both ""Mandy"" and ""Possessor"" - I would have had hard time guessing which is which.Since there is no character development, by the time gory scenes come up, they don't affect you on the emotional level; they just make you physically sick. After that - the snoozefest continues and once again you're stuck with surviving, yet utterly lifeless characters, as they drag themselves on from one scene to another.At one point, it seemed it would tackle philosophical notions of free will and identity more seriously, but, alas, that story gets dropped almost as soon as it starts. The lines between identities do get blurry from time to time, but it is resolved pretty quickly and in a way that leaves no room for further exploration of the matter.""Possessor"" could have become an instant classic, had its dread originated from the existential aspect of the story.

I just don't really understand what this movie is supposed to be. Is it a violent B-movie gore fest or one of those arty films that only a few people ""get""?
The script is almost nonexistent and what little dialogue there is is delivered by characters that seem to be either stoned or on the verge of nodding off.
There's no character development so you end up just not really caring what happens.
What I found most infuriating is that it could have been a great film. The idea is really interesting but they don't really explore it. Who are these assassins? Where do they come from? Do they work for a government or just whoever pays? Why is the main character losing the plot? Is it a side effect of the job or something else?

Brandon Cronenberg takes this philosophy to it's logical extreme with 2020's greatest horror film, Possessor. We are dropped into a world of mind control and corporate assassins, but those high concepts aren't explored here - Cronenberg rightly assumes we will be able to relate much more readily to Andrea Riseborough's protagonist Tasya Vos, and instead tells us a troubling tale of her unhealthy work-life imbalance and manipulative employer. And since this is a horror movie after all, he treats us to plenty of blood and gruesome practical effects along the way.",Possessor
254,Bughuul,Deeper Synopsis explanation attempting to avoid spoilers,8,16 November 2020,"My Synopsis--
Andrea Riseborough plays (Tasya Vos) the agent, who is employed by (Girder's) Organization played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. The Organization uses brain implants to inhabit pre-selected civilian bodies in order to control their behavior and make them commit acts of ultra-violence and assassinations. This Organization is funded by high-paying clients. This particular story focuses on (Vos) inhabiting the body of (Colin Tate) played by Christopher Abbott. (Vos) has shown she has a couple of quirks when the simulation is running. She is much more violent that what the mission entails, as well as struggles with her exit strategy of the simulations. We're only shown a single simulation prior to the film's main sequence. The mission is for (Vos) to assume the role of (Colin) and convince his girlfriend (Ava Parse) played by Tuppence Middleton, that he is a worthy boyfriend to be accepted by her Father (John Parse) played by Sean Bean. (John Parse) is the CEO of a data-mining company that someone has paid big money to (Girder's) Organization to infiltrate the ranks and takeover. During this process (Colin) slowly begins to become aware something isn't right, and struggles with visions during his possession by (Vos) and attempts to regain control, making it very difficult for (Vos) to compete the mission. Meanwhile, back at home (Vos's) husband (Michael) played by Rossif Sutherland and their son (Ira) played by Gage Graham-Arbuthnot are completely unaware of (Vos's) true occupation. It's mentioned during an interview with (Girder) that (Vos) and her Husband (Micheal) are separated, assuming that her job took a toll on the relationship. (Girder) also reveals during another interview that she was once a possessor, but age has taken it's toll on her ability to continue. (Girder) also alludes to the Organization standing to outright own the company they are attempting to infiltrate. (Vos) hides some of the affects this possession takes from her, almost like the process is starting to crumble and not take hold any longer. She never shares these instances with (Girber) leading the viewer to believe that there is a duty that (Vos) feels she has to prove to (Girber) that she's always ready for a new job. (Girber) admits at once point in an interview session that (Vos) is her star performer. There is no reference at any time of other possessor's team within the Organization other than plotters that will do research prior to a mission taking place.Actor performances-
Tasya Vos - B - It seemed to me she had run too many missions
Girber - A - Good pressure boss, explained things clearly
Colin Tate - C - Seemed always ""stuck"" in completing his tasks
Michael Vos - B - Small role, but ending made up for it
Ira Vos - C - Only a single scene where he redeemed himself
Ava Parse - A - Nailed the rich entitled drug-party heiress role
John Parse - B - Nailed the pompous-bullish, successful CEO roleStory-
I was really excited on the premise of this film. As a long standing fan of Horror and Sci-Fi, I think this film manages to pull off both to excite either viewer of their favorite genre. You're in for a treat if you like both! I've never really seen an idea for film like this before, much less pull it off completely with no plot holes. I will admit, narration through the film could have been better as to what the heck was going on at times, but I chalked that up to some of the science shown on-screen wasn't supposed to be fully understood by the viewer. I really liked that the character Vos has a darker side than she was fully willing to admit to Girber, and the ending scene there's a small difference between interview #1 and #2 that if you catch it, seals the film as a winner.Rating-
This film is a strong R. It has gratuitous use of nudity, sexual scenes, illicit drug use, language and ultra-violence level gore. Not kid friendly. This would be okay for a Teen, around aged 16-17 depending on the maturity level. It left me feeling a bit unweary on the lingering effects of the ultra-violent parts. Make no mistake, I liked them, but the thoughts lingered well beyond the film cut to credits with me. I feel this was a solid 8 stars for attempting to pull off something akin to The Matrix, Inception and Jason Bourne movies all-in-one. At no time did it feel ""scary"" I think the Horror side was gore-only. Good film by Brandon Cronenberg. I wish him the best in the future, and sadly it appears this film has no mention of nominations. Which I think is a shame. It's a very tough pitch to make in general dealing with Horror movies are already at a -25 in score to critics, since most feel like they need to be ""scared"" in order for the movie to qualify for Horror. I disagree, I believe modern horror can take two forms. Scares and Gore. This film does gore in spades.",Possessor

The main character was so unlikeable and un relatable (her motives for doing the things she did didn't make sense at all for me) that it was impossible to root for her.

The way it is staged, the annoying background music, the explicit murder scenes with far too much blood, make the film difficult to teach even for the horror genre. I do not recommend it.",Possessor
258,octoberorison,"Chilly, Violent, and Pretty Fantastic",8,14 May 2020,"Possessor reminds me of an ultra-violent combination of Inception and Looper.It's about an assassin who uses body-hoping technology to kill her targets before terminating the body she's co-opted.The movie does not do a lot of explaining, we open up with an assassination in a swanky hotel where one of the staff is manipulated to kill a guest before security guards gun her down.Then we see the protagonist (I use the word loosely) Taysa Vos, played by Andrea Riseborough, was controlling the body of the killer from a safe distance. Vos works for a secretive company that offers these kind of closed-loop assassinations. Side bar: Taysa Vos sounds like it could be a name from the Star Wars universe, or is it just me?The process of changing bodies seems to take away from her sense of self. She takes a test after each job where she recognizes objects from her past and identifies the one that doesn't belong. When she visits her family, she has to practice sounding like herself -- as if she's rehearsing lines.What follows is a kaleidoscope of violence and surreal, dreamy imagery filmed in a cold, deliberate style. Lots of indie movies today go for this kind of neon/midnight movie mixed with Kubrick aesthetic, but Possessor pulls it off better than most.Vos is supposed to possess the body of Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) to murder his girlfriend and her CEO father (Sean Bean) before offing himself to tie up the loose end.It goes wrong, but not in the way I expected. I'd recommend this to people who enjoy mindbenders along the lines of Primer, Triangle, or Upstream Color and can put up with a bit of seize-in-your-seat gore.",Possessor

But when it comes time to pull out, she can't pull the trigger.If we assume that she has done many missions, shouldn't she be used to pulling the trigger? Later, we're shown she has what it seems to be cramping in her right fingers. After finishing her mission and when it comes time to pull the trigger, lo and behold... she can't pull the trigger again. No matter how she puts the gun in her mouth or to the side of her head, her right fingers can't do it.Guess what?! There's something called a left hand. I'm not a film analyst but, assuming she's not afraid of going home, her left hand is more than capable of pulling the trigger. But she doesn't even make a single attempt to hold the gun with the other hand...I agree a lot with what others say: there's a lot of ideas here BUT the execution (and maybe budget) didn't make the movie into something great.

We do feel a bit for one of the central characters but the second, arguably more interesting character is truly short-changed... a great pity due to a really impressive performance.The shooting style screams low budget and the unorthodox framing and handheld look never find a good balance.

It immerses the viewer in an alt-future of bleak, often hateful existentialism, it's clever plot avoiding every possible contrivance to do exactly what it needs to, and to the most intense degree.This us all presented through the lens of a desperately unhinged protagonist, who's motives only become clear to us as they begin to for her.If a film paints itself as violent and I don't feel physically sick at least once, I feel cheated.

The storyline took a while to get but once you got it a third of the movie in you kinda wonder the possibilities of the movie, i would have liked a little more pazzaz, action, but it felt ok nothing amazing. As for if I would buy this and show to others, i would probably want to buy it once it becomes cheap, this does feel like the kind of movie that isn't really a big title. The company behind the movie I haven't really heard of, its a Canadian company so that probably does help. If there movies are like this i can say they surly have a different taste for what they consider scary to be. I wouldn't mind showing this to other people but it isn't on the top of the list and doesn't really show anything amazing with picture, maybe sound in some parts of the movie but again nothing really stands out. The reason why i like the movie is the ideas behind it and how the movie feels like a soft indie short film but with some good directors and again storytelling the movie i enjoyed. I'd give it an overall ranting of 7/10 i did notice 3 people of 2 groups did leave before the movie ended so i can see how some might have felt it was too boring, to gross, or not interesting enough, so your kinda split between liking it or not. I wouldn't go as far as saying i loved it. This has been my soft review of Possessor.",Possessor

294,mmancha-35792,An Overall Failure,2,14 October 2020,"Look, I'm not some prestigious movie reviewer for any magazine or website that claims to be the end all be all of cinematic opinions. All I can say is that I've seen a lot of movies and I can tell the difference between a good one and a bad one. This movie is a bad one.I might as well start with the good things this movie was able to accomplish, as there are a few. The special effects were awesome, truly something to marvel as everything felt pretty real and accurate when it comes to gore. It was visually striking and was shot pretty well. The acting was pretty decent as well for the most part. Christopher Abbott is a very skilled actor and is shows in this movie, I would argue he was the saving grace since the rest of the cast was nothing to write home about.The rest of the movie can only be described as murder porn mixed with actual porn lightly topped with a plot that remained largely unexplored. The sex scene make up probably about a third of this movie and is purely tasteless and leads to absolutely nothing. Usually sex scenes lead to character building or progression of the plot, which is not the case for this movie as it seems they're only present to please the director and a few creeps that watched this alone in the theatre. There are a few scenes in this movie that are just literal porn. I cannot stress this enough, its just porn.There's also a ton of unnecessary gore scenes that only serve to shock people into reaction because the writing failed to do so on its own. The main character appears to not enjoy killing people in this movie (which makes sense and can lead to a thicker and richer plot) yet for some reason always chooses the most traumatic and barbaric ways to kill people. It makes no sense and is never explained. She has PTSD and hates killing people, she also has a gun to kill people quickly... lets just have her kill him with a fireplace poker in the most gruesome Evil Dead way possible. This movie is not Evil Dead, it wants to take itself so seriously and yet it seems as though the director reached peak creative maturity in middle school and wrote the movie strictly for those who carry the same mentality. The ending was pure confusion and its clear the director had no clue how to end his own movie.This movie has great scores across the board. I truly for the life of me cannot understand why. Its clear that movies have had a strict decline in quality over the past few years, yet movies like these still get great reviews. Its like solid writing and interesting, well explored plots has been replaced with relentless confusion and overly ridiculous concepts yet somehow people are receptive of this. Movies are dying and were just letting it happen.",Possessor
295,terrylynnmercer,Left in the middle...,2,23 October 2020,"While the overall artistry of the film was something interesting to see, like a disturbing Billie Eilish music video, the character development lacked any real substance of any true emotional human incarnation. There was nothing keeping us invested in the storyline, that we awkwardly had to leave in the middle of the movie.",Possessor
296,wtina-54400,"Clear to see where they got the inspiration from, a shame.",6,4 November 2020,"Not going too much into detail, but this movie certainly borrows heavily from the 1995 Ghost In The Shell anime by Mamoru Oshii. Hacker(s) taking control of other people. False or implanted memories.
For me personally it was a bit too obvious where they got their inspiration to experience the movie as original or very good.I am not going to pretend like there aren't at least a dozen other films who do or try to do the same, but when you also take into account that the music at times (the modernized/distorted female high pitched choire) is a direct ripoff of Kenji Kawai's Ghost In The Shell original score, then the picture is complete.Luckily the movie tries to bring in it's own ideas, especially on a psychological level. At times it's a very unpleasant, dark and gruesome watch. Especially the violence can get to stomach-turning levels.
Personally I appreciated the dark and raw style, we need more unapologetic movies like this.All in all not a bad movie, just a shame it's so obvious to see where they got some of the main ideas for the plot.",Possessor
297,shawnborucki,Son vs Father,6,8 November 2020,"Brandon versus David and Goliath. Possessor is a film of what the protégé learned from the master. While Brandon keeps in line with David for the corporate influences, (Existenz, bending fictional worlds with reality, Naked Lunch, bending reality versus drug induced psychosis). Brandon finds a medium for corporate take overs with mind assassins, and how an assassin might lose their own identity depending on the target's own mental stability. It was an interesting film after seeing Antiviral, while some of his influence is his father's, he does try to carve out his own in the film industry. Pass or fail, he will come into his own, and when he does make a successful film, it will be a film that will make you question your own reality.",Possessor
298,peelpeyl,Disappointed,6,7 June 2021,"Great premise, unfortunately lacks in execution. Not as shocking or disturbing as people say, has a strong underlying theme of the main character's mental turmoil and struggles (violent intrusive thoughts, identity diffusion and guilt over assassination), but no development or sufficient character background exploration over them whatsoever that would make it interesting.Minor irks about the movie:
1. Lack of harmony between the volume of the actor's voice and music.",Possessor

303,sliceserve,Fantastic filmmaking,9,1 June 2021,"Saw this film was getting notice in film circles, and I screened it last night. Very enjoyable film to watch. The script's sci-fi and and character motivations ideas run deep, the casting is on point, the visuals/music/atmosphere of the film's universe really stands out (this is very hard to achieve in films). Tons to like here.This kid gets a big budget, a fancy DP, and has another fascinating script, and directs, and he could really really hit it out of the park. Definitely keep an eye on this talent. Like if Tarantino and Kubrick had a kid and you get to see his early stuff. (And all honor to Brandon's father's films).",Possessor

I enjoy a good spiral and that's what's on offer here.
The entry premise is simple enough. An assassin that uses others as a puppet for the to accomplish their deed, but....then it goes wrong. So wrong. Despite all warnings, the assassin's mind begins to fuse and/or become subsumed by the will of the victim. Halfway through it's hard to be certain of who is genuinely in control.
The story culminates in a way that is more than a little conflicting and adds a whole other additional dimension to the general theme (i.e. possession, does what it says on the tin).
The conclusion leaves you with layers of questions to unpack.",Possessor

What happens when the process goes smoothly, considering we are only shown what happens when the process goes haywire? I could go on....This movie feels unfinished (maybe it is?).
