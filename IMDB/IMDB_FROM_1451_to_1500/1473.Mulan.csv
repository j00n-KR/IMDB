0,MartinHafer,I really liked this Disney flick that seemed to slip between the cracks,9,10 June 2007,"In the 1990s, I felt that Disney made quite a few undistinguished cartoons following Aladdin. Unlike most of the world, I wasn't all that enamored with THE LION KING and subsequent offerings such as the wretched HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and POCAHONTAS were huge disappointments. Sure, POCAHONTAS is a lovely film to watch, but it's so wrong historically and it's so politically correct and hokey. And as for HUNCHBACK, the story was so dark and unappealing, I have no idea WHO the intended audience was. So it was in this context that I expected to hate or at least be underwhelmed by MULAN. Instead, it seemed fresh, well-made, humorous and fun--something distinctly missing from these other films. While the anachronistic aspect of having a lady warrior is problematic, for once Disney had another strong and likable female lead following Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This was a definite home-run for Disney and well worth your time whether you are a child or an adult.",Mulan
1,TheLittleSongbird,Definitely a Disney classic!,9,26 February 2009,"I love this movie, and so does my sister. I loved the fact, they based it in China, and they got the cultural aspects of Chinese life right. Bravo, Disney! The animation, especially during the avalanche scene, was spotless(loved that epic shot of the bird flying over the huns), and the music, especially in the attack of the huns/avalanche scene and the part where everyone bows down to Mulan towards the end(a real tear-jerker as was the ""greatest honour is having you for a daughter"" part) by Jerry Goldsmith was lovely too, Shan-Yu's theme was also haunting. The songs are better than they're given credit for, the best being ""Reflection"", ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and the one in the end credits. I strongly recommend Vanessa Mae's rendition of ""Reflection"", which is extraordinary. The singing voices, from the likes of Lea Salonga and Donny Osmond, did match the voice actors, unlike Quest for Camelot. The characters are also very memorable; Ming Na's feisty Mulan(one of Disney's greatest female characters), George Takei's brooding ancestor, Eddie Murphy's hilarious Mushu- who bags most of the film's best lines-, BD Wong's handsome Shang, Miguel Ferrer's mysterious and often frightening Shan Yu(who actually is an effective and underrated villain despite having an all-too-easy and lame death scene) and of course Pat Morita's wise Emperor. Some aspects of the well-told story might fly over children's heads, but this is enthralling entertainment, that deserves a much higher rating. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Mulan
2,SnoopyStyle,the progression of the Disney princess,7,13 January 2015,"The Huns led by Shan Yu are invading China. The emperor is calling up one man from each family to join the army. Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) fears her father is too sick and instead joins herself disguised as a man. Her ancestors call on the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve Mulan but clumsy small dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy) accidentally cracks the statue. So Mushu tries to make Mulan a war hero so that they can return in triumph.It's a good evolution on the Disney princess movies. She is no longer the helpless victim. Like Beauty and Beast, Mulan willingly sacrifices herself but she's doing even more. She is actively trying to break out of the traditional gender roles. It's an admirable advancement but it's missing a few things. The most notable is the absent of any catchy great new song. Also Mulan dressed as a male soldier doesn't make for the best doll for the collection. Nevertheless this is a good story and fun exciting animation.",Mulan
3,Hitchcoc,A Very Good Character,8,24 June 2015,"I took my kids to this film when it was first released. I had not seen it since. My daughter holds it in high regard. It is quite a nice film. Mulan, the title character, is being groomed to marry, following the various requirements of one in her position. I would be interested to see how Chinese people today would accept or reject her as a character. The empire is being invaded by the Huns and one member of each family must go fight. Since she is an only child, her frail father must again put on his military uniform and go to fight. He can barely walk and it is horrible for Mulan to watch. She cuts her hair, dons the military clothing, and sets out to join the fray. She is accompanied by a dragon that the spirits have given her out of fear for her safety. Unfortunately, he is relatively useless. Played by Eddie Murphy, he is pretty much the same character as Donkey from Shrek. His mouth flaps constantly with no filter. Once she enters the service, she must maintain her boy-ness and perform deeds that make her useful to them. Her successes are often accidental, but she begins to be seen as a force to her fellow warriors. The Huns are enormous and dangerous, and she must eventually face off the with their leader, no easy task. This is all about having no standing in a culture of sexism that has been around for centuries. This would be quite inspiring for young girls.",Mulan
4,lee_eisenberg,I'm China tell you something,6,4 October 2017,"The story of Hua Mulan is probably not that well known outside China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, so most of the world will very likely only know Disney's adaptation. The title character is admirable enough, refusing to conform to traditional gender roles. My favorite character was Mushu, given an over-the-top personality by Eddie Murphy.Around the time that it got released, I remember reading about people of Asian descent who were unhappy with some of the depictions in ""Mulan"". I suspect that every movie has something that can come across as insensitive. Overall, the movie is enjoyable enough. As usual, I didn't pay much attention to the songs, instead concentrating on the action.The rest of the cast includes B. D. Wong (Dr. Wu in ""Jurassic Park""), June Foray (voice of Rocky the Squirrel) and George Takei (indelible as Sulu on ""Star Trek"", he later wrote a Broadway musical about the internment of the Japanese people in the US during WWII).",Mulan
5,jboothmillard,Mulan,7,24 September 2007,"I said to myself that I would need to see this Disney cartoon feature again to see why the critics give it four stars, and I'm glad I did and that I can agree. Basically, this is the retelling of a Chinese folktale. In ancient imperial China (during the Han dynasty), the Huns, led by the ruthless Shan Yu, (Miguel Ferrer), have invaded by breaching the Great Wall. In the Imperial City, the Emperor (Pat Morita) orders a general mobilisation, sending messages to recruit one man from each family for the Imperial Chinese Army. Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) is the only man of the Fa family, but his only daughter, Fa Mulan (Ming-Na, with Lea Salonga singing), fears for his life due to his poor health. To protect him, she cuts her hair and takes her father's sword and armour, disguising herself as a man to enlist in his place. The family quickly learns of her departure, but cannot risk trying to stop her, as the penalty for her actions would be death. So, Mulan's grandmother (June Foray, with Marni Nixon singing) prays to the family's ancestors for Mulan's safety. Led by the First Ancestor (George Takei), the spirits of the family decide to send the ""Great Stone Dragon"" to bring Mulan back. Disgraced former guardian Mushu (Eddie Murphy), a small red dragon named, is ordered to awaken him, but accidentally destroys the guardian's statue. Mushu resolves to go instead, hoping to redeem himself to the ancestors by making Mulan a war hero. Reporting to the training camp, Mulan passes as a man named ""Ping"", with Mushu providing encouragement and clumsy guidance throughout her deception. Under the command of Captain Li Shang (B. D. Wong, with Donny Osmond singing), she and her fellow recruits train as soldiers, with mixed results. Mulan finds it hard to hide her true identity from fellow soldiers, including Yao (Harvey Fierstein), Ling (Gedde Watanabe), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo), but gradually she and the others prove their strength and stamina. The Emperor's belligerent counsel, Chi-Fu (James Hong), threatens to dissuade the Emperor from allowing Shang's men to fight. So Mushu, with the help of a ""lucky"" cricket, crafts a fake letter from Shang's father, General Li (James Shigeta), ordering the soldiers to join the main imperial army in the mountains. The reinforcements set out and arrive at a burnt village, discovering that the Huns have massacred General Li and his troops. As the soldiers march up a mountain pass, they are ambushed by the Huns. Mulan cleverly uses a Huolongchushui cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries the entire Hun army. Mulan is wounded by Shan Yu during the battle, and her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life, as she saved his, and she is expelled from the army. Mulan is left behind as the other soldiers depart for the Imperial City to report the Huns' defeat. However, Shan Yu and several of his warriors have survived the avalanche, and Mulan sees them heading towards the city. Mulan enters the city and warns Shang. The emperor is captured by the Huns who seize the palace. Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po disguise themselves as concubines and enter the palace, while Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor. Mulan lures Shan Yu onto the roof, where they fight until she pins him with his own sword. Acting on Mulan's instructions, Mushu fires a large skyrocket at Shan Yu, propelling him into a firework launching tower, where he dies in the resulting explosion. The Emperor initially reprimands Mulan, but then he and the crowd of people gathered praise her for having saved them. They all bow to her in honour. She accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts. But she but politely declines his offer to be on his royal council and asks to return to her family. Mulan returns home and presents these gifts to her father, but he is happy to have her back. Having become enamoured with Mulan, Shang also arrives and accepts her invitation to stay for dinner. Watching the Fa family, Mushu is reinstated as a guardian as the spirits ancestors celebrate. Also starring Miriam Margolyes as Matchmaker, Freda Foh Shen as Fa Li (Mulan's mother), Frank Welker as Cri-Kee and Khan (Mulan's horse), and Mary Kay Bergman as various ancestors. The colourful animation is splendid, it is an interesting, political and cultural stuff with go a little over the heads of children watching, but with great set pieces, sweeping training and fight sequences, and likeable characters, especially Murphy as the wisecracking talking dragon, it is a good fun animated musical adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Matthew Wilder, David Zippel and Jerry Goldsmith, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score, and Best Original Song for ""Reflection"". Very good!",Mulan
6,Tweekums,The girl who saved China,9,2 May 2012,"Disney is probably the best known name in animation but because their films are almost never on television I don't think I'd seen one since I saw Pinocchio in the cinema in 1972 when I was five! For that reason when I saw 'Mulan' was going to be on television I just had to watch it.This film tells the tale of the eponymous Mulan; a Chinese girl living with her invalid father. When China is invaded by the Huns every family must send one male to fight for the emperor; as Mulan has no brothers this means her father must go for the sake of the family's honour. Knowing that he will almost certainly be killed Mulan cuts her hair short before taking her father's armour and sneaking out of the house at night to enlist. This is a foolhardy move as it would mean instant death and dishonour should her true gender be exposed. In order to save her the family ancestors are summoned and Mushu, a small dragon goes off to help her he too wasn't meant to go but he is determined to regain his position. When Mulan gets into the army things don't go too well at first and more than once it looks as if she will be caught; eventually however she and her comrades go into battle against the dreaded Hun and due to Mulan's bravery and quick thinking they prevail. Unfortunately for her though they learn she is a girl; because of her bravery she isn't killed but she is left behind in shame. When she sees that the Hun aren't all dead she must tell her friends and save the emperor this time she won't be hiding her gender they will! I was surprised how much I enjoyed this; the story was great and I really liked the protagonist, Ming-Na did a good job providing her voice. The most recognisable voice was provided my Eddie Murphy, who played the comedy sidekick Mushu; he did a good job and provided plenty of laughs from a character I initially thought might turn out to be irritating. While there are plenty of laughs there is also a good amount of drama and action; the scenes where Mulan sets off to join the army and where her unit finds the site where the rest of the army had been defeated were particularly poignant. The action scenes were quite dramatic; especially the 'avalanche scene'. Being a Disney film there were some songs and while they didn't have me humming along they did add some enjoyable moments. Being a U certificate there is nothing in this film that makes it unsuitable for young children and it is nice to see a children's film where the female protagonist doesn't need a man to rescue her from danger; here it is she who does the rescuing! Given how much I enjoyed this; I just hope it isn't another forty years till I catch another Disney animation!",Mulan
7,BA_Harrison,"Not one of Disney's best, but still good fun.",6,25 September 2006,"When China is attacked by the Huns, the emperor enlists one man from every family to help fight the savage invaders. In order to save her father (the only male in her family) from what would probably be certain death, beautiful Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes his place. Aided by Mushu, a wise-cracking dragon, and a 'lucky' cricket, Mulan learns how to be a soldier, saves the day and still has time to steal the heart of a dashing captain.Disney's adaptation of the Chinese legend of Mulan is a well animated and entertaining tale, but one that may not appeal to younger children due to its rather slow start and historical setting. Technically the film is superb, with some lovely stylish oriental flourishes to the animation and superb action scenes, but the unmemorable songs are less than impressive and many of the supporting characters lack the 'personality' we have come to expect from recent Disney films.Although definitely not a 'classic', Mulan is nevertheless still entertaining fare and, let's face it, even a poor Disney movie usually has enough merits to warrant a viewing (unless it's the Black Cauldron or Cars, of course!).",Mulan
8,moonspinner55,She's an Oriental Yentl,5,28 June 2001,"Good-looking but lumpish and derivative Disney animated musical based on Chinese folklore. Young girl, a failure in Concubine School, decides to join the Chinese Emperor's Army disguised as a boy to save her family's name. The dozen-plus ""drag"" jokes and vocal hamming from Eddie Murphy (as a tiny dragon) may make older kids giggle, but this is far from the studio's best work. The bathing sequence is a hoot, there are moments of beauty and wonder, but Mulan simply isn't a very intriguing character. The songs from Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel are not memorable and the picture seems exceptionally long at 88 minutes. ** out of ****",Mulan
9,sunwarrior13,One Of The Best Disney Animated Musical Features,10,3 October 2012,"Mulan is an animated musical film directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook.It is based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan,who is a girl pretends to be a man and takes her father's place in the army. Ming-Na, Eddie Murphy, Miguel Ferrer and BD Wong together with Miguel Ferrer,Harvey Fierstein,Beth Fowler,George Takei and Pat Morita provided voice to the characters.The screenplay was written by Rita Hsiao, Philip LaZebnik, Chris Sanders, Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, and Raymond Singer.It is set in China during the Han Dynasty. Fa Mulan is the only daughter of aged warrior Fa Zhou. She impersonates a man and takes her father's place during a general conscription to counter a fictitious Hun invasion led by Shan Yu. Along with her guardian dragon Mushu, her captain, Li Shang, a lucky cricket and her companions, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, she battles the invading Hun army.Exploring themes of family duty and honor, this movie breaks new ground as a Disney film, while still bringing vibrant animation and sprightly characters to the screen.What's terrific about it is its reaching for emotions that other movies run from: family love and duty, personal honor and group commitment, obedience and ingenuity.Overall, this is a lovely film, ranking with the best of Disney's animated features while taking on serious issues of war, honor, gender roles and family pride.",Mulan
10,studioAT,Mulan 1998,6,30 August 2020,"Interesting to revisit this film, what with the live action version coming out recently.I think this is a good film, the heroine has more about her than most Disney leading ladies, and Eddie Murphy (practicing his vocal performances ahead of the 'Shrek' franchise) lends good comedic support.With some lovely messages about bravery, independence and being yourself, this is a good film.",Mulan
11,CinemaSerf,A fun story of myth and determination ruined by a dragon...,6,3 April 2020,"Disney heads East for this fantasy adventure, this time based on an ancient myth from Imperial Chinese folklore. The Hun hordes are attacking the ancient kingdom and the Emperor must rally every troop he can to defend the nation. His riders travel far and wide calling upon all his men to join the army. They arrive at the home of ""Mulan"" and rather then send her ageing father, she decides to impersonate a boy and go join the fight. There is plenty of action in this much darker animation; the evil ""Shan-Yu' has devilish, piercing eyes and the use of darker colours and hues - alongside heavy drum-based themes from Jerry Goldsmith goes some way to project a decent sense of menace on the latter half of the film. ""Mulan"" herself, though spending half of the film pretending, turns out to be a feisty heroine easily the match of her male counterparts. So, why only 6/20 - well: Eddie Murphy drove me mad. ""Mushu"" was as irritating as he was noisy; a hammer to crack a nut - so overblown as to largely ruin the film for me.",Mulan
12,utgard14,"""Let's go kick some Hunny buns! Yee-ha!""",6,8 September 2015,"Enjoyable Disney movie about a young woman named Mulan in ancient China who poses as a man and joins the army so her elderly father will not have to. She proves her worth as a soldier against the invading Huns. Excellent voicework all around with Ming-Na Wen giving a delightful performance as Mulan. Eddie Murphy's comic relief dragon is funny (and obviously a precursor for his work as Donkey in the Shrek series). The songs are nice, though few stay with you for very long after the credits roll. Good score from Jerry Goldsmith. The animation is solid and occasionally impressive. The cultural diversity helps greatly as the story is predictable to a fault. It's got humor and action to spare with a little bit of romance and at least one tearjerker moment. It's not the best movie that Disney put out in the '90s but it's a good one.",Mulan
13,Calicodreamin,"Mulan, setting goals since 1998",10,1 May 2020,"Mulan is by far the most kickass Disney character of all time, no contest. Taking on the entire Hun army, getting cast out, and still shows up to the final boss to end things right. Mulan is literal goals. The perfect mix of humor, action, and good old Disney magic. One of my favorites!",Mulan
14,view_and_review,I Watched in the Wrong Order,6,18 November 2020,"I watched these in the reverse order. I watched the live action ""Mulan"" before watching the animated ""Mulan."" I think they were both good though I prefer the live action version. I think I would've preferred the original ""Mulan"" had I seen it in 1998. This was a quaint story of tradition, the good of it and the bad of it, and a young girl bucking that tradition.",Mulan
15,neil-476,"Very good, but...",8,29 April 2012,"Mulan tells the story of a Chinese girl who joins the army in the guise of a man, in order to save her infirm father from the death which would otherwise await him.Disney's 36th animated features is memorable for tackling an interesting and unusual subject (including consideration of feminism and sexism issues), for doing it with sensitivity and a beautiful sense of style, and for treating us to some first class animation and production design.The voice cast includes a number of oriental performers, for obvious reasons: they are all Chinese Americans, and sound as American as everyone else, so there is a big chunk of ""I can't see the point"" at work (which is not to denigrate the voice performances, which are uniformly good. Except...).Then we come to Eddie Murphy's turn as small dragon Mushu. This is essentially exactly the same performance as he delivered a couple of years later in Shrek: but while it worked perfectly with Donkey, it seems completely out of place here: it is a style of humour from somewhere else bolted on where it doesn't belong. Murphy is good, but totally out of place, and it jars.The film is very good: it could have been first rate.",Mulan
16,anaconda-40658,Murphy Breaths Comedic Life Into a Dragon.,7,24 June 2015,"Mulan (1998): Dir: Barry Cook, Tony Bancroft / Voices: Ming Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, B.D. Wong, Harvey Fierstein, Miguel Ferrer: Glorious and enchanting animation regarding the war on China in which one male from every household must venture. Mulan is a teenage girl discouraged of past failures. Her father is not well enough to fight so she cuts her hair and sets out in the night while her parents are asleep. Well placed humour takes affect as she attempts to act manly during training. While plot is typical, structure is formula but its ending bares the message. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft with beautiful animated appeal that will appeal to family audiences although it isn't as broad as the best of Disney animations. Ming Na Wen voices Mulan who undertakes a massive task. It is obvious that she will be the hero she never was and that her family will be honored, etc. Eddie Murphy steals scenes as Mulan's dragon guardian who is not exactly what he appears. Murphy steals every scene as the voice of this little red creature. Other voice talents accompany very flat personalities. B.D. Wong voices the commander whom Mulan is under but he serves only as a tight ass and eventual romantic prop. Harvey Fierstein voices one of the other loons under command. Although screenplay is thin it does pass as hilarious with a broad message of endurance and family loyalty. Score: 7 / 10",Mulan
17,HotToastyRag,One of Disney's best,10,28 September 2021,"The legend of Mulan can be traced back through the centuries, and there have been several Chinese films honoring the female warrior who disguised herself as a man while battling the Huns. I've seen a couple of them, but to me, nothing compares to the Disney musical. In my opinion, it's one of the best Disney cartoons ever made. It's a fantastic true story, it has action, tears, laughs, romance, great characters, and beautiful music. It's not too silly for the parents in the audience, and it's not too scary for the kids. And it also educates people on certain Chinese customs, managing to teach culture and history through entertainment.Christina Aguilera immortalized ""Reflection"", and while it is a beautiful song, it's not the only one in the movie. ""Honor to Us All"", the first number, reminds me of the fantastic ""Belle"" opening song from Beauty and the Beast. It shows the townspeople bonding together with common beliefs and expectations, and the heroine is an outsider who hasn't yet found herself. ""Honor to Us All"" educates the audience about Chinese customs at that time by showing the different paths men and women take. How to honor the family: ""Our boys by bearing arms, our girls by bearing sons."" Another lyric shows the expectation of how Mulan should mold herself to fit in with society: ""Men like girls with good taste, calm, obedient, who worked fast-paced. With good breeding and a tiny waist, you'll bring honor to us all.""In the incredibly moving sequence, Mulan decides to honor her family in a different way. Her aged father has been drafted, and to save his life, she cuts her hair and dons his uniform. With her grandmother's lucky cricket and a guardian appointed by the ghosts of her ancestors, she has to disguise herself and blend in with the other male soldiers. There are countless jokes that would undoubtedly provoke riots if they were made today (hence the recent non-musical remake) but they're still funny in my book. The wonderful song ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" has clever lyrics that aren't meant to be offensive but instead completely tie in with the first number about women's expectations.I could probably write another four paragraphs about how wonderful and moving this Disney movie is, but it would take less time to just watch it again instead. With fantastic voice acting from Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, Miguel Ferrer, Harvey Fierstein, June Foray, James Hong, George Takei, and a few lines of dialogue from James Shigeta and Pat Morita, lovely stylized animation, and a meaningful message, even if you don't like musicals, you'll find plenty of reasons to love this movie.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Mulan gets woken up by the cricket's ""alarm clock"" her POV shows double vision for a few seconds, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Mulan
18,Aaron1375,Another one I got dragged to.,3,7 March 2003,"My friend is for some reason a big Disney fan...he sees all the movies and somehow he always finds a gal that is really into Disney too.  From time to time, he somehow drags me to one of these Disney movies.  I have a policy of I will go to any movie as long as someone pays my way.  So I got dragged to this one and man, I didn't find it all that enjoyable.  If it wasn't for the character Eddie Murphy voiced I would have had a completely lousy time indeed.  His character though does do some funny things so I was able to tolerate it better.  This one has a girl pretending to be a guy in order to help her father who is drafted to serve, but is very old.  Of course, in this type of movie the girl does great in the army and becomes a better soldier than all the guys as is typical with these kinds of movies.  In the end I was able to sit through this one, but I wouldn't want to see it again. I have never really been a big fan of Disney movies, even when I was a kid so maybe I should revise my you pay I'll go policy.",Mulan
19,Mr-Fusion,It looks great,7,16 November 2016,"""Mulan"" always seemed like the more interesting of The Mouse's late-'90s output; certainly the cast is first-rate, and I do really like the animation style - but it also features an array of subpar songs in a Disney flick. Seriously, you have Lea Salonga and you waste her talents on these? But despite the lame villain and some of the ineffective comedic elements (including a pre-Donkey Eddie Murphy) this was a hit with the real target audience; my kid really liked this, and I enjoyed this much more through her eyes than I would've alone.

20,siderite,One of the better Disney cartoons. Same stupid music.,8,4 September 2005,"OK, Disney movie. Nice word play, good emotional story, Eddie Murphy's voice, even Pat Morita is somewhere around there. The same really dumb song and dance routines, though, exactly when the film starts to get interesting. I really really wish they'd stop that.Animation. Disney like. I found it less thorough than many, but still OK. Cannot rival Japanese animation, though.Plot. A bit too shallow for my taste, but after all, this is a cartoon and the audience is children. I am sure battle strategy or good plot continuity were not in the mind of the creators of Mulan.Conclusion: all in all I rate it an 8 for Disney movies, although it's more like 7.5.",Mulan
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,A surprise pleasure to watch,7,20 November 2006,"I really held back from Disney's later animated features, most of them started to slid down hill after The Lion King, excluding The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but it seemed like Mulan was going to be a disappointment for Disney. It turned out to be an actual pleasure watching this film. It had great animation, a good soundtrack, and a wonderful story about courage and strength.Mulan is a girl in China who is ready for marriage but seems like she isn't ready to settle down in this man's world where she must have permission to speak and only cook and please her husband. When her father is called to war, she fears for his life and dresses like him and fights in his place disguised as him. Mushu, her ""guardian"" dragon per say, comes to help her out and make sure she doesn't get herself killed out there in battle. She also falls for the captain that doesn't kill her when he finds out her secret.It is a visually stunning masterpiece that I am glad that I had a chance to watch. It had great morals and values for children, even if it was a bit unrealistic, we have to let go. Still, I don't think a film will compare yet to The Lion King or Beauty and The Beast, but Mulan is a treasure of it's own.7/10",Mulan

23,OllieSuave-007,"A beautiful, adventurous and fun Disney film!",10,31 January 2014,"This is Disney's 36th full-length animated feature, a story about Mulan, a young Chinese maiden who doesn't quite fit in as being the perfect bride and one to bring honor to her family. She also learns that her weakened and limp father is called into the army in order to battle the invading Huns. Fearing for her father's life, Mulan disguises herself as a male soldier and takes his father's place in the army. The spirits of her ancestor want to spare Mulan and inadvertently sends their disgraced former dragon-guardian, Mushu, to bring her back. What follows is a breathtaking adventure where Mulan, trying to prove that she can do things right, attempts to fit in with the other soldiers and train well enough to battle the Huns.The film has the suspense, thrills and somberness of any war-themed movies, but it is counterbalanced with the laugh-out-loud comedy and humor provided by Mushu and Mulan's fellow ragtag soldier-trio team of Yao, Ling and Chien-Po. Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, gave the same witty, no-nonsense, hilarious and crackpot personality of the actor. Ming-Na voiced Mulan and gave a smoothing and gentle, yet determined portrayal of the character. I especially like Pat Morita's commanding, dignified and wise portrayal of the Emperor and his line, ""No matter how the wind hows, the mountain cannot bow to it,"" was my favorite.The movie is made in beautiful animation and great visual effects, highlighting many characteristics of the Chinese culture like the Great Wall of China, the Forbidden City, a Dragon Dance, traditional Chinese robes, a game of Chinese Chess and a spectacular fireworks show. Directors Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook created a non-stop fun and exciting Disney film along with a fabulous story-writing team. And, Composer Jerry Goldsmith provided a brilliant music score, with his haunting and commanding theme when the Huns come charging down the snowy hill being my favorite.Overall, I believe this is one of Disney's best films and one of my favorite animated films all together - beautiful animation, great music, exciting story and memorable characters, with a very touching emphasis on honor to yourself and your family.Grade A",Mulan

And the song ""Reflection"" would include a chorus where Fa Mulan would pull a ""Let it Go"" and say ""But What I (Really) Want is..."".If ""Mulan"" was made today, the grandmother would have sided with Mulan all along and encourage her to follow her dreams. Which leads me to think that she wouldn't have alerted the family when Mulan left home to go fighting instead of Fa Zhou and maybe we wouldn't even have Mushu.Speaking of Mushu, if ""Mulan"" was made today, we certainly wouldn't have Eddie Murphy as the voice actor. Though I'm not sure they would have made the effort to cast one Asian actor for every single character, the scene-stealing sidekick would have certainly been voiced by an Asian-American star. And why not? Listening to the little red dragon, I was wondering whether it was Axel Folley or the Donkey who got caught in a time loop that took him to the Han dynasty... and I wonder why they didn't try to get Jackie Chan for the part (was he that busy with ""Rushmore""?)If ""Mulan"" was made today, we wouldn't have the cricket because he would be as needless in 2018 than he was in 1998...If ""Mulan"" was made today, she would have been a natural-born warrior impressing the soldiers with her skills from the very start instead of being that ""adorkable"" unexperienced maiden trying to pass for a man. Everything would have been done to tone-down the effect of her cross-dressing and reduce it to the cutting of her hair.Speaking of which, if ""Mulan"" was made today, I'm not sure we'd have that badass synthetized score during the dressing moment. Not even sure we'd have so much music that scream ""Nineties"" (and yes, it came from Jerry Goldsmith, of all the composers!)If ""Mulan"" was made today, a song like ""Like a Man"" wouldn't exist. (I wish they would keep the tune though because it's catchy as hell).If ""Mulan"" was made today, Shan-Yu wouldn't have been turned into such a scary-looking villain in case it might offend Hunnish populations.Now that one is risky: if ""Mulan"" was made today, would there be a romance? Would they keep the character of the young captain Shan?Let's face it, ""Mulan"" is perhaps one of the few Disney movies where we don't get one but two heroes and Shang even follows a character arc as he starts as an inexperienced and prejudiced soldier trying to fit in his father's shoes to a more tolerant person. Mulan and Shang form a rather interesting ""Yin and Yang"" duo and I wonder if he would have been kept or just turned into some ruthless leader wrongly opinioned about women.Still, let's stick to the romance. If ""Mulan"" was made today, would they have abandoned any prospect of a romantic relationship and avoid the possibility of two male-looking soldiers being romantically involved. Disney has so much to show, so many grounds to break, so many taboos to fight, that I don't think they would have missed that opportunity for one of the few stories involving cross-dressing. So I'll stick to my guns and say there would be a romance.That said, if ""Mulan"" was made today, the romance would be one-sided and wouldn't distract Mulan from her mission. Well, as long as they keep that hilarious and risqué ""river-bathing"" scene...Now, of course, if ""Mulan"" was made today, it would be in 3D.But if ""Mulan"" was made today, the Great Wall of China would look even greater but I don't think they could have made a more impressive sequence than Huns' epic riding over the mountains. This has got to be one of the most beautiful Disney shots from any movie ever on a pure Eisensteinian or Kurosawan level.If ""Mulan"" was made today, she would still save the day by causing an avalanche but maybe the writers would have found a better way for our heroes to survive. I want Mulan, Shang, Mushu and the other fellows to live like the next watcher but there are so many insults to the laws of probability in three minutes of the avalanche sequences than maybe all the Renaissance Disney pictures of Disney. And my disbelief was suspended by a looser rope than the one thrown from over a cliff to land on Harvey Fiernstein's head.If ""Mulan"" was made today, the climax would have kept the concubine cross-dressing but would have ended with an iron-crossing fight between Mulan and Shao-li.If ""Mulan"" was made today, she would have accepted the job as the Emperor's counselor and never get back home to become a maiden again. Hell, Shang wouldn't have followed her. Wait a minute, of course he wouldn't have... since he's not supposed to exist so it all makes sense that Mulan ends up a counselor, then a general, then maybe the new Empress of China.In fact, if ""Mulan"" was made today, there would be at least two or three extra female characters, maybe Shao-li would have a daughter who would have been the real nemesis, maybe Mulan would have a little sister (all right I cheated for that one) or maybe the empowering message would have been even more explicit, like ""Brave"", ""Frozen"" and ""Moana"" and would make 1998 Mulan original look like Snow White...My question is: are there any girls who still don't give a damn about being warriors? Mulan did that out of love for her father and I just hope that will still be the key motive in the 2020 versions but I do expect a few changes to remind me how far we are from 1998... when Mulan was considered a progressive movie.It's a matter of opinion but I believe it is.",Mulan
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Let's get down to business...,7,11 September 2020,"'Mulan (1998)' follows a young woman who pretends to be a man in order to take her crippled father's place in the army when the emperor conscripts one man from every household to fight the incoming Huns. The protagonist is certainly one of Disney's most capable (and most lethal), taking matters into her own hands and often saving those who would otherwise look down on her. There are very few instances where she herself is saved by anyone, let alone a man, and this reinforces the film's underlying theme of gender equality. Indeed, the flick is soaked in the sort of genuine female empowerment that ought to be present in a lot more movies. It's good stuff, especially considering its age, and it stands out as one of Disney's best, most progressive efforts. It's also just entertaining throughout, with engaging characters and exciting set-pieces. Its highlight is probably a training montage set to the tune of 'I'll Make A Man Out Of You', which is an absolute banger of a song that's sure to get stuck in your head (seriously, it's got to be one of the best Disney songs of all time). Overall, the picture is really entertaining. It's an enjoyable, engaging experience with a distinct setting and a strong central character. 7/10",Mulan

28,lesleyharris30,"A Delight for all Disney fans,",8,18 September 2015,"Mulan is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic voice cast. It's a very sweet, beautifully animated film that will surely please all Disney fans, it stands as a classic animated film in the same vein as Aladdin and The Lion King does, it also has some unforgettable songs that you will find yourself humming long after you've watched the movie, such as Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You. The only thing I think this movie is missing is a strong factor of Disney animation films, comic relief, I know that Mushu is a fantastic character and brilliantly voiced by Eddie Murphy, but he dosen't have as much scenes as he should have to lighten the tone of the film, it takes itself too seriously at times and it's story can be very heavy for a younger audience, but we have to hand it to Disney for taking a huge risk on openly dealing with war. The film, unlike most of Disney's animated movies, is quite intense, it will keep you at the edge of your seat a lot, and once we get deep in to battle, it becomes very hard to believe that an animation is making you feel so much excitement, with a very powerful story. Beautifully animated with stunning music, I would recommend Mulan to anyone looking for a good family film. A young lady takes her fathers place in the army by disguising herself as a man.",Mulan
29,Bored_Dragon,Different kind of Disney Princess,7,6 November 2018,"In a Chinese family with no male children, daughter disguises herself as a male and goes to war against Huns instead of her elderly father. Hilarious Eddie Murphy lends his voice to her sidekick, a clumsy little red dragon. The story is interesting, with lots of Disney humor, but also a good message. Essentially, this is ""coming of age"" and ""women empowerment"" drama, but shown in a typical Disney way, to the extent that even this girl warrior can be classified among the Disney Princesses. I had the impression that someone forced them to make a ""women empowerment"" movie, and then they did their best to disguise it as much as possible. I know that Disney movies are primarily intended for children, but still I think they banalized it too much. Also, I did not like the animation, but the music is excellent.

Many of the outdated cliches of comedic parody are interspersed with the typical musical routines and stereotypical gender roles even though Mulan supposedly is a strong feminine character. It's live action update by Disney released in 2020 offers up a much more vibrant and rightfully accomplished successor.",Mulan
31,ironhorse_iv,Be a man & watch this movie!,7,9 April 2013,"By Disney renaissance standards, this was pretty close to what the film was actually based on, the ancient Chinese poem called the Ballad of Hua Mulan. There is a slight exception from the poem and the movie, in the fact, that she lasted ten to 12 years in the military without getting discovered. Disney got it wrong in the settling as well, the ballad is set in the Northern-Southern dynasties period (420 to 589 AD), but Mulan the film makes it look like the height of the Ming dynasty a thousand years later. Oh, she also died tragically in the ballad. She commits suicide because the emperor asked her to be a concubine. But that's beside the point. I'm just history nerding. In the end, the story is the same, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) must pretend to be a man to save her elderly father from death in the army due to invasion with the Huns and it's leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer). Some people think of him as forgettable due to one of the relatively few Disney villains who doesn't have a villain song, but I like Shan Yu as a villain because he looks so scary. No, his personality isn't that great, but the dude just looks like a monster! And he's a powerhouse! He can slice through the castle pillars with one swing of his sword. He's the only Disney villain I can think of that actually causes that kind of destruction. He doesn't need to be fleshed out as a character. He's the leader of the Hun Army. The Huns were trying to conquer China and were really violent and underhanded in their tactics. He belongs with the greats. One thing that bugs me in the film is how Mulan go to the camp, and get nearly kicked out of the army for not being fit, which kinda negates, the whole point of her taking her father's place. Clearly, her father wasn't healthy so if he was sent instead of her, he would have been sent home anyways. So what was the point of replacing him? Why, didn't Mulan go home after not being fit to join the army? I think it's about giving Honor to the family. Mulan's smart in a way I can see, a cheater, a bit lazy, loving, outspoken, and just fails at all things social, but lovable. This 'wood orchid' seems like the girl-power type character for the overly feminist. If anything, I've always seen her as a person who was just trying to find her own place regardless of gender roles. She tries to act as her society's definition of a woman and fails, she tries to act as her society's definition of a man and fails. If anything, Mulan only succeeds when she acts like herself rather than the roles that are put before her. It isn't about the girl power or the male dominance, it's about people finding their own place in life. Mulan may be a strong female character, but I don't believe with Disney marketing her as a princess. Mulan appealed to some girls because she wasn't a princess. The title of Princess is really just more marketable, because Queens in Disney type movies are usually evil, while the Princess is a heroine. Still, Mulan is not a princess. For example, Mulan in the movie didn't like her kimono outfit and found it uncomfortable and it's only seen in the beginning of the film. And yet, most of the toys of her showed her in that outfit as opposed to her warrior one. For Disney to do that is kinda wrong. A lot of the hate has to do with gender roles. No matter how brave or action oriented or tomboyish princesses are, they still dress in pretty clothes and have beautiful hair and fall in love which isn't realism to the source material. The main musical theme ""Reflections"" is well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion. Even though it's like the other princess songs, it's still a great song. 'A girl worth fighting for' is just as good, but my favorite is 'Be a man'. Most badass song in Disney history. How come only guys can have no singing ability whatsoever but still make an awesome song? Was it really necessary for Shang to be shirtless for the entire duration of that song? Shang clearly had a thing for Mulan even during the time he didn't know she was indeed a she. Conclusion, Shang must be at least bi. Disney, you astonished me again. Want to know something interesting though, the voice actor for Captain Li Shang, was B.D. Wong, an actually an openly gay man in real life. So it was a bit odd in a while. The confusing gender roles jokes and visual gags closely border on PG, but it was funny. Another person who was funny was Eddie Murphy as Mushu, the Chinese Dragon. He did OK in the role, but couldn't they find a Chinese or Asian American comedian, that would fit the film, more. I don't mind the fact that the Chinese culture is underplayed. Speaking as an Asian, it's refreshing to see a work of media that takes place in an Asian setting without overplaying the stereotypes to the point of offensiveness. The film was generally well received by Chinese audiences. The fact that Jackie Chan put his pipes to work as the voice of the captain for the Mandarin dub didn't hurt either. The animation was breathtaking in some scenes, but others were missing the epic sheer artistry. All in all the film itself doesn't really do any harm to the source material or the culture it seeks to portray. I really liked that about it and continue to consider it one of Disney's better animated films of recent memory.",Mulan

36,SAMTHEBESTEST,"You trusted Ping, why is Mulan any different? LOVED IT!",7,7 September 2020,"Mulan (1998) :
Brief Review -You trusted Ping, why is Mulan any different? Loved It. I remember watching this animated flick in childhood on some TV channel or DVD but that time, by default, i didn't pay attention as a Movie Buff. Anyways, i enjoyed it then and even today when i feel like being a matured movie freak. Mulan is a story of a girl who decides to go and join Army to save her old age father and then discovers her own identity and glory. The story itself doesn't run on a dramatic path as the girl herself seems hungry to find the insights otherwise many films make mistake of letting someone else force her to do so. Apart from the girl angle the 2nd best thing is perspective set to have woman respect in society. When Mulan asks if you trusted the fake male version of her then why is Female any different? So sharp it was. Additional factors like family, drama, love are also engaging and loveable. Animation effects are quite Decent not anything spectacular may be because they wanted to keep the simplicity intact (as i figure it). Like i always say, animation gives you libery and freedom to give nasty and wild portrayal to the characters which live action films can't achieve. The characters can jump, fight, laughing, fly like anything and we won't mind at it, but the same cannot be applied in live action and that's the main reason i wanted to watch this Original Disney animated flick before giving a watch to the latest live action remake Mulan (2020). You know, there is some kind of nostalgia and cuteness in Animated films which makes them delightful and soulful. Mulan direction is upto the mark to whatever the script and visuals are provided. It couldn't have got any better, although overall impact of the film could have been better for sure. As i see it, Mulan is another Disney Product from 90s that has got deserving audience and fans.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Mulan

38,Vartiainen,"Fantastic, thrilling adventure with a great message for kids",10,24 November 2015,"Fa Mulan is by far my favourite Disney protagonist. If we're simply talking about Disney heroines, that might be Jasmine from Aladdin or Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Mulan is far more than a simple heroine. She's the hero of her story. She is the one that causes things to happen. Sure, there have been lots of female protagonists before her, but in their case it was always the case of things happening to them and them reacting to it. Mulan's story is entirely her own doing. She didn't need to go to war for her dad. She chose to, despite all the problems it would bring her. It's a small distinction, but an important one.Furthermore, it's an amazing film even without our badass name-taking, sword-swinging, Hun-defeating, pole-climbing, ancient-bazooka-wielding hero. After a couple of rather flawed Renaissance films, it returns to form with all aspects of the film working beautifully together and with no discernible faults. Sure, some people claim that Shan Yu, the villain, is a tad boring and one-dimensional. And yeah, I can see where they're coming from, but personally I like him. He's menacing and unstoppable, with an intellect to match. He attacks China because it's there, no other reason needed. Having him singing villain songs would water him down.Then there's of course Mushu, the dragon guardian, voiced by Eddie Murphy. And yeah, that is an odd, odd casting choice, which I'm not one hundred percent convinced works. Sure, he is the best source of comedy in the film by far and it's very good comedy. One of Murphy's best roles, in fact. But he is also pretty distracting from time to time, keeping us from fully immersing ourselves. It doesn't really ruin the film, and I'm not convinced that a more traditional voice would have worked any better either, but it is a thing to ponder about.The songs are also great, though perhaps not Disney's best effort either. Though, keeping in mind that this is Disney, that's a pretty high bar to reach, so you cannot really fault the movie for failing. And they are good songs, with I'll Make a Man Out of You being a contender for that elusive best effort status.I love that this movie exists. That Fa Mulan as a character exists. That there is a movie that uncompromisingly tells us an adventure story with a female hero, in this age where we still cannot get any movies with female leads, unless they're romantic comedies or dramas about the difficulties of love. That's thankfully slowly changing and this movie will be remembered as an important milestone on that journey.",Mulan

Along the way she meets a hilarious dragon(who looks more like a lizard than a dragon)voiced by Eddie Murphy and falls for a handsome captian named Shang.The story isn't your typical fairytale movie as its all about action and adventure. Seriously I have no idea why Mulan is a princess as she isn't royal at all. The whole film was edgy and excellent. The animation is very exquisite and the music is very good.

40,FiendishDramaturgy,Brave and Magical.,8,28 October 2003,"Witty, amusing little Disney movie, regardless of the horrid song element.I'm not a fan of the Disney musical formula. I do not like the made-for-five-year-old song element found in most Disney animations, so I tend to just ignore those sections except in movies such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" where that activity is just not possible. I therefore avoid the movie itself, as often as I can.This movie, has much of that Disney musical element, which for me, lowers the value of the movie.However, the animation is far better than that of other later Disney movies, and the backgrounds are well done, which is a delightful surprise.Disney has taken to ignoring detail, of late, which is a major disappointment for those of us who watch these movies for the animation quality.The story itself is really very compelling, innovative, and strong. I thoroughly enjoyed this Disney attempt, although I am sure, as with all Disney sequels, they will screw up the animation quality and background value in Mulan 2.

There is the growth of her relationship with her war comrades see her as a liability and ends up loving her. There were powerful moments like when Mulan's father accepts his conscription papers and practices with his sword despite being frail health. ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" was a great musical number.But the film does not stand up as well against some of the other films from the Disney Renaissance because it relied more on slapstick humour than some of the other films from the period.It is an enjoyable but minor offering from the House of Mouse.",Mulan

It's flashy and well-produced, with a strong female lead and up-front morals, but the plot seems too convenient and there's very little life outside the spotlight's bright glare. Funny, that last point, as Disney's always been so thorough about granting attention to the little details in their better preceding efforts.Mulan is just fine. The animation is fluid and smooth, a crisp blend of classic western style and traditional Chinese décor that brims with character while paying service to a stiffer, more respect-driven society. The plot, up-tempo but shallow, hits its important points and changes the scenery before younger minds have a chance to wander. Singing and dancing cartoons aren't really my thing, but the tunes in Mulan are aurally inoffensive, at least, and kept rather short and utilitarian. I didn't hate anything, really, but I also didn't love anything... it was all just there. Yep, that looks like a Disney movie. Yep, that's the bad guy. Yep, there's the cursory romance. I appreciate the envelope-pushing hinted by the premise, encouragement to challenge the status quo if you find it unjust, but the film's conviction to see that message through adversity seems shaky at best. Even Eddie Murphy's comic relief side character, the aforementioned cat-sized dragon, doesn't get much to do.The ideas are good, the animation is top-notch, the music is tolerable, but the big picture stuff is half-baked and the window-dressings are shockingly bland.",Mulan
44,GiraffeDoor,It da Man. Sort of.,10,18 March 2020,"When I was like 6 years old I think I bought the VHS with birthday money and I watched it over and over.This is a movie I don't think I'll ever stop rewatching. As good as it is that feminism is getting more and more popular, we unfortunately have too many writers who think they can score brownie points by waving the black and purple flag without anything to say about a struggles of women. Ocean's 8, Brave and that god awful Dracula Adaptation in 2019 just pandered to the audience by telling them what they wanted to hear at the expense of well developed characters and good story telling.Mulan is therefor perhaps even more relevant now than ever as what a good empowered female movie should actually look like, and this is over a decade before #metoo.A lot of this is to do with Mulan herself. She is a good character because she is neither a helpless damsel in distress like Snow White nor the opposite problem of a character that has no personality beyond being practically perfect in every except in having no real personality, like Hermione Granger.She is clearly smart and resourceful from her dog powered chicken feeding device (It's a lot more simple than I make it sound) but when she enlists in the army she is as much out of her depth as anyone but she has the capacity to rise to the challenge in a believable way and they don't spend too much time on it. Mulan is the perfect fusion of relatable underdog and credible hero. While in a lot of comparable movies, the human protagonist is almost one of the blandest with the anthropomorphic help carrying the show, but she has perhaps the most personality of any pre-Tangled ""Princess"".We have not only an internal conflict of a person not knowing where they belong but also a material one in Mulan trying to spare her father military service and the too strands coalesce so elegantly in this story of overcoming the self, of friendships emerging between initially hostile parties and of also of the futility of war in a mature and subtle way (""A girl worth fighting--"" cue reality check). One really gets a vivid sensation of the destruction of armed conflict in a way one typically doesn't see in the ""family"" movie.It ticks all the other boxes you expect it too and more: the music, not just the songs but the intense score, the immersive sense of local color juxtaposed to the austerity of battle, the comedy, the pathos, the impeccable structuring of the story and intense images (Mulan must have worn the most easily removied make-up ever but I don't care), that all come together in a feature that is more of a treat each time.My only real qualm is an unsavoury spitting attempt but that's a small thing.This is what a feminist family movie looks like.",Mulan
45,alindsay-al,A Great Animated Tale,8,3 December 2020,"So the 2020 Live Action version of Mulan hits Disney+ at no extra charge tomorrow and because I am cheap I haven't watched it yet so I thought I would watch the original animated film and here is my review for it. The premise of sees a young Woman attempt to save her Father from dying in the military by taking his place secretly by pretending to be a man.Main Character
So obviously Mulan is the main character and for those that criticise Disney's animated films back in the 90s of not portraying strong female characters then go back and watch Mulan as this is a fantastically strong character. It only came to my attention today that the fantastic Ming-Na Wen who I know from Agents Of Shield and The Mandalorian voices Mulan and she is a perfect fit for the role, she is known for her action prowess and she just really fits into the character of Mulan.Supporting Characters
There is a good group of characters that Mulan allies with in the film, the main one being Mushu played by Eddie Murphy and he is great and adds plenty of life and energy to the film. I mean it is funny that his voice role here is basically the same as when he voices Donkey in the Shrek films, but it does work here and as I said adds plenty of life to a film that needs it. BD Wong plays Shang her Captain in the army and I thought he voiced the character well and I thought his character fit well with Mulan's story and I thought their dynamic was a highlight of the film. The characters in the army are fine and are good with Mulan, but you can't help but see the stereotypes and generic nature of them kind of makes them a bit paper thin. But when you get to Paper thin we get to the villain of this film, I mean these animated films have great villains such as Scar, Jafar & Ursula but this guy is just really generic, he is a Hun and just wants to take over China. We are not given any interesting and thought provoking reason, he is just a bad guy for the sake of the film having a bad guy which does hurt the film a bit.Story
The story is good, it does a great job showing its main protagonist in a great light and making you care about Mulan and wanting to see her succeed and it does that in an appropriate way, the story also doesn't shy away from some pretty sexist moments and I think it makes Mulan's story better that the film doesn't hide from that. But I feel like this film maybe has an overly simple story, compared to other Disney films I felt like this film had the potential to have more shades of grey in it, like I said the bad guy is just simply a bad guy and I think there could have been more done there, especially when you consider some of the attitudes of the Chinese empire that are pretty bad in this film.Script
The script is really good, you have to remember that this is meant to be a family film so it has some of that family humour but it feels appropriate and the film knows when to have its dramatic moments and it is effective in doing so.Style
This film looks fantastic, back in the 80's and 90's Disney had great looking animated films but this one is right up there, it looks stunning and the Chinese backdrop really adds to it and the style of the film. For a family film it does have some exciting moments and some darker moments which sells its war like feeling. It is a really short film barely clocking at 90 mins but that is part of its charm, you can turn it on and watch this quickly and feel like a complete story has been told in the time that is given.Overall
Overall, this is a great animated film that maybe is a bit underrated. I feel like when people mention the great Disney animated film Mulan is never mentioned and I am not saying it is as good as The Lion King or anything but I think it is a really great film that deserves to be watched.",Mulan
46,CubsandCulture,Struggles to break out of the Disney mold,8,10 December 2020,"There's a lot to recommend about this film. It's animation style is a lot more Eastern-Chinese-than most of the Disney canon. There's a lyrical beauty to much of the vestas and characters. Likewise, the story-being concerned with honor, duty-is quite different from much of the Disney films. The film really tries to escape the Disney mold. The songs have less narrative weight placed on them. And the story is more complex than say Sleeping Beauty.Yet this came out at the tail end of the Disney Renaissance and it has a lot of the same tropes, abet better deployed than most animated films. Mulan has not one but two animals friends in cricket and her horse. Mushu-a wonderful, engaging character generally-is very much in the Genii mold of comedic sidekick. I wish the directors were given a freer hand by the studio.",Mulan

It was a story about a lady in China who poses as a man and take her father's place in the Chinese army during a Hun invasion. There are themes about fitting in and redemption in it. Eddie Murphy's comic relief dragon character was ok. This will appeal to any fan of animated Disney films, as it has outstanding stories,songs, and characters.",Mulan

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.Ming-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the 'Shrek' franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.Animation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.I do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable.",Mulan
50,MissSimonetta,A girl worth fighting for,8,16 June 2020,"MULAN is one of those movies that I don't count among my favorites, but I still enjoy watching it now and then. It's a pleasant movie, a gem from late in the Disney Renaissance that benefits from its mostly understated strengths: Mulan is a great heroine, the art style evokes Chinese watercolor painting, and the songs are lovely. The ""girl power"" theme is presented in a non-preachy manner too, a rarity in current Hollywood movies which feel the need to hammer their points home. Mulan doesn't need to give speeches about why she's badass-- we see it in her actions, courage, and intelligence. About the only element I dislike is Mushu, but even he gets a good line in now and then.",Mulan
51,noralee,Delightful Animated Girl Hero who Breaks with Disney Traditions,7,8 November 2005,"""Mulan"" is not quite a chick flick and it's much better than ""Pochantas."" It has terrific animation and I forgot I was even watching animation. The script has some funny lines. The music is not great (the writers didn't ring any bells with me as to their past work) but good lyrics. I was disappointed that the music wasn't as Asianish as ""Lion King"" is Africanish. And the final rap is a bit off-putting, though the segue into the Stevie Wonder song was fun.Eddie Murray isn't Robin Williams but he's fun. At least they do use quite a few Asian actors' voices - Wing Na Wen (""E.R.""), George Takei (""Star Trek""), B.D. Wong (""Oz"") Pat Morita (""Karate Kid""). I think ""Mulan"" is the first Disney animation post-Katzenberg and there's a couple of digs at him and responses to the criticisms of how he did the girl stars. There was a lot of criticism of how Katzenberg personally insisted on Jasmine in ""Aladdin""s impossible Barbie shape and ""Mulan"" takes that on with a line about how stupid it is to want such a narrow waist. Definitely a much more positive body image movie than under the Katzenberg regime. There's no dead mother syndrome here, well for Mulan anyway. The Captain's mother isn't mentioned. Not only is there a mom, but even a grandmom. The father is still Freudian - he's wounded. All the Disney dads of daughters have some incapacity or other or tragic flaw.Refreshingly, there's no wedding at the end with birds chirping as a canopy. The courting is assumed and the grandmom invites the captain to live there forever--but Mulan shuts her up. (originally written 7/23/1998)",Mulan
52,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Pure Disney magic,9,15 July 2006,"MULAN, in my opinion, is pure Disney magic. If you ask me, what Mulan (voice of Ming-Na) did was absolutely brave. If my father were in the same situation, I'd probably do the same thing. I really enjoyed the music, especially ""True To Your Heart,"" by 98 Degrees and Stevie Wonder. Also, I was surprised to see that Eddie Murphy was in this as the voice of Mushu. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film that's pure Disney magic to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",Mulan
53,adamjohns-42575,Not for me,3,5 September 2021,"I feel that the content was perhaps too adult for a cartoon, too serious for the fun element that Disney usually brings and it makes it easily forgettable. I had only seen it once before and could remember nothing about it and I'm already struggling to recall it after just two days. I certainly couldn't tell you how any of the very forgetful songs go.Perhaps it will work better as a live action version for children who are slightly older? I will have to wait and see that one, but for me it reminded me of 'The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor' (2008), 'The Great Wall' (2016) and basically any other film set in China when the Huns were invading. Certainly nothing special.It just didn't have that Disney magic and seemed like a lesser film made by one of the competing companies. Even the bad guy seemed like something from an after school cartoon in the 80's with his grey skin and orange eyes? I also felt that Mooshoo seemed a bit displaced. Just the style of his character was badly juxtaposed with the oriental setting, you can dress him up as a dragon, but he's still Eddie Murphy. It was good to have some comic relief however, although he might as well have been a donkey?The message of equal rights is important, but gets a bit lost as a silly, frivolous thing. It's almost as though they're not bothered about getting that message across, like it's just a gimmick to make another film.It is easy to watch, but not exactly gripping and the soundtrack is so meh, that I'd never be able to name identify it for a quiz.I do think it's a shame, because these later ""Girl Power"" films including 'Pocahontas' (1995) and 'Moana' (2016) just don't seem to have had the time and money spent on them like those of 'Beauty And The Beast' (1991) and 'The Little Mermaid' (1989), although I know there are plenty that would disagree with me, but I challenge you to write your own top Disney list and see where they land?I think representing everybody is important, so every film should be given it's all regardless of the subject matter.",Mulan
54,rbverhoef,Another great Disney,8,19 May 2003,"I can't think of a single animated feature film done by Disney that I don't like. For some reason they never bore me and they never feel the same.

'Mulan' definitely belongs to the best ones.Mulan is a girl who doesn't do much right. For the honor of her family she joins the army instead of her father. She takes his gear and runs off. She pretends to be a man and does the training to go to war against the Huns who invaded China.With some nice new songs, great music by Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful animations this is a real Disney.

56,Spleen,Truly great except for ONE thing ...,9,1 July 1999,"The depth of talent at Disney is frightening.  It's interesting the character animation here with that in ""The Prince of Egypt"" - no contest at all.  Every character in ""Mulan"" is well, brilliantly, perfectly animated, and many great animators at Disney didn't even touch the project.  A writer here who said that the animation ""lacks detail"" merely betrays his (her?) ignorance.  One must distinguish between character design and animation: the former is what a still drawing of a character displays, the latter is the art of moving a character around.  The animation was full of detail.  I felt that every one of the 24-per-second frames conveyed something of value. The character design, on the other hand, *was* deliberately simplified, but I don't see how anyone could deny that this approach was both beautiful and fitting; and since everything (backgrounds and effects animation) had the same stylistic simplicity, the characters were more solidly in place than they usually are in animation.(The effects animation was creative and also streets ahead of ""The Prince of Egypt"".  As was the use of computers.  Watch the Great Wall scene closely: you might be able to *deduce* that computers were involved, but you certainly won't feel that they were.  Computer imagery has been misused with ghastly results in everything from ""Aladdin"" to ""The Phantom Menace"". Finally someone has it right.)I won't comment on the story - I'm still moved by it, but then I'm a sucker for that kind of thing.  I'll get to my one complaint.  It's not the music. Yes, the music was ultra-1980s with the odd pentatonic scale; but that's not intrinsically worse than being ultra-1990s with the odd pentatonic scale, and it has the advantage that we know immediately the worst about how dated it will sound (less dated than you'd expect).  No: my problem is Eddie Murphy.  He is painfully unfunny and his introduction made me sigh wearily. He doesn't belong here.  I don't have anything against comic relief, but Disney should have trusted their animators to provide it.  When Mushu is funny, it's the animators' doing - and on those occasions the humour is not at odds with the story.That one criticism pains me to make.  Swallowing ""Mulan"" whole, Eddie Murphy and all, it's still a fine movie and a reason for optimism about the future of hand-drawn animation.",Mulan

You read about the Juan-Juan or Hulagu or Attila, seems to me that they were portrayed as being far worse by the Romans, Chinese, Arabs etc. Remember it's only a cartoon.Nice voice work by the lead, by Weinstein, Osmond(singer), Sulu, Mr Miyagi, etc. I don't see much wrong here you know?

61,Lady_Targaryen,The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.,8,21 January 2006,"One of the reasons why I like Mulan so much, is because she is independent and braver than many of the female characters from Disney, who looks always to be searching for a man to be the reason for them to live or to be happy. Mulan is lovely, but also a tomboy what always gives her problems. Since the story takes place in a China of more than 1.000 years ago, women from that time, more than in the present days, needed to have an outstanding behavior all the time and with everybody.Being the only kid her parents had in a time where women didn't have many rights,Mulan is pressed to marry with a good catch. One day, she is going to see the matchmaker but everything goes wrong,since she is clumsy and not very graceful. Being accused that she '' will never bring honor to her family'', Mulan stays sad and depressed, and so stays her parents. But the chance to change that awful prophecy comes quick when the Emperor's men started to call one man from every family to serve in the Imperial Army: since Mulan's father was no longer young and healthy, Mulan reported to the army with a new name and looks. But she needed to make this a secret, because it was against the Chinese laws to a woman be a soldier, so, with the help of the dragon of the family called Mushu,one of the coolest adventures from Disney's starts.",Mulan

To match the visuals is the animation which is well done I always enjoy hand drawn animation it really gives you respect for the art work in this film plus how the artist study the landscape of China.The voice acting is very good and there is a lot of passion in the cast performances.

64,MartianOctocretr5,Mediocre effort at telling Chinese folk tale,4,29 April 2012,"Not really poor, by anybody's standards except Disney's, that is. This movie shot for yet another in a long line of breath taking animation extravaganzas for the famed studio. It fell a bit short.The movie has many scenes of wide shots, enormous structures, army multitudes, and feeds its dialog with plenty of ancient Chinese wisdom. But there is little involvement for the audience where the central characters, especially Mulan herself, are concerned. In a movie about a woman who impersonate a man in order to become a soldier, that is integral to invoke interest. But the story never pulls it off; at best, Mulan comes off as a spoiled rich daughter who whines to herself, and sneaks around regardless of the consequences. It's difficult to accept her as a heroine of ethnic diversity (as was intended, it seems) when the character sounds more like a modern western middle-school girl talking on her like cell phone. The Chinese folk tale character was lost in translation somewhere.By the time she does her super hero routine in the battle scenes, it only evokes a ho-hum response: did we (yawn) beat the bad guys, yet? Most scenes from the film are too over the top to be taken seriously. Others are forgotten soon after seeing the film.The film has its moments, but it's among the weaker movies by Disney.",Mulan

So, about a month ago I saw this movie on a channel and thought that it was worth showing to my nieces and nephews. They loved it and in a way I was transported once more into the past as I danced in the living room, with an imaginary Mulan.

68,blott2319-1,"Solid story, but needs to lose some of the kids stuff",7,4 August 2020,"Mulan is an entertaining tale of a young girl who takes her father's place in the Chinese army. I think what I appreciate most about this film is that they don't spend a massive amount of time on her possibly being discovered. There's one scene that creates that kind of tension, but otherwise she remains hidden until the movie is ready for her to be revealed. The rest of the time she's just treated like any other soldier who is trying their best to become an effective warrior in the battle against the Huns. I like the training sequences, I find the other soldiers that she meets to be charming, and I'm always a sucker for those scenes when the instructor presents a seemingly impossible task and our protagonist figures out how to make it happen. The film manages to condense the war down to a single moment, but I thought it was a surprisingly effective way of making our heroine a savior on such a grand scale that it allows people to ignore centuries of tradition that minimize the role of women.Where I think Mulan suffers to some degree is that the creators felt beholden to the Disney animated tropes. The small cricket and dragon are not important to the plot and mostly provide slapstick comedy breaks. I'm all for Eddie Murphy being silly in an animated film, but the tone of Mulan feels less suited to his antics. In fact, I suspect the live action remake of this film will be one of the best because they will probably excise Mushu and Cri-kee from the script. The musical numbers are good songs, but they also feel a bit unnecessary in this story. I wouldn't say they bothered me, because the tunes are catchy, but I didn't think they needed to be there. My only other complaint about Mulan would be that the entire film feels a bit rushed. This might also be based on the fact that they were trying to meet some Disney animated movie standards, and keep it under 90 minutes for the young kids. I just felt they could have used a little more time to let some aspects of the story breathe and develop some of the characters a bit more. However, Mulan works quite well as a film, and it also looks great. This is definitely one of Walt Disney Animation Studios' successes.",Mulan

70,sharky_55,"Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns!",8,23 October 2015,"This is one of the excellent animations from the Disney Renaissance that mixes Chinese legend with the typical Hollywood elements, but unlike many animations it weaves them together well. You never really see Mushu as anyone other than the wisecracking Eddie Murphy (just as evident as in Shrek, although it is a little more appropriate there) but he manages to create humour and show that he cares for Mulan in little moments such as the assistance in the training montage. The three stooges in Yao, Ling and Chien-Po provide the other comic relief, and they do it well. How lovable and gentle is the giant Chien-Po? (Beef! Pork! Chicken! Mhmm!) Then there are the elements of Chinese culture that do not overburden the narrative but provide a strong basis for the conflict within Fa Mulan. The idea of saving face means her father is too proud to let a woman take her place in the army, and that same sentiment is seen throughout the society. The soundtrack is as good as any from the Renaissance. We first get an inkling of how out of place Mulan is in the opening number Honour to Us All, which is a playful percussive piece that uses Asian influenced guzheng and flute to match the physical comedy of Mulan's incompetence in the female domain. That is later backed up by the heartfelt Reflection by Lea Salonga. In Blossoms, it starts off slow and meditative, before the orchestration and fanfare create a powerful moment in the storm where Mulan takes off with armour and sword, aided by the slow but tense beats of the bass. The centrepiece however is the rousing I'll Make a Man Out of You, everyone's favourite Disney song that gets you out of your seat. It is simply impossible to not feel pumped up by this montage; the beat is infectious, the lyrics are ridiculous, the sing-along potential unlimited.The animation style is simple enough and the art design elegantly creates the Han period. There is a stunning wide shot within the battle scene where Shan Yu charges as a single solitary figure behind the rest of the army amongst the snow, before Mulan creates an avalanche and the scene becomes a literal ocean of flowing snow. I am reminded of the chaotic wildebeest stampede in Lion King only a few years back, and here as well 2D animation becomes 3D, and the scale and theatrics of the entire action piece are spectacular. It is here that Mulan shows her heroics despite her gender, and that also being the cause for her exile. It becomes easy to recognise the bravery and courage of Mulan in such a male dominated society. And just beneath that, there is the little domestic conflict of her parents wanting her to marry off to a suitable match. This was an entirely different era; without Mulan there would be no Merida, no Rapunzel, no Elsa and Anna. Mulan follows the same sorts of formulas that many kids animation films still follow today, but despite some rather pained humour in some parts (the entire character of Chi-Fu, especially with the accent, is rather embarrassing, and Mushu gets a little weary at times - although the grandma is just absolutely precious), underneath there's a genuine narrative with some pretty important themes going on. And there's always something for the kids to sing along to.",Mulan
71,vip_ebriega,"One of the best animated movies ever. A ""Best Picture"" movie epic made as an animated feature.",10,7 June 2007,"My Take: Yet another Disney classic. Impressively animated and beautifully told. Epics have always been one of Hollywood's most regular films during the golden age of film making. Epics are done in very high budgets, and at the time, one of the most astonishing. Another powerful Hollywood genre, is animation. It was powerful as well, that it earned an award slot in the Academy Awards (""Best Animated Feature"").What's great about ""Mulan"" is that it combines these to staples in Hollywood in one very satisfying movie. The film is based, as I've heard, on a poem about a typical village girl who, in favor of his father, joins the Imperial army on resent against the invading Huns. Disgused as a man named Ping, Mulan sets on an incredible journey, and finds herself changing the course of history forever. This movie interests me for the fact that it is done in great skill, as if the producers were making a live-action epic. The films moments of war matches the very moments of those on big-screen live-action epics. The score by Jerry Goldsmith, one of my favorite composers of all time, gives his best by providing the music, and of course it was great. But when Goldsmith scored this, he wasn't focusing on an animated movie score, but as if he was scoring, perhaps, a David Lean epic. ""Mulan"" has always been one of my favorite animated movies. Perhaps, it may just be one of the best animated movies ever. A ""Best Picture"" movie epic made as an animated feature. If David Lean were to make an epic and threw in some first-rate musical numbers in, it would have been somewhere akin to MULAN. Rating: ***** out of 5.",Mulan

74,Animany94,At points underrated.,9,6 August 2017,"When I still watch Disney animated movies, it is because I think there is more to them than just great animation and family entertainment. Mulan has shown me that real life issues can be handled in a way so we can translate those problems into a visual delivery. Therefore I will highlight some points for which Mulan should get more recognition.Mulan shows us the generally male dominated culture we live in (the Chinese setting is secondary). Mulan is a good role model for young girls, because she acts instead of just being pretty and waiting for her prince to save her (Snow White and Sleeping Beauty for example). The horrors of war is also visually shown when Li Shang and his army finds the dead bodies of his father and the other soldiers. It is a brilliant scene which seldom is mentioned in various ""scariest Disney moments""-countdowns. Those are the messages I feel are underrated. Now for some quick technical aspects I see as great. The Hun army's run down the mountain side is incredible, when the crowd in front of the emperor's palace bows is also great and the scene in which the Chinese army finishes the song ""A Girl Worth Fighting for"" and discovers the burned down village. However, I would have liked to see more of the terror of the Huns. Shan Yu was not that memorable (I still find him scary, though).",Mulan
75,ajs-10,Much better than I Expected... Especially 'Donkey'...,7,16 April 2011,"I don't watch many Disney films these days, I've probably outgrown many of them, but I took an exception in this case. It had been recommended to me and so I thought I'd give it a look when it came up on TV recently. I was pleasantly surprised, a strong story, some nice animation and a few decent songs thrown in not too shabby. I'll give you my more detailed thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please go training with the army while I write the next paragraph).Mulan is a spirited girl who, having failed to make an impression with the matchmaker, is looking for some other way of bringing honour to her family. China has been invaded by the Huns, lead by the very tough and evil, Shan Yu. An army is being raised by the Emperor and Mulan's father, Fa Zhou, is chosen as one of the conscripts from their village, but he was injured fighting for the Emperor before. He insists he will go, but Mulan has other ideas. Stealing his armour and his sword and taking her horse, Khan, she sets off to join the army in his place, hoping she can pass herself off as a man. The penalty, if she's discovered, is death. To help her on this quest, the family ancestors, inadvertently, send Mushu, a small dragon with ambitions to improve his position. A lucky cricket, Cri-Kee, also comes along on the adventure. The soldiers are led by Captain Li Shang, the son of a General and a very handsome man. Calling herself Ping, Mulan is befriended by three soldiers, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po, but can she pull off this charade and will she bring honour to her family? Well, you probably guessed it, I'm not going to tell you here, those Spoiler Police will be after me if I do.I found this film surprisingly good, some great animation, a really good story and some pretty good songs along the way. The only let-down (for me) was the inclusion of the voice of Eddie Murphy as Mushu. Whenever I hear him now I think of 'Donkey' from the Shrek films. Don't get me wrong, he has some great lines and does his stuff very well, but I just kept seeing 'Donkey' in my mind's eye. The film started very strongly with a nice set-up and it was looking good until the 'comic relief' is brought in ('Donkey'). It's then a struggle for the narrative, which is very good by the way, to fight its way past the comic japes of 'Donkey'. Fortunately, it does and we end up with a pretty good film that's entertaining, funny (thanks 'Donkey') and, at times, quite dramatic.Decent performances all round, Ming-Na did a good job as the voice of Mulan, ably backed up by Lea Salonga who did the singing parts for the character. B.D. Wong did a nice job as Li Shang with Donny Osmond doing the singing parts. The voice that really stood out (for me apart from 'Donkey') though was Miguel Ferrer as the voice of the evil Shan-Yu, he was really menacing and made you believe in the character. Honourable mentions go to the voices of; Harvey Fierstein as Yao, Gedde Watanabe as Ling and Jerry Tondo as Chien-Po. I would also like to mention George Takei who had a nice little cameo as the voice of the First Ancestor.Over all a pretty enjoyable film with lots to admire. The animation of the scene where the Huns are attacking down a snow-covered hill is quite spectacular. Would I watch it again? Yes, I didn't find 'Donkey' all that bad at the end of the day, and, who knows? I may even see him as a small Chinese dragon one day Recommended.My Score 7.3/10",Mulan
76,brookenichole-98054,Amazing!,10,18 August 2021,"I love Mulan! It has intense moments, great comedic timing, romance, music, and heart-warming moments. What more could you ask for?

It may not be as strong as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King, but it's a lot better than some of the later films in the early 2000s (except Treasure Planet, Lilo & Stitch, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and The Emperor's New Groove).The story is great and the way they made a Disney princess become a hero is what made it work. The comedy is well thought out and Mushu, the dragon, is very funny as the comic relief. The pacing is fine, the dialog is pretty good. The characters are pretty good too and the voice acting is top-notch. Ming-Na did a solid job as the beautiful Mulan who determines to save her father's life by replacing him in an army. Donny Osmond is charming as General Shang, the villain Shan-Yu is a frightening villain and is easily one of the best out there. Like I said before, Mushu is funny thanks to Eddie Murphy's great voice work.The songs may not be as memorable as the other Disney scores, but they're fine enough for me to listen to. Especially ""Reflection"", which is a lovely little tune I will sing forever. The best part is the animation. The look of China, the emperor's palace, and the mountains are great as are the character animation.Overall, Mulan may not be as solid as the three films I've already stated, but it's a childhood classic that has been stuck with me for a while and would be looking forward to watch it again. Thumbs up!",Mulan
78,silvermistvio,One of the best animations of all time. A must watch.,10,10 May 2019,"Mulan is one of the films I watched when I was a little girl and also it is one of those films I love to this day. I don't know whether Mulan is just a legend or she really existed in the real world, but she is kind of a hero to me. I love her story of taking his father's place and went to war. It's so touching.I only know the Chinese version. So, I don't know her name really is Hua Mulan, or the surname is something and Mulan, but if it is, I'd say Disney got it wrong. I really don't like the surname Fa. Whenever I hear that surname Fa, it makes me annoyed. So, I prefer Hua.What makes me love Mulan is of course the story. And also it's amazing original score, especially, the tune of that scene where Mulan prepares herself to go to war and takes horse and leaves home. That scene is also one of my favourites.I think the original story doesn't have anything about dragon which is Mushu in this film. Disney put that part by themselves. But that part is also good too. Wherever Mushu appears, I find it quite funny. That's why I love Mushu.All in all, Mulan is an amazing animation which will never get old. Even it is, it's like old but gold. Hence, Mulan is one of those animations that everyone must watch at least once in their lives.",Mulan
79,kenandraf,Average Disney still rates a classc!,10,23 October 2000,"This is by no means an average Disney effort but like I said,an average Disney still rates as an all time classic.Nobody can beat them in the family/animation genres.What makes this one average as opposed to it having been one of the best was the fact that I found the animations a little rough.They could have made more spectacular background effects.They had ancient China for scenery and that would give them leeway for much more spectacular scenery.I wanted more attention to detail in this area given the animation technology available today.Also,they could have made Mulan a little more stronger looking.More of a stronger look and personality could be done for women without compromising their female qualities.There are many amazon/warrior type gorgeous women and a lot  of them,contrary to stereotipical beliefs,are Asian too.How many chances does Disney have to focus a movie on east Asia.They should have been more responsible wih their portrayal of scenery and people of this great land in this regard.But other than this point,and given how many other things could have gone wrong,Disney once again did a bravo job.Not shying away from exotic cultures and taking on women's rights issues are very commendable and really educate the world's children.The little dragon stole the show too and I was laughing so hard!I forgive the producers regarding the music becouse good musical compositions are very very difficult to come by and you do not just create top quality music any time you want.Great music is very precious and people must realise this fact.So we must appreciate what ever great music we got from this movie(like ""Reflection"").Creatng great music is very spur of the moment and pops up unpredictably.Ask pro composers and they will tell you.But other aspects like visual animation can very much be controlled big time.Particularly now when hand drawn art is backed up by computer animation technologies.Peace out......",Mulan

81,emm,Just one of hundreds of reasons to watch a Disney movie.,7,24 February 1999,"It'll be hard not to recommend any movie from the folks at Disney, be it a vintage classic or cartoon minus the recent stinkers. MULAN shows what the Mickey Mouse cartoonists can do with a setting where samurai warriors and concubines rule. It's been practical as always to show off familiar renderings of hand drawn art just as with past animated films, and can remain timeless in years to come. As long as stylish techniques apply the basics (like THE PRINCE OF EGYPT), the flat 2-D cartoon film will stick around longer. Even more, you can notice the 3-D effects that stand out as realistic. How many warriors on galloping horseback can you spot? With this being mentioned, it isn't stunning anymore once you saw THE LION KING for the first time. That one was incredible in detail. The story of our young mistress becoming a bold fighter in disguise to bring back peace and family honor is astounding for a Disney creation, and sounds like a step above previous summer efforts. Still, it's another kid's tale filled with the usual instances of comedy relief and sing-along songs that remain a pure delight by Disney's trademark standards, but remember that grown-ups will appreciate the entertainment too. You can't beat the Magic Kingdom for delivering wholesome quality ""family"" fare. MULAN is another excuse to be satisfied with Disney's tradition of excellence. The world can be a better place to live, if you just feed the kids a huge Disney video collection. But that's good, right?",Mulan

83,msbreviews,Mulan is one of the most culturally significant movies Disney has ever made!,8,3 September 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)2020 brings us yet another Disney's live-action remake. After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short.This is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming.As with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith's music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney's best animated flicks ever.However, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I'm genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it's hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan's (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father's spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules.Ming-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula.Now, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I'm sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don't think ""oh, that's Mushu"". I think ""that's Eddie Murphy"". It's a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney's trademark humor, so the tone's balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he's the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny.All in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character's arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one's self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can't complain too much. It's a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.Rating: A-",Mulan
84,moviesleuth2,"Great Disney movie, but not up there with the best",7,22 May 2009,"During the 1990's, it seemed that every year or so The Walt Disney Company would come out with a new animated masterpiece. After the breathtaking ""The Lion King"" in 1995, the quality of the films decreased, with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""Hercules,"" and, their worst feature (although ""worst"" is a relative term), ""Pocahantas."" With ""Mulan,"" that trend was reversed (though the legacy of hand-drawn animation came to an end with the dawning of Pixar), at least temporarily (I haven't seen ""Home on the Range,"" though it bombed at the box-office, ending the legacy).While ""Mulan"" may have reversed the trend, it fails to match up with Disney's undisputed masterpieces. That being said, it comes close. The animation is astonishing (though the human figures are not as beautifully rendered as in ""Beauty and the Beast""). It features a number of standout songs, and a few hilarious sequences. The voice characterizations are solid, with Disney making the right decision to use voices that work the best, and not those who are the most famous. The villain is vicious, but doesn't top ""Aladdin's"" Jafar. In short, ""Mulan"" is very good, but not the best.During Imperial China, the villainous Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns has crossed the Great Wall of China and is moving towards the Forbidden City, destroying everything in their path. The Emperor (Pat Morita) orders that one man from every family must serve in the army against Shan-Yu. This poses a problem for the Fa family. They don't have any sons, which leaves the ailing patriarch, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) to serve. However, his daughter Mulan (Ming-Na/Lea Salonga) knows that he cannot fight, so she poses as a boy and goes in his place.""Mulan"" covers a lot of issues, none of which are taken TOO seriously: cross-dressing (how neither the MPAA nor the social conservatives have a fit about this being in a family movie is beyond me), honor (not quite taken to a stereotype), feminism, conscription, the nature of identity, and so on. Nevertheless, neither the script nor the directors have any intention of pushing some sort of agenda with these ideas. The only reason why any of these issues are addressed is to tell the story, and that's why this film succeeds.Of all the Disney heroines, Mulan may be the most three-dimensional. She's not the first girl not to be lady-like (that would be Belle from ""Beauty and the Beast""), but she has the most depth. Mulan is more of a tomboy than anything, and that makes her a very interesting character. This is taken seriously (she will be executed if she is caught), and it's also taken for laughs (whenever she tries to act ""manly,"" and a disastrous encounter with the Matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes), which is nothing short of hilarious).The other character that has to be mentioned is Mushu, who is voiced by Eddie Murhpy. A failed guardian, Mushu is demoted to waking up the ancestors and the guardians. After a catastrophe, Mushu finds himself in a peculiar position: if he succeeds in getting Mulan home safely, he may be able to become a guardian again. Internet film critic James Berardinelli likened Mushu to Robin Williams' Genie in ""Aladdin."" While I see the resemblance, I prefer the Genie to Mushu, if only because Williams improvised his lines to better effect. Still, Murphy does great work, and he has a number of hilarious one-liners.There are other great smaller characters as well. The wordless cricket has some great scenes with other characters. The tiny but outrageous Grandmother Fa (June Foray/Marni Nixon) has some hysterical scenes as well. And the three soldiers who become Mulan's friends, Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo), and Yao (Harvey Fierstien) serve as more comic relief.""Mulan"" has some problems. Some of the dialogue could have been rewritten, and the difference between Mulan's speaking voice and her singing voice is immediately noticeable. Most noticeable of all is the rather plain look of the people. Disney has a way of drawing the human figures to fit the culture it is portraying (like in ""Hercules"" and ""Pocahantas""). ""Mulan"" is no different, but more work should have gone into them.As it is, though, ""Mulan"" is a lot of fun for both kids and adults.",Mulan

excellent movie
I first saw this movie as a little kid, but I still enjoy it now that i'm 22. I consider this to be one of the first GOOD movies to come out of that greedy capitalist hellhole called Disney in years. Some of the arguments against it have been ridiculous.""It's racist!"" Oh come on people, it's supposed to be and adventure/war movie, not a remake of Ghandi! The Huns are bad, the Chinese are good because that's how it was in the ancient legend. A movie like this is not supposed to put political correctness before entertainment.""It's discriminating against men!"" Lighten up, please. I'm a guy and I wasn't offended by this. It's from Mulan's perspective, and I think it's safe to say she was somewhat prejudiced. Besides, Shang was cool. There was nothing wrong with him.""It's too violent!"" I hate to break it to you, but war happens. Yes, there are fields of bodies. Yes, the bad guys kill people. Yes, it might scare little kids. But seriously, the evening news is way more violent. These things happen, and if your kids never know about it then they're going to be pretty freaked out when they first encounter the real world.In short, Mulan is a great movie for anybody who doesn't want they're kids to live in a bubble. It's got action, romance, friendship, the whole works, and would have been great even if it wasn't animated.",Mulan
88,dilipbts,Mulan,8,10 June 2020,"Mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national hero/heroine. Although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, Disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. As a Chinese myself, I know the mulan story like millions of Chinese people do. Some people (espcially Chinese people) may not like the Disney version of mulan simply because Disney didn't stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. Not only did i have no problem with Disney's decision to make modifications to mulan's story, I actually kinda appreciate that they did. Cuz Disney's retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. I mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in Disney's mulan. In the Disney version, Mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient Chinese society, where a woman's value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. So naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number ""reflection"" that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. This song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and I'm a guy! This song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. And now back to the movie, there's a lot to love about Disney's mulan: the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. The story is smoothly-paced and very believable. You have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. And I think Disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real Chinese people instead of the classic Disney characters that we used to see. And they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful Chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me! And the opening of the movie is probably one of the most brilliant among the Disney animation features. I was completely blown away when i first saw it in the theater. Although Disney didn't completely stay true to the original mulan, it stayed true to the spirit of the original story and the spirit of china in most part! And as Mulan being a Chinese story, i think Disney did its best to make it look like and feel like Chinese, and i really appreciate their effort. So thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!",Mulan

90,baileycrawly,Underrated!,9,15 November 2020,"Mulan is one of those Disney movies that really slipped through the cracks in the sense that I knew it existed, but there was never any desire to watch it.Until today.Mulan is a fantastic film. It's beautifully animated with some gorgeous action sequences, the voice talent is spectacular, it's got some infectious ear-worms that are guaranteed to stick with you after the film has ended. It serves up comedy and heart in equal measure in true Disney fashion, as well.Mulan, for those who may not know, tells the story of a young woman who disguises herself as a man to fight in a war against the Huns in the place of her elderly father, looking to honor her family. It's not an ""ugly cry"" kind of movie, but it's genuinely heart-warming. You want to see Mulan succeed and honor her family, and it builds to a rewarding conclusion.The only issue the film really has isn't the fault of the film at all, but rather of the lack of versatility in Eddie Murphy's voice and acting talents. It's hard to listen to much of Mushu without hearing Donkey from Shrek, and it ultimately takes away from the viewing experience. Sure, Eddie Murphy does the goofy, big-mouthed sidekick pretty well, but I think this film would've gone over much better for me with someone else in the role. Given what he would go on to do, it's too distracting and, while it's not a direct reflection on the quality of the movie, it is a reflection on the capabilities of the talent hired to do the film.It's disappointing that I'm only just now seeing Mulan, but I have absolutely no regrets in watching this film. It will most definitely be on my re-watch list going forward.",Mulan
91,chrisbrown6453,"Disney comes through with yet another animated masterpiece, and this one goes by the name Mulan.",8,17 June 2002,"Mulan is a young girl in ancient China. When the Huns start attacking the country, the Emperor orders one member of every family to join the Chinese Army and defend the country. The one member must be a man, but in Mulan's family, the only male is her injured father. Not wanting to allow her father to die, Mulan dresses like a man, and escapes into the night to join the war. To protect her, the ancient elders of her family ask the great Stone Dragon to watch over her. Unfortunately, the great Stone Dragon is destroyed by the little tiny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy). So with Mushu and a small cricket by her side, Mulan heads off to help destroy the Huns.
I think we can all guess what happens. Mulan, although a woman, manages to save the day. The plot line isn't really a surprise when you break it down. And the animation is, by now, expected to be great, and Mulan certainly lives up to the great Disney tradition. It's the story and the feeling you get that makes this movie so wonderful. Disney went through a lot to make sure it's depiction of ancient China was accurate. From the decorations on the walls, to the matchmakers, to the great honor in family, Disney manages to show what the country of China was like, and in many ways, still is today. Following the Disney tradition, there is a strong female character, this time taking lead. There are the over the top bad guys, and of course, the comic relief. Eddie Murphy was just down right hilarious in this movie. I wish they had showed more of him. The songs were sort of a change of pace, with Matthew Wilder and Jerry Goldsmith doing the honors, and not the venerable Alan Menken. The music was good, but the lyrics in some of the songs were weak. The reason I feel Mulan was better than recent Disney fare like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame is because it had a much more lively feel to it. Hercules was very dark, animation-wise. Everything was centered on the color blue, so it didn't feel alive. And The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a more adult story, and some of the scenes were very dark and broody. Mulan took a simple plot, put it in ancient China, and made it very colorful and fun to watch. It was light, and ""Disney"" enough for kids to enjoy, while still being adult enough for the parents to enjoy. Overall, I'd say Mulan is definitely one to watch. Disney animation has done it again.",Mulan

What she ends up getting is Mushu, a disgraced dragon and Crickey, the ""lucky"" cricket. Together they must work to save her lie, for discovery means death. Can Mulan help save China and defeat the Huns?Though the setting of this movie is not one with which Americans can relate, the message surely is, that women can become anything they want. What I love about this movie is this fact is not crammed down your throat as it oft is with movies that have come out since. In fact, unlike many of the feminists in newer movies, you find yourself rooting for Mulan from the very beginning. This movie does a lot for female empowerment without emasculating men in the process. Having Eddie Murphy voice Mushu was the icing on the cake. I am a straight, white man, and I absolutely love this movie and watch it probably more often than I should.",Mulan

The story development is perfectly knit for the main character to shine and mature into a hero who saves the world. Mulan is different from previous Disney princess because she is inspiring and telling girls to become a better person herself rather than finding the right prince.

97,kdnor2011,One of my favorite Disney Movies,8,1 February 2012,"Mulan seems to be one of those Disney animated movies that everyone seems to like, but no one seems to love. It was one of those movies of the Disney Renissance that didn't get the praise of their earlier movies like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Lion King. Well personally, I love this movie, I actually prefer it to Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid, two movies that tried to be femenist. Sure there are a few things that I can nitpick about, but this movie just works so well for me.First the characters: Mulan is a kick-ass heroine that is the best female lead Disney has had in, well, ever. Seriously Belle, Ariel, Jasmine, Nala, Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, they all did almost nothing. Mulan on the other hand killed Shan Yu with a fan. All the army members are good, if kind of forgettable. Shang is a hero who doesn't upstage Mulan. Mushu can be really Funny at times, but probably the funniest character was Mulan's grandmother.Next, the animation: It may not be Disney's best animation ever, but it still looks really good.The songs: while a couple are kind of forgettable, I absolutely love ""I'll make a man out of you."" And both ""A girl worth fighting for,"" and ""Reflection,"" are good as well.The action scenes are fun, the comedy really works, and it has a good message about femenism.",Mulan
98,mdm-11,More Disney Magic -- Historically Accurate Legend,8,1 June 2005,"There are too few ""girl"" heroes in stories. According to Chinese legend, Mulan, the only child of an aging soldier, disguised herself as a male to take her sickly father's place fighting evil invaders. While in the disguise of a loyal soldier to the emperor, Mulan falls in love with her commander, who does not suspect the deception. When Mulan saves the entire fighting forces, what she managed to hide up to that point is discovered: She is a girl masquerading as a man. Rather than punish Mulan with death, the commander sends her away (presumably to die). In the end Mulan is honored with a medal for bravery by the Emperor himself. Although ""only"" a female, she had saved the entire empire from certain doom.The finest moment is the scene where her father says ""I am proud to call you daughter"". Legend or history, this is a fine example of telling a story centering around a girl, rather than the countless tales celebrating boys as heroes. Like so many other recent animated Disney features, this is yet another gem in the treasure chest of Walt Disney Studios.",Mulan

100,mmallon4,Yin & Yang,9,2 October 2020,"Mulan is one of my favourite films in the Disney animated canon. A movie which is rich in layers and characterisation topped with brilliant songs and great action, there's barely a single minute that doesn't leave me enthralled. The titular heroine herself is a unique specimen in the canon of female Disney protagonists. For one she actually has living parents and contrary to the likes of Belle or Ariel, Mulan is not a free spirit. She is a clumsy, unpunctual, clutz, and a bit of a tomboy who doesn't fit the gender norms society would have expected of her at the time as she tries to find her place in the world. She is also an adult who still possesses some childlike tendencies, perhaps most memorably and heart-warmingly when she unexpectedly hugs the Emperor of China. Mulan is also under the Disney princess brand even though she has no royal lineage? - Money talks.Mulan is one of many examples throughout history of women disguised as men in combat roles, albeit in the case of Hua Mulan being one of disputed historicity. For many western children, a film like this would be their first introduction to Chinese culture and history beyond what they would see in a Chinese takeaway. I'm not Chinese so I can't atone for well the film represents the culture. From a historical accuracy perspective, however, the film presents the Huns being a threat during the film's setting of 600AD (Tang Dynasty) when they were actually active several centuries prior to that. Likewise, fireworks and gun powder wouldn't come along until the 9th century (also Mulan's family owns a pet dog?). - Embrace it in a charmingly inaccurate Cecil B. DeMille way.Mulan is a classic heroes' journey as she begins the film within the familiarity of her village but soon has a call to adventure into the unknown, only to eventually return to her village, a transformed individual. Disney films often being at the ire of snooty left-wing academics due to their highly archetypal nature rooted in the conventions of storytelling which are often dismissed as passé and cliché formulas of storytelling in favour of the deconstruction of myths. Thus I have no desire to see a live-action remake of Mulan in the age of woke Hollywood. In relation to the dreaded ""F"" word of feminism, I'll reference an unlikely source in the form of Knuckles the Echidna:
""You know Amy, any time someone brings attention to the breaking of gender roles, it ultimately undermines the concept of gender equality by implying that this is an exception and not the status quo.""Ok, Mulan is a film which is guilty of this itself with irony-laden songs such as Honour To Us All and A Girl Worth Fighting For which would normally lead one to groan with their intentionally un-pc lyrics and little visual accompaniments such as Mulan unintentionally wielding the umbrella like a sword during Honour To us All, but I'm never left with the impression the film is propagating an agenda. Mulan's journey was never some feminist quest to prove a woman can do anything a man can do and stick it to the patriarchy - rather it was to preserve her father's and by extension her family's honour. Mulan doesn't want to change how her society works, but rather just cheat its conformist rules.Hollywood has a modern tendency to portray female characters whom are just women acting like aggressive men who can beat up hordes of bad guys and lack any sense of femininity. Mulan is not like that and film demonstrates her lack of physical strength and demonstrates how she has to rely on her mental capabilities to survive. Mulan figures out how to climb the pole and retrieve the arrow with the stone slabs of strength and discipline not with physical strength but with ingenuity, by wrapping the ropes attached to the slabs around the pole as an aid to climb it. Some suspension of disbelief is required that no one in the boot camp isn't more suspicious that Mulan's alias Ping is not a man, even as an effeminate one at that (one way the animators got around this is by having Mulan's face shape change when she is dressed as Ping). To use a symbol of ancient Chinese philosophy, Mulan's balancing of masculine and feminine is akin to the balancing of the yin and yang.From the opening shot of The Great Wall, Mulan captures an epic scope on par with some of the best live-action epics. The colour scheme throughout the film is a thing of beauty complete with many a fantastic shot or creative transition. Mulan was the first time a Disney movie dealt with warfare with the sequence involving the soldiers discovering the village following a genocide (after such a joyous upbeat song) being one of the darkest Disney moments. Likewise, the beginning of the battle sequence on the mountain as Shan-Yu and his men appear over the hill is reminiscent to the film Zulu (that avalanche sequence breaks many laws of physics but no less exciting). The film's scope reaches a peak with the film's climactic money shot of Mulan jumping of the palace roof in the Forbidden City with fireworks behind her. The only criticism I have for the animation is the repetition of very similar character models in the Chinese and Hun armies as well as in the Forbidden City. Although the appearance of these models on screen is very limited it's a bit odd whenever I took notice of it.Jerry Goldsmith's East Asian influenced score is among the strongest of his career. The track titled Haircut is a piece of synth to die for! How does a piece of music from 1998 sound like it was recorded for a movie made in 1985? None of the musical numbers in Mulan fail in their grand, sweeping nature. The film's classic Disney ""I desire more"" ballad in the form of Reflection (how did she wipe away all that makeup with on rub of her sleeve?) helps to signify Mulan's vulnerability. Yet Mulan's greatest musical accomplishment is the hair raising I'll Make a Man Out of You, the militaristic training montage ballad with its larger than life lyrics and memorable one-liners from the supporting characters - it can proudly stand among the likes of the Rocky IV soundtrack as motivational music to get you out of any rut.
The other area where Mulan surprisingly exceeds is the comedy as one of the funnier Disney animated films, managing to balance the laughs with the high stakes drama. Eddie Murphy as Mushu doesn't surpass Robin Williams in Aladdin but his antics and many memorable quotes give him one of his best career roles. However I find the film's funniest moments come from Mulan's attempts to act manly - it's not a body swap comedy without a scene in which the character's cover is almost blown when they are out of costume (underwear with hearts on it, anachronism much?). The only tonal criticism I would levy at the film is the end credits song True To Your Heart, an upbeat pop song which comes out of left field after Mulan's heartfelt reunion with her father and family. A good Stevie Wonder jam but it feels out of place.The film's villain Shan-Yu is a two-dimensional bad guy but is still quite entertaining from how overtly evil he and his falcon companion are, with Shan-Yu himself being complete with fangs and muted colours. I also love how his scenes end with him delivering a spine chilling message (""How many men does it take to deliver a message?"" - oh, badass!). He's not the main source of conflict in the film so his two-dimensional personality doesn't interfere with the film. However, he does display one revealing character moment during the film's climax in which upon discovering Mulan was the solider from the battlefield who took out his army, in an ironic twist he is the only character in the film who does not belittle Mulan for being a woman.Mulan's world is populated with many great characters from the badass, no-nonsense general and love interest to Mulan, Li Shang (those abs are body goals) of whom it turns out is a bit socially awkward when it comes to women. Mulan's dignified father Fa Zhou on the other hand is best summed up in the powerful shot of his attempt to walk without his aid and disguise his limp to accept his conscription assignment. Although absent for most of the film, he is at the film's heart as the instigator of Mulan's journey (""I know my place! It is time you learned yours!""). The question does have to be raised if the military would actually have this old, physically weak man on the battlefield but rather to act as a general due to the fact that he appears to be a well-known figure at the boot camp and thus likely respected and held in high esteem. I do also adore the trio of soldiers - the fiery voiced Yao (thank you Harvey Feinstein), the childlike Ling and the pacifist Chein with their camaraderie and failure to act like tough guys and lady killers. Then there is the slimy pencil pusher Chi-Fu, the film's love to hate character. I like how he is given some humanising moments like his picture with the Emperor on his desk and his claim that he apparently has ""a girl back home who's not like any other"". Even The Emperor of China himself is full of wisdom and memorable quotations worthy of Confucius himself.""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all""",Mulan
101,Trevor-Kerensky,One of the best Disney films!,8,12 April 2018,"After watching Hercules, I wondered what was next for Disney. Then this showed up. I'd never even heard of the Chinese legend of Mulan before the movie but it sounded like an interesting premise. And since I'm Chinese-American, albeit half, it's like visiting one of my homelands. Plus, it has a female protagonist who isn't just another damsel in distress or another girlish princess. This is the heroine that works on so many levels. Not only that, there's also a wisecracking dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy, and one of the few films I enjoyed of his) and many Asian-American actors and actresses in the cast (some of them are actually Japanese, but they did well). And some decent songs and the themes of family and honor. It's quite the feast for the eyes. If you are in the mood for a strong female lead or an Asian-styled adventure or both, look no further!",Mulan

The only part I enjoyed was the beginning when the mother & Grandmother were preparing Mulan for a ceremony. That was nice because it was about tradition and family.

105,christian94,"Enjoyable, time and time again",10,26 September 2008,"If the Lion King is the best Disney ever-achieved, they came very close 4 years later with this simple tale set in ancient China. With a extended writing team that looks like a football lineup, the animated retelling of this Chinese legend came up both crisp and fluid. The final 88 minutes cut is well-pace and packed with poignant and witty dialog. Add in the a apropos lyrics that are equally funny or soul-searching deep and you have a movie that has almost as much quotables as people in China for your kids (or you) to try to memorize.Then you have the multi-nominated score and songs themselves, including the cornerstone ""Reflection"" to give the musical aspect a strong supporting presence. The story is heartfelt and Mulan's character easily memorable. Her story and struggle bring us right into the narrative and the scenes and songs are expertly edited to have the desired emotional impact.The voice talent is noteworthy with Eddie Mucrphy stealing the show as the sharp-tongued mini-Dragon, Moshu. He brings such impact to the his clever and laugh-out-loud funny banter that his presence is pivotal to the movie's overall drama-comedy balance. Ming-Na gives a believable, less-assured take on the woman who tries to pass herself of as a man, but clearly has a big gap to overcome (Mulan; not Ming-Na!) The animation is superb from beautiful scenery, captivating action sequences, to nuanced facial expressions. If you doubt that this is one of the best animated pictures ever released just look at the 10 wins it received at the Annie Awards. I would go even further and say that it clearly simply ranks as one of the best movies and still is after half a dozen viewings since I first saw it in theaters ten years ago.Long Live Mulan!",Mulan
106,cinephile-27690,The Animated Movie Disney Released In My Birth Year!,10,24 August 2018,"My 20th birthday is today, so in honor of the year, I am writing reviews of movies from that year.Disney released this movie, Mulan, 2 months prior. And it's very good.If you have not seen this movie, you must not be near my age. The story, then, if that is the case, follows Mulan, a Chinese girl who is upset that she can't ""honor"" her family, which is proven after failing the expectations of a matchmaker, who is seeking a proper husband for her. So when war is proclaimed, she disguises herself as a man to fight in place of her sickly father. What positives can I say about Mulan? Well, it's a Disney movie. It has a great story, songs, and the animation is great.It has some of the most memorable songs(Roger Ebert would disagree, it lost half a star from him for that.) Such songs include: Reflection, A Girl Worth Fighting For,Honor To Us All,and my personal favorite: Make A Man Out Of You.(Which made me cry as a kid, for some reason.) Most of the cast members you may not not know, Ming-Na Wen(known for The Joy Luck Club) voices Mulan.(Would you have known that had I not told you?) The most famous one stands out, not just for his popularity, but since it's this comedian's only G-rated movie on his resume. Mushu, Mulan's dragon(not lizard) partner-is voiced by none other than Eddie Murphy. Yes- Raw, Delirious,Harlem Nights, etc.-then Mulan.Mulan is a great Disney movie-and if you have not seen it, then you should.",Mulan
107,adampkalb,Mulan is the perfect film for challenging gender norms. That is why I reviewed it during international women's month.,10,10 March 2021,"I might feel nostalgic for Mulan or A Bug's Life because they premiered the year when I was born, but that could just be a special coincidence, and I really like them because I am moved by their message and realize they do not get enough attention like other Disney or Pixar films around their time. Fa Mulan was terrific for sneaking into the war against Shan Yu and pretending to be a man to prove women can fight equally as well as the men. Ming-Na Wen, BD Wong, Eddie Murphy, James Hong, Miguel Ferrer, June Foray and many others brought their A-game for voice acting. If you liked Fa Mulan, you should check out her daughter Lonnie in the Descendants trilogy, particularly in the second movie. Since the Descendants films are live-action despite being based on animated Disney, and Ming-Na Wen was also a great live actress in Agents of SHIELD, I believe Ming-Na Wen herself would be a much better live-action Mulan than who actually played Mulan in the live-action remake. It really helps more that Ming-Na Wen is old enough to be Dianne Doan's mom, and Dianne views her as a motherly figure because she enjoyed Mulan as a kid. Another big reason why I admire Mulan is because the film writers at Disney did a much better job with Chinese culture here than when The Aristocats had a Chinese cat play a piano with chopsticks.",Mulan
108,kevinxirau,A great movie that entertains with honor.,10,21 December 2011,"This was a very interesting direction Disney went in terms of storytelling with their classic charm. Based on an actual Chinese story, Mulan is unlike anything the filmmakers of Disney ever created.Mulan herself is very unique compared to most women from the Disney universe. She's no princess or pretty girl wanting more or waiting for a happy ending, instead she's a bit of a social outcast stuck in the traditional family norm the Chinese had with women at the time who just wishes to be herself and prove that she's no obedient little housewife-to-be. Mulan takes a big risk and ends up becoming the heroine China needs to save them from the crafty and ruthless Shan Yu, who leads the invading Huns.All the other characters are a true delight. Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Mulan's guardian dragon, is a hilarious character who proves to quite helpful on certain occasions and brings much of the comedy into the film. Captain Shang is tough and determined, but even he has his insecurities, which makes him a unique love interest to Mulan. The villain Shan Yu is not someone to be trifled with or underestimated because he's cold, calculating, and powerful as heck. The trio (Yau, Ling, and Chien-Po) are really fun to watch as they hilariously interact with other characters such as Mulan, Chi-Fu, and even each other.This movie has the perfect blend of amazing art design, epic action scenes, wonderful music that complements the various scenes, memorable songs, great comedy, intricate storytelling, flawless animation, and excellent themes. The filmmakers must have really pushed themselves to make this into an awesome and unique edition to the Disney franchise and they weren't too afraid to get a little dark and make the situations the characters are going through as real and sometimes as dangerous as possible, both the menacing Huns and their own somewhat strict social traditions.Overall, this is indeed a rare flower that blooms the most beautifully. I consider this to be one of the greatest Disney films ever made, if not the best. It is highly recommended that you check this movie out and marvel at the cultural and cinematic wonder that is Mulan.",Mulan

By tradition, I mean a girl who decides to go off and become a soldier to help fight because she feels her father wouldn't be able to.Along the way you get a comedic dragon thing who at first doesn't think he's powerful enough but ends up being so in the end.

111,lyubitelfilmov,Feat of a Brave Warrior or Honored Masterpiece of Evil Corporation,10,10 January 2021,"Musical, adventure, drama, comedy. Do you remember, dear viewers, that in ancient times, when mammoths still walked the earth, Disney studio was associated with the words ""quality"", ""humor"" and ""great pastime for the whole family"", where viewers of all ages will find for themselves what something close to his heart? Yes, my dear old men, there was a time! This is now Disney mired in such a brown substance with its subpoena and openly careless attitude to business that it earned me the nickname ""Evil Corporation"". But let's not talk about the sad, and therefore - let us remember today one of the well-deserved masterpieces of my childhood, which I can revisit an infinite number of times - and again have pleasure, as in the very first. I don't remember the circumstances of the first viewing, but it was definitely in childhood. And here is my brief opinion - Honored Masterpiece of the Corporation of Evil. In this review we will consider the expressive advantages of this cartoon, because, firstly, I don't want to talk about the shortcomings here, and secondly, they are insignificant here, and the word ""absolutely"" does not affect the general perception. Now, let your humble servant dwell on the merits in more detail.
So, here they are:
1. Told Story - this musical, intertwined with several genres, tells the story of a brave girl Mulan - a character from a Chinese legend (about the reality and fiction of which is still debated), who went to war instead of her elderly father. And everything would be fine, but if the deception is revealed, then death and shame for the whole family awaits her. Of course, the story is retold with a Disney touch of talking animals and is filled with songs and humor. I also note that Mulan is shown as a strong and courageous girl who took such a step to save her father. At the same time, she remained a wonderful girl, very emotional. I fell in love with this heroine, and empathized with her throughout the cartoon, absolutely in any situation. A strong heroine who is loved by boys and who has been admired by a girl for more than one generation. And do not care, as it was in the legend, because it is very similar to the truth.
2. Animation - I definitely indicate this item in cartoons with classic 2D animation, since 3D is already frankly enough, not to say even worse. Characters, environments, backdrops - everything looks amazingly beautiful and does not age. I assure you, and in a hundred years, this animation will delight a new generation of viewers and bewitch with its beauty.
3. Chinese entourage - since the legend of Mulan is Chinese, the creators tried to immerse the audience in this era, applying a minimum of details, but strengthening the emphasis on being of that time (strictly patriarchal). And they succeeded. I literally ended up in Ancient China, threatened by nomadic tribes from the north. Clothes, design, music - all this perfectly conveyed the entourage.
4. Songs - I estimate them according to the Russian version, because I did not watch the cartoon in the original. But I know that the Corporation of Evil is very vigilant about the localization of its products in different countries, and knowing the experience of the Russian branch, you can not worry about the quality, because the translation is not verbal, but it perfectly fits the motive and meaning of the songs. The songs themselves turned out to be strong and emotional, and even touching, funny, and so on. Plus, the dubbing actors obviously tried, and in their voices you can hear the whole gamut of feelings that a person is capable of. Bravo!
5. Images - fear of the enemy, the ominous image of a strong enemy, the monstrous consequences of a bloody battle and much more - the creators of the cartoon managed, in the absence of blood or scenes of a cruel slaughter (after all, a cartoon for family viewing), to convey all this through the images, actions of the characters. Using a minimum of details, the creators were able to demonstrate and make us feel emotions, including fear for China and the heroes.
6. Humor - Evil Corp would not be Evil Corp if there was no humor in their cartoons. And he is here, there is a lot of him, and he is amazing. In some moments you experience a real ""Spanish shame"" for the heroes doing such that at least stand still fall. The lion's share of humor is formed here by the dragon Mushu - my favorite. Of course, some jokes were adapted to Russian realities (naturally in dubbing), and this added points to the cartoon from the viewer in the CIS and the former USSR.
7. Characters - each is worked out and interesting, both first and second plan, from a soldier to the Emperor himself. But Mushu takes a separate place. For without him it would be definitely boring, I assure you. Mushu is a cartoonish loser-merry fellow who hooks the audience from the very first appearance in the frame and does not let go until the very final credits.
A little about the main characters:
1. Fa Mulan is an ordinary girl who, in a difficult time for the country and family, committed a daring and deadly act - disguised as a man and went to war. An awkward, daring, strong and courageous girl. A real warrior maiden. Who did not become a radical feminist, but remained a woman capable of feelings and excessive emotionality. She will be admired by both boys and girls. A worthy image of a strong girl who evokes sympathy from start to finish.
2. Mushu - a dragon, the keeper of the family, who went to help Mulan in order to help her cope with an impossible task. A treasure trove of humor and a source of endless laughter. The classic loser who gets the chance to make something memorable and benefit. In the original, he is voiced by Eddie Murphy himself, but in Russian dubbing he speaks in the voice of Valery Kukharyoshin, whose voice will always remain with me.
3. Li Shang is the commander of the recruits, in whose ranks Mulan has arrived. I must make from yesterday's peasants a combat-ready army, which must defeat the invaders who attacked China. He shows himself as a skillful mentor and a courageous commander who knows how to make decisions in difficult situations. Well, the romance has not gone anywhere. It looks appropriate and evokes emotion and joy.
There are still many heroes that deserve mention, but if I list them all, I will ruin the viewing for those unfortunate people who have not yet watched this wonderful cartoon.
Of course, there are some comments, but they, I repeat, are insignificant and do not affect the overall impression. Let's call them small shoals that are inevitable when working on an animated film.
This masterpiece has a sequel to ""Mulan 2"", but it is frankly weak, and keeps only on Mushu's humor, but even it is better than that squalor called ""Mulan"" 2020, which I don't even want to talk about, otherwise the pressure will jump up and you will have to drink funny pills ... Therefore, let's imagine that the story of the brave warrior Mulan ended in this cartoon with a predictable and well-deserved ending.
As a result, we have a real masterpiece of the Corporation of Evil about the brave girl Mulan, with an excellent script, great surroundings, great humor, catchy characters, great songs and stunning animation.
My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Mulan

113,patrick_dunne,How animated films should be,8,30 December 2005,"I must say, Mulan is a truly wonderful film. It used to be one of my favorites as a kid.It deals with ancient China, where only men could join the army. To fight the invading Hans, the government recruits men to join the army to fight the invaders. This affects Mulan's small family. Mulan is reluctant to have her father fight in the war, because she knows he could easily die, so she steals his armor and sword and sets off to join the army as a man. She later gets a companion named Mushu (voices by Eddie Murphy) who is a miniature and funny dragon sent by the ancestors. And so our story begins.I really loved this movie. First of all, he story deals with a semi-sexist community, and one of the people who are considered lower, stands out from the rest. I found this to be very dramatic, and it reminds me of other movies, such as Rabbit-Proof Fence, where the despised half-castes run away from the cruel camp. This is a similar situation.Second of all, the film is very funny. Eddie Murphy shows off his comedic talents when playing the role of Mushu. It's rather silly at times, but it doesn't hurt to laugh. I thought one of the funniest scenes was the bath scene, but it was pretty gross though.Third of all, the animation is superbly detailed. The characters do look a bit funny, but the artists defiantly took their time in making this wonderful film.Mulan is very powerful, very detailed and very funny- just like all animated films should be. I don't know why this isn't in the top 50 animated films. It's wonderful.8.5/10",Mulan
114,Vimacone,Disney's Greatest Heroine,8,12 August 2017,"I've considered Mulan (and Tarzan) to be the last great animated Disney features to be produced. A lot of comparison has been made between Mulan and Pocahontas in that most fans and critics consider Mulan to be a better film. While I do think Pocahontas is a great film, I do agree with that sentiment. Both films feature a strong and admirable heroine that break the mold of what their respective societies expect them to adhere to. Mulan is more successful in portraying the theme of breaking the gender roles. And Disney didn't whitewash the historical realities of how women were treated in Ancient China, which conveyed the theme so much stronger. Another aspect that makes Mulan a much more enjoyable film are the songs. Virtually every song (even the deleted songs) are very catchy and memorable.The supporting characters are also very memorable. Eddie Murphy seems like a curious choice for Mushu, but it works so well. Chein Po, Ling, and Yao bring comic relief to the trials of basic training and also to the dramatic war scenes. Disney had gone back to the appealing cartoony designs, reminiscent of their golden age animated features, at the start of the renaissance. However, like their films of the 1950's, they moved toward realistic designs for the human characters starting with Pocahontas. I believe this was a factor as to why Pocahontas was not as successful as say Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, because the drawing style lacked that Disney charm. In Mulan, only the comic relief characters (i.e Chein Po, Ling, and Yao) are drawn with that exaggerated cartoony look.Speaking of gender roles, this is a Disney film, billed as a ""Princess"" film in later years, that can be enjoyed by both genders. In theory girls can appreciate the theme of hardship and pressure she goes through to fit the criteria of becoming an ideal woman and bride, while boys can enjoy the thrilling war scenes that are so brilliantly executed. But, both boys and girls alike can admire Mulan for her feat of twice taking down an entire army (almost single handed) that threatens her country.",Mulan

117,Dawalk-1,A Disney Heroine Like No Other.,10,26 March 2012,"I remember first seeing and hearing previews/ads of this Disney animated feature over a decade ago, when it was set for a summer release back in '98. Before then, I hadn't heard of the original Mulan legend, so I would've thought that this was a completely original film by Disney and there was no inspiration for it to take and adapt or remake. I never saw this in theaters, which looking back on it, I wish I had, but I would own it later when it was brought to VHS since my mother bought a copy of it for me from a Wal-Mart and I'm so glad she did. And since seeing this, it has been my most favorite or just one of my most favorite Disney animated movies. One of the reasons why I love it so much and what I love about it is the fact that it has a heroine who appeals to both the male and female genders. The eponymous character seems to be the first to do so and I think that's such a great thing. Another is it's a jam-packed, action-adventure thrill ride that will keep y'all on the edge of your seats. I like the fact it was made at the now defunct Disney Animation Studio in my home-state, Florida.What separates Mulan from the other Disney heroines is when she decides to fill in for her father by joining the army (since she has no brothers and he has no sons). She proves that women can be action heroes too. Evidently as she succeeds in helping defeat the Huns. For me and probably most other males, she's my most favorite Disney heroine and I'd also consider her to be the best. The moments with Mushu and Cri-Kee are great too. I wish the former's musical number could've been possible to make it into the final cut of the movie.Anyway, if no one reading this has already seen it, I recommend to see it for yourselves. It's not to be passed.",Mulan
118,Dragoneyed363,My favorite Walt Disney animation,10,16 August 2008,"There are some films you remember the exact day that you watched them for the first time because they had such an influence on you. I am certainly one of the people that enjoyed Mulan to a fuller extent than those who still thought it was great, because I think it is near perfect. The first time I watched Mulan I was simply overwhelmed by how much I fell in love with the heartwarming story, strong character of Mulan and the musical numbers. I still remember the place and time, and how I felt.Of course, what is to be expected of Walt Disney animations? Most all of them offer some form of entertainment or positive influence on the viewers and have now for ages. The Disney renaissance was well needed and brought along a handful of lovable new installments. Mulan is just a film that I got carried away from beginning to end. My favorite scenes are the Match Maker, river and climax scenes. I also find the quote, ""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all,"" to be one of my many favorite quotes that are out there.Anyway, if you were let down by Mulan, I strongly suggest giving it one more go. I teared up, chuckled and smiled through most of the movie and it was because it is an extremely well done animation that is probably my favorite of the Walt Disney classics and masterpieces line or even animation film in general. I really do love it that much.",Mulan
119,wwe7961,"Very good, but its flaws keep it from achieving greatness.",9,18 August 2010,"Mulan is very well animated, very well written, and very well done. I want so much to give this a 10, but there is a few flaws that take away so much from it. First is the character Mushu. If they had made this without any Mushu this would have been a 10, but he is there. He takes away a lot of drama from the movie. In ""The Hunchback"" there was a comedic gargoyle character that took away a lot of drama, but he didn't take up a lot of screen time. Mushu has a lot of screen time to soak up a very large amount of drama, and he isn't even funny. I really wish they took this a little more seriously. Another flaw is Mulan's man voice that is painfully awkward. Although it isn't in the film as much as Mushu so it isn't very bad. Then there is the romance of Mulan and Shang. With other Disney films the romance is needed for the film. With this film we don't need a romance. This film is supposed to be inspiring girls to be who they want to be not just ""girls"", but Mulan ends up falling in love with someone just like every other Disney female. Despite these flaws I really like this movie. It just had so much going for it, and it fell short of what it could have been.3 and a 1/2 stars out of 4",Mulan

121,C22Man,Dragon!,7,12 October 2015,"Coming out at the end of the Disney renaissance and after a small string of films with a more mixed reception, Mulan can be seen as the film that called back to the earlier films of this period. It took a simple yet interesting premise and gave it plenty of emotional heft as well as comedy in an attempt to reconnect with a general audience. For the most part it is successful in achieving what its original aim with even a little extra added because of its more cultural and historical basis. Though it is by no means amongst Disney's strongest works, it is a very well made and frequently enjoyable piece.The story of Mulan is loosely based on the Chinese legend of the same name. It sees the Huns invade ancient China and the man of every house must join the army. Because Mulan's father is too ill to fight she takes his place and must impersonate a man or face the death penalty if found out. This is a very good premise and an area Disney has only really touched on before, with the themes of fighting for your country and war. It gives us something Disney enjoy which is a main character fighting against adversity and here it's in more ways than one. It also successfully walks the fine line between seriousness and comedic, balancing both out effectively within the story.Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) isn't that interesting yet she is meant to be a normal person thrown into a crazy situation and for that she's just fine, she is likable and does get plenty of comedic moments. The army men, including the likes of Yao and Ling, are amongst the best things here. They all have distinct personalities and provide a number of laughs, whenever they're on screen its always funny. Li Shang is just okay and doesn't have much development, but he is heroic and easy to route for on the whole. Chi-Fu is a good snobbish character and James Hong is always enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of Mulan's dragon aid Mushu and think his more self-aware comedic stylings don't fit the film at all, Eddie Murphy provides a lot of energy but it just doesn't work for me.The animation is really impressive. It is very smooth and scenic for the most part, while managing to get across the beauty of China. When I think of the film I think of a lot of wilderness and mountains which always look picturesque throughout. The scenes showing the vast army of the Huns are very striking too. It also perfectly lent itself to the comic scenes and allowed for some amusing slapstick. The situation comedy is a highlight. Mulan's interactions with her fellow troops are usually hilarious and the comedy flows very naturally as a result, most of it is timeless slapstick or smart wordplay as she tries to hide her identity and fit in. The action scenes are good too. There is a genuine tension to the battle scenes and the film manages to convey just how big they are.It isn't all without issue however. Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) is such a dull villain. Apart from an intimidating design there is absolutely nothing of note about him. I can't recall a line of his dialogue or any actions of his. He shows up to fight and that's effectively it, he has next to no development. The music isn't that good either. None of the songs featured where memorable and most of them didn't really fit the scenes that they were playing over. Jerry Goldsmith's score is serviceable, but again it's just a touch forgettable overall. We don't get as much of a look at the Chinese culture as I'd have liked either, but then that isn't really the films focus. Mulan is another very entertaining Disney film. It doesn't go as serious with the story as it could have done or try anything new with it, but what it does do it does very well. The animation is excellent, the story is something a bit different and the situational comedy was a lot of fun. Of course some characters are a bit unbalanced, the villain is extremely weak and the songs are forgettable. Yet none of these issues truly harm the rest of the enough to damage it as a whole. It is nearly always engaging and delivers more than enough amusement throughout.",Mulan

125,haydenluz,Mulan,7,4 July 2020,"Mulan, directed by Tony Bancroft & Barry Cook, produced by Pam Coats, is one of Disney's first princess', that really wasn't a typical princess, doing princess duties. Bancroft & Cook incorporated great heart-warming messages throughout the story, treating the kids like actual human beings, and also giving the adults something to be invested in as well. This was a big ""girl power"" movement, but I was perfectly okay with it, due to it's soulful messages. The story was pretty fast paced, but well balanced with the tones & amount of content they had to offer.Hand Bacher & Ric Sluiter did an amazing job bringing these fantastic drawing-animations to life, backed up with favorable voice overs by Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, and more! All of these characters looked great, and were balanced out very well; nobody shadowed one another. Mulan was an empowering character, that you really cared about because she embraces such an influential & powering figure. Her character development meant so much to the film, with the narrative flowing through her actions. Mushu is one of my favorite Disney characters of all time! He is the needed comedic relief of the film, having just enough screentime to not over saturate his character. The antagonist is pretty creepy, while posing a huge threat at all times. All of the additional side characters were great! They were all great fun, and utilized nicely, complimenting Mulan.The screenplay was very serious at times, but managed to sneak in well placed comedy, and deep dialogues. The dialogues were wise and witty, with a few silly moments to really even out the tone & pacing.The score by Jerry Goldsmith had a great battle score. Goldsmith had a hand from Stevie Wonder, Mathew Wilder & David Zippel, to help create these near-classic songs.Overall, this movie was very unique, and it truly paid off. Disney classic!",Mulan
126,Lupercali,"Very good, but not classic.",7,8 April 2004,"Mulan is just about Disney's last really good 'classically animated' style movie (at the time of writing). The whole thing has a pleasing, mildly intoxicating atmosphere to it. There are scenes of considerable emotional impact, mixed with sufficient comedy and adventure, and some really nice landscape shots. Eddie Murphy, though slightly annoying as the salamander-thing, has not at this stage developed into the outright annoying animated voice-over artist which would come with Shrek.The film could have strayed into irritating political correctness (G.I. Jane in Ancient China), but it pretty much manages to avoid this. If you can put up with the silly American accents used for Chinese characters, I'd recommend Mulan. Particularly in a visual sense, it has the feeling of a traditional oriental painting at times. I'd sooner watch this than anything by Disney I've seen since (though nearly most of them have been at least alright)",Mulan
127,datautisticgamer-74853,What Pocahontas wanted to be,8,31 October 2018,"Since I recently saw this movie again during a seminars day at my school, and since I was unsatisfied with my first review of this movie, I have decided to rewrite it. It was a slow Halloween despite a costume-con in my school's atrium, but conveniently it quieted down as this movie began. So why is this movie better than I initially remembered it?The story, admittedly, does utilize some clichés (especially in its twists), but its structure is very solid overall. It flows affably and delivers on the humor, courtesy of its voice acting (I loved Miguel Ferrer's portrayal of Shan Yu) and the way it wrote its comic reliefs. Not only do these reliefs provide some good chuckles, but Mushu in particular is important to the plot due to his fire breathing and mentoring of Mulan. For our characters, we have the titular Mulan as the woman who wants to deliver more than what is expected of her by any means necessary, Li Shang as her tough yet fair CO, and Shan Yu as a genuinely threatening and bad@$$ villain with, again, an intimidating and all-around awesome voice. Most other characters outside of the Fa family, the Emperor, and Chi Fu are either summed up in tropes (Mulan's trio of friends) or just not important to the main story. Our main characters are memorable and complex, just as we expect from a Disney movie. Even 20 years later, the animation still resonates with its depiction of ancient China, its moderately thrilling action, its appealing character designs, its commitment to the humor, and its enhancement of the songs. It's smooth and perfectly fluid to give the human characters realism, and does enough with its effects and stylization of the animal characters to make them believable in their world. The songs are forgettable in comparison to other Disney songs of the period, but they are very fun to listen to, don't interrupt the plot flow, and make the montages easy to remember, more so than the songs themselves.Mulan, at least for me, comes off as one of the few Disney movies where one more easily understands it if they view it as they grow older. Young children may remember the songs, Mushu's jokes, some sight gags, and the action, while older children may point out that Mulan is a solid role model. As such, if your family has children of various ages, this would be a safe bet for movie nights. It is a worthwhile addition to Disney collections, even if VP Pence doesn't think highly of it.",Mulan

133,smashattack,Disney can do better.,5,6 March 2002,"I was somewhat disappointed when I saw Mulan.  The characters looked deep, the plot engrossing, and the graphics and animation pretty good.  What Mulan turned out to be was a movie filled with crummy Disney songs and a shallow storyline.Probably the most interesting character is that of Mushu, the demoted dragon of the ancestors.  He is voiced by Eddie Murphy, who is an excellent actor and shows it in this movie.The plot is pretty well-thought out, but the execution of the plot is somewhat shallow.  Not too much happens within the main conflict, as they train and then go into only two battles.Mulan is quite a good movie if you can overlook its nasty flaws, which can possibly be disguised by the colorful characters.The music isn't all that great.  Some of the songs aren't bad, but I would have rathered the movie be without those.  The composed music is hardly heard in parts, and the battle music isn't as quick-paced as it should be.The good part about Mulan is its good animation and great acting on everyone's part.

134,JackCerf,An Ambivalent Message,5,8 August 2014,"This is not quite the story of self realization and female empowerment that the commercial and internet reviewers are calling it. If she is a role model for the independent girl, Mulan is a very ambivalent one.Mulan does balk at being married off by the matchmaker, she does go off to war, and she does prove to be not only tough and brave but the smartest soldier in her outfit. She twice saves the life of Li Shang's, her commanding officer and love interest, and she kills the chief of the Huns. The Emperor, who says ""A girl like this doesn't come along every dynasty,"" gratefully offers her a seat on the Imperial Council.Having seen the wider world at its ugliest in wartime, Mulan is uncomfortable with her newly won status. She turns down the offer because, she says, she has been away from her family too long. Prodded by the Emperor, the deeply smitten but none too swift Li Shang follows to court her. As the movie ends, it is perfectly clear that she will marry him, with the enthusiastic support of her mother and grandmother, who had despaired of ever marrying her off.Li Shang is brave, conscientious, honorable, from a good family, and not all that smart. You can see him 30 years later in his father the general, a dignified, worthy man who gets his army massacred by the Huns. He is still an excellent match for Mulan and her family, and she is an excellent match for him. He'll love and honor her in very comfortable surroundings as he pursues a career at court. She'll run the marriage and bring some brains and spirit into the Li gene pool. Their sons should do very well. Their daughters are another story. The Emperor sees Mulan as something that ""doesn't come along every dynasty,"" not as an example of half the population of his realm. And Mulan turns down that seat on the Imperial Council. Her family comes first, and she's been successful enough already. She turns her back on her own exceptional quality. Mulan doesn't put on a glass slipper, but she makes her own glass ceiling. If the movie has a message for girls, it is that the wider world of men is a nasty, hard and dangerous place. Having a successful career there when you're young is good because it wins you respect and puts you in touch with a much better class of husband material when the time comes to leave your career behind, go home, and settle down with your own family. Mulan's courage, spirit and intelligence raise her out of the marriage market to which she appears foredoomed in the first reel, only to win her the one extraordinary man whom she deserves in the last.Mulan is popular entertainment shrewdly and successfully designed to appeal to an audience that favors gender equality in principle but is ambivalent about its price. While we'd like our daughters to do well in their own right, we'd also like them to mother our grandchildren. Mulan is all in favor of young women of intelligence and spirit going out to prove themselves in the world run by men, but it is equally in favor of their settling down with the right young man to carry on the family after they have gotten the career thing out of their system.",Mulan

136,thewillt08,Disney's Most Underrated Masterpiece.,8,25 November 2013,"Walt Disney created the masterpiece that is Disney Land and in that came some of the most iconic characters in history. One of the most underrated characters in the Disney Universe is Mulan, in my opinion. Mulan is a strong woman trying to find her place in China. Mulan is a fantastic movie with Eddie Murphy as a funny sidekick, before he was Donkey, and one of the creepiest Disney villains. Mulan is one of the better Disney movies but why does it not seem that way? Why it is not considered one of the best? Well, let's get into it.The story behind Mulan is rather basic. The Huns, led by Shan-Yu invade China for no real reason. I think that is a real flaw in the movie itself. The villains don't have a rhyme or reason to what they do. They just do it. They are evil for the sake of being evil. Shan-Yu leads the Huns and his haunting theme music is enough to scare any kid but still he is overlooked. This movie took a lot of risks for a kid's movie. There is a war going on, many people die, you do not see it but its implied, and the main protagonist is a woman. Now that is not a sexist remark but most of the memorable Disney movies has the lead woman be a damsel and not a strong leader like Mulan. I really like Mulan's character. She is incredibly relatable. She is a young girl trying to find where she belongs. She says it in one of the most memorable songs in any Disney movie. ""When will my reflection show who I am inside?"" She eventually goes to war in her father's place. That right there is courageous and foolish. Women are supposed to stay in the house and make babies in China. They are forbidden to fight in war. She does this anyway, and yet she isn't considered one of the greatest characters ever. Mulan is somebody people can look up to and the movie does an amazing job of portraying her. Eddie Murphy has a special talent for voice acting. Mushu is the lovable dragon that kids enjoy. He brings comedy and many memorable moments. From the first time I saw Mushu as a small kid I fell in love with him. He too is looking to find where he belongs with the ancestors of Mulan's family. The obvious similarities between the two main characters are enjoyable. Thankfully Mushu didn't take too much of the spotlight. Disney is known for its lovable characters and evil villains but also for its music. Mulan captures some Chinese culture in the song in this movie and they are most memorable. The first song is a bit odd if you listen to the words. It is catchy and fun to sing along to but is basically about the worth of women in China. Look beautiful for a guy to want you and make babies to defend the Emperor. It is little things like this that could be why Mulan does not get the recognition it deserves but the rest of the songs make up for it. A Girl Worth Fighting for is a personal favorite along with Make a Man Out of You. I think I know every word. The songs are well placed and when one ends it reaches the saddest part of the movie. It goes from a high point to a low point. It is interesting for a Disney movie to have this much emotion. Mulan has many relationships in the movie. The obvious one with her father and Shang but I particularly like the relationship with the three side characters. I'm talking about the bald guy, the thin guy, and the short angry guy. These three are c0molete opposites from each other and bounce off each other perfectly. They are side characters to fall in love with and quote. They have moments that are classic in the movie too. Overall, Mulan is a great movie that is unfortunately overlooked. People may disagree with me but think about it. You ask somebody what their favorite Disney movie is they probably will not say Mulan. Mulan is extremely underrated and I think it is because it has some controversial parts. The movie itself has everything a Disney movie needs and it also got trashed with a sequel. If you ask me I won't say Mulan is my favorite Disney movie, that is a close one between Hercules, but it stands in my top three with ease. And of course it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I imagine I will get backlash for thinking it is underrated and the reasons I believe so so please respectfully let me know in the comments.",Mulan
137,HanShotFirstGR,"A different Disney Princess, a healthy role model for young kids and a healthy portrayal of feminism!",8,15 April 2021,"Plot:To save her father from death in the army, a young maiden secretly goes in his place and becomes one of China's greatest heroines in the process.Analysis:Disney princesses have always been an inspiration for children -especially girls- and they left their mark on animated cinema. Out of all of them if I had to pick one that I consider her to be the best role-model I would choose Mulan without any doubt. Her powerfull yet sweet character maintains a beautiful balance between a cute girl that is charming and feminine and a dynamic woman who can fight and think equally or even better than any man, it's a healthy projection of women and the movie definetely achieved its goals as it remains a fan favourite even now.The screenplay is perfectly structured to give a proper introduction to society's customs of that age and how people were normalizing the sexism. It was definetely very frightening as a subject because it could easily turn to ""All men are pigs, women are better"" stuff but it actually didn't. Mulan isn't some warrior who outpowers all men and makes them look like fools, it's a girl who is strong like them, she can fight like them and deserves to be respected as a human being not treated as male property, as every woman and every girl who watches this film and learns what is her place in society (side by side with men and equally respected), perfect and satisfying equality through a well-written movie.The star of the film is obviously Mulan but the one who steals the show is actually Mushu. He is very funny, his lines are amazing, his interractions with everyone are beyond description and this was some fantastic job from the writing team that created a side-kick that no one can resist. Eddie Murphy encaptures all the magic of Mushu's character and gives an amazing performance, one of Disney's funniest for sure.The last factor I would say played a major part in this film's success is the music. Not just the good songs that fit this movie perfectly but also the nice score that helps every moment to be more magical, it's quite touching and musically pleasing to watch Mulan as it manages to produce catchy tunes and beautiful melodies to elevate your experience.The only thing that was kinda questionable for me is a certain part of the artwork. I love the old Disney look and many of my favourite movies share this with Mulan but there are a few misses in this particular film. Although, I love the design of the environment and most of the things look quite lovely, I am not a fan of the character design, most of them are oddly shaped even those who aren't supposed to, it feels a little bit too distracting for me, it's not enough to ruin this great movie for me, it's what I would like to be a little bit different to really love this.There is also a slight disappointment in the last battle, there are good elements that include every major character but I just can't find it entertaining enough to be excited. The conclusion is pretty good and I would call it pleasing but the battle is just my least favourite part of the film.Conclusion:Despite some minor flaws, Mulan is a very good movie, a princess that is healthy role model for children, a more dynamic main character that makes the whole movie way more interesting. It's a Disney classic and belongs among those who will be loved and respected by many generations, it maybe didn't reach the Lion King of Toy Story in terms of quality but it's still a great, visionary piece of art that gave us healthy feminist messages in 1998, a truly insane achievement.Rating: 8/10.",Mulan
138,Rumples,"Weak, corny, predictable, etc etc etc",5,9 May 1999,"Never having been a fan of Disney movies I was reluctant to rent this one however my wife was keen and I was somewhat reassured by the rating it had gotten on IMDB! Now I feel somewhat ripped off by my fellow IMDB-ers for misleading me so. This film is horrible and is an insult to a noble Chinese legend. Mulan as a Valley-girl!?! Mushu is nothing but a constant annoyance. The music is alternately bland and inappropriate, the dialogue incongruous, the slapstick un-funny, and the plot transparent. Now I am not a child and did not watch this with a child, but I don't think that it would have improved the experience if I had. Better avoid this one, 5/10",Mulan
139,quiqueperezsoler,"Timeless, Empowering and Touching. Proof that when animation is done right and with care it becomes a fan favorite and classic.",9,26 April 2020,"The 90s were known as ""Disney's Renaissance"" where many titles reached critically and commercial success, some of them even breaking records like Mulan(1998). It is not an exaggeration to say that Mulan(1998) is one of the most original, well-crafted and aesthetically innovative animated feature in Disney's repertoire.From the mesmerizing chinese painting-style opening titles to the stunning animation and sharp character designs, the film holds an aesthetically pleasing style and feel very different to what Disney used to do back then and which stand the test of time. Contrary to computer animation, it's hard for traditional animation to become outdated and it will still resonate the same to newer generations as long as it's done right. That's why the moral and themes of the story must be significant in order for it to have a chance to still be relevant in the future.The film succeeds in both aspects, it provides an endearing, touching and well-realised story loosely based in the famous Chinese legend of Mulan; and a riveting emotive and action-filled spectacle with an incredibly well-composed soundtrack and an empowering message for women. The movie has some elements that could have potentially ruined the tone and craftmanship of the tale being told like the character of Mushu. However, thanks to the well-written jokes, impeccable performance by Eddie Murphy and overall relevance to the plot it provides a funny support character meant to help the main lead to express her thoughts at certain crucial parts of the movie.Disney has been known to add common elements to every Princess tale making it a bit formulaic, elements like animal side characters or mascots and a romantic interest. While these are merely irrelevant to the story and mostly add comical moments to it, in this film all the side characters have a reason to be there and have a role within the story. Except perhaps the dog, which only appears in one sequence at the beginning of the movie and it's never seen again.Furthermore, the first 20 minutes are some of the most intense, well fleshed out and heartfelt moments of any animated feature. With little dialogue and the abundance of symbolisms, songs and wise metaphors, the first act of the movie is able to convey to the audience precisely how Mulan feels towards the situation she is living and the overall picture of women in this portrayal of feudal China.While some views and commentaries found in songs may have aged poorly, the film contains uplifting and encouraging calls to action motivated by honor and identity. THere's a sense of comradery as the training the soldiers go through provide a needed bonding that would benefit them not only in defeating the enemy but also would help them open their eyes and heart.Another very important aspect the movie stands out for is the uncensoring of the more tragic and darker moments involving the enemy and the consequences of war without ever taking it too far.IN CONCLUSION, as a take of a very loosely based portrayal of the legend of Mulan the movie doesn't succeed as much, but as a story of a daughter that went to war instead of her wounded father to not only save his life but prove her worth and find her self and eventually suceeding in doing so bringing honor to her family it's a remarkable movie. Great animation, original setting, inspiring scenes and symbolism, soothing and energetic music and incredible themes. This film does everything an animated movie can do and it does it perfectly.",Mulan

The ending could have been better though. 8/10",Mulan
142,sc8031,Jerry Goldsmith and Donny Osmond failed to make a man out of me!,4,28 August 2008,"""Mulan"" is one of Disney's last ""hand-drawn"" animated works from before it bought Pixar and started exclusively producing computer-animated films and pre-teen pop starlets. The animation here is certainly nice when compared to Disney's television shows, but like other Disney cartoons from this era (Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove) the lines are simple, the colors are a bit flat and the cast seems to be on auto-pilot. Yeah, Mulan isn't a Disney film that I would say was particularly ""inspired"".The musical numbers by Jerry Goldsmith are pretty droll and even offensive (for instance, the fat Chinese soldier character sings about how his ideal woman would know how to cook beef, chicken and pork; you know, like on a Chinese food menu?). Donny Osmond sings the main theme song for Mulan's training montage. I don't like Osmond, but the song is actually flawed by the weak and tepid songwriting, not the vocal performance. Most of the songs here are memorable because they're so laughably awful. I mean, compared to ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"" the songs here are not even in the same ballpark.Eddie Murphy isn't laugh-out-loud hilarious, but he's the only saving grace of the film. He voices a sassy supporting role, Mulan's pet dragon and best friend, and is the only entertaining part of the film. He's a little miscast, but is also somehow the only substantial character. For instance, the villains (here it's the Mongolian Horde, ancient China's consistent historical adversary) have such little character depth -- not to mention humanity. I know Disney films paint the world in simplistic shades of good and evil, but good golly... the Mongolians are depicted here as a collective race of monsters! They're given no incentive or individual reason for existence. And I don't recall seeing any female Mongolians either. Their whole depiction is clumsy and comes across as ignorant. Also, it's kind of weird that Mulan falls in love with a tough guy who, well... beats her into shape. The film's not unwatchable, it's just really mediocre. The use of the CGI makes it clear that Disney was just about finished with their signature (historically significant) hand-drawn animated works. But Mulan comes nowhere close to any of Disney's back catalog. To any parents looking for a good Disney animated film to watch with their kids, go for anything before Pocahontas. Mulan is lackluster in the departments of charm, pacing, songwriting and memorability. I've heard the more recent animated Disney film ""Lilo & Stitch"" was much better, so maybe I should check that out.",Mulan
143,Mario64,A Strong Heroic Tale.,8,31 July 2014,"Mulan came out towards the end of Disney's peak era of animated musicals, which began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. The company released 9 major feature films of that genre in that period, and I rank Mulan is somewhere about 5th or 6th in that pack; that's no insult given how strong most of the films were. This is a quite entertaining, beautiful film, with very good musical numbers, which only lacks in a few story elements and a central heroine not quite as well-rounded as the likes of Ariel, Belle or Jasmine from past films.Mulan, voiced by Ming-Na Wen, can't seem to act as a ""proper"" Chinese lady and find a husband. She decides to take her physically ailing father's place when every family must give a man for war that has come upon them by the Huns. Dressing and acting like a man she's awkward in the training at first, but she eventually becomes one of the most impressive of all the soldiers, while the man leading her and the squad is one she admires and finds quite dashing as well. Along the way she gets some much needed help from a small but determined dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.The film has a nice combination of comedy and action, although they are within a story somewhat clunky at times. This is no doubt a gorgeous film, from ancient Chinese villages to snowy mountain peaks to the Forbidden City. The title character is certainly a strong willed female hero, and mostly it is not by chance but by the choices she makes which determines her fate. Unfortunately she just didn't engage me as a person like any number of other Disney leading ladies; as much as I admired her strength her character basically swung in two modes: awkward bumbling girl and super-brave hero woman. It's a good Disney heroine, but not a great one. The songs are nice, with a couple being fairly memorable.On balance the good stuff in this film far outweighs the minor issues I had. Mulan, even if it isn't one of the best Disney animated musicals, is certainly one that should satisfy those of all ages looking for a rousing and inspirational tale.One last thought: What the heck were they thinking with that first song in the ending credits? It doesn't fit movie at all.",Mulan

146,Jeremy Bristol,"Pretty Good (7/10), and the characters don't break into song and dance.",7,5 June 2001,"Except, they do still sing--as sort of narration for their emotions.  The songs are highly unmemorable (as I sit here writing this, I can only remember the line, ""I'll make a man out of you,"" which is from the very worst song ever including in a Disney film.By the way, will Disney ever have a ""training session"" that will last more than a couple minutes and that isn't put to a song?  They did that to this movie, Hercules, Tarzan (who also grew into an adult instantaneously), and Beauty and the Beast (in that Belle changes her mind about the Beast during a song).One more really bad thing about Mulan--Mushu is a total hinderance.  I'm not just talking about his pop-culture mouth (which someone should have popped), but that he in fact causes more problems than he solves.  Would it really be so much to ask if Mulan could have made the mistake that ""gave away our position,"" instead of having Mushu shoot off a rocket?  At least that way, she's redeeming her own mistake, instead of someone elses, which gives no emotional payoff.  Better yet, why not have the falcon find the line of troops--after all, that's what the falcon is for, right?  It scouted earlier for the general's encampment and brought back the doll, remember?Oh, and the cross-dressing thing at the end was a little too weird--a bit too Fushigi Yugi and not really very intelligent--do you honestly think that anybody would fall for that trick, even if they were really women (especially considering what the Monguls would have done).The best parts of the movie were the references to Japanese cartoons (anime).  When Mushu fries the feathers off of the falcon, it looks like a Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, but is just as likely a reference to the horseclaws from Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind (the director, apparently, is a devotee of Miyazaki).  Another Nausicaa reference--the doll, which is similar to the one that Lord Yupa finds at the beginning of the Nausicaa movie (it crumbles, and Yupa says, ""Another village has died."").  Also, Mulan's hair is given incredible attention, which is not usually the case in Disney films (usually they're just pretty and blow in the wind).  Just watch her hair when she bows in shame after they find out she's a she!Beyond that, there is a good deal of emotional content, though once the possibility of execution is lifted (a life for a life), it is never mentioned again--even though the overseer, who really hated her, could have had her executed at a moments notice once she caught back up with them.  And I'm sorry, but for all their knowledge and art, the Chinese were rather steadfast about their ways and about honor--they would not suddenly become so accepting of women, especially since they are still rather unaccepting of women.",Mulan

This is Disney!
I knew the main plot of the story and I felt the time before the main character go on her big adventure was very long. I wondered if it was OK to be so slow in only 87 minute films. But my afraid was unfounded. It looked like it was redundant at the beginning, but the whole thing was very well balanced. Each episode wasn't too elaborate. Rather, it looks like a shoddy job. But I think it was really an elaborate script. ... She did a great adventure that I felt at the last scene. The Chinese 2009 version of Mulan was also a masterpiece, and I thought this one was as good as that. I thought Zootopia was interesting and I like The Incredible Family.

149,pintaxandre,Better as most Disneys,7,15 February 2020,"An interesting female character with some depth. You don't see that everyday and even less in a Disney.
The animation has not aged well, but that's inevitable in 2020 where the technique has known so much imporvement in the past years.
The film's beginning is the weakest part in my opinion. I couldn't feel invested in Mulan's fate because she acted in such a dumb way that it seemed inevitable she would be in unpleasant situations. But from the point where she begins er training, has a goal and is focused, I was in. The ending is magnificent in every way.
However, I am not a fan of this disney-ish chinese culture. That's personal but Disney bringing its touch to every culture, more particularly one that is so different, is out of place in my opinion.
The music is incredible and the directing is good. A film that could have been better, but is quite enjoyable.",Mulan

She's charming and has a great voice for a kit of the songs. As do the rest. We have to sidekicks and meaning if not a tad over the top villains, and they are playing well, despite a dose of stock.The songs:
All great, all memorable, here we are treated to 3 tracks that are very catchy indeed. They all progress the story and comment on the situation. The standout is easily Make a man out of you.The Animation:
Classic hand drew beauty here. A lot of backgrounds the leap out due to their sheer size, plenty of expressive faces and a nice imperial aesthetic that blends well with the culture however accurate.The story:
Maybe it doesn't hold up as much now or has been done so many more times and better, but a story of female empowerment, especially back then, before it really blew up, should be praised and respected. Also, a character who fights for her family and what's right.Final take:
Not one loved as many others, but it is perfectly fine for anyone really. It has a nice story and good songs and looks gorgeous, but maybe after time, it proves a bit serviceable.",Mulan

She did not to well in serving an old lady, and she had no fun in that. Her family engages the dragon Mushu and the cricket Kriki to get her out of there. At first, she can keep a secret from being a woman. But anytime they notice it, and so she has to leave them. When the army is attacked by another one, she used her mind to get them out of there. And she gets it. In the final battle she defends with her cleverness the Chinese emperor from being murdered, and she becomes a national hero.Mulan is a very funny film. Mushu and Kriki have very funny lines in this movie. My favorite character is Mushu. He was just hilarious.I usually like disney-movies, and this one made no exception.

153,bblack1-699-968577,All He Needs is a Mic Drop!,8,17 June 2014,"The general consensus about this movie is people really like it, and I like it a lot too. I like the story, the characters, the jokes, and the songs. It's not the best movie, but it's really enjoyable and I have a lot of fun watching it.ANIMATION: The animation is...good. Unlike some of our earlier movies, it doesn't really have bright and popping colors, nor does it really showcase China. We get some great visuals of Chinese culture (The Great Wall, white space, ""Girl Worth Fighting For"" number), but we don't really see much else. But the designs of the characters are OK, and the backgrounds are nice. All in all, it's good animation.SONGS/MUSIC: The songs here are pretty good, too. I like ""Please Bring Honor to Us All"" and ""A Girl Worth Fighting For,"" and the sound of China in them. If the animation doesn't totally bring us to China, the music in these songs do. I really like ""Reflections."" It shows us the struggle Mulan is battling in the movie. Of course we all know and love ""I'll Make a Man Out of You."" It's the movie's Number One song: those lyrics, that music, the rhythm - it's awesome! I also really love the ""True to Your Heart"" song during the credits. It sums up the movie, it's a fantastic song, it has 98 Degrees, and it features FRICKIN' STEVIE WONDER!!! That man wrote and sang the soundtrack to LIFE!!...But I digress. The songs are good.ROMANCE: You might be thinking there's nothing to talk about here, there wasn't really a romance here. Actually, this movie has what I think is one of the best Disney romances ever. We get a couple hints that Mulan and Li Shang are developing a romance, but the movie doesn't focus on it. It doesn't try to give us a random, unnecessary romantic moment like ""The Lion King"" did. They don't get married, they don't commit to a relationship, they don't kiss, they don't even talk about being in love. But we know what's going to happen, it does happen, but the movie doesn't focus on it at all. I think that's great!CHARACTERS: I always thought Mulan and Pocahontas were one and the same. They both feel as though they don't fit in with their environments, they have free spirits, they do something radical to change their cultures, and they're looked at as strong heroines...And it's for that reason I think Mulan is just OK. Don't get me wrong, I really like her, but from an analytical point of view she's just like Pocahontas and other typical strong female characters. I also really enjoy Mushu. He gets a lot of laughs, and I like Eddie Murphy's portrayal of him. But I think my favorite character is the Emperor. Why? Because he's crudded awesome! Did you hear his dialogue? He says some of the most awesome things ever! ""No matter how hard the wind howls, the mountain will not bow to it."" ""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all...You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty!"" All he needs is a mic drop! If this Emperor had a mic drop in the movie, he'd be the most awesome character in Disney EVER!STORY: Like Mulan's character, this movie is very reminiscent of the ""I want to be something bigger and better - My heart tells me I have a greater destiny than this"" story. It's not a bad story, I enjoy it; but it doesn't really add anything new. I enjoy the scenes, characters, songs, and romance, but the story has been done so many times. Disney already released this movie three years earlier, only it was set in early America. Sadly, the story did not phase me at all.CONCLUSION: While the movie didn't have a new, exciting story, the characters and songs will still keep you totally engaged. You'll want to see what they'll do, what sort of people they'll become, and what they'll learn. You'll be rooting for all our main characters, and you'll love them. They are totally worth watching this movie. Of course I wasn't able to write about all the characters, but check out the film and see which ones you like the most. They're pretty good and entertaining. It may not give you a lot of culture, at least nothing new; but give this movie credit, it seems to be making up for the possible racist Siamese cats in ""Lady and the Tramp."" Were those cat racist? I heard that argument, but I don't know for sure...Anyway, watch it and see for yourselves. God bless you. BOOYIKA!",Mulan

156,films-22537,My very involved reasoning on why I liked but didn't love this movie,8,22 February 2020,"It seems what makes this movie stand out to most of its fans is the fact that Mulan is a female action hero and not a rich princess, she's Asian and not white and it shows little girls that they can and should be treated equally as boys. However, I'm not a kid, I don't have kids, I'm not a sexist, or a racist, so none of these things affects me looking at this as anything more than just a cartoon. A cartoon that's the intellectual property of a multibillion-dollar company that had nothing more in mind than making the most money they could by exploiting a market of fans dissatisfied with the status quo that Disney themselves perpetuated with movies that had white women waiting for a rich handsome prince charmings to save them. They did those movies when it served them and stopped when it didn't. I don't say that try and sound like I've found out their big secret, I say that to say this movie is just okay to me, because of MY perspective. However, I do respect and understand that there are other ways of looking at this movie that would elevate it to others. But just not me, Eddie Murphy was funny, the villain was pretty forgettable and the love story was so tacked on that if felt like something done in protest, as if they filmmakers said, this is my movie and if you cut it off here it's done, but let it play a few minutes more and you have the studio mandated ending, but I also could be way off.

157,pmcollectorboy,Another great Disney modern,9,25 September 2000,"Modern Disney is kind of a funny thing with me. Their formula, more or less, keeps getting recycled every single movie. Despite this, there are good modern Disney movies, and there are bad modern Disney movies. Yet even with the good ones, there is always some kind of funny aftertaste. Mulan is an example of a great modern Disney movie. I'll point out the good parts first and get to the funny aftertaste later.First, this is a touching and dramatic story. Mulan is only the third Disney movie that was able to touch my heart, The Fox and the Hound and Bambi being the first and second. It is about a young woman's struggle to do what's right and save the life of her father, who for once is a caring but firm man and not some goofball like you see in some of the other Disney movies. This is also about her struggle to find identity, her struggle to persevere, her struggle to be like one of the men, and her struggle against the Hun army and the horrors of war.Now the funny aftertaste. As usual, Disney insists on throwing in a comedic sidekick. While he is funny, it does get annoying sometimes. Some of the songs are good, but others are real snoozes. And Disney's modern formula still hasn't changed any. Disney also still insists on modernisms and pop culture.Despite these flaws, which appear in practically all modern Disney movies, Mulan is still a great Disney movie with a strong story.

166,aizbennett,Inpsirational and uplifting,8,4 March 2021,"Mulan explores themes of honour and loyalty and presents them extremely well. The characters are all really likeable and the comic reliefs are never too annoying. The comedic timing is also perfect and provides some great laughs. Mulan is an amazing character, coming from a simple farm girl to a warrior who single-handedly takes down an entire enemy army. The whole movie is very inspirational, and has some very dark moments. It's one that I've watched multiple times, with more times to come.",Mulan

Filial piety to her father is the cause of the story, but not the ultimate goal. The significance of joining the army is to find the most real self. The truth is very important for both boys and girls, and also an opportunity for Mulan to prove her ability. Success only cares for those who work hard, regardless of gender.",Mulan

169,djfoster,Dramatic core undermined by comic sidekicks,7,6 January 1999,"Like ""Pocahontas"" before it, ""Mulan"" is a sumptuously animated adventure made wobbly by its heavy-handed message against sex role stereotyping.  Yes, we learn, women can stretch beyond their social roles, even fight in combat. Yet, the men are depicted either as noble egotists or dolts.  Worse, Eddie Murphy's comic sidekick dragon is an annoyance, no doubt written because every Disney animated feature must now have a recognizable cut-up to aid their heroines.  Still, the Disney storytelling strength is there.",Mulan
170,g-39554,Mulan,9,10 May 2020,The film tells the inspirational folk story of Mulan's father in the army. The cartoons are also very attractive to children. Disney's films never let me down.,Mulan
171,KingCritic,A Very Solid Film,8,10 September 2020,"It's pretty hard to find something about this film that doesn't work, especially with *yet another* terrible remake by Disney that's come out apparently. First the soundtrack is very strong, and only adds to the gravity of the scenes.The animations great, the characters rock, and the humor is uplifting and fun.Mulan tells the tale of a young woman named Mulan who must take her father's place in the army raised to fight a horde of Mongol Invaders in Medieval China. What surprises me is the incredible amount of emotional power told in this simple tale of self determination, responsibility and honor. Even though it's cartoonish, over the top and even a little ridiculous at times, Mulan is a well written film, and Mulan is a protagonist that embodies personal growth in every level. She's resilient, honest, and selfless. It's surprising that a simple children's movie tells very mature and well developed themes of duty, self sacrifice, and emotional zeal. It's power holds up well over 22 years later.The only problems are Eddie Murphy starring Mooshu (who can be annoying and out of place at times), the meh villain, and the Disney standard animal sidekicks of Mulan, who technically is a Disney princess at the end of the day, albeit a great one.She's not this ""girl power"" character because she's strong, she's strong because she fully becomes the individual China needed her to be, not in a subversive way, but in a smart one. At the end of the movie, it's noted that Mulan's arc wasn't about becoming the person she thought she needed to be, but the one other people needed her to be. China needed her to be a warrior, not a wife. Overall, I highly recommend this great movie, to fans of Disney and not. Thank you Disney for this incredible classic.",Mulan
172,ggk-34-546807,A VERY underrated Disney classic,10,6 August 2011,"This is one of my favorite Disney animated movie! It's not as cutesy as many of the Disney princess movies are - It's about a war of all things and for a change the main heroine is not a princess but a strong female role model. Clever and brave but at the same time clumsy and silly at the moments. The massage is strong and works on many levels, and it has some great dramatic moments (especially the sequence when Mulan escape from home is build pretty powerful, some best music I heard in a Disney movie) however what work best is the comedy. After ""Emperor New Grove"" I find it to be the funny-est of all Disney films. Comedy with Mulan pretending to be a man and all the camp scenes are hilarious and just getting funner and funner. I also enjoy Eddie Murphy who while may look annoying at first he quickly turns into a very lovable and comedic characters. To be honest all characters are great and even those who have few lines are very memorable. The villain lives a impression as well.Plus how great to see a Disney movie that doesn't focus on a love story. There is a romance element to it, but it's quick and handle mostly for comedic effect. And what crime would it be to not mention the animation - it's great as usual!If you haven't seen this one I strongly recommend it to you! Next to ""The Fox and the hound"" the most underrated Disney movie.",Mulan
173,Movieman-133,Avoid this film.,5,16 May 1999,"The movie I will admit attempted a good story line.  Mulan was a character that was well developed and she showed courage and strength. The army leader and eventual lover of Mulan was good but he wasn't very military like/Japanese like in his singing.  Would you really expect Donny Osmond to sound like a strong japanese warrior.  This movie was overall OK but there was no musical number that was especially moving even though Lea Salonga's voice showed much potential,  she only sang one small solo). The lizard resembled a pale imitation to Aladdin's genie,  Mulan resembled Pocahontas in her ethnic courage for peace and dignity,  and the military leader seemed like an honorable Pheobus--not very emotional(or loving) but a fairly good performance.  However,  in general the movie's supporting cast was weak,  not very catchy music,  the story line wasn't especially interesting,   there was no funny moments really, and overall Disney's other films are better.   Try The Hunchback for Notre Dame for serious interesting and moving Disney performances,  or Beauty and the Beast.

175,anastasiia_shystovska,Mulan: Movie review,10,7 July 2020,"'Mulan' is an animated historical adventure movie based on the ""Ballad of Mulan"" by Guo Maoqian. It was directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook. Thirty-two scriptwriters worked on the script.The Chinese girl, whose name is Fa Mulan, wanting to keep her father safe, dresses as a man and goes to war instead of him with her dragon Mushu who helps her. People around her expected that Mulan would be only a wife like every other Chinese woman, but she turns to be a strong and brave warrior who with other warriors saves her country and protects the emperor from his enemies.Coming out in 1998, it was popular among children and adults as well. Most critics like this movie. It won several Awards and the love of the audience. It is one of the most exciting animated movies of the 90s.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska",Mulan
176,jessbir-23618,childhood movie,8,21 July 2019,Mulan was my childhood Disney movie I absolutely loved it as a child and I still very much do. Mulan really stands out among all the great Disney movies for me because of how unique and different it is. the story of a young woman disguising herself as a man in the army in order to save her father dosnt sounds like your typical Disney movie and it isn't which is why its so great. the animation is absolutely stunning the attention to detail is just flawless. the characters are all charming and memorable especially Mulan herself who stands out as easily the best Disney heroine of all time. her sidekick Mushu voiced by the very talented Eddie Murphy is absolutely hilarious and a total scene stealer. the movie has many emotional and powerful scenes that to this day still make me cry every time I watch them. the movie also has many great action scenes that are always fun to watch. Mulan for me is one of the best Disney movies of all time and if you've never had the pleasure of seeing it before see it now.,Mulan
177,caamich,One of Disney's finest stories,10,11 July 2003,"I saw this for the first time two nights ago, 5 years after its release in theaters. It had my heart strings being tugged, had me giggling, and, most importantly, it moved me. The music was beautiful, particularly the lyrics and music to the song that Mulan sings to herself (""Who Is This Girl I See""?). The lyrics are just as awesome an accomplishment as the melody of the song. The animation on Mulan and the Captain of the Imperial army was very lifelike. I could actually picture what the people might look like in real life. That's a first for me with a Disney animated feature. I was very impressed.The only possible flaw I saw in this movie, not being an expert in East Asian culture, but knowing a little, is the way Mulan's family behaved when she returned from running away, even though they knew where she'd gone and what she'd done. I think, realistically, an East Asian family, particularly from that era, would not have behaved that way. I could be wrong.",Mulan

181,kennethtownsend-97230,Mulan,10,14 October 2015,"Mulan is a heart warming story of a young women finding herself, as she goes on a selfless journey to protect her father from getting killed, however doing this she puts her own life in danger. Through the course of the movie Mulan is fighting a formidable foe and against stereotype, if anyone say through her disguise she could be killed on the spot, as women weren't aloud to do this in ancient china. The humor in this Disney movie appeals to all ages, throughout the movie you find yourself laughing, part of this is due to Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy. Additionally, this movie begins with Mulan going to a matchmaker to become married, however when the matchmaker declares that Mulan has brought dishonor on her family tensions run high. Meanwhile, Shan Yu, is going to attack China, the emperor orders that all men fight in the war, unfortunately Mulan is an only child, her dad has already fought in a previous war and is injured. That night Mulan runs away, her family is worried as they know if anyone finds out she is a women she will be killed. In the end Mulan saves China and falls in love. Mulan is a marvelous movie that everyone should experience. Children of all ages can learn from Mulan's selflessness and bravery. The movie can teach all how being different is acceptable and everyone has their own purpose.",Mulan
182,WeslyM,Another strong Disney heroine,8,4 May 1999,"Disney's most recent animated film contains fewer of the crowd-pleasing elements that made ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King"" into box-office bonanzas (although there is a tiny dragon, Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, and a horrifyingly cute roly-poly dog does make a mercifully brief appearance early on).  Instead, ""Mulan"" tells a surprisingly mature story through beautiful animation in the classic style.  From lush gardens to stark snowscapes to ornate temples, the settings frame and complement the storyline beautifully.  When her father is injured and unable to represent his family in the emperor's army, Mulan disguises herself as a boy and rides forth to take his place and defend her family's honor.  Disney has released a series of animated films with strong heroines (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Pocahontas""), and ""Mulan"" continues the trend. (One might wonder at Disney's agenda; the only central male character in a recent animated Disney film [""The Lion King""] is not human.)  Mulan's cross-dressing adventures are fascinating enough to engross child and adult alike (in the end, she manages to include her faithful soldier sidekicks in the joke), and Shan-Yu, the leader of the Huns, is as wicked a villain as anyone has a right to hope for.  It all comes to a fine, satisfying conclusion, and the story's emphasis on the value of family relationships makes for a worthwhile shared experience.",Mulan
183,xtonybueno,"Enjoyable movie, but I have a question...",7,27 February 2000,"Mulan is yet another winning animated feature from Disney.  However, there is one question I cannot get out of my head.  Is there any material missing from the DVD that was included in the theatrical release?

So I gave Mulan a chance.And I was really pleasantly surprised. Mulan manages to keep a reasonable flavour of Chinese/Hong Kong cinema without seeming patronising or watered-down. It's not too cute or fluffy and the villain is not even remotely camp or risible. He's just plain EVIL. Course the songs are sometimes naff, but I really loved Disney's take on the staple ""kung fu boot camp"" .Even the romantic angle isn't too gloopy and soft focus, it just leaves you with a hint of a beginning.Anyway for more cross-dressing martial arts heroines, check out Brigitte Lin's career.",Mulan

BUT,I was so surprised.It was funny,witty and there was a good twist of Chinese culture.I read in a book that the Disney team went to China to do research for the film so that was good.

190,joseav10,Great story but...,8,25 September 2004,"To begin with, I have to say that this film is one of my favourites, I like the plot, I love the characters (specially the dragon). The beginning is good, very good, the fight scenes, the vision of the Chinese world, the defence of the tranquil and peaceful style of life against the bad guys, the Huns. However, in my view, there is a problem, the movie comes to an end too fast, a little bit of a mess. Course (SPOILER: everybody knelt down in homage to the heroine is quite moving, but the way in which Mulan fights against the wicked Hun is a little bit fast in my opinion...)All in all, one of the greatest Disney movies that, for some reason, has been forgotten or not included among the best ones.",Mulan

192,mines1985,Not as bad as I first thought,7,16 March 2002,"I'll be honest here. I started watching this movie with a pretty negative attitude about the whole thing. I think that most Disney movies have gotten worse and worse over the past few years, so I assumed ""Mulan"" would be no exception. But then, after I watched the movie for a little while, I realized it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it might be. The characters are quite well-developed, and the movie itself moves along fairly smoothly. I think the only thing that really ""clogged"" the movie was the frequent songs, although I truly enjoyed a couple of them.

194,Kehleyr,Would have been better without Mushu's character,7,9 January 2001,"I love cartoons. I think ever since the first full-length cartoon movies have been made, there was the ""funny"" support character which was responsible for the laughs. In later times this character was in general the hero's aide: the Genie in Alladin, Philoctetes in Hercules and so on. The problem is that the funny character tends to get more and more exaggerated every time, borrowing standard and oh-so-predictable lines from poor comedies, spoiling everything. Don't get me wrong: The Genie and Philoctetes were perfect, because they didn't overdo it, but Mushu certainly overdoes it. What need do we have for this kind of silly humor in a children movie? All the lines were heard and reheard, stupid and boring... and not funny at all. A movie CAN be nice without somebody telling the same old jokes over and over again, jokes which sound the same whether they are told in I-don't-know-which-century China (like in Mulan) or in the next century (like in the last semi-science-fiction movie I have seen, The Sixth Day).
A cartoon movie is dedicated first of all to children, and I think that at least for them we should keep the movies nice, like the stories were when I was a kid. Why do kids these days watch mostly cartoons about bigger and bigger robots fighting each other and not Tom and Jerry anymore? We should try to change this mentality...
Other than that the movie was very nice, the musical score was great and did a great job in sustaining the action.",Mulan
195,rosswilcock1,One of Disney's best,10,7 August 2019,This film is a childhood and adult good favourite of mine. It's a beautiful and heart warming film. It's so so good and would highly recommend seeing it.I would be surprised if there are people who haven't seen or even heard of Mulan. especially now that the live action film is coming out from Disney.I think everyone will find something to love about this film.It's Disney magic at its very best!!,Mulan
196,Aerie-2,A True Masterpiece,10,28 February 1999,"Every Disney movie is always advertised as ""a masterpiece"", but Mulan is one of the few that REALLY fit the bill.  The animation itself is simple and flowing, reminiscent of ancient Chinese art.  But the animation for this is really something else.  In fact, this is the best thing since The Lion King.Mulan is a young girl who does her best to bring honor to her family.  Then, when the Hun army invades China, one man from every household must serve in the Imperial Army.  Since Mulan has no older brothers, her crippled father must serve.  And it's obvious, early on in the movie, that it's impossible for him to fight with a crippled leg.  There's a great likelihood that this man is going to die in battle.So, out of the sheer love for her father, Mulan disguises herself in his armor and takes his place in the army.This movie isn't about some gal going off to war to prove herself, or break free from the caste system, like so many other Disney heroines.  And it isn't about ""finding your prince and living happily ever after"".  Mulan goes for the simple love of her father and because of the her dedication to her family.  She risks losing everything to SAVE everything.Mulan is a wonderful movie because the main character is realistic.  She's not perfect, she has her faults, and we all identify with her because we all try out best to please our fathers.  This is one of the few movies I watched with my dad that he really liked, and he isn't that fond of animated stuff. It's a great film.And that's what makes a true masterpiece.",Mulan
197,JR-92,Typical Disney......but Entertaining,9,7 August 1999,"Mulan is very entertaining. The only daughter of an old, disabled father goes to war in his place to fight the Mongols who have breached the Great Wall! 			 			This is a typical Disney movie; the same characters set in a different time and place. but it is still worth watching if you don't mind that. Mushu(Eddie Murphy), Mulan's comical sidekick, is very funny. Eddie does a great voice, and Mushu's jokes are funny! I watched it twice just for the comical entertainment, and little for the feeling of adventure too. 			 				I recommend it. I gave it a 9.",Mulan
198,ghostofdaniel,Imaginative and beautiful style !,8,16 June 2004,"The story is good, but I didn't really care about it. The best I appreciated in this movie was its wonderful graphic style. There is a long time I haven't find a Disney movie simply ""beautiful"". Despite this ""old style"", the movie succeeds to give us a good use of modern technologies during the famous great battle. And more, Disney rarely gives the music to be done by a great composer like Jerry Goldsmith. The music is really good. Of course, we can hear some reminiscence of the ""Rambo"" music during the great battle, but the main theme is original and impressive.I don't know if it is a ""classic Disney"" since it doesn't really use the ""Disney design"". But I know it's a ""rare Disney"". So let's enjoy it !8 out of 10 (the few songs are probably the only weakness of this movie).",Mulan
199,batocicero,A favorite that was discovered later on,10,1 December 2009,"I remember watching Disney's Mulan in the 1990's and I really didn't pay much attention to it. Mmm, hmm, bad move, I reckon in retrospective. But fortunately, I once had the curiosity to have a look at it recently, and it just blew my mind! Not only the landscapes were great and the Chinese landmarks really stunning, I became in love with the characters, especially Mulan, Mushu and even the squeaky Chi Fu. It's one of those movies that, once you care to watch again, you can rediscover as an rare jewel.I don't know why I didn't see this before, but Mulan is a very positive role model for girls indeed. She is strong, spirited, humble, resourceful, smart and independent. She is selfless and she decides to risk her own life to protect her sick father's. That is quite a statement! Not only that, she manages to become a national hero by defeating the main villain, Shan Yu, single-handedly (well, with a bit of help from the likable tiny dragon Mushu). It's one of the few times I remember watching BOTH a female lead and a sidekick being so proactive! How cool is that! Besides, Mulan is very pretty (even when she is just a cartoon). When she had her self-doubting moments, I wished I could get into the movie and give her a hug (cheesy, I know, but I can't help finding her really cute).Mushu is one hell of a good sidekick. Not only does he play a major role in the story, he has some of the best lines I've heard from a Disney movie (""Don't look at me. I ain't biting anymore buts"", ""You lied to me? And what are you, a sheep?""); he has so many good ones, I can't pick a favorite! I couldn't stop laughing. He is hilarious! Plus, he is never cheesy or over the top (perhaps Eddie Murphy has something to do with it).Noteworthy is also the bad guy, Shan Yu. He is really cool and evil-looking, and menacing. He is very intimidating because he is realistically human (no superpowers, no fairy tale creature; perhaps some extra muscle and brute strength), and his cruelty is very real. It's not hard to think of a real individual who can come close to this guy in terms of power hunger and callous violence. Even with such a dark villain, the film still manages to give us quite a few comical moments. But when he is on screen, he means business, and you feel it.Definitely, a new favorite for me. A beautifully-designed Asian culture (I love Asian cultures!), an endearing and timeless story, a cute and strong female lead (she also has her funny moments), a cool and intimidating bad guy, and a priceless little lizard... er, dragon sidekick. What else does this masterpiece need? 10/10 without doubt.",Mulan
200,zenoki,"It was okay, I guess",5,27 January 1999,"Although I have a strong dislike for DisneyCorp, I have to admit Mulan is, for the most part, watchable.For the protagonist, we have a liberated 90's girl transplanted into ancient china. She cross-dresses to get into the military - nothing like transvestitism for cheap laughs - and of course, proves herself to everyone. The plot is forgettable. The jokes are predictable.The animation is okay. I couldn't stifle a snicker when I saw Disney's much-hyped computer graphics effects.But the soundtrack... Ugh! I laughed out loud in the theater when the music blatantly ripped off Pink Floyd.",Mulan
201,Iria,It was okay...,4,18 October 1999,"The animation wasn't terribly impressive; at times, it seemed too simplistic, with the quality of shading and attention to detail falling drastically short of say, for example, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.  In addition, I felt that Disney was trying to stereotype and ""play into"" the Chinese culture too much by trying to imitate Chinese music in some of the soundtracks (which, I might add, weren't that great either. Only ""Reflections"" I shall acknowledge as being somewhat enjoyable). Mulan's character design is a stereotype in itself.  Since when do Asians really have eyes that tilt at almost a 45 degree angle?  I realize it might seem like a little thing to get so excited over, but I'm Asian, so I am sensitive to details like that simply because I have been the target of many jokes of that ilk during my adolescence.  I also think that Mulan is the most flat-chested Disney human female I've ever seen.  Pocahontas, who, historically, was 13 when Smith ""discovered"" her, was stacked.  Of course, there's no stereotype about flat-chested Asians, right (which is entirely a grossly incorrect generalization).  Now all I can say is, ""Gee, thanks, Disney.""  I suppose that some credit should be given, because usually a giant corporation will not take risks by exploring a minority group.  Yet in doing so, they have only played upon the American society's expectations of what Asian culture means to them, but doesn't necessarily reflect the truth.At face value, however, Mulan was entertaining enough.  Granted, this film is supposed to be for little kids, so hey, why not give some of the music a Chinesy feel to make it all cute.  Why not paint Mulan's face entirely white (even though that extent of make-up is used, NOT for matchmaking, but most commonly for Chinese opera).  Let's give the public something familiar, but at the same make it seem exotic and make it appear like we really *heh heh* want to explore Chinese tradition for its inherent value, and not to exploit it for our purposes.  Mulan is something I'll watch when I have absolutely nothing better to do.  Even then, I don't think I'd watch it more than two times.  In the words of a previous reviewer, ""Excuse me, I have to go watch some Anime now.""  Go watch Neon Genesis Evangelion.",Mulan

The pacing and story are what really lift this movie above the recent Disney fare.

210,LVJeff,Coming from a Chinese POV,10,3 August 2000,"While most critics went into this movie expecting another typical Disney animated flick, I went in with another interest in mind: to see if Disney would give a respectable treatment to a Chinese subject.  Asian culture and their stories get limited enough time as it is in the theaters, so, being of Chinese blood, movies like Mulan are something for me to look forward to as a moviegoer.I am happy to say that I was delighted by what I saw.  On the surface was, expectedly, a rather typical Disney treatment of the alienated heroine who fights for acceptance.  However, it was framed within an uncompromising traditionalist Asian mentality, and I found it quite satisfying to see Disney pull few punches as far as this mentality was concerned: that women are inferior.  They are worthless, secondary, and there only to support men. A Disney be-yourself story is perfect against this backdrop, and it was great to see the backdrop itself so relentlessly illustrated.A normally watered down story might have featured a heroine set back by her own naturally limited abilities (such as Ariel's being a mermaid not allowing her to walk on land), but Mulan was stuck in a world where prejudices against whom she inherently was were not only unchecked but accepted as fact.  As someone who has been repeatedly irked by the ridiculous traditional Asian/Chinese view that women are inferior, Mulan's presentation enthralled me as the perfect situation to triumph out of. Everything in the movie reinforced this.  Mulan is to be presented like a piece of fruit to get married; she can not join the army under penalty of death; women are repeatedly referred to as not being able to do a man's job; etc.  Even the songs were extremely well-written to reinforce this: ""Be a Man"" straightforwardly suggests that only a man is capable of being strong enough to go to war; ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" has the troops objectifying women to what they look like and cook like; ""Honor to Us All"" has a great line: ""We all must serve our emperor... our boys by bearing arms, our girls by bearing sons.""  Over and over again, the Asian mentality which I had witnessed so much myself firsthand was being pounded in to audience primarily made of impressionable kids!  Let me tell you, it was great!It was great to see that old Chinese mentality exposed, even if it was in a colorful musical, to a young audience.  And it was great to see that mentality refuted by the story itself: that a woman could be resourceful enough to help win a war and defeat a major villain _without_ becoming a man.  I really appreciated it.  The extra touches of ""Chinese-ness"" were also appreciated: Mulan's exclaiming ""ai-ya!"", the Ancestors and their place in the family homelife, the reverence under which the Emperor was held, the wicked official (ancient Chinese history is full of them).  One of my friends saw this in a theater full of Asians, and he said the audience received the movie with cheerful enthusiasm.  Even my parents appreciated the effort put into the movie, with my mother, self-proclaimed cartoon-hater, giving it a thumbs up!This movie did not go to lengths to misunderstand and poke fun at the Chinese.  It really did a fine job getting the point just right, especially in the conveyed attitude toward women.  Thus it scores on two levels: it shows that the Chinese can be heroic and that women are equal with men. It makes the kids happy and Asians can be in on the jokes.  I think this was a great achievement.P.S. For those of you who wonder about the actual story of Mulan: the story exists as a poem.  Much of it is spent describing in detail how Mulan made herself to appear as a man, and then back as a woman after the war was over, and, so I've been told, not much else.  The Chinese mostly regard it as one of those stories you've heard about, like the way Americans regard fairy tales.  I think it was a perfect story for Disney to ""raid,"" in its usual way :-)",Mulan

For starters, I didn't like the style of the animation. The backgrounds are rarely detailed and the characters look very rough, it's nothing like you'd expect from Disney. The music also pales in comparison to the great scores of other Disney films. And finally, the villain is almost as forgettable as the songs. Can't even remember his name.

So over the handful of years we've been together I've found my self watching a good deal of animation i would otherwise have ignored. Moana, Coco and Ratatouille left me with an unexpected sense of joy. Stylish stories with a quiet moral woven into the back ground.
Mulan, though set in China, feels like a cheap Chinese restaurant in California. If you are making a film set in a foreign culture? You should do your leg work and get the feel right. Simply putting the family name first on a character and making some assumptions about honour does not cut it for Chinese. This movie felt like a good B grade western with a thin Chinese theme pasted over the top.
Then there's the message. The movie is obviously trying to put a woman up as a heroine. A ""lady triumphs and wins the respect of the men"" happy ending story. But really the only message here, is that if you're a woman and want to be judged as an equal, you need to be as good as three men to even stand a chance.

That little dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy was atrocious!2) I didn't like any of the songs, they were definitely not up to scratch. Whatever happened to the wonderful Disney music?3) It irritated me that Disney just put in anything remotely Chinese looking in the animation(e.g. Chinese symbols everywhere)There's got to be more to China than that!4) I didn't get that warm Disney feeling inside me when it finished.

217,rebecky14,An awesome Disney movie for so many reasons ...,9,3 April 2012,"Finally, Disney has a great feminist character! Disney has created a beautifully artistic and cultural movie, with an excellent story, in the form of Mulan. The story: Mulan is a young Chinese girl preparing for a life as a housewife, but she knows she's far too strong-minded to be something as menial as that. When the Huns invade China, her father (the only male in the household), is selected to fight in the army, despite the fact he has old wounds that prevent him from fighting properly. Determined to save her father, Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes his place in the army. This movie has been a personal favorite of mine ever since I saw it when I was a little girl. Since I watched it, Mulan has constantly been a role model of mine: she is a girl who's brave, who will do anything for her family, a girl who dares to be different, and a girl who dares to follow her dreams, and her heart. But the character of Mulan isn't the only awesome thing about this movie. The other characters are excellent and not at all one-dimensional. Eddie Murphy - who voices the tiny, jive-talking dragon Mushu - is hilarious most of the time. Shan-Yu has to be one of the best villains Disney has created in a long time. Shang is interesting, but is possibly the weakest, least-developed character of all. The music is wonderful, the battle scenes are epic, the song items don't interfere with the story at all, and the detail is beautiful. My only complaint is that it could have been a bit longer. I would have liked some more development within the story and with the separate characters. Nonetheless, an awesome Disney movie!8/10",Mulan
218,queenofhalves,A movie only a kid could like,4,25 November 2000,"_Mulan_ might have been a masterpiece at a time when Disney films had strong creative voices behind them, but the film has been badly marred by Disney's current committee-style production process. The film simply can't seem to figure out what it's trying to achieve. It's nominally feminist, but undermines that feminist message with its overuse of male gender stereotypes and regressive ending. It is a musical in format, but features uninspired and forgettable tunes that play only a subordinate role in plot and character development. It attempts to realistically portray war, but stretches the laws of physics and basic concepts of military strategy in a way that only a six-year-old could ignore (Run! It's an army of six Huns!). Finally, it tries to lighten this rather somber mess with a wacky sidekick, but Eddie Murphy's voicing of the dragon is so over-the-top that it destroys what could have been the film's greatest strength -- the mystical, exotic mood created by the sweeping Chinese landscape. _Mulan_ seems to me to be compelling evidence of Disney's schizophrenic 1990s creative philosophy: it tries to be feminist and conventional at the same time, and attempts to deal with issues of war while still being comprehensible to toddlers. The result is a confused mess so full of holes and inconsistencies that older children and adults will find it very difficult to suspend their disbelief.",Mulan

221,JanieJane96,Not one of Disney's best,5,3 February 2012,"I was a huge fan of the ""Disney Renaissance"" films in the 90's, of which ""Mulan"" is one of them. However, I don't think it holds up very well among the others. Which is a shame, because the story and setting are unique, and the heroine is strong and admirable. She deserved a better movie, in my opinion.First of all, the songs and score are just not that memorable (with the exception of ""Reflection"", and even that is pretty conventional). The animation was not as impressive. Compare the animation to that of ""The Lion King"". Every shot in that film was an ""awe"" moment. In comparison, Mulan looked like it was made for home video. The villain, while scary, was more of a caricature than a fully developed character. Disney always did a great job with villains, so this was a missed opportunity. Also, I really missed a romance. Now, some may love that Mulan never got together with Shang (at least in the first film), but romance is what gives Disney films their spice! Overall, the story just didn't excite me. I saw it once in college when it first came out, and didn't see it again until recently. That just shows how much I really missed watching it (lol). It's admirable that Disney would do a film about a Chinese girl who dresses as a man to fight in a war, but they could have done a better job of it.",Mulan
222,agvkrioni,"Great Art, Poor Direction",4,5 June 2007,"This review is an attempt to explain some reasons why this movie is considered not one of Disney's greatest films.In short, the art is beautiful in its own way and the voices aren't bad. But the lack of sound (background noises, music, sound effects, etc) except for in select parts where a musical number popped in was devastating to the mood of the picture.Sound moves the film and at times it became boring, even when Eddie Murphy was blasting out some silliness that should have been entertaining.Also the music numbers seemed uninspired and randomly placed. Instead of moving the picture and complimenting it, they seemed to be begrudgingly thrown in like tinsel on a Christmas tree- no one likes it, yet many just toss it on in a strange sense of obligation.The art was definitely good and the animation fluid. Sometimes the backdrops were so simple that it almost felt like one was watching an animated storyboard instead of the final product.",Mulan
223,AD-7,Disney has gone bananas !,9,2 December 1998,"What a miracle : I didn't need one single Kleenex during a Disney movie. After the already 'different' Hercules, Disney now brings us Mulan, a story based on a Chinese poem. You might have thought that it would turn out to be very serious, but really, this is the funniest Disney-movie I've ever seen. But, technically, I think (to my humble opinion Mr.Disney), the movie is not so good. I know that the studios often change styles the last couple of years (like in Hercules, which was also technically very good), but this style didn't pleased me at all. Maybe they tried to imitate the cheap Chinese/Korean/Japanese productions that we often see on tv. (no, it wasn't THAT bad). I always use 'The Sleeping Beauty' from Disney as a reference to technical perfection, as that is the best Disney movie in my opinion. It is not possible to classify Mulan between the other 'Disneys', but it was superb, with Disney displaying drag queens etc. Is this film banned in Texas ?",Mulan

The backdrops are wonderfully drawn. The songs are memorable and entertaining, plus they're sung by two very good singers: Lea Salonga and Donnie Osmond.

228,BeautifulSinner,"Thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!",8,11 March 2008,"Mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national hero/heroine. Although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, Disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. As a Chinese myself, I know the mulan story like millions of Chinese people do. Some people (espcially Chinese people) may not like the Disney version of mulan simply because Disney didn't stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. Not only did i have no problem with Disney's decision to make modifications to mulan's story, I actually kinda appreciate that they did. Cuz Disney's retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. I mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in Disney's mulan. In the Disney version, Mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient Chinese society, where a woman's value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. So naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number ""reflection"" that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. This song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and I'm a guy! This song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. And now back to the movie, there's a lot to love about Disney's mulan: the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. The story is smoothly-paced and very believable. You have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. And I think Disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real Chinese people instead of the classic Disney characters that we used to see. And they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful Chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me! And the opening of the movie is probably one of the most brilliant among the Disney animation features. I was completely blown away when i first saw it in the theater. Although Disney didn't completely stay true to the original mulan, it stayed true to the spirit of the original story and the spirit of china in most part! And as Mulan being a Chinese story, i think Disney did its best to make it look like and feel like Chinese, and i really appreciate their effort. So thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!",Mulan
229,lizzieejohnson,Best Disney Film I have seen so far!,10,5 August 2016,"We all have heard of many different Disney princesses. However, this one probably takes the cake. First of all, she is Asian (hooray for Disney being more culturally diverse) and she is like many women who just are not the type who adore being girly and feminine. This story follows Mulan, a girl in ancient China who is having a hard time blossoming into a so called 'woman'. China is freshly at war, and hence are recruiting a man from every single family to fight it. As Mulan's father is old and sick and there are no other males in her family, she decides to take the risk, dress up as a man and take his place. This is one of the first Disney films that addresses gender roles, and how they do not necessarily need to be followed to be a good man or woman. The movie is directed in a light-hearten fashion, with quite a bit of comedy and a lot less romance. It also is a story of personal development, and how rough experiences can teach you things you would never imagine. Great for anyone, even if you are not a fan of Disney!",Mulan
230,jcbaek,I love Disney,8,22 December 2016,"Disney did it again. With the right blend of humor, romance, action, and most of all, emotion. Watching this now is quite the different experience than when I first saw it as a child. I understand more fully the cultural and familial obstacles presented against Mulan. I noticed some things that I didn't catch the first viewing. Again, Mulan is a tale of identity, about trying to find out and discover who you are. Like Hercules, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Frozen, you name it, Disney is all about identity and rising against the norm and what society expects of you. Obviously, as it's a Western commercial production, it makes many cross-cultural flaws -- the characters have too-exaggerated facial features to supposed to look Chinese, for instance.It being Disney, its soundtrack is amazing, we all know ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and ""Reflection,"" just to name two. It has a great voice acting cast (i.e. Eddie Murphy as Mushu), and it ends very happily for all the good guys. Some things are a little rushed, I thought, towards the end concerning certain characters but still, Mulan is a film you need to see, no matter what your age. It will impel you to strike forth against the societal construct we know as ""normal,"" that is, to be like everybody else. Who gives a damn about what other people think? You only have one life. Make the most of it, carpe diem.Everything taken into account, Mulan I'd say surpasses Hercules, but lies below The Lion King.

Only the opening title gives any hint of rich beauty of Asian art.  Closer attention to traditional silk painting, scrolls, screens, etc. might have helped lift this one a notch.As it is, its manner of storytelling is only a b-level imitation of other Disney flicks of the late '80s and 'early '90s.  Standard stuff, though Eddie Murphy provides a little (very little) relief.Still, Asian-American kids might (MIGHT) get a kick out of seeing one of their most revered cultural legends come to life onscreen.

238,trapper-hell,A good feel-good movie,7,29 June 2009,"I must say that I have enjoyed this movie. At first thought, I wasn't sure what to expect. Not much of an animations-fan. However, this movie became interesting after only a few minutes. Not a girlish movie (as I had first thought), and the plot was fine too.Certain things I did not like were that the original plans for Mulan to serve as an average lady were only shown in the first part of the movie (where she performed miserably), and then the movie did not focus anymore upon it (not even in the ending). Furthermore, that sudden change-of-heart were she was sent away by Shang and than excelled in all their training - that was too sudden and did not focus upon her efforts to reach that goal (even though this always happens in most movies).One more negative plot remark is that Mulan's seemingly primary intention to go instead of her father was because her father's health was very poor and thus she went instead. However, it seemed easy enough not to attend later on, since she was easily asked to leave by Shang when her process seemed to be to no avail - so why did she have to go? One more aspect - that is only seen in cartoons - is that the Huns were able to beat up most of the army and then they came into difficulty with a ragged band of a few 'warriors'. However, this can only be adapted in cartoons :) However, I must say that I did enjoy this movie. It's feel-good aspect is felt throughout the movie (of course, as it progresses along). Furthermore, the fact that certain people do not seem adept to certain aspects and yet they excel in others, is shown in the movie as can be in real life.The songs (and the singing) were fine and adequate (even though at times they seemed to drag on). Laughter is well packed and distributed in the movie, and thus makes it entertaining - even for the whole family since most aspects were not so childish (although the movie can be easily understood by children).",Mulan

I still live in the '90s. Get over it) some parts over and over during those viewings. This movie is just so fantastic I can hardly put it into words. The music isn't tiresome or annoying like some Disney movies, the message is strong and a good one, and there are some dark elements in it that won't scare the children but will provide a little extra entertainment for adults.I personally think that this movie should be in every household - whether there are children or teenagers or adults watching, it's fantastic.",Mulan

The other is that I just wanted to stand up and cheer at this great heroine.  I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but most of the heroines, while spunky, are still just your basic damsel in distress.  I loved Mulan's character.  She was strong, she was powerful, she could do anything she wanted, and she overcame much diversity.

What was I saying Before!!!?? The movie has some of the best characters and songs ever in a Disney movie! Eddie Murphy Was a little corny but other than that the movie blew me away!,Mulan
244,RobnHood,"I walked into this movie thinking ""yuck"", but came out pleased.",8,31 March 1999,"Very good movie. I was really impressed with everything....except one thing. NO MEMORABLE DISNEY MUSIC! There wasn't one song that I was diggin', the songs sounded out of place. Other than that, very good. I give it an 8. Kudos to Eddie Murphy. Also Kudos to Disney for another woman hero for young children.",Mulan
245,Dina-11,Mulan is a movie worth seeing,10,16 August 1999,"The movie teach us about a new culture, teach us about China and it is also great for all ages. I liked it very much, because it shows love, courage and action in the same time. Great animation just like Disney always shows us that the company is the best for animated movies. In the chain with The Lion King showing us the wild life in Afrika so touchable for the children so close to them. And in the chain with Pocahontas showing the Indian culture and teaching little children about a part of the American history. And every other movie is a story about it self. Mulan also is more than just a story about a  girl that feels sorry about her father but it is also about a part from the Asian history about their legends and about their culture. Great to see.",Mulan
246,ira-73738,Maybe I just wanted to look in the mirror and see someone worthwhile...,9,30 December 2020,"Mulan...so much bravery and courage in this name.
As for me Mulan is one of the best Disney's movie and I can explain why :)
1. The Plot. Watching this animated movie we get a real combo: travelling to China, history points, relationship and respect in Oriental culture. We have an opportunity to get closer to the idea of ancestry's veneration, a guardian spirit of a family, women's position in society etc. So, from this prospective Mulan is quite informative.
2. The cartoon is absolutely neutral and can be highly appreciated by any age and gender. It's cute but not too romantic; it's funny but not cheesy.
3. The Characters. They are awesome here. Decisive Mulan, role-model Li Shang, fussy Mushu, jolly Granny and etc. It's extremely difficult not to take a great fancy to them, as all of them have nice personality and life values (except Shan Yu and his co., definitely)
4. The Songs. They are amazing here, with nice lyrics covered with a light flavour of oriental melodies.To recap, 'Mulan' is worth watching as it can inspire you, push you to call your parents a bit oftener and just help you feel revitalised in the presence of a vivacious soul of your personal dragon.",Mulan
247,q-50062,Girl's power,10,23 March 2020,"I love mulan sooooo much, her courage touched me deeply. Since I was a child, I have been dreaming to be the one who made history like her. In addition, I especially like Mushu in the movie.",Mulan
248,xyqhc,Be yourself,7,13 April 2020,"This movie is great as it's got an amazing catchy soundtrack, brilliant animation, great relatable themes like to always honor your family's name and to follow your heart. I think it is a positive educational film that has established the image of the ancient female hero through the tortuous story of Mulan joining the army on behalf of his father, and has promoted the traditional virtues of filial piety, perseverance, patriotism and so on.",Mulan
249,goodguy-16,It has an awful moral lesson,1,19 September 2010,"Disney had to even out the numbers - after the making of 'Beauty and the Beast' that is degrading for men, you've got to a film that is degrading for women.Under the pretense of ""A girl can do anything a guy can do, and even better than him"" you get the moral lesson of: ""If you're a girl that wants to be respected and appreciated for who you are inside and for your inner qualities, and to be valued not only when you are matched with a man that you can clean and cook to you, you've got to at least defeat a whole army and save your country from total destruction.Great message for our little girls.Other than that - wonderful film.1 out of 10.",Mulan

251,DesertHedgehog,A Movie With a Beautiful Message,10,14 September 2005,"Words just cannot express the beauty in this film. Mulan, our heroine, is a sweet, yet awkward young woman who wishes to bring honor to her also-loving family.After a meeting with the matchmaker goes horribly awry, Mulan is left ashamed and distraught. She wishes so badly to please and bring honor to her family, yet her spunky, outspoken attitude makes this a struggle for her in a culture where women are expected to be quiet and subservient. But despite her failure, her family still loves her.That very day, the Emperor's consul comes with a declaration: one man from every family is to serve in the Emperor's army in the war against the Huns. Mulan, knowing that her father will certainly be killed if he goes to war, disguises herself as a man and goes to war in his place. The sentiment and unconditional love portrayed in this movie makes it a very beautiful story.The movie also pokes some good-natured fun at males in general, but never to a ridiculous degree. The one reference to a modern media (Batman) is subtle enough that it doesn't spoil the atmosphere. Mushu sometimes feels a little overdone, but isn't too bad overall. There's enough comic relief in the movie to keep it fun.Another thing going for this film is that the dilemmas faced by the characters are very, very serious. The villain isn't just set out to conquer; he's set out to slaughter. This is made very clear to the audience - and although it was kept toned down, it wasn't completely sugarcoated, either.Also, I feel that Mulan is a much better role-model for girls than certain other animated characters. The love and respect that she shows for her family (especially for her father) is a breath of fresh air compared to many other animated female leads.",Mulan
252,reudebakernel,Brilliant Disney Epic,9,23 September 2020,Was really looking forward to this and boy did it live up 2 expectation. Really great cinematography. Good storyline and overall brilliant acting well done Disney,Mulan
253,jynx,Brilliant!,10,7 October 1998,Disney's best movie since Aladdin and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is just as funny. Mulan manages to combine ancient tradition and 90's humour into a wonderful tale that will appeal to all age groups and surprisingly resolves a long standing gender issue. Highly recommended...too good to miss!,Mulan
254,john-154,A Disney apple never falls far from the tree. (Good apple!),8,14 March 1999,I found this the most pleasing animation from Disney for a while.  The signature child/parent separation pain was there as expected.  The commentary on the role of women was refreshing and needed.  I was particularly pleased that it did not end with a wedding scene.,Mulan
255,beefmage,second only to Beauty and the Beast,9,1 December 1998,"this film is second only to Beauty and the Beast for Disney.  I first went to the film very reluctantly, because I hated Anastasia and had heard that Mulan was this huge feminist flick, but my girlfriend wanted to go so I had to.  Now don't go thinking I am just some sexist pig, but i didn't want to see a film in which i didn't like the heroine, which happened in Anastasia, and i think most guys share my opinion on that.  but after the first few minutes i was blown away.  i loved the art and Eddie Murphy did a fantastic job as the comic relief.  funny yet not detracting from the story's importance.  sure there were many dumb common sense things that were inconsistent in the film (China has LOTS of people in it, after all, they built that wall with sheer numbers, you think they would be able to come up with a little bigger army...)  but that doesn't matter in the story. overall i think it was beautifully done and truly one of the great Disney films.",Mulan
256,egilDOTnet,"Nice, slick, Disney-design, humorous characters and delicate sound",9,28 December 1998,"This movie lacks somewhat in story, it leaps a bit from here to there, but allover its a nice animation out of a classic story. Eddie Murphy gives the little lizard (""It's D-R-A-G-O-N to you!"") an excellent voice, and he gives the movie a lot of its life, so to speak.Also, passing along the tradition of the latest Disney animated ""classics"", this one is extremely well made, especially the scene where the Huns come racing down the hillside, and the music is also the now ""accounted for"" quality.All in all, a very good movie, well worth seeing only to hear out the lizards comments!",Mulan
257,wxgoddes,A learning experience!,9,26 July 1999,"I have never been a huge fan of Disney movies, but this one has made me reconsider.  I've also never taken an interest in the Oriental culture, so when this movie came out, well, I didn't have ANY desire to see it.  Once I finally did see it though, I was impressed.  Yes, it was modernized and Americanized, but so was every other Disney animated, from Hercules to Sword in the Stone.  American children are the primary marketing target, and what child is going to want to sit through an entirely realistic portrayal of an historical figure or fable?  Most fables are based on gruesome truth, and most historical heroes were normal people who were in the right place at the right time.  This film did what it was supposed to do:  It entertained kids, and it gave me the desire to learn more about that culture, which I never thought would happen.  Thanks Disney--my next overseas trip will be to see the Great Wall.",Mulan

The music makes me so happy inside and the Huns scare me so much and I'm 16! I just did my history exam today and part of the course was on the Huns and watching Mulan was like everything I had just learned. I LOVE THIS MOVIE and I want to watch it again tomorrow night! I love Captain Li too! He's basically the GREATEST of any of the male lead roles in Disney movies! Mushu makes me giggle and I did rewind (yes, my Mulan is on cassette NOT DVD) a few times when he said something funny. HAHAHHA. Like when he shows up for the first time and the horse steps on him.

261,ABigSaltyFish,A solid movie with two big flaws.,6,2 September 2021,"In ancient china, you don't cut your hair due to filial piety. Your hair represents your love for your family, but also your dignity as a human being.There was a sentence where your hair are cut short. So everyone can know at first glance you committed a crime :)""Dishonor on you! Dishonor on your cow!""Since the bad guys are the Huns, the story take place somewhere between the Qin dynasty and the Northern and Southern dynasty. So way after the Warring states period and the birth of Confucianism. In the ballad of Mulan, it is generally considered the story takes place during the sixteen kingdoms, so more than 100 years after the end of the Han dynasty. So by looking at the bad guys, it is hard to identify when the story is happening.In the movie, the clothes are closer to the ones during the Han dynasty and the architectures are closer to Ming/Qing dynasty. So... when no one after they became an adult (~15ish yo) cut their hair short... except criminals... which was a type of sentence as I said earlier. (which was why during the Qing dynasty Han Chinese people were forced to cut their hair since it was a sign of the Manchu dominance and those who did not cut their hair were seen as rebels that wanted the restoration of the Ming dynasty)So, the hair cutting scene was very disturbing to me. Although I get the meaning behind this specific scene, it was too foreign for the story... So instead of being moved by Mulan's decision to protect her father and the country... I was unable to emotionally connect for this scene.Another thing that bugged me a lot back then is Mushu. His name was more like a random fake Chinese name, so it made no sense. The way the dragon is portrayed through Muhsu was so different from the ones I was familiar I was unable to enjoy its presence. I wasn't offended, but I wasn't amused either.These are the two main shortcomings in the movie for me but it is an overall a pretty good movie.",Mulan
262,alice917,Good for little girls,8,6 June 2003,"This movie is a little violent, but not gratuitously so.

For once, characters could roam around without frickin breaking out into song every five minutes. The one thing I hated about all the old Disney movies is that they were practically musicals. This movie probably had fewer songs than any other Disney flick at its time. And also, the songs were cute n' catchy, instead of overwhelmingly cute and sickening. I could actually watch this movie without the urge of just taking out the tape and loading it on a skeet shooter. Hahhahaha. I left this movie saying wow, I actually wouldn't mind watching it again.

265,Brighteagle,"Mulan (inspiring, brillant, fantastic)",8,24 June 2018,"I was wary at first when I first started watching Mulan as back in 1998 when the film was released, there was not much positively said towards women in society so I did not have much hope that this movie would be able to pull off such a powerful women lead back in a time when women were perceived to be lower down in class compared to men. However, this movie starts out to be one of the best female lead movies that I have watched in a long time. Going by the time in which the movie was made Pam Coats did an amazing job for producing the movie and Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft brilliantly directed the movie in a way to focus on Mulan's journey from a small maiden to a warrior of the army in China and receiving praise from the emperor. This film is a fantastic movie to show the power then women can hold and the equality that should be faced towards both men and women. This film is still relevant in todays society across the globe and could easier be names as one of the best Disney movies that have been created.",Mulan
266,tma-02111,a great animation of a Chinese legend in an American perspective,9,26 December 2018,"This is a lovely animation. My favorite part is definitely the heroine. She is brave and resourceful, and most importantly are able to make her way out of people's biases and the obstacles society has given her. It is inspiring to see a story like this coming into life and capture people's eyes. Not only that, this story is also very refreshing and totally hilarious. It's very colorful and its characters like the lucky cricket and Mulan's three troop friends are so lovable. Mushu is just straight fun. Some feminism movies tells a very heavy story where the heroine overcomes great adversities with blood and tears. That is great in its own way; however an animation like this truly shows an optimistic, quick-to-act vibe that cheers me up and brings lots of hope. Great movie!",Mulan

The story of a young woman's heroism, Mulan does a good job keeping adults interested in the story, while providing enough humorous moments and a simple enough story to keep the kids interested.  Some of the artwork is quite stunning, matching the beauty of The Lion King, though the songs were not terribly memorable.  Eddie Murphy does a fine job on the comic relief, without distracting from the story.",Mulan
268,panthony,great!!!!!!!!!1,10,4 January 1999,"I thought that Mulan was Disney's best work. It didn't follow its usual pattern for animated movies. It didn't focus on the romance, but on her struggle to win in a ""man's"" world.",Mulan

It is with Princess Mononoke, CTHD, Twin Warriors and Startrek TNG one of my all time favorites.",Mulan
270,magisterfabrum,A little more historical precision doesn't harm the box office,7,13 January 2013,"The movie stars the Huns as the bad guys. OK then, let's go ahead. Texts from the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) repeatedly refer to one Xiongnu tribe or tribal confederation that caused plenty of headaches to that times' Northern China. The name ""Xiongnu"" might be cognate to the name ""Huns"", but the equation Xiongnu = Huns is highly controversial among sinologists and other historians. Anyway, the Xiongnu quit China's history during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD to never come back. Now, by the time the Xiongnu raided Northern China, the most sophisticated known weapon was the crossbow. However, the movie displays a collection of arms, such as flint muskets, fuse guns, huge howitzers, old heavy mortars, that fits almost perfectly the weaponry available in the first half of the 17th century (AD, of course) so in the West as in the Far East. But, did happen anything important by then in China? Well, yes: a people first known as the Jurchens, and from then on as the Manchus, gradually increased their pressure on northern China's border, until they eventually entered Beijing in 1644 and enthroned the Qing Dynasty, the Manchu Dynasty, the last Dynasty. So our brave Mulan seems rather to fight against those Manchu invaders. And why not? Put aside Chinese popular war legends: for 2000 years they have been calling ""Xiongnu"" any northern invader, even Genghis Khan's Mongols. Then either the fire arms or the name ""Huns"" should have been removed from the screenplay. Suppressing ""modern"" weapons is out of question: along with them, half of the movie would go away. So, did Walt Disney Prductions - Buenavista Productions seriously think that calling ""Manchus"" the Manchus they would make a lesser profit? Did they really think the name ""Huns"" would frighten children more? The answer to both questions should be no. Changing History never improved a movie; it were always directors, characters and writers who achieved it. Oh, and don't fear for Mulans's safety: she sure got back with her family and was happy, for, although it's true that the Manchus won, once settled down in China's throne they became Chinese right away, and didn't treat their new subjects worse than other emperors. That's the magic of China: many times invaded, but never conquered.",Mulan
271,rrussell5,Mulan *spoiler alert*,10,18 October 2013,"Mulan is a step in a new direction for Disney, providing a thrilling, inspirational tale about a young woman that strays away from the beautiful damsel longing for love that Disney is so famous for. Mulan is set in Han Dynasty China during the invasion of the Hun army led by a barbarian by the name of Shan Yu. In this desperate time for China, a man from every family is drafted to serve in the Imperial Army and defend China against Shan Yu. To protect her family, Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes her father's place, risking her life and the honor of her family. This begins Mulan's adventure as an Imperial soldier and the hardships and perils she will go through in her journey to protect China, all the while protecting her identity. Arriving at the Wu-Shong camp Mulan comes to realize she is not alone in her journey, her ancestors have sent a ""guardian"" to watch over her in the form of Mushu, a ""travel-sized"" dragon meant to guide her and protect her from harm. Little does she know, the claimed guardian is actually an ex-guardian of the family, following the unfortunate demise of one of her ancestors. With Mushu by her side she enters the camp and is faced with the challenges of blending in with the other soldiers. With the help of Mushu, she quickly gains many enemies throughout the camp, taking on the name of Ping and earning herself the title of a ""complete lunatic"". As in all Disney movies, the audience is not disappointed to be introduced to Shang, the handsome young captain and love interest in the story. As ""Ping"" is slowly gaining status among the soldiers, the Hun army continues to move closer and closer to the Emperor. In a desperate effort when it looks like Mulan will never see battle, Mushu and the 'lucky' cricket, Crick-ee devise a plan that sends the troops rushing to the front-lines. When the army arrives, they find total devastation where the Imperial Army and General of China are found dead in the snow. This begins the start of their fight against the Huns in the Tung Shao pass, complete with fiery arrows, intense explosions, and a wound inflicted by Shan Yu himself. This scene is a vital turning point in the movie and sets the scene for Mulan's reveal as a woman and her final decision that will change the fate of China and will either shame her family forever or make her a hero . The movie incorporates the beauty of China and the opening credits begin as a silk painting, with traditional Chinese style art. The painting transitions into the opening scene of the Great Wall and the Hun invasion. This presents a wonderful introduction to the conflict in the story and gives the audience a preview of what is to come. Throughout the movie there are wonderful landscape shots where the audience can see the beauty of China. However the most powerful scenes include those that feature close-ups. A scene that is incredibly powerful and marks the transition of Ping the lunatic into Ping the soldier is the scene where Mulan retrieves the arrow. This scene is filled with close ups of Mulan's face and her struggle and her ultimate victory. This victory follows the song ""I'll make a man out of you"" and in the end, she is a man, not in body but in her determination and strength as a soldier. Overall, this movie is thrilling and is a refreshing change from the Disney princess stories that are so famous. Mulan is a movie that inspires young women to be brave, strong of spirit and to be yourself. Mulan makes it a good thing to be different from the rest and show the change that one can have on the world. One of the most powerful lines from the movie comes from Mulan's father when she returns home from war after she presents him with gifts from the empire. He throws down his cane, hugs her and says ""The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter"".",Mulan
272,llewsgniktterb,One of the Best of Disney,8,14 January 2014,"I really loved Mulan. It was a great movie that actually had an interesting story that could be enjoyed by adults as well as their children. I think Lion King and Beauty and the Beast might be better films over all but I also appreciate Mulan for other reasons. First of all and most important, I think it's great that the hero of Mulan is not the typical white skinned princess waiting for a prince to rescue her like you get in most Disney movies. There still aren't many of those (Jasmine and Pocahontas are the only other non white Disney heroines I can think of) so it's definitely welcome and a step in the right direction!",Mulan

I consider this to be one of the first GOOD movies to come out of that greedy capitalist hellhole called Disney in years. Some of the arguments against it have been ridiculous.""It's racist!"" Oh come on people, it's supposed to be and adventure/war movie, not a remake of Ghandi! The Huns are bad, the Chinese are good because that's how it was in the ancient legend. A movie like this is not supposed to put political correctness before entertainment.""It's discriminating against men!"" Lighten up, please. I'm a guy and I wasn't offended by this. It's from Mulan's perspective, and I think it's safe to say she was somewhat prejudiced. Besides, Shang was cool. There was nothing wrong with him.""It's too violent!"" I hate to break it to you, but war happens. Yes, there are fields of bodies. Yes, the bad guys kill people. Yes, it might scare little kids. But seriously, the evening news is way more violent. These things happen, and if your kids never know about it then they're going to be pretty freaked out when they first encounter the real world.In short, Mulan is a great movie for anybody who doesn't want they're kids to live in a bubble. It's got action, romance, friendship, the whole works, and would have been great even if it wasn't animated.",Mulan
275,martinezsigfredo,Mulan: Not Your Typical Disney Movie,8,3 December 2018,"The movie, Mulan, starts when a messenger named Chi-Fu is sent to everyone in China from the emperor, including Mulan's village.The emperor is asking for all men to fight and protect the country, for they are about to engage in a time of war. Mulan being the sweet, noble, caring daughter that she is, she realizes her father is now too old to fight and would die in combat. She makes the decision to sneak out the next morning with her father's armor and to take his place in the Imperial army with hopes of bringing honor to her family. And because of that she encounters a small red dragon named Mushu, who would become her trusty sidekick. Despite the fact that this one of the only Disney movies with a heroine, the film, written by Robert D. San Souci, and directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, successfully portrays the character developing into a brave young woman.A great deal of people put the movie Mulan in a negative light because throughout the film Mulan does many things such as, disobey her parents wishes, destroy the emperors palace, lie to her superiors, and run away from home. These actions are not something people want their children watching nor repeating. Along with that Mulan tries to justify her actions by saying she was staying ""true to her heart"", which is supposed to make everything okay because she had good intentions. The movie does not make it look like its a bad thing because all Mulan's inappropriate actions ended up saving China and everything wrong she did looked great. Which of course only happens in Disney movies, not in reality. There have been a lot of raised eyebrows and concerns among critics who don't view rebellious Chinese teenager, Mulan as a good role model for young kids or young girls. Worrying that children will because of Mulan believe it is okay to disobey or lie as long as they have good intentions. But it is not Mulan's defiance that makes her cool or a good role model, it is her bravery in certain situations, overcoming her disadvantages, and bringing honor to her family by overcoming fear. Some critics feel that the film Mulan also discriminates against women and throughout the film puts women second to men. Juliane Fang writes, ""This is exemplified in an argument between Shang (Chinese army captain) and Chi-Fu (Emperor's adviser) , when Shang says, ""she's a hero!"" and Chi-Fu responds with, ""she's a woman! She'll never be worth anything!"" Despite the negative attitude towards woman, Juliane Fang adds that Mulan is still the hero in the end. However, she only became a hero and achieved this status by faking a masculine being. And in that, the film is stating that success is primarily a male quality.But, although, the movie demonstrates negative attitudes towards women, it does very well portray a girl developing into a woman, bringing honor to her family, and respect to herself. ""As the Emperor (Pat Morita) tells Shang after Mulan rides back to her family, 'You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty.' He's right."" Despite the movies weaknesses, the directors of the film Mulan do a good job in showing her struggles and her growth in confidence from the beginning to the end of the film. For example, Mulan is a good role model for young girls because while preparing for war all of the soldiers are brought to a camp for training. She starts off weak and slow, but she doesn't want to disappoint her family, so she becomes determined to be a good warrior. And because of that she is able to do everything the men can, you couldn't tell she was different. She is also seen as brave by her bold moves such as when she uses a rocket to shoot snow on a Clift to create a landslide effect and wipe out the enemies. These parts of thre movie are positive for young children and teen girls. These certain scenes reveal Mulan's bravery and courage.Futhermore, the film successfully portrays a young girl overcoming obstacles, the emotions she felt during those obstacles, as well as the good result after doing what she felt was right. The movie has a positive influence on children, especially Mulan's sidekick, Mushu, who makes the film so much more enjoyable. And he is a perfect balance of rebellion and humor, to not make parents raise an eyebrow at the film and question its message.
Even though the Disney Film Mulan incorporates doubtful situations and mirrors gender discrimination, its natural humor makes it easy to connect and relate to the movie. The depiction of the main character's emotions throughout the movie make it far exceed the others with a strong heroine role. This film demonstrates a role model for young kids and teen girls, and strikes certain emotions that are not typical for family films, reinforcing that Mulan is not a typical Disney movie.",Mulan

Which of course only happens in Disney movies, not in reality. There have been a lot of raised eyebrows and concerns among critics who don't view rebellious Chinese teenager, Mulan as a good role model for young kids or young girls. Worrying that children will because of Mulan believe it is okay to disobey or lie as long as they have good intentions. But it is not Mulan's defiance that makes her cool or a good role model, it is her bravery in certain situations, overcoming her disadvantages, and bringing honor to her family by overcoming fear. Some critics feel that the film Mulan also discriminates against women and throughout the film puts women second to men. Juliane Fang writes, ""This is exemplified in an argument between Shang (Chinese army captain) and Chi-Fu (Emperor's adviser) , when Shang says, ""she's a hero!"" and Chi-Fu responds with, ""she's a woman! She'll never be worth anything!"" Despite the negative attitude towards woman, Juliane Fang adds that Mulan is still the hero in the end. However, she only became a hero and achieved this status by faking a masculine being. And in that, the film is stating that success is primarily a male quality.But, although, the movie demonstrates negative attitudes towards women, it does very well portray a girl developing into a woman, bringing honor to her family, and respect to herself. ""As the Emperor (Pat Morita) tells Shang after Mulan rides back to her family, 'You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty.' He's right."" Despite the movies weaknesses, the directors of the film Mulan do a good job in showing her struggles and her growth in confidence from the beginning to the end of the film. For example, Mulan is a good role model for young girls because while preparing for war all of the soldiers are brought to a camp for training. She starts off weak and slow, but she doesn't want to disappoint her family, so she becomes determined to be a good warrior. And because of that she is able to do everything the men can, you couldn't tell she was different. She is also seen as brave by her bold moves such as when she uses a rocket to shoot snow on a Clift to create a landslide effect and wipe out the enemies. These parts of thre movie are positive for young children and teen girls. These certain scenes reveal Mulan's bravery and courage.Futhermore, the film successfully portrays a young girl overcoming obstacles, the emotions she felt during those obstacles, as well as the good result after doing what she felt was right. The movie has a positive influence on children, especially Mulan's sidekick, Mushu, who makes the film so much more enjoyable. And he is a perfect balance of rebellion and humor, to not make parents raise an eyebrow at the film and question its message. Even though the Disney Film Mulan incorporates doubtful situations and mirrors gender discrimination, its natural humor makes it easy to connect and relate to the movie. The depiction of the main character's emotions throughout the movie make it far exceed the others with a strong heroine role. This film demonstrates a role model for young kids and teen girls, and strikes certain emotions that are not typical for family films, reinforcing that Mulan is not a typical Disney movie.",Mulan
277,Gris,Very good... maybe the Disney boost?,9,25 November 1998,"This is one of the best Disney pictures from ""The Little Mermaid"". It seems that they have realised that their public is not only còmposed by children and that the animation genre does not necessarily be musical to death. With only four songs -rather good, but not as breathtaking as before- and a BEAUTIFUL score from Jerry Goldsmith, it has some important differences from the former Disney structure. There is no love story, but some real social revindication -the girl is not looking forward to finding a man to marry to and have children. The plot is well balanced showing both crude real-life scenes and good gags.Maybe the Disney boost? Since ""The Lion King"", nothing really remarkable was made... Pocahontas's plot was awful, The Hunchback just killed the original story by Victor Hugo and Hercules was a bit too childish. I guess they have been seriously encouraged by their competitors 20th, Warner and Dreamworks.",Mulan

281,lishang2001,Making a Woman Out of Mulan,10,2 December 2019,"In their live-action revival of Mulan, Disney redefines the standard for modern princess tales in this new and improved take on a beloved children's movie. Watchers who went to see the original Mulan will be met with many familiar faces in this film, but the movie they grew up with is a far cry from this remake.Liu Yifei gave a compelling performance as high school junior Mulan, whose soccer team is cut due to a lack of funds. When the boys' coach refuses to give her or her teammates a tryout, they devise a plot to disguise her as her brother so she can train with his school's team during preseason and beat her own school. Mulan navigates a new school and team, all under the nose of her watchful and traditional parents.This film provides great entertainment with its vibrant cast and twists on the original tale. In the past, Disney's attempts to express different cultures have fallen short in their representation. Karo incorporates a plethora of elements of Chinese culture in Mulan's everyday life, namely in her home life and relationship with her parents. She is a relatable, average teen, yet she is also faced with navigating what it means to be a first generation American. Karo's directing style preserves the humor of the original Mulan but revitalizes what it means to make a kid's movie with great potential for impact.The one arguably integral character that was missing from this live action take was Li Shang. Older audiences might have been shocked to see him missing from the screen; after a few scenes, however, it was easy to see how Mulan didn't need him to complete her goal and provide a fulfilling plot.Although this film is a far cry from serious, it manages to down the same female stereotypes that Disney has set out to do for decades far more effectively than the original. Mulan proves not only her own might, but the potential of her entire girls soccer team and any other girl out there to be successful at their passion. Audiences both laugh at Mulan's antics and rejoice with her in her triumphs. The evolution in dialogue with her parents also tackles the cultural pressures she faces.Despite any minor shortcomings in this light-hearted film, Karo's Mulan beats out the first Mulan film in what it takes to create a feminist 'princess' movie. This film is fun, creative, and inspiring, and sure to empower tiny female audiences everywhere.",Mulan

292,ElJaguar,"Very good, but not perfect",9,18 March 2003,"Mulan is a very good movie. Simple, yet moving. It is certainly not traditional Disney film.Mulan is a film where the tragedy and comedy is wisely mixed. It balances itself wittily, except one last minor thing. In the end they should not have used nowadays music style to express happy end. Otherwise the score was great. I give 10 out of 10 for music. Osmond and Salonga are first rate musical singers and do their part superbly. I have also heard mandarin version of ""Man out of You"" with Jackie Chan and to tell the truth I found it even better than English version. Although I do not understand the language, I felt the poise in the singing, and it was superb. So for Chan I add one extra point 11 out of 10.The Huns were presented as evil as could get, yet wise, which gave depth to their characters. The battle scene in the middle of the film has very interesting and good angles in cinematography. Very well thought out.The supporting characters were good. Mushu was very well created character and had some very funny lines. Usually many sidekicks are too overwritten, but Mushu, even when talking too much, had something to say as well. Murphy did great job. There were some lines even that were spine chilling (Emperor's).Although the movie was very well paced and intelligently created, it was not perfect. And simply because it tried to be too commercial. If some cheap jokes were omitted, it could have been great.Overall I give 9 out of 10 and highly recommend for everybody.

Well, I found Disney's portrayal of China's Joan of Arc (Oriental Yentl?!) depressing. Who knows, in the future, a Disney movie about ""Young George Washington and his band of merry revolutionary friends going off to fight the evil bratty British"" or ""Young Abraham Lincoln and his wise and noble friends went to free the slaves with his witty asides and his magical top hat, challenging the evil slavers to dance offs"" with the appropriate American contemporary lingo will be made.",Mulan

The artful animation(watch the smoke) the terrific songs like ""Be a Man"", the laugh out loud antics of Eddie Murphy's Mushu, and a heroic, feisty, and really likable Mulan help make this movie truly special. Every time I take it down from the video shelf I'm surprised at how good it is. Some of the subject matter isn't appropriate for small children.

298,Ehamilton40,Mulan Synopsis,9,21 February 2014,"Disney's animated and musical film Mulan (Mulan, Bancroft and Cook, 1998) was released into theaters on June 5, 1998. The movie was directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook and used the voices of Miguel Ferrer, Eddie Murphy, and Lea Salonga for some of the main characters (International Movie Database.) During opening weekend, Mulan grossed almost 23 million dollars. The movie went on to make 121 million in the United States and about 304 million in world wide gross revenue (Box Office Mojo.) The movie was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for its original music and received and received an American Society of Composers and Publishers Award for top box office films in 1999. The film was also nominated for and received multiple Annie Awards (International Movie Database.) This 88 minute animated musical begins with a scene of peaceful China being invaded at night by a group of Mongolian nomads referred to throughout the movie as ""Huns."" (The Xionnu Culture.) The Huns are clearly a major threat to China's society. The audience is then introduced to the main character in the movie named Mulan. Mulan is a young woman who is struggling to come of age the way that her Chinese culture wants her to. She is expected to have the poise and grace of a Chinese lady and is scheduled that afternoon to meet with a matchmaker. Her mother and grandmother help her prepare to meet the matchmaker and give her a small cricket in a cage to carry with her for luck. When Mulan gets to the matchmakers house, things do not go as planned and Mulan ends up spilling hot tea on the woman, making her look clumsy and ill prepared to be a bride. The matchmaker shames Mulan, stating that she will never bring honor to the family as Mulan runs out of the house. Later in the day, the general from the imperial army arrives in their town, stating that one man from each family must go to war to fight against the Huns. Since Mulan's father, an honored veteran himself, is the only male in their family, it is obvious that he must go again to war. It is very dangerous for her father to do this because he is old and could very easily be killed in battle. After watching her father and mother have a quiet conversation, Mulan decides to take matters into her own hands. She cuts her hair and takes her father's armor and horse, leaving for war in the middle of a stormy night. Alarmed by Mulan's actions, her ancestors' spirits awaken and discuss what they should do about the situation. Eager to prove himself, Mushu, a small red dragon, decides that he is going to find Mulan and assist her in becoming a war hero. Mushu appears to Mulan just as she is about to enter the army's camp. He gives her tips on how to walk and talk like a man but it is clear as soon as she walks into the camp that she is extremely out of place. She accidentally starts a fight between the warriors and when the newly appointed captain Shang-Yu walks out, he is obviously disappointed in the group and specifically Mulan. Mulan introduces herself awkwardly as Ping and the group begins training. Things are hard for Mulan at first because she has to adjust to acting like a man and keeping up physically with the rest of the troop. Slowly but surely, however, she begins to prove herself as a valuable asset to the army. When Mulan's troop is called into battle early because of a letter that Mushu writes from the general, Mulan is determined to prove herself further as a warrior. As they travel, the troop comes across an abandoned town, one that had obviously fallen victim to the Huns. The troop is then ambushed by the Huns from the top of a snowy mountain and is eventually forced to confront a group of them head on. Clearly outnumbered, it is obvious that Mulan's troop will not win this battle. However, Mulan thinks quickly and comes up with a fast solution to beat the Huns. She seizes the last cannon and runs toward the enormous group of approaching Huns. Once she gets to a close enough spot, she lights the cannon and shoots it directly towards a snowy mountain. This causes a huge avalanche that wipes out most of the Hun's troop, ending the war and making Mulan's troop the heroes of China. Despite her valiant efforts to keep her womanhood a secret, she is discovered the next night after Shang had heard many rumors that she was female. Instead of killing her as the law demanded, Shang decides to spare her life, claiming that she saved his life the day before and now the two are even. Ashamed that she had yet again disgraced her family, Mulan sets out to leave for home. While she is leaving, Mulan notices that there are Huns still alive and races to the ceremony where the rest of the army is being honored for her accomplishments to warn them. The troops do not believe her until the Huns themselves appear at the ceremony and kidnap the emperor, locking him inside the palace. Mulan runs to the scene and comes up with an elaborate plan to break into the castle to save the emperor. Her plan works and Mulan is recognized by the emperor himself as a great hero of China and offered a position on his council. However, instead of accepting this great honor, Mulan states that she would like to return to her home, hugs her new friends, and turns to walk away. As she is leaving, Shang realizes that he is in love with Mulan and goes with her. The two return home as great heroes of China.",Mulan
299,jewel_of_ia,Actually my favorite movie in the world,10,22 April 2005,"I know this sounds silly, but Mulan is actually my all-time favorite movie. Trust me, I am a perfectly intelligent young woman who likes to read and is going to college, but there's just something about Mulan that I have always loved. It suffered a lot in release because it was lost in an avalanche of new CGI movies like A Bug's Life. But Mulan's story is every bit as good as those movies, even if you find the animation less impressive.The strengths of the movie for me are not the songs (which are very weak compared to earlier Disney), nor the animation (which is charming with a few Chinese flourishes) or any other technical aspect of the movie production. What makes this moving great is that it has a truly endearing, likable main character. While in most Disney movies the silly sidekicks or cute animals steal the show, in this movie Mulan is both funny and brave, making her a truly human character that I rooted for whole-heartedly.I am also a crazy feminist and for me this movie is the ultimate girl-power movie. Who would of thought that could ever be said of a Disney movie? But really, Mulan, as a Chinese tomboy who never quite feels that she fits in in her society, is an excellent picture of a woman finally proving to the world that she can do everything a man can do. After watching the movie (which I have done over 15 times) I always feel really inspired and motivated! Seriously! The movie without a doubt has lots of production problems (bad songs, clichéd side-characters, mediocre villain), but I still highly, highly recommend because fundamentally the characters are likable and believable and the plot is well constructed. Oh and I think it's pretty damn funny. Mushu always makes me laugh, and watching Mulan try to spit is still the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.If you want the classic singing, dancing fairy tale-style Disney movies a la The Little Mermaid, this is not quite what you're looking for. Mulan is more character driven and less lavishly made. But it absolutely belongs in the upper ranks of Disney, and it's a pity that Disney couldn't have continued to make animated features of this quality.",Mulan
300,shakiajcorcoran,Spoiler Alert!,10,29 September 2015,"We are all accustomed to the usual beautiful princess who needs a prince to rescue them; that is not the case for Mulan who proves herself not to be a damsel in distress, but a warrior who saves all of China. She accomplishes this amazing task along with vivid characters and defeats all odds against her. It was not just a film, though, it was an epic depiction based on a true story of Hua Mulan, a real warrior who fought in the invasion of China. The Disney film Mulan captures the timelessness of Ballad of Mulan and reintroduces it in a way that appeals to viewers of all ages, displaying empowerment as a trait all girls can possess, overall an excellent movie with clear cut theme and plot without losing its authenticity. Mulan, released in 1998, was a screenplay written by Robert D. San Souci. Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) was the only child of her ill father Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) and mother Fa Li (Freda Foh Shen), both decent farmers. The story begins with Mulan having a meeting with the matchmaker to find a suitable husband, but Mulan is not as poised and graceful enough to impress the matchmaker and ultimately dismissed and labeled a disgrace. Soon after her father is summoned by the councilman Chi Fu (James Hong) to serve in battle. Chinese culture collects one male from each family, if the father is summoned, a son can volunteer to assume his position; although in this family, there is no son to volunteer. A brave and determined Mulan, afraid to lose her father, decides she is going to take his place disguising herself as his son. Since women cannot participate in war she had the challenge of concealing her identity as well as living up to expectations as a male warrior. Li Shan (B.D Wong) is assigned to train the recruitments for battle. Mulan was not as trained and skilled as most of the males so she was met with challenges. After training was over with Mulan was at the top of her class, and soon her identity was revealed and she was released from the roster. She was a determined warrior she returned leading to victory against Shan Yu with the help of some friends and began her budding romance with Li Shang. In addition to the incredible Disney film, it's not only for the television screen, the story has roots. Mulan is actually based on a real person and a real account in history. Mulan is based on a ballad written anonymously during the Ming Dynasty telling the legend Hua Mulan. There of course are subtle differences in the ballad and film, such as the fact that Hua Mulan was fairly skilled in weapons and combat, overtly Mulan was not. What makes this fact special is the time period (1368 C.E-1644 C.E.) where there were strict roles that men and women should follow, especially in Chinese culture. But Mulan differed all regulation and ultimately became a popular figure in Chinese history. Selflessly she took the place of her father in risk of being exiled, killed, or worse. It inspired me even, not to allow anything to become a hindrance and to continue to be selfless one day it may be recognized as greatness. Needless to say, the ballad sets the movie apart from any other Disney film. Characterization is important in any film, they give it dynamics and set the tone. This is a critical movie, but the tone can be very light hearted given the vivacious characters. Mulan is given an ancestor spirit in the form of a little red dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy) he adds a comical twist although he is very wise. The characters were well thought out and given an identity, even the minor characters were complex. Warriors and friends of Mulan's like Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po were supporting characters who, like Li Shang, learned to accept Mulan's motives and forgive her deceit. Then you have the obvious static character like Shan Yu whose ultimate goal was to kill the last of the Chinese warriors. Moreover, the voice behind the characters were all of Asian descent (given very few exceptions), I found that intriguing and it gave the roles even more distinction. Characterization provided in this film gave the story the tone it needed to reach out to the audience, without losing the culture. This film happens to be a family favorite, it's always on the list when binge watching Disney films. After its release it was nominated for an Oscar award, and ranked number 2 in the box office, rightly so. Without bias this film has been underrated, I believe it gives hope to female youth. It gives off a sense of empowerment and bravery over all odds. In this story you do not need a prince to rescue you from a tower guarded by dragons; in this case the dragon was her accomplice and she saved her prince. If you were to ever ask who my favorite Disney ""princess"" is I would tell you Mulan. Although she is not a princess, she has just as much nobility on film and in history.",Mulan
301,alohidog,(Wo)manning Up,9,5 October 2016,"Although Mulan seems to be nonsensical when she cuts her hair off and joins the army pretending to be a man, she demonstrates courage and bravery by taking her elderly father's place to defend China against the treacherous Huns. When the Huns climb the wall built to keep them out and kill all the guards present, the horror that China is about to face becomes evident. Why the Huns want to seize China is unknown, but they are on their way to the capital to do so. Like many third world countries, China requires that one man from every family enlist to strengthen their numbers. Of course to propel the movie, Mulan's family does not have any young boys, so her father is forced to join. Concerned for her father who is elderly, Mulan begs the recruiters to pardon him from enlisting because she knows that in his old age he will die training for and fighting the war. Her father, however, is disgraced by Mulan's begging because he feels it is his duty to defend his country. He is honored to fight and die for China. Of course, Mulan plays the hero. Determined to keep her father out of the war and uphold her family's honor, she chops off her hair and enlists.",Mulan
302,localdudet,A Fire Female,8,17 October 2017,"The famous movie of historical Asian history, Mulan, directed by Tony Bancroft, is a movie of a woman named Mulan taking the place of her father in war. Being a woman automatically disqualifies her as a soldier, and throughout the movie it is obvious that women are not looked at the same way that men are. Mulan's plot demotes women but its protagonist rejects this assumption to conclude that women can do whatever a man is able. In the beginning of the movie, Mulan, the main character, is continuously put down because of her female being. The movie begins with Mulan practicing to impress a match maker that will match her with her future husband. When her professional stylist is getting her ready for the big event; the stylist implies that Mulan is a sexual object. Throughout their song the stylist says, ""Boys will go to war for you if you're pretty, obedient, and have a tiny waist. You should demonstrate dignity, be poised and be silent."" The stylist is implying that the only way a woman should be appealing is by obtaining these qualities. Personally, being a woman myself, this portrait of woman-expectancy that reveals the sexism that is present in this movie, makes me question what young boys take away from this particular section of this movie. To add on, when Mulan steps up to go into war for her father, she is still looked down on for doing the impossible. Her ancestors say, ""Mulan's father, forever shall be shamed because a woman is taking her place in war."" Mulan is willingly taking the place of her injured father. This act is noble if a man were to do it; however, this movie suggests that it is shameful for a woman to perform the same honorable act. When Mulan is preparing to face the other soldiers, her male horse laughs in her face for trying to act as male. Animals are treated as less than humans and the way that the horse demotes Mulan portrays women as being even less than an animal; proving the sexism further. In the song that plays when the men are getting ready for war, Li Shang, the captain of the troops, says ""Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?"" Li Shang is downgrading women without realizing that Mulan is in his presence. A great amount of sexism goes on throughout the plot of this movie coming in the form of humans and even animals. Even though Mulan faces an enormous amount of unbelievable sexism, she proves that she can do whatever a man is able to do. When going through training, she comes in last and lags behind the other soldiers. However, as time goes on, she trains hard enough to become first in the races and training practices. Also, when in battle, Mulan is first in line with all the men behind her. She selflessly goes head first into the opposing army's soldiers in order to swiftly beat them in battle. Mulan uses logical alternatives to excel farther than the men in her troops and on the opposing army. Though, scientifically, Mulan is not physically matched to the male soldiers, she substitutes her smart antics to fly high. Mulan's plot degrades women, however the main character changes this thought, helping women to realize that they can match anything that a man is capable of. I think that this movie begins with a large amount of demotion towards women but there is a satisfying ending to this assumption. Mulan proves that women are capable of more than being a trophy wife, and this is proved every day in the twenty first century. Women are CEOs and military lieutenants, which manifests their ultimate capability. Women are powerful and can do anything that they put their mind to. And if every woman realized this, sexism would not exist.",Mulan
303,RogelioMontana,Disney has Done it,9,29 September 2009,"I believe that this is one of my favorite Disney movies. Maybe what I like so much is that Mulan is not waiting for her prince to come or any damsel in distress deal, but she is an intelligent woman held down by her society. The story: Mulan's father is old but he is called to war. He will probably die. Mulan decides to take his place. This is remarkably unselfish because if she's discovered she will be killed. This shows how much she loves her dear old dad. You just have to see the movie to appreciate it. The songs are amazing (""I'll make a man out of you"" Donny Osmond's voice is fantastic). The extra features were also pretty good. I found ""I'll make a man out of you"" in all different languages very interesting. The animation is great as it shows a lot of the natural beauty of China. So make sure you don't miss one of Disney's greatest(and probably last judging by the way Disney is going down the drain) animated movies. There is a strong message for us all when watching Mulan. The main character, Mulan, represents the cluminess in all of us. She tries very hard to please her parents but always seems to come up short from their expectations until the time is right. I know it was like that for me growing up and for a lot of people i know. Having seen this many times and enjoy it more as time goes by...if i was on a stranded island and can only have 3 DVD movies with me, this would be one of them. Very good storyline and animation as Disney is knowned for, this is one of their best IMO. Highly recommended viewing for all ages!",Mulan
304,lichan-1,Great Movie for little girls,9,8 January 2006,"I have a 4.5 year old daughter who is going through the princess phase. We read lots of fairy tales etc and its very difficult to find a fairy tale where the princess is strong and resourceful. Most of the time they are pretty passive and the worst one is sleeping beauty. I find myself treading a fine line between letting her enjoy the fairy tale and occasionally commenting on the fact that perhaps some of these princesses just don't do enough to help themselves and how they can help themselves a little bit more. I don't want to destroy her pleasure in these fairy tales, after all, I loved them too. But it took me a while as adult to see how the subconscious message of helplessness in these fairy tales can reinforce the existing values of society and parents that girls are meant to be saved. So it is a great pleasure to be able to show my daughter a story of a strong and intelligent girl - Mu Lan and its great that Mu Lan and we are both ethnically Chinese. Here is a heroine who is resourceful, uses her brains, saves the Captain and China. We draw many discussion points from the story, such as why it is that women were not allowed to join the army, the value of trying hard and training and practising hard, what is discipline and why it is needed to succeed, using your brains and thinking of how to solve a problem, not just using brute strength, etc. Even some politics - like why did the Hun king want the Emperor to bow to him and why the Emperor wouldn't bow to him but would bow to Mulan. My challenge is the explain things in a way which is both accurate and yet understandable to a 4 year old. My daughter loves the story because Mulan does a lot of ""saving"". My daughter has probably watch the movie only 3 times coz I limit TV and video a lot. But she'll ask me to tell her the story in my own words, based on the video. It works out great.The fact that the movie Mulan captivates me as an adult also helps. There's only so much I can enjoy of a barney video. I definitely recommend this movie to parents with young girls, as a good place to start talking about being a strong and intelligent woman. Another good one is Beauty and the Beast. I've not seen Pocahontas so I can't comment on that.",Mulan
305,apaloalyssa,Mulan Review (class project),10,4 May 2018,"Mulan Worldview Analysis 
In the Disney movie Mulan, the hero is in fact named Fa Mulan. Her goal at first is to give her family honor by being able to be matched with a good husband. When that plan doesn't work out, she then comes back home to find out her father is having to be sent off to war to fight the Hun army. Her goal then shifts to taking her father's place in the army by disguising herself as a boy and bringing her family honor in that way. That fact that she is a woman in the army disguising herself as a man is her character flaw because it eventually leads to her ""apparent defeat."" The apparent defeat happens after fighting the Huns and the main adversary, Shan Yu. She is discovered as being a woman after being injured in battle and is left there for dead by her love interest, and the general, Li Shang. After you think all is lost, her and her guardian from the ancestors named Mushu, discover that the Huns are planning to attack the emperor of China. She rushes down to China, as a woman now, and is faced with the final confrontation with Shan Yu and after an intense battle, she defeats him. The revelation of the hero is that even though she is a woman, she is just as tough as any other man in the army. The whole country sees that as well and bows down to her in the end. In conclusion, the moral of this movie is that women are just as strong as men and possibly even stronger. A woman can do anything a man can do and this movie teaches equality of the sexes. 
The movie gave a lot of supporting evidence to prove the moral of the story. At first, when she goes off to war disguised as a guy, she is stumbling around and can't fight very well. After training though she becomes one of the best warriors in their group and even saves Li Shang from his down death. She also defeats the Hun's leader Shan Yu and saves China which proves a woman can do anything a man can do. I agree with this message and I wouldn't do anything different, I think they prove that point very well. Also, I believe this movie ultimately celebrates goodness in the end because Mulan realizes women are just as powerful as men and she is liberated. Another way this movie celebrates goodness is she is the hero and defeats the evil Huns who are killing people. 
In this movie, I don't believe Christianity is expressed very much, if at all. I think this movie depicts more Chinese traditions and religions through the use of praying to ancestors, several mentions of meditation, and defending family honor. The ancestors, though, are the main thing I want to focus on as an example. Not only do they pray to the ancestors for help and guidance, but we also see the ancestors come to life. They actually also end up sending a guardian named Mushu to go and protect Mulan. I think this is saying that the way we should live and the human condition is that we should look to our ancestors for help and guidance. The movie is saying our ancestors will ultimately be there to protect us even when they have passed on to the afterlife. This does not agree with the Bible because the Bible says that Jesus is ultimately the one who can save and guide us through our life by praying to him alone. 
The redemption revealed in this movie is that Mulan finally gets to be comfortable in her own skin. She fights with the guys as her true self and gets to be liberated in the fact that she is just a tough as the guys. I think it completely departs from biblical truth because biblical redemption is accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior and being baptized to be born again. Even though this is true, I think this movie's message is a positive element of this movie. This movie is empowering to women and a good lesson to teach little girls that they don't have to feel less than any man. It is also positive to have the message to have people feel comfortable in their own skin. I think some negative elements of this movie are the sexism that is portrayed in the movie and the religion depicted not being Christian. If you think about it, if she was a woman who couldn't fight at all and hid as a boy in the military only to get caught, she would have died for sure. Despite this, in conclusion, I believe you can recommend this movie to all ages because it is a very funny and quality Disney movie.",Mulan
