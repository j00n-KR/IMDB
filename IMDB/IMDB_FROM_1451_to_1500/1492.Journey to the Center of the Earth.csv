0,TheLittleSongbird,"Dumb and silly, but pretty entertaining",6,13 July 2010,"Starting with the pros of this film, it looks fantastic. The scenery is imaginative, the cinematography is inventive the costumes are well-designed and the 3D is absolutely mind-blowing. The score is excellent, and the direction isn't too bad either. The acting is pretty decent, nothing great, but nothing awful. I liked Brendan Fraser in the first two Mummy movies and he is good enough in the lead, while Josh Hutcherson who was so good in Bridge to Terabithia is even better. Also the pacing is pretty brisk.Don't expect a brilliant script or a big, complex plot though. The script can get a little lame and clichéd, while the plot is rather predictable with one too many silly and dumb moments. The ending felt a little rushed too, and the characters are lacking in depth.Overall, not a masterpiece, but fun enough in perhaps a mindless sort of way. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Journey to the Center of the Earth
1,bkoganbing,Not My Generation's Journey,5,12 July 2008,"The new remake of Journey to the Center of the Earth is one far cry from Jules Verne's original novel. The classic old version from my childhood with James Mason, Arlene Dahl, and Pat Boone set during the 19th century in Verne's time is not anything you'll recognize here.Instead what you'll see is something like an Indiana Jones film with the intrepid explorers just facing the unknown. And it's not a planned expedition from the Icelandic volcano into the earth's bowels, the travelers sort of stumble into things.Brendan Fraser is a scientist who's brother went missing eleven years ago searching for the fabled land underneath that Verne talks about in his novel. He and Anita Briem's father were Vernists, apparently folks out there who believe that what Verne wrote about has some basis in fact. At the same time he's contemplating a trip to Iceland, his sister-in-law dumps his late brother's kid on him who's all of thirteen. Josh Holloway brings his father's copy of the Verne novel with all kinds of notations which lead them to Briem who just happens to be a guide and who takes them up the side of the volcano Verne wrote about.But as I said, the three of them sort of stumble into the path to the center of the earth and then the next hour or so is like an Indiana Jones film with some Jurassic Park tossed in. Best scene is one where Holloway gets separated from the others and in eluding a very large T-Rex, gets some T-Rex drool on his person.A lot of what was in the first film is here, though not necessarily in that order. One piece of silliness from the first film was the pet goose that the Mason expedition carried along and the nasty end it met is eliminated. The notion that the Verne novels were not speculative fiction, but actual fact is an interesting one. But try and apply that to 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea or From the Earth to the Moon and you might run into trouble.The special effects are nice, but I'd hate to say it this one is a good film, but strictly for the kiddie trade.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
2,SnoopyStyle,Forget about science or reality and enjoy the ride,7,15 January 2014,"It's been ten years since professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser)'s brother Max been missing. The university is about to clear Max's lab for storage. His nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) is spending 10 days with him while Sean's mother is preparing to move to Canada. Trevor is given a box of Max's stuff. There he finds the Jules Verne book 'A Journey to the Center of the Earth' which Trevor and Sean follow in the track of Max. Once in Iceland, they find Hannah (Anita Briem) who is the daughter of a deceased scientist. Max and the dead scientist both believe in the reality of Jules Verne's book. So Hannah, Sean, and Trevor follow the trail to an unbelievable underground world.Forget about the science, this is a simple fantasy amusement park ride. Brendan Fraser is the same guy as 'The Mummy'. He's still that charming nice guy. Josh Hutcherson is pretty good, but Anita Briem is kind of cold. Chemistry isn't that necessary. It's a great fun ride nonetheless.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
3,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Adventure,6,13 November 2008,"Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) receives his teenager nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) that will spend ten days with him while his mother Elizabeth Anderson (Jane Wheeler) prepares to move to Canada. She gives a box to Trevor that belonged to his missing brother Max Anderson and Trevor finds a book with references to the last journey of his brother. He decides to follow the steps of Max with Sean and they travel to Iceland, where they meet the guide Hannah Ásgeirsson (Anita Briem). While climbing a mountain, there is a thunderstorm and they protect themselves in a cave. However, a lightening collapses the entrance and the trio is trapped in the cave. They seek an exit and falls in a hole, discovering a lost world in the center of the Earth.This nth version of the classic novel of Jules Verne is an entertaining adventure. The characters are nice and there is a strong chemistry between Brendan Fraser and the unknown Anita Briem. However, the strongest part of this enjoyable movie is certainly the special effects. I have just seen this movie on DVD, but for those viewers that saw it in 3D in the movie theaters, the impact was certainly bigger and bigger. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Viagem ao Centro da Terra"" (""Journey to the Center of the Earth"")",Journey to the Center of the Earth
4,classicsoncall,"""Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?""",7,15 August 2020,"I was surprised how much this film seemed to be geared to a younger audience. It's action sequences took on a video game format, with the predictable result that all three protagonists in the story made it to the end with nary a scratch. More than anything, the movie resembled an Indiana Jones flick in it's presentation of hair raising escapades, and that's not a bad thing, but a little more originality would have been welcome. I thought there would be more in the way of dinosaurs in the movie, but we only get that one visceral Tyrannosaurus sequence, unless you want to count the ocean storm with a few giant sea creatures creating havoc with our heroes. Up to very near the end I imagined that Trevor's (Brendan Fraser) brother Max might somehow make a surprise appearance, but that was finally dashed when the explorers made it to Earth's daylight. Not a bad film altogether, but as I say, geared more toward teens and young adults who might never have heard of Jules Verne.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
5,jboothmillard,Journey to the Centre of the Earth,4,15 September 2011,"When I was a kid I remember watching an animated cartoon series called Willy Fog and the Journey to the Centre of the Earth, so that was probably the closest thing I knew to the famous story by Jules Verne, and I had a feeling a film version would be something like this, directed by visual effects supervisor of Men in Black and The Day After Tomorrow, Eric Brevig (Yogi Bear). Basically Boston volcanologist Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is looking after his thirteen year old nephew Sean (Zathura: A Space Adventure's Josh Hutcherson) while his mother Elizabeth (Jane Wheeler) prepares to move for Canada, and she gives him a box containing stuff from his missing father. Trevor is fascinated by some of the contents of the box that belonged to his brother Max (Jean Michel Paré), including a book charting the last journey he ever took in Iceland. Trevor decides to take Sean with him to following Max's steps and continue where he left off, in Iceland, and there they meet guide Hannah Ásgeirsson (Anita Briem) who joins them climbing the mountain. As the climb however there is a big thunder storm, and they enter a cave to protect themselves from it, but then they end up trapped when lightning strikes and collapses rocks to the entrance/exit. They travel through hoping to find another exit, and their first attempt is to use the near rail track and carts, which turns into a twisting turning roller coaster style journey ending up further into the cave. Then they end up landing on a very thin earth surface where the slightest hard hit will cause the ground to collapse, and of course this happens and they fall for ages before finally reaching a waterfall that breaks their fall. Finally they reach the same destination as Max did when he went missing, a world within the world, the centre of the Earth, a large tropical jungle with its own sunlight and a variety of plants and animals. It is also there that they find the body of Max, and after saying their goodbyes to the corpse they are desperate to find a way back to the surface, and Trevor works out that it may be on the other side of the deep underground ocean, so they make a raft to sail it. After encountering a large amount of prehistoric piranha fish and being saved by a Elasmosaurus, Trevor and Hannah realise Sean has been stranded further ahead of them, and with only his bright blue butterfly as his guide he must travel across floating magnetic rocks. When Trevor and Hannah eventually find Sean they are all then running from the hungry Giganotosaurus dinosaur, but he also falls victim to the thin muscovite floor, and they reach the river that may help them get out. Using a large dinosaur skull as their boat to avoid going into the boiling water they travel to the area where magma is gathering, and they hope to cause an explosion that will release the huge ton of water to cause a gas eruption that will help them get to the surface again. They do manage to do this and they are indeed plunged into the air by the huge rush or steam blasted from the magma until they crash to floor safe and sound on Mount Vesuvius in Italy, and the only evidence that they were ever there they have is a diamond they give away and the bright blue butterfly that flies away. Also starring Seth Meyers as Professor Alan Kitzens, Giancarlo Caltabiano as Leonard and Frank Fontaine as Old Man. As with The Mummy films Fraser is the cheesy action hero, and Hutcherson and Briem are just as adequate, if you were watching this in 2D you will recognise the obvious sequences made for the 3D audience, obviously the special effects are most of the time pretty good and help the action gain a little excitement, but overall it isn't the most impressive action adventure. Okay!",Journey to the Center of the Earth
6,ccthemovieman-1,A Fun Movie For Kids Mainly,6,2 November 2008,"Plain and simple: this is a kids' movie. If you're an adult and you saw the previews with some genuinely-scary looking scenes and thought, ""Wow, this looks cool"" - be warned. Some of it is cool, but most of it isn't.Most of it is Brendan Franser doing his ""George Of the Jungle"" routing of yelling and screaming, either trying to find this teen kid or in terror as he falling for being chased by something. In fact, the last half hour of this film will give you headache with all the yelling by all three major parties.I didn't realize this film was out in 3-D. I saw it on a regular DVD and the special-effects, in 2-D obviously, looked so cheesy. Some of these scenes looked like they were right out of the Tarzan movies of the 1930s with the obvious screen in the background and the actors on a stage in front of it. So, see this 3-D, if possible, otherwise expect it took look pretty bad.Teen girls in the audience will like Josh Hutcherson (""Sean""), a handsome young kid who looks ad sounds good, until he gets excited and his voice cracks. Ah, the joys of puberty. Meanwhile, teen boys will get an eyeful with Anita Briem (""Hannah""), a very attractive new face. Actually, Anita has a lot of credibility in this role, playing a character living in Iceland who, in real life, was born and raised in Iceland before moving to England at the age of 16.As for the story, it's a re-make of the famous Jules Verne story about discovering a whole new world (without people) in the center of the earth, complete with amazing birds and frightening animals and fish. Despite the dumbness of the dialog, the first hour was watchable. As with many adventure stories, though, it gets totally carried in the final third of the film.In all, the movie is fairly entertaining to the degree that adults wouldn't be bored if they took their kids. It's not really offensive except for one stupid play-on-words which is totally unnecessary. Other than that, this is a very clean film safe for kids of most age. There are parts, however, that are way too scary for the real young ones.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
7,ma-cortes,Amusing and lighthearted romp for kids and teenagers based upon the Jules Verne novel,6,5 January 2010,"A scientist(Brendan Fraser, also producer) and his niece (Josh Hutcherson) undergo an hazardous voyage to find clues of his father, along the way they face numerous dangers and risks. During the trip, the scientific and his niece hire a wealthy scout (Anita Briem) to find the father who disappeared several years earlier during an expedition to a center of the earth at Iceland. The trio descend into deep caverns and discover a tunnel-rail system leading to the planet's center. They have to deal with lightning storms, endure torrential floods, volcanic eruptions, prehistoric animals and discover a forest of giant mushrooms, but not the lost city of Atlantis as happens in the classic novel.This spectacular adaptation is a special version of the Jules Verne adventure yarn . There're rip-roaring action, spirit of adventure, derring-do, thrills and results to be pretty entertaining. It's a great fun with nice special effects , breathtaking set decoration and impressive art direction but with excessive use of computer generator. Lavish utilization of 3D cinematography and superb, imaginative soundtrack . Highlights of the voyage includes a roller-coaster trip, strong storms, magnetic rocks, a terrifying odyssey in sailing, prehistoric reptile, a Tiranosaurius Rex, and many others.Other renditions about this know story are the following : Classic version (1959) by Henry Levin with James Mason as Lindenbrook, Pat Boone,Diane Baker and Arlene Dahl; Spanish version by Juan Piquer with Kenneth Moore, and TV adaptation by George Miller with Treat Williams, Jeremy London and Bryan Brown.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
8,hitchcockthelegend,"Jules Verne's novel, it's true you know?",6,5 January 2012,"Originally released in 3D (I've not seen it in that format, sadly), Eric Brevig's take on the Jules Verne novel updates it to modern day and sends Brendan Fraser, his nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and Icelandic babe Anita Briem down to, well, the centre of the Earth. Where of course peril and wonderment await in equal measure. As adventure films go it's entertaining stuff as the intrepid trio run, dive, jump and fight their way through the hazards of a hot land that's getting hotter by the hour. The kicker in the story here is that they are saying Verne's novel is true, giving birth to a collective of people known as Vernians who believe this to be so. Therefore for plot drive the book is used as a sort of tourist guide to aid them in their attempts to escape from the Centre of the Earth. Cool or what? The production design is excellent, marking the film out as being very visually appealing, while a number of the set pieces are genuinely entertaining and suspenseful. It moves along at a good clip, too, and the three actors carrying the film engage firmly on the good side of good, especially Fraser, who can do the heroic kooky act with ease.It's far from being a truly great film, but the makers have at least tried to put their own stamp on the story, making it a sort of modern day sequel to the wonderful novel. But even with that in mind, narratively speaking it's very predictable for the most part, but speeding along as a family friendly adventure the film never once outstays its welcome. Of worth as well is that Briem's character, Hannah Ásgeirsson, is not a token female put in simply to look hot and give Fraser the push to prove his masculinity. Ásgeirsson is tough, intelligent and resourceful, working on a par with Fraser's Professor Anderson, this also sets up a running joke involving the two of them as to who saves each others lives the most times! In 2D some of the impact of certain scenes is invariably lost, though we can easily imagine what the 3D sight of Fraser unleashing a mouthful of toothpaste and water on us is like! But as it is it's a film that is unlikely to garner much love from sci-fi buffs and haters of popcorn pleasures, but kids will love it, as will the adults who don't mind letting their guard down once in a while for a bit of good clean family friendly fun. 6/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth
9,Hey_Sweden,I think we're in deep schist here.,6,15 September 2016,"Brendan Fraser plays a scientist named Trevor Anderson, who goes in search of his long missing brother Max, who vanished over a decade ago. Along for the ride is Trevors' surly teen aged nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson), as well as Hannah (Anita Briem), the lovely Icelandic mountain guide they meet. Sealed inside a cave, they soon find themselves transported to a magical inner world deep inside the bowels of Planet Earth, encountering various perils such as a drooling T-Rex and a steadily rising temperature.Much more inspired by the work of Jules Verne, rather than based on it, this *does* make the reading and dissection of the novel a major plot device. It also mentions people known as ""Vernians"", fans of the author who believed that he was writing fact and not fiction. There were some groan-inducing lines and moments for this viewer, and it's all rather silly and juvenile as it targets a family audience. It's the kind of experience that doesn't work as well outside of a 3-D format. Admittedly, the digital artists do create here some impressive, appealing visuals and environments, although the CGI monsters are not convincing in the slightest. (At one point, our intrepid heroes swing oars like bats at an army of piranha-like fish.) The little glowing hummingbirds are cute, to be sure. The sequence with the floating, magnetic rocks should raise some of the hairs on ones' head. Cinematography, production design, and music are all adequate to the occasion.The movie benefits from fairly likable characters & performances. Fraser, Hutcherson, and Briem are all okay, and create some chemistry together. Seth Meyers appears in two scenes as Andersons' snide, sardonic colleague.Lightweight, unmemorable, but passable entertainment. At least it's relatively brief at just over an hour and a half.Six out of 10.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
10,Doylenf,Jules Verne for kiddies...obviously slanted toward 3D effects...,6,29 April 2012,"Brendan Fraser again is an amiable action hero with a young nephew (Josh Hutcherson) in tow for a buddies adventure that includes a pretty (but boring) female guide as Fraser's eventual love interest. Let's fact it--nothing original about the story but it does feature some neat special effects (courtesy of CGI), not all of which are totally convincing, but hey, this is a kiddie romp if ever there was one.Josh Hutcherson is especially good as the adventurous nephew who trades quips with his fun-loving, equally adventurous uncle who is able to strong arm himself out of every incredible predicament.The scientific angle of the film is just plain silly but the film is fast moving enough to help us ignore all the lack of credibility angles. The roller-coaster ride in the mine is probably the high point of 3D effects if you can see it in that dimension but it's equally thrilling on a big flat screen TV.The only real asset the film has, aside from a script that is full of some good byplay between Fraser and Hutcherson, is the fact that the center of the film is Brendan Fraser who has lost none of his appeal as an action hero. He keeps the entertainment factor alive throughout.Fans of Jules Verne will no doubt forgive a lot of the goings on and view this as light entertainment aimed at kiddies more than grown-ups.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
11,preppy-3,Aside from some cool 3D effects this is pretty terrible,3,13 July 2008,"This film says that the events in Jules Vernes ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" really happened. Scientist Treven Anderason (Brendan Fraser), nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and sexy Hannah Asgerersson (Anita Brieren) travel to the center of the Earth and discover a whole other world.As an adaptation of Vernes' ""Journey..."" this is a disaster. As a homage to it its STILL a disaster! Heck, its a disaster just as a movie! Fraser, Hutcherson and Brieren fall from one disaster to another--none of them are remotely interesting or thrilling. I was mostly bored and looking at my watch. The science in this film is more than a little questionable and logic stops short halfway through. I saw it in 3D. The 3D effects themselves are incredible and made me jump more than once (the killer fish especially had me leaping:)) but the plot was stupid, the characters were seriously underdeveloped and--basically--this was very boring. In 2D this must me a real chore to sit through. If you can turn of your mind COMPLETELY you might like this. Otherwise this is an insultingly stupid and boring film. This gets a 3 for the 3D effects alone.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
12,CinemaSerf,"Daft, but an enjoyable enough remake",6,9 January 2020,"This isn't a half-bad reworking of the Jules Verne story. Here Brendan Fraser teams up with his nephew Josh Hutcherson and off they go into the innards of the planet in search of his brother. Along the way they team up with Anita Briem whose father also disappeared in similar fashion. The three of them have plenty of adventures as they try to find out what happened to their explorer kinsmen. It's a bit of a slog at the beginning, but all in all it's quite a good little family fantasy action feature with some fun special effects.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
13,dbborroughs,"Just okay in 2D, in 3D its a great thrill ride",7,14 July 2008,"I must not decide to see 3D movies in 2D simply because I can't see Hellboy2 Okay (in 2D) retelling of the Jules Verne classic has Brendon Fraser as a geologist who's brother has been missing for ten years. As the university Fraser is teaching at is getting ready to close down his lab, his nephew turns up to spend a few days with him. through circumstances he opens his brothers copy of the Verne book and finds it full of notes. This leads Fraser and his nephew to Iceland where, along with the daughter of a scientist they meet along the way, they end up going to the center of the planet.Its a diverting romp thats reasonably close to the basic plot of the novel. The performances are good even if the roles are unremarkable. There is a minimal amount of tension, but not a great deal since this isn't really a movie but a ride or experience and its plotting is as safe and harmless as ride a Disneyland.Filmed with every intention of being seen in 3D this loses a great deal in 2D. Its not bad in 2D but it plays more like a harmless kids film then the cinematic version of a thrill ride. To be certain this will look great in 3D even if most of the effects and backgrounds are obviously CGI. There's enough things to make you jump and duck- effects that are completely lost in 2D- and will be more so once this hits TV and DVD.Worth a trip to the multiplex if you're going to see it in 3D. If you're not going for the full effect wait for cable, of hope they do release this in some form of 3D on DVD.6ish out of 10 in 2D. 7.something in 3D.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Goofy fun and wicked cool 3-D visual effects make Jules Verne's classic novel a 21st century thrill ride when scientist Fraser takes his nephew Hutcherson to try to find his missing father who disappeared while attempting to locate a source to the titular locale by employing guide Briem and finding just that! Director Eric Brevig makes a decent debut as a filmmaker (previously a visual effects wiz which adds to the charm here) who wisely uses the novel as literally a guideline/map into discovering all the wonders/dangers of the underworld with impressive 3-D technology to boot. Fun for the whole family even if it cribs liberally from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and JURASSIC PARK.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
15,neil-476,"Don't expect Shakespeare, and it's fun",7,16 July 2008,"I was thoroughly browned off not to have the 3D version at our cinema, especially as so much of the movie is full of the usual 3D delights of things zinging out of the screen at you, things which have a great deal less cinematic justification if you haven't got the little cardboard glasses on.Brendan Fraser was his usual personable self in a tolerable retread of Jules Verne's story, a retread which uses as part of the plot the idea that Verne's novel was factual. There are only, effectively, three people in the cast - Fraser, his nephew, and the dishy Icelandic hiking guide (who does sweaty skimpy shirts and shorts rather well). All three principals are fine.The effects, too, are up to the task (although, obviously, I can't comment on the 3D). There are no huge surprises anywhere - there is an air of successful action sequences from other movies being retooled for 3D - and the couple of points which should have been emotional weren't. This is the sort of movie which is all about the ride, and not about the emotion.This is not a contender for best film Oscar. It's not a heavyweight drama. But go along looking for a lightweight popcorn movie, and you'll enjoy it.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
16,Wuchakk,Fun adventure/Guilty pleasure,6,12 March 2014,"2008's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a loose adaption of Jules Verne's classic book set in modern times. Here, the story involves Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, an attractive Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem), and their many misadventures as they stumble upon a an old mine and ""volcano tube"" that drops them deep into a marvelous subterranean world. Can they make it out alive?One glance at the poster or DVD and the viewer will instantly know what s/he is in for -- a fun, mindless adventure in the spirit of ""Indiana Jones"", which is understandable in view of the fact that the first Indiana Jones film ripped-off two scenes from the 1959 version of ""Journey"" (the 'guiding light' and huge rolling stone sequences). This 2008 rendition even features a thrilling roller-coaster-like rail-car sequence a la ""Temple of Doom,"" although it's done better here IMHO. There's also a t-rex sequence reminiscent of ""Jurassic Park,"" but the oversized reptile is more cartooney here (interesting how filmmakers still aren't able to outdo that t-rex sequence a full 15 years later!).I won't compare this version to the 1959 rendition with James Mason, Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl since that film was made a half century ago! Needless to say, these are two totally different movies from two totally different eras. I will say, however, that it's not as long & tedious and there's no pet duck -- lol (not that I dislike that one).Normally I'm not into mindless ""blockbusters"" like this but if they're done right and I'm in the proper mood for mindless fun adventure I'm usually able to acclimate and enjoy them for what they are. Such is the case here. Brendan Fraser is the perfect actor for these types of films (e.g. 1999's ""The Mummy); he's got that likable, benevolent 'everyman' charm. In addition, Anita Briem is easy on the eyes. It's surprising that there are only three main characters in the entire film, but they have great chemistry and you can tell they had a fun time filming; it transfers to the viewer.This is a family-friendly misadventure with the requisite goofy humor, which caused me to bust out laughing numerous times. I think it's better than the three Indiana Jones sequels (""Temple of Doom,"" ""Last Crusade"" and ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""). The only reason I detract a Star is my mind started wandering a bit after the t-rex sequence late in the film. Other than that, this is a highly entertaining zany adventure flick full of spunk and wonder. That said, I'm glad it only runs an hour and a half as films of this ilk should stay around the 90-minute mark so as not to risk overstaying their welcome (e.g. the three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flicks).I also enjoyed the desolate, mountainous Icelandic locations seen early in the picture.One last thing: The DVD features the option of viewing the film in 3D or regular (one side or the other) and provides four pairs of 3D glasses for the former. I tried the 3D version and wasn't impressed; the 3D gimmick just doesn't do much for me and I especially dislike the dingy overall picture it offers. Needless to say, I recommend viewing the film in non-3D.CONCLUSION: Turn off your brain and have a blast! GRADE: B",Journey to the Center of the Earth
17,siderite,Verne is rolling in his grave down to the center of the Earth,5,28 November 2008,"Imagine cardboard characters. Done? OK, now make them even thinner, up to transparency. They are now only a blur. You see the guy, the girl, the comic relief, the special effects... oh! The film is over!This latest ""inspiration"" from A Journey to the Centre of the Earth has lost all the science, the reasoning, even the dinosaurs (if you discount the briefest encounters with some plesiosaurus and a stupid Tyranosaurus). Anita Briem is terribly cute, but also has a terrible role as the slightly not in distress damsel.Bottom line: if you have any respect for Verne and his written work, don't watch this. If you are a really small child looking for insight into the world of adult relationships, you are only going to get confused. And if you want to learn how to stay safe, don't follow ANYTHING the characters do. If you are the screenwriter, kill yourself.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,Good action for the family to enjoy,7,17 July 2008,"I admit when I first saw the trailer for Journey to the Center of the Earth, it didn't really seem like it was going to be much fun to see on my own. But I decided to go ahead and give it a fair chance, I got to see it in 3D as well, I think that's part of what made it so much to watch. I know it sometimes feels like a kid thing but I think the 3D adds so much to the action since you feel like you are part of the movie. I also felt like this was actually well done and wasn't cheesy at all. I did see the original Journey to the Center of the Earth when I was a kid, I used to love watching it, now I'm an adult so seeing this newer version of the film brought back a few memories and created some new one's for this generation.Trevor is a professor who isn't really taken serious by his colleagues at the college as well as his students. When his sister in law drops off his nephew, Sean, for the week while she finds a new home in Canada, he goes through his brother's old things. Trevor finds the book Journey to the Center of the Earth with notes from his brother who has been missing for a long time. Trevor and Sean want to find out if this was real and travel to Iceland, with the help of an adventurer, Hannah, they go to the center of the Earth to find some amazing things you could never imagine.Journey to the Center of the Earth is worth the watch, I think what made it more exciting was the 3D, as cheesy as it sounds, it made the action more real and just apart of you. The story was fun and the effects were not too over bearing thankfully with the CGI. This is also the year of Brandon Fraiser, I know a lot of people think he is dull, but I thought he brought a lot of life to the movie, I think his career just keeps moving up. This movie is worth the watch in the theater, at home I don't think it will have the same effect, so if you get the chance, I would recommend it, this was a fun movie to watch and very enjoyable.7/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth
19,sddavis63,A Weak And Silly Adaptation Of Verne's Story,4,12 January 2010,"When the adventure happens in this ""adventure"" movie, it's pretty good fun. The rail car ride through the old abandoned mine was a blast, the dinosaur chase scene was both exciting and well done and Sean's ride on the magnetic rocks was really quite disorienting. Unfortunately, there isn't enough adventure in this ""adventure"" movie. For whatever reason, the decision was made to go more often for rather lame humour than exciting adventure. Both the beginning (going on for about 20-25 minutes) and the ending have a feel of silliness about them, which is too bad, because if this had been treated more seriously as a modern-day version of the Jules Verne story it might have worked quite well. As it was, while this had a definite ""Verne"" feel to it once the group got underground, it lacks the excitement and mystery of Verne's story, even with those few great scenes I mentioned. The basic idea behind the story is that Verne's novel was based on an account related to him by someone who actually made the journey. Now, set in the present day, the movie follows another group of explorers down into the earth, headed by Brendan Fraser as Trevor, a geologist whose brother went missing years ago and is presumed dead. He's joined by Anita Briem as Hannah, an Icelandic mountain guide, and Josh Hutcherson as his nephew Sean. They were all pretty good in this. There was at least one point to the story that made no sense to me. If this ""air bubble"" in which they found themselves heated up as much as they said (to up to 200F) then how did any of the creatures that were down there survive? And, how would a temperature of ""up to"" 200F (which means it could have been less and which itself is not the boiling point of water) cause all the water to evaporate? Some, perhaps, but there was a lot of water down there and I found it hard to believe that a temperature of less than 200F would cause it all to evaporate. That's a very technical point, of course, and the movie was clearly going for fun that sometimes descended into silliness, so it may well be unfair. The real problem here is simply that the movie was a weak adaptation of an exciting story. 4/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth
20,Robert_duder,A kids adventure fantasy but nothing more...with or without 3D,7,25 August 2008,"Journey to The Center of The Earth was cute. No more, no less, just cute. Kids...particularly young kids will likely love the theme park attraction element of being in 3D, the exact thing that many people worried about with making this film. They didn't make the movie and shoot it in 3D, they chose to make a 3D movie and built this around it. It doesn't feel as heavy as a gimmick as I thought it would but there is no doubt that the gimmick is still there. However I also didn't feel like the 3D made or broke this movie. I mean I have never seen it without 3D but the 3D aspect was impressive a few times but got old after awhile and they didn't even use it as much as they could have. Sure it's fun and it sounded like the kids around me were getting a kick out of it but adults will find the whole 3D thing kind of tired maybe and hurt their eyes after awhile. I found myself continually readjusting my eye site. Okay now that I've complained sufficiently about the 3D, which wasn't as bad as I make it sound, the movie itself is a fun little adventure. Certainly not complex, nor does it really let itself be any great epic picture but the action is fun, and the story is solid and small kids will probably want to see it again and again.Brendan Fraser is and always has been a very versatile actor, he nailed the action genre with his hero role in The Mummy trilogy, he hammed it up and went silly with movies like Dudley Do-Right and George of The Jungle, and he has done serious roles so the man can definitely do it all and best of all he knows how to connect with his audience, and no matter how bad the movie he has that working for him. It works just that way in Journey To The Center of the Earth. His character is believable and fun and adventurous and treats his teenage sidekick like a human being making the kids love him. And he looks good in 3D. Josh Hutcherson plays Fraser's Nephew Sean. Hutcherson is becoming a terrific child actor in his own right having impressed in movies like The Polar Express, Bridge to Terabithia and R.V., and he proves he can carry another film like Journey to The Center of the Earth. Him and Fraser have great chemistry and make a great team and I think Hutcherson has a very promising career ahead of him. Lovely and cute Anita Briem plays their mountain tour guide Hannah. Briem is good in her role as she is mostly there to be...lovely and cute and provide a romantic story line to Fraser. They have great chemistry together and they keep the romance toned down to something kids can just giggle at and not making barfing noises. She doesn't really impress but doesn't disappoint either.No matter how you look at it, the movie's real star is the gimmicky special effects. Yes the 3D but also the lava and the falling and the dinosaur and the glowing birds but even with all this special effect goodness, it fails to impress anyone over the age of eight. Key point to make perhaps is that director Eric Brevig is new to directing, although he has worked in different capacities on many other films, this is his first big screen directorial debut and I think perhaps he made the movie with nothing more than kids in mind. Now don't get me wrong if it sounds like I'm dumping on the movie, I enjoyed seeing it, but it didn't blow me away being the first movie entirely in 3D that I've ever seen. I think if you're looking for a really terrific family adventure with lots of fun then Journey to The Center of The Earth is perfect!! Nothing that the kids can't see and plenty of fun for all of you to enjoy together but if you're just looking for something for adults, skip this one because it won't really shine in your mind. 7 out of 10",Journey to the Center of the Earth
21,MLDinTN,not for anyone over the age of 14,3,27 April 2009,"I was disappointed in this movie. I was expecting a some what serious action adventure movie, sort of like Indian Jones. Instead this movie had some of the silliest visual effects and dialog; it was like it was made as a kid's film.Brandon Frazier is miscast as a scientist whom lost his brother 10 years ago. His nephew is coming to stay with him for 10 days. He gets a break in his geological research and he decides to go to Iceland to investigate. He thinks there may be something to the book Journey to the Center of the Earth. Him and his Nephew, Sean, meet up with a hot mountain guide, Hannah, whom is taking them to retrieve a box that has collected data. A lightning storm strikes, and the 3 run into a cave and are trapped by falling rocks. Now they have to find a way out, and discover the place that the book JTTCOTE talks about. It is just as the book describes. They go on an adventure across a sea, battle flying killer fish, dodge a T rex, and must find a way to shoot water out of a geyser before the lava reaches them.Now to the special effects; they were horrible. The worst part was the ride on the mine carts. It shows close ups of them talking. As if that was possible and jumping from cart to cart. The whole underground sea was also poorly done. It just all looked so fake. And the dialog was as if written by a 5 year old. And Brandon Frazier doesn't even seem to try to be believable.FINAL VERDICT: I'm sure kids would like it, but I didn't. I don't recommend it.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
22,g-bodyl,Great Fun!,9,18 November 2008,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is not a bad movie. I don;t know why critics always bash these kind of film. They always compare these type of films to Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Of course the mentioned movies are better, but this is a nice summer flick for the family. This movie is not going to win an Oscar, but who cares? This film is based on Jules Verne book and it is about Trevor Anderson, his nephew, and a mountain guide finding an entrance to the center of the earth that was thought to be fake by everyone except Max's deceased brother. They travel through the center experiencing many things that are not normal on modern-day Earth. The acting is pretty good. Brendan Fraser is great as always and he adds a bit of humor. Josh Hutcherson keeps getting more mature as he gets more roles. Anita Briem did fairly decent as the pretty mountain guide. I will admit that the screenplay is fairly weak, but everything else makes up for it. The 3D effects were amazing and it will blow you away. The music by the unknown composer is pretty good. Finally, I will warn you all that there is a sad part in the movie. Overall, a nice summer flick. I rate this movie 9/10.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Despairingly, Trevor goes home, only to discover he forgot that his nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson) is being dropped off for a week of bonding. Their initial greeting is hardly very warm on Sean's part. But, this soon changes when Trevor discovers that Sean's copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth by Verne has some important notes from his deceased brother, who died trying to reach the earth's core. Suddenly, both Trevor and Sean are whisked off to Iceland to connect with an old friend of Trevor's sibling. Alas, this man has died but his lovely daughter Hannah (Anita Briem) gets excited when Trevor explains the reason for their visit. Together, this trio goes down a quiet Icelandic mine, where they encounter undiscovered creatures, fall off the mine railroad tracks into the deep earth, and have very little time to find a way back out. In addition, temperatures rise above 100F and keep climbing. Will they perish inside the earth or return to the blue planet's surface? This fairly faithful adaption of the Verne classic starts so slowly viewers may yank it out of the DVD player. Do not do it!

24,tabuno,"A Fun, Exciting, and Simple Classic Reproduction",7,20 January 2019,"13 July 2008. This simplified version of Jules Verne's novel gets right to the point and speeds the story along in a consistent, almost straight-forward way that has thrills and spills without trying to be sophisticated and deep. It has it's human moments but doesn't try to be pretentious. The movie seen in 2-D is even able to capture some of the imaginative 3-D chills but the storyline and the action are still fun, entertaining. There are a few flaws and sometimes unconvincing plot devices, but on the whole this fantasy movie allows for some suspension of logic. People can bury themselves. We don't know who the person we see in the beginning of the movie is or what really happens. This updated version still doesn't have the awe and mysterious build-up as James Mason's epic (1959). This is a decent summer-time action movie that has Brendan Fraser added a nice human and fun face on the screen. Seven out of 10 Stars.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
25,The-Sarkologist,I actually quite enjoy this movie.,8,3 December 2012,"This is one of those movies that pretty much stands out from the many other action and adventure movies out there, and that is that it does not have an antagonist. Well, okay, maybe we could consider the university department head that wants Trevor Anderson's (Brendan Fraser) lab, but he plays such a minor part in the film that he is hardly even worth mentioning (or even crediting). Further, this is one of those films that I sort of look at the cover and ask myself why I actually bought it, and then within half an hour of actually watching it, discover that I am actually really enjoying the film and have a lot of difficulty actually turning it off.The film is based upon the Jules Verne story of the same name, though set about a hundred and fifty years after the original adventure. The idea is that Jules Verne wasn't writing a fantasy novel but actually recording the adventures of the protagonists of the book, and a number of people have since travelled to Snaffels to try to locate the cave that allegedly leads to the centre of the Earth. One of these people was Trevor's brother, who disappeared about ten years before the film leaving a wife and a child.Trevor's sister in law, decided to finally try to start a new life, leaves her son with Trevor and goes off to set up a new home, but while going through his brother's stuff, discover a copy of Verne's book which has been scribbled in and annotated to an extent that it actually looks like a bible. They then discover that one of the monitors at Snaeffels has activated, so they both jump onto a plane and fly to Iceland to investigate, and after picking up another companion (a quite attractive female mountaineer) and a series of mishaps, they discover that what Verne had written was true and find themselves in the centre of the Earth.This is a fun movie, with some rather intelligent humour as well (Hannah: emeralds!, Sean: rubies!, Trevor: feldspar!). However the one thing that this movie seems to be is an amusement park ride, though we are not meant to actually take is seriously (I am somewhat dubious that six large jars of nickles and dimes could actually buy a ticket to Iceland from America). Pure and simple this is a family movie, and considering a lot of the rubbish that seems to float around, this is quite a well made family movie, though I find that Brendan Fraser does quite well in this movies. Some may think that his career has stalled, or even stagnated since the days of Airheads, but who knows, maybe he is happy in the roles that he takes. Hey, I haven't seen much of Buschemi either, and Adam Sandler has gone on to play soppy romantic comedies (oh how I wish for the days of Happy Gilmore).",Journey to the Center of the Earth

The acting is pretty good and the plot is unique and very creative. The movie is a little short and there aren't may characters in the movie (really only 3 main characters). In the start of the movie, its starts slow then it turns it up a notch and the acting and fun gets better.Its a nice comedy and filled with a lot of surprises, its sort of predictable but that's what makes this video entertaining.

27,filipemanuelneto,A very fun adventure through the bowels of unrealism,6,30 October 2017,"This film tries to adapt to the cinema the sci-fi novel ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" by Jules Verne. Book and author are even abundantly referred in the film. However, it creates a new story around the book that is a far cry from what was written by Verne. To begin with, this film doesn't happen in the nineteenth century but rather during our time and the original novel was about a scientific expedition into a volcano, not an occasional incident that runs by chance. The script is pretty basic and far-fetched, runs over science in favor of dramatic effect and abuses the usual clichés of adventure movies, with poorly constructed and undeveloped characters escaping from certain death always at the last moment. There is a lot of silly stuff in this movie and it harms it's quality. The film has a nice cinematography and the fast pace that it takes, along with its short lenght, helps to make it more enjoyable because we forget mistakes and failures that we would be thinking about, focusing on what is happening.About the actors I can only say that the cast is regular, tries hard but doesn't have much quality material on which to show talent. Brendan Fraser is the sounding name here, but it doesn't surprise the audience. His character is similar to what he had in ""The Mummy"", reason why it doesn't require a major effort of the actor, whose career fell into the doldrums after his sudden success. Anita Briem is a perfect stranger to me but plays the hot girl contested by the good guys while Josh Hutcherson is the revolted teenager.In short, this movie is the typical adventure movie in which nothing is credible but makes the public have fun, with appropriate doses of humor and action, some silly romance and a forgettable story.

Honorable mention: a dreamy Anita Briem.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
29,funkyfry,Entertaining schlock,6,1 November 2009,"Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is probably one of the last sci-fi classics that really was screaming for a new 21st Century film version. While Hollow Earth sci-fi was extremely popular in the late 19th Century, its implausibility is generally apparent at this point even to the unwashed masses. Who knows why the producers decided to pick this particular story? Maybe it was in the public domain. It's certainly not sacrosanct, but seems a bit silly.Granted that the premise is silly, the treatment is thankfully goofball enough that it's all of a kind. If they had tried a more serious treatment, the film itself would be a total joke. But it's full of winking and nodding, not exactly ""camp"" but definitely cheezy. I enjoy these types of stories, so I didn't mind watching the film at all. I had a few good laughs, saw some decent action scenes, etc. The love story seemed pointlessly grafted onto the story, even objectionable in the fact that Anita Briem really does look closer in age to Brendan Fraser's movie nephew (Josh Hutcherson) than to Fraser. Hutcherson himself has very little to add to the film, but I wouldn't mind seeing more of Briem.Basically I didn't think the movie was much better or worse than similar recent films like ""National Treasure."" I'm sure the 3D effects enhanced it in the theater, but I didn't see it in that presentation. For my money, Brendan Fraser is perfectly fun in these types of movies. He reminds me of people who used to do this type of film like John Agar and Doug McClure. People who enjoyed him in his ""Mummy"" movies will enjoy him in this. Those who find him annoying will find nothing new here to redeem him.The movie scores some points for being slightly unpredictable (I was sure that the boy's father would end up being alive, and turned into a mad villain of some type). It's not an ambitious film, so I would say that it hit the marks it was trying to hit.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
30,Anonymous_Maxine,"Mostly for kids, but the best version of Verne'e story ever...",7,2 August 2008,"In an effort to prove the potential truth of his long-missing brother's research and theories (and to get along with his smart-ass nephew), Anderson sets off on this quest to penetrate the earth's crust through a volcano in Iceland. What follows is a remarkably faithful presentation of Verne's story, which doesn't really matter because most people will be more interested in the 3D anyway.And the 3D is impressive, by the way. We have come a long way since those red and blue sunglasses that just made everything look red and blue, the 3D here is so realistic that the obligatory jump-through-the-screen moments may cause even the most judicious of us to raise our eyebrows. Sadly, that realism is the new novelty, so the movie can't help halting in its tracks every ten minutes or so for a nice 3D wow-moment. I hate that.It should be noted that this is a family film, so don't expect high adventure or danger the likes of which you should expect to find on a journey anywhere where no one has ever been before. As a guide, I have developed a theory that, in a movie like this, the character who doesn't know anything (Sean, the nephew), is about the age of the target audience, because he is the one that needs to have everything explained to him, for the audience's benefit. Sean is 13.There is, however, an immediate and crippling discrepancy with the story. Before anything happens resembling any journey anywhere, we get a Toyota Prius commercial, a PSP commercial, plugs for Mountain Dew, Tivo, Family Guy, and Iceland Airlines, and the strange revelations that a PSP can ""Google at 30,000 feet"" and a punk teenager can receive calls on his cell phone while trapped miles below the earth's surface. That's news to me!The problem is that the story of a journey, as Anderson describes it, through the earth's crust and into the mantle, requires a fundamental lack of modern scientific knowledge. So it follows that in a society that has commercial airlines, hybrid vehicles, portable video game devices that can search the internet at cruising altitude, cell phones that work anywhere on or in the planet, and modern computers, should also understand that a journey to the ""center of the earth"" is, as they say, an exercise in futility.Nonetheless, this could be a great way to spend some time with the kids this weekend and, although there is one emotional moment and one romantic moment in the movie and both fall completely flat, it's not the worst date movie I've ever seen. Even though Prof. Anderson and Sean encounter a creature late in the movie that betrays a stupendous lack of imagination on the part of the digital effects team, there are some clever and amusing scenes (""We're STILL falling!"") but also plenty of cheeseball dialogue and half-assed performances (Fraser's quivering lip is just too much...), but despite the roller coaster ride lifted right out of Indiana Jones and the bizarre idea of the magnetic rocks, the movie surpasses expectations.

31,jzappa,"""Humongous Fungus!""",5,4 October 2008,"This is a bad movie, and yet at the same time maybe about as good as it could be. There may not be an 8-year-old alive who would not love it. If I had seen it when I was 8, I would have remembered it with deep affection for all these years, until I saw it again and realized how little I really knew at that age. Because I saw it now as a collegian, I may never achieve an erection again.You are by now on more than informal terms with the premise, that there is another realm inside of our planet. The title, Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3-D, is the most self- explanatory title one could ever give. It is a journey to the center of the Earth, and we watch it in 3-D, and on this journey, the functioning attitude is that no matter how often or how long a distance they fall, they will hit the ground without being hurt at all. They fall an awful lot, and awfully far. The first descent lands them at the foot of a yawning cavern, from which it is not achievable to climb, but they stay extraordinarily buoyant. Not surprisingly, they find a deserted mine shaft and climb on board three cars of its small railway for a scene that I would say was ripped straight from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom if it were even a fraction as effective.The issue of not being able to experience this undiscovered world because it's in the pitch black of a cave is resolved in the next cave they enter, which is populated by adorable birds that shine in the dark line neon. One of them makes friends with the character of the young boy, and leads the three main characters on to the big turning point of the story, a world surrounded by a vast inner sea. The center of the earth has to be a terrifying place in which to live, what with its human-eating plants that pose the threat of strangling you, its sea holds fish with oversize pointed teeth and alarming sea snakes that prey upon them, and ashore is a large dinosaur.So do the characters lose heart? Would you have any hope if you were ensnared miles underneath the earth in a cavern and being hunted by its ravenous residents? There isn't a second in the movie when they appear at all to be scared or anxious, not even in the course of a fall directly down for miles, at some point during which they have curious, nonchalant conversation.

They bombarded the audience with too much and, yes, it looked cool, but does that even matter when, in the end, you are too distracted to remember you paid for a movie, and somewhere in there, there was a story with actors actually acting it out...but they were well hidden beneath the 3D effects and you really didn't get to see them.Thank God movies learned how to tone it down and find a happy medium since.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
34,dfranzen70,Wild effects buoy deep-exploration plot and balance Fraser,7,17 July 2008,"The 3D effects of this spine-jarring yarn largely offset the hammy, over-the-top nonacting method practiced by Brendan Fraser to provide quality family entertainment - as long as you don't mind your family seeing perilous attacks by carnivorous fish, dinosaurs, plummets to the center of the earth, molten lava, and cave-ins.Some kidding aside, this is a fun movie, a reminder of how escapist movies used to be - that is, not over-hyped balls of crapitude. We didn't hear much about this redo of Journey to the Center of the Earth, not with so many other widely anticipated movies coming out this summer. And this version lives down to the lack of hype. It simply is what it is, which is a lazy way of saying it's amusing as long as you don't expect it to be, you know, terrifyingly awesome.First, a note on the 3D effects. Not all showings are in 3D, because 3D projectors are expensive. If you're unfortunate and can't find a 3D theater showing this, my advice is to skip it entirely - or perhaps watch it at home on your big-screen TV anyway. The truth is that once you strip away the effects, this is less Raiders of the Lost Ark (which it desperately wants to be) and more Alan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (don't remember it? wonder why). It's like watching Sheena of the Jungle without the jiggle factor. It's got a main story thread - they must escape to the surface - and little else save for the great 3D effects. Another quick note: I don't know much about 3D technology, but I did notice that when an object was presented in 3D (say, a yo-yo darting toward the audience), everything else in the scene was in soft focus. I don't know if this is an artifact of the technology or if it was by design (i.e., diverting attention to solely the 3D), but it's not good that I noticed it.The plot is straightforward. Fraser plays a Trevor, science teacher whose brother disappeared seven years earlier while researching tectonics. His widow drops off their son to Trevor so they can male bond, or something, and soon they're off adventuring, looking for clues to the brother/father's disappearance. They wind up in Iceland, where they figuratively hook up with a lovely mountain guide named Hannah (Anita Briem), whose father had been working with Trevor's brother. And off they go to check on a seismic reader on a remote mountaintop, when a freak lightning storm traps them in a cave, which leads down, down, down, and eventually they're at the center of the Earth.Fraser has been gunning for these kind of roles for a while now, but here he's even less swarthy and manly than he was in the Mummy movies - he's more like Link, the caveman he played in Encino Man. Well, he's smart, and he's got courage, but Indy Jones he's not. In fact, he screws up so often early on that Hannah has to keep saving his life. That's gotta sting. So Fraser doesn't exactly fit the hero mold here, but what's more he can't show emotion properly. He either delivers his lines in a flat monotone or pushes the needle in the other direction and camps up a storm. I half expected him to look at the (nonexistent) sky and wail, ""WHYYYYYYYY?"" But certainly the big deal here is the effects, and many of them are especially awe inspiring. The movie lends itself rather well to 3D effects, what with the plummeting and the running and things flying at our heroes and stalking them and trying to stomp on them or eat them. It's good to see such creative use of 3D effects, because the better these outlying special movies are, the more likely we'll get to see more 3D in the future. It's expensive to make these, and theaters have to be specially equipped to show them, so unless there's a huge demand, there's no real reason for studios to make a lot of 3D movies.Journey to the Center of the Earth is based on the eponymous Jules Verne novel, and the novel itself figures prominently in the movie - pretty meta, huh? Yes, the book's probably better than the movie, so let's dispense with that, but even so, this isn't a bad adaptation. In fact, it's kind of clever in spots; Trevor's brother discovered, apparently, that the adventures and exciting places in Verne's book actually occurred and do exist, so Trevor, Hannah, and Sean (the nephew) can follow the book to see what perils await them. It's more of an homage to Verne's work than a ripoff of them, which is nice. Oh, and the movie even mentions Vernians, people who (in real life, not just this movie) do believe that Verne's novels are really nonfiction travelogues.Watch this movie in 3D, and you're sure to ooh and aah and OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS at various moments of impending doom. Journey to the Center of the Earth is imaginative, fun-packed, and a real treat; it's just that there's not much else there other than the effects, which somewhat blunts the appeal. Watch this movie in 2D, and it'll be just another two-bit B action movie with pithy one liners.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Its an adventure based 3d special effects movie it's about that....NOT about history that my moronic nay sayer is called a documentary!! This movie wont win any awards for acting or screenplay but it should win awards for 3d special effects. And it did what a movie is suppose to do...ENTERTAIN and it most certainly did!!

38,3xHCCH,I Enjoyed the Journey Very Much!!!,8,10 July 2008,"I was actually very surprised to see Brendan Fraser in this movie, just when a bigger Brendan Fraser movie is about to be shown later this month, ""The Mummy 3"". Brendan had been off the screen radar for quite some time after ""Crash"", and suddenly he comes back with two summer blockbuster movies in a row! In ""Journey,"" we again see the Brendan Fraser his fans have all grown to love, as the goofy action-adventure hero. This in fact could have been another installment of the Mummy series! In this adventure, he also has a pretty yet gutsy lady companion, and a young boy in tow, much like ""Mummy 2"".Brendan plays Trevor Anderson, an earth scientist who felt he needed to go investigate an unusual volcanic activity in Iceland in order to locate his brother Max. It just so happened that Max's son 13 year-old Sean (Josh Hutcherson) is under his care for ten days. Max had been long lost in an expedition in search for the fabled center of the earth (as described in his favorite Jules Verne book) when Sean was only three years old, In Iceland, they were able to hook up with Hannah (Anita Briem) who was the daughter of another scientist who also believes that the writings of Jules Verne are based on fact, just like Max. When Trevor, Sean and Hannah get trapped by a rock slide inside an old mine shaft that is when the fun and adventure beyond their (and our) wildest dreams begin! I watched this in a regular theater, but clearly you can see that this movie was meant for 3D. The roller coaster-like mine car ride had of course been done so many times before, but it was very exciting just the same. I was also thrilled by the ""rocks in a magnetic field"" scene, the flying prehistoric fish scene, as with the T-Rex chase scene, especially when I imagine them in 3D. All throughout the adventure, we were also laughing at Brendan's funny lines and physical comedy done to break the tension of the scary scenes.OK, overall I enjoyed it. Check your logic at the theater door and just go along the exhilarating journey with Brendan Fraser and company. It is shallow and maybe even corny, but we both enjoyed this adventure very much. The hint of a sequel at the end is very welcome.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

This doesn't pretend to be a ""scientific"" film, but a fantasy quest. A fun film.I think the last ""fun"" movie was the same title nearly 50 years ago with James Mason and Pat Boone. Directors and producers have been so arrogant and self indulgent in their desire to bully audiences, that many people thought it was ""illegal"" to make fun films.And this film is fun. What makes it fun? Action, suspense, effects that don't look like video arcade games, visuals that can be followed due to good editing, but mostly, because of good, fresh, believable characters. Finally, a male lead who doesn't already have a wife, ex wife, and children. That comes close to being groundbreaking in itself. There are also lots of role reversal surprises, as the woman is the industrious one, and the males are the ones in distress. That is what really makes the film work.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
40,TOMNEL,"From the laughable opening to the preposterous ending, this movie is a cheesy and fun break from reality.",7,21 July 2008,"From the moment this movie starts, you know what kind of film it is. It's very entertaining all throughout, but at the same time so ridiculously ill conceived and stupid. It's one of those popcorn munching flicks, where you finish the movie, and an hour later, all you remember is the popcorn. Journey to the Center of the Earth isn't a particularly good movie, and it's certainly not well written, but the entertainment value is often through the roof, and the 3-D is pretty cool too.Trevor Anderson (Brendan Frasier) is a science teacher who more than anything wants to prove his late brother's findings true. His brother disappeared on one of his excavations over ten years ago. Trevor's nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) comes to stay for a few days before he moves to Canada, and Trevor finds his brother's notes on the journey to the center of the Earth mission he was lost on, and Trevor and Sean go to Iceland for the adventure of a lifetime. As their mountain guide, they hire a scientist friend of Trevor's brother's daughter (hopefully you got all that), Hannah. The three get stuck in the Earth and see miraculous sights, such as T-rex's, big plants and a huge freefall.I'll start with the negatives and move onto the positives. Sean could be a very annoying character. He is always pointing out the obvious for the audience who the writer must have assumed are too dumb to figure this stuff out for themselves. Every moment other than those at the beginning are pure chaos, to keep the audience interested, but sometimes it could be too much and I just wanted some time to think about the numerous effects coming at me. The script is also full of bad puns and jokes, which were only good in camp value, and too much camp is not good. Also, why the heck were so many jokes taken from the Spy Kids movies. From the long falling scene to the s-word fake out, this movie reeked of Spy Kids, not that Spy Kids was bad. Incosistensies were plentiful, but this was a fantasy.Entertainment was all this movie was made for (and money). The acting is pretty good, and the direction and special effects work well. The story is silly, and jumps around a lot, but what else could it do to keep audience attention. Brendan Frasier is a charismatic lead, and there just wasn't much bad about the movie.Overall, this is a fun movie, full of cheese and corn, but at bearable levels.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. PG for violence",Journey to the Center of the Earth
41,Enchorde,"Too much (bad) effects, too little story",5,5 December 2009,"Recap: Unsuccessful and mainly disrespected geologist Trevor Anderson is obsessed with the idea that his disappeared brother put forth. That the tectonics works in such a way that another world might exist beneath ours, just like the story Jules Verne wrote. He is so obsessed he almost forgets that he is to take care of his nephew Josh a few days, so when the two of them find an anomaly on Iceland, he got to bring Josh along. He enlists young mountain guide Hannah, but on the expedition, they become trapped in a cave. It leads further and further down and soon they find themselves on the most unbelievable adventure.Comments: Yes, it is an adventure without any comparison, but two things should be known about this movie. First off, it is a family movie. Yes, it is adventurous, but not in any really suspenseful way. More in the goofy, funny way. You should know this before you watch, because otherwise it might become annoying.Second off, it was released in a 3D-version, and the script and direction is clearly adapted to it. It is all too evident, even if you don't get the 3D-version. Some stretches of the film is far too much alike a theme park ride to be really good. But I bet it is spectacular in 3D. Apparently the original writer and director left the production in fear of the movie focusing on effects more than story. His fears proved to be well founded as the story unfortunately takes the back seat to effects far too often. As a grown-up it almost gets boring sometimes, and I guess a few kids might think so too.Surprisingly much of the CGI is of pretty poor quality. Some animals and environment is feeling too much like plastic toys, and the characters are too evidently acting before a blue screen. Sure, I know they must be, but when it looks like they were cut in like in a movies from the forties, it's bad.I didn't much appreciate the acting either, with one exception. Mostly this is due to the characters. Trevor is too goofy and clumsy, and too responsible for the comic effect. Josh suffers from movie-kid syndrome annoyingly putting himself in trouble too much. Only Anita Briem, an authentic Icelandic, as Hannah is a competent character and acts convincingly. I sincerely hopes she get better roles in the future, and returns for the planned sequel.I had hoped for more, even without any high expectations. Maybe next time they could focus more on doing the basics, like a decent story, before they concentrate on the special effects.5/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth

43,invisibleunicornninja,BORING,3,3 April 2018,"A few years ago my mom borrowed this movie from the library claiming that it was entertaining. It is not. Do not watch this movie. It is terrible. Characters - I have no clue if there were actually characters in this movie. A more accurate description would be ""a couple of people were asked to read lines, and walk across poorly designed greenscreens in an effort to get people to call them actors."" Take it from me, no one on the cast of this movie cared enough to even attempt a convincing performance. The script was pretty bad, but still. Plot - This movie is mostly boring filler. There is a plot, but there are no stakes to it and it doesn't help that most of the human beings shown onscreen are too dumb to breathe. Sights and Sounds - Nothing in this movie that doesn't take place on the surface looks real - and even then there is still some unconvincing CG above ground. Maybe this movie looked good in theaters - I don't know - but most people aren't going to see this movie in theaters seeing as how this movie was released 10 years ago (more depending on when you're reading this review). If the only thing that your movie has to offer is that it looks kinda cool in 3D on a big screen, then you have failed. The sound mixing is also pretty bad. Message - True, I might not have been paying too much attention by the end (the only reason I watch this movie all the way through was because I was bribed) but I'm pretty sure the end message was that lying and stealing is good. The ""protagonists"" lie and steal all throughout the movie, and in the end they come out on top. Great message for the kids to learn.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
44,eric262003,A Innovative Remake of the Classic Jules Verne Novel,7,1 June 2009,"The real reason this remake of Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is not anywhere near the novel is mainly because of the masterful technology with a 21st Century kick with it. The movie is dependent on 3-D graphics with polarized glasses as the main source for visualization instead of the cheesy red/blue type. Without the glasses, the visuals are slightly opaque. Such wonderful sights include the slight chunks that come falling on the screen or the widening mouths of the giant fish are truly a sight for sore eyes which would literally make you jump out of your seat. Sure it's hinders in the vicinity of Verne's novel, but it never once follows through. Brendan Fraser stars as Dr. Trevor Anderson, an expert geologist and Josh Hutcherson plays his nephew Sean who has no choice but to stay in the custody of his eccentric uncle. Sean's father was in this process of a very special project, but the university had to postpone the project entirely due to his father's mysterious disappearance. A sensor set in Iceland is just a hint of Verne's novel that set Trevor and Sean and their guide Hannah (Anita Briem) on their journey to explore strange lands below the Earth's surfaces and encounter strange creatures to add to the excitement of their exhibition.In tradition to the classic cliffhanger genre, the heroes face life and limb as they escape form one dangerous obstacle to another and in the end after all the chaos they are finally rescued and it all adds up to one riveting 92 minute roller-coaster ride that never slows down in pace.The critics will condemn this movie mostly due to the fact that it's simple with no real surprises coming at it and depends too much on special effects. But this something you can take your whole family to see, and I'm sure they'll enjoy it immensely just as much as those parents who took their children to see it when it came out a year ago.The only drawback was the gearing up for this adventure which took too long and those with short attention spans were growing a bit impatient for the climax, and by the time the Center of the Earth journey began, it was finished too quickly. I would've liked more emphasis on the escapade rather than the actual setup, but overall it was still an enjoyable movie and deserves more credit than it deserves.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Could this have been made in two? They certainly used quality film stock to shoot and print this. Everything else is so bad, you wonder what drug they were using on the set.There's no story here, the original Verne novel merely used as point of reference while the three actors stumble from one foolish and implausible 'dangerous' situation to the next. Verne's novel, especially as realized in the brilliantly entertaining '50s film with James Mason, was a glorification of scientific discovery. No science here. Laws of physics and known facts about the prehistoric earth are just ripped through like so much tissue paper.The characters are devoid of personality and have no interesting dialog - ""we're still falling!"" has become a joke around here, not because it was humorous but because it was so obviously out of place.My friends and I had a grand time saying lines and remarking action - BEFORE they happened, everything was so painfully predictable.There were also lame 'dramatic' moments we fast-forwarded through since we knew them all by heart from other films.Speaking about which - is Spielberg suing these cruds for not only using his ""Temple of Doom"" mining sets, but actually using (with CGI alteration?) large chunks of that scene in the Indiana Jones film?

46,screenman,And It Should Have Stayed There,4,4 January 2012,"A boring bloke and a couple of tiresome kids plummet harmlessly to the centre of the Earth, taking nothing with them but a third-rate script, hammy acting, inferior special-effects and a pocket-full of clichés. That's it.The original 1950's version starring James Mason certainly had its faults. Not the least of them was Pat Boon's crooning. But with Mason and his iconic voice piling on more gravitas than Brendan Fraser could muster at gun-point, a truly bad baddie (he ate the pet duck raw!), a sly and witty script - especially the gender sparring between Mason and the heroine, and prehistoric animals that set the standard right up until 'Jurassic Park', there was much to admire.This remake demonstrates yet again that lack of good story can never be redeemed by a surfeit of special-effects, especially when they're sub-Jurassic Park. Even when Uncle Stevie's T-Rex is wheeled-in to prop up the enfeebled thrills, you're simply left with a sense of de-ja-vu. Especially with the 'Indiana Jones' underground railway sequence.It's the old grumble: STORY is something that happens to someone you've been moved to care about. I just couldn't give a hoot about these three chuckleheads. So story fell at the first fence and nothing the backroom boys could whistle-up on their computers could either remedy or redeem it.

IMAX showings for that film sold out for the whole day (not surprisingly)! What did I decided to see instead? ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" in 3D! Yeah, I guess you can say I was slightly disappointed yet a bit excited for another film.Let's start off with the good: 3D. Well, that's probably the reason to see this movie in the first place! What's so good about this 3D? It's RealD 3D! What does that mean? I have no idea! What I can tell you is that you won't be wearing those plastic red and blue 3D glasses anymore.

Well, you need it. You really need it but, of course, you weren't expecting this film to be realistic, did you? Now, what I didn't like about the film is that, well, it really wasn't as fun as I hoped it to be. Yeah, there were some fun scenes but I just expected ""more,"" if you get what I'm saying.The CGI looks good, in my opinion, but I don't think it matters in a 3D film. The action sequences are fun. The imagination runs very broad here, which I liked, but the film is based on an imagination-filled book anyway. The performances by the three leads were good. Actually, Brendan Fraser played a convincing role as a smart science teacher, which I never expected him to pull off.Overall, the film was fun and entertaining, although I expected more.

Perhaps because each version strays further from the source material; apparently Hollywood directors think they can improve on Jules Verne. Yeah, right: sure they can.This one tries to bedazzle the eyeballs with strange, exotic creatures and some of these are done pretty well. However, as they just appear at random, it becomes apparent the design of these creatures is all the makers of the film paid any attention to. Plausibility is lost in a sea of impossible situations that just tumble along. For example, distances are not consistent, there are numerous conveniently contrived key moments, and nothing is bound together. The mine ride is a joke. Yes, there's obligatory monsters, such as a T-Rex thrown in just for the heck of it. Ol' Rex has apparently survived for the last 65 million years in an underground desert devoid of any food source, and when it does find something to devour, it plays hide 'n' seek with its victims first.

49,dunmore_ego,Hitting Bottom,5,26 December 2008,"Boy's Movie. In 3D. Serves its purpose of getting thirteen-year-old boys interested in slim blond girls with indeterminate Euro accents and tennis-ball ta-tas. Brendan Fraser has some nice ta-tas too. All that sweaty tight t-shirt adventure with the Running and Screaming and CGI completely outa control. It's been decades since I've read Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of The Earth, but I can safely say this movie is only ""loosely based"" on Verne's book. Very loosely based. They really lost me on the INDIANA JONES mine-cart ride... when three mine-carts jump a precipice (with no approach ramp) and land on the opposite side, exactly on their tracks - a stretch of fantasy even Jules Verne would never ask of us. More concerned with inserting 3D wonderama moments than any plausible explanation on how humans can survive the bone-crushing pressures at the Earth's core, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH quickly takes our heroes to a subterranean world within this world. Brendan Fraser is the scientist mocked for his ""hollow Earth theories,"" Anita Briem is the indeterminate Euro chick and Josh Hutcherson is this movie's own target audience 13-year-old boy, who discover a pocket of ecosystem near the Earth's center, where they encounter luminescent birds, floating magnetic rocks, and the perfunctory tyrannosaur. Every new iteration of CGI tyrannosaurs keeps getting better and better. This is the best you will ever see. Until the next iteration. Though it contains a smidgen more ""science"" than the 1959 movie of the same name (starring James Mason doing his best - uh, James Mason), we must note that this 1864 tale was written by a guy interested in ""science"" as adventure fantasy, not as scientific fiction, like Clarke or Asimov. So the crushing atmospheres above our heroes' heads is never mentioned. Or there would be no movie. No popcorn. No ta-tas. Verne did try to convey a sense of evolution though, the surroundings and fauna becoming more prehistoric the deeper the characters went; a jot of that concept remains when Brendan Fraser ejaculates every ten minutes about the exciting rock strata that no one else is interested in, including the audience. Get to the dinosaurs, willya! Directed by first-timer Eric Brevig, JOURNEY goes deep, stays shallow. For the thirteen-year-old boys. And when the temperature rises so high it forces Anita Briem to strip down to sweaty tank top and short shorts, Science is the last thing they're thinking about... well, maybe biology.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
50,pyrocitor,Verne-lite,6,2 November 2008,"If nothing else, Journey to the Center of the Earth proves a perfect example of Hollywood's ability to mislead audiences through twisted marketing ploys. Those privy to the film's trailer would hardly have expected heart-wrenching drama, but the focus of the content did allude to at least a young adult crowd, likely fans of such summer fare as the recent Mummy films. And while such demographics would hardly be alienated by the film, this adaptation of Jules Verne's classic novel is one geared firmly towards kids, making no attempts at profundity and forcing not only suspension of disbelief but completely tossing it to the wind. Implausible plot points are consistently ignored simply for the sake of not slowing the fun down, as fun is all the film strives to be, unabashedly striving for the thrill of Indiana Jones while shirking on the quality. While the subject matter could have easily been turned into a sprawling, gripping adventure film, visual effects specialist Eric Brevig (making his directorial debut) appears content to coast by with a lazy imitation of the source text, so securely propped up by formula that one has to wonder how little would be left if every genre cliché in the film was removed. Nonetheless, there is an endearing charm left in the story which manages to make the frustratingly shoddy screenplay more bearable and glean a dull spark of enjoyment out of the heavily worn exterior of convention. The main concern is a constant sense of rushing, constantly leaving the viewer yearning for more time simply spent exploring and appreciating the wonders of the mysterious fantasy world and crucially deprived of the chance to enjoy such a wonderful construction. Despite the title, the actual time spent in the center of the Earth proves disappointingly quick, with too much time devoted earlier to wince-worthy ""character development"" sequences that easily could have been clipped, or at least rewritten to be more enjoyable. Nonetheless, when the characters reach their titular destination the film excels, making the lackluster rest of the journey considerably easier to stomach. The film also proves unusually self-reflexive for a Hollywood blockbuster by incorporating the unorthodox plot device of having Verne's novel not only made reference to, but actually inciting the journey itself, by being discovered to be a factual account rather than a fictional story. Despite being an intriguing idea, the Verne referencing is used to rather unimpressive effect, (characters being able to predict points in the film by scanning the book is simply tiresome rather than subversive) though it does lead to a rather commendable (if overstated) underlying message about the importance of reading. Such intriguing touches, while used to varying effect, do prove impressive experiments in narrative form, although the overtly sequel baiting ending is cause for a major groan, undermining previous minor innovations. However, for those wary of the added 'wow' 3D effect, the film is unlikely to garner many new converts, as it begins to feel more gimmicky than impressive (characters spitting or tossing objects towards the audience feels excessively contrived, though unassuming kids may enjoy it) and one begins to wish more of the budget had been invested in script rewrites or improved special effects. That being said, Brevig's past calling does prove to be the high point of the film, as while the special effects hardly break new boundaries (the tyrannosaurus sequence pales in comparison to past efforts, from Jurassic Park to Peter Jackson's King Kong remake, both of which the film directly plunders from on numerous occasions) they do succeed in evoking a rather marvelous sense of nostalgic wonder and joy, one sure to ensnare even the more jaded of young viewers. Foremost of the film's potentially objectionable points is the necessity of tolerating Brendan Fraser at full force, high pitched screaming and over-expressive facial tics included. Nonetheless, while operating firmly in Mummy mode, Fraser remains an amiable enough lead to infuse the picture with energy and prove likable for younger audiences. Forced with confronting the horrendously overdone defiant teenager archetype, Josh Hutcherson does his best, doing little to redeem the inherent painfulness of his character but masterfully managing to emerge with a share of charm amidst a succession of wretched one liners. Icelandic actress Anita Briem is similarly entrenched in a thankless role as the stock female adventurer/love interest, and despite Briem's best attempts to put a slyly gruff spin on the character she quickly erodes into a dull damsel in distress figure with little to offer except furrowed brows or winsome smiles. Finally, the reliably comedic Seth Meyers is given nothing to do as Fraser's malevolent fellow researcher, his screen time cut so short that any hope of merciful comedic potential is quickly eclipsed. While the reduction of Verne's classic adventure with endless cinematic potential to a lightweight, uniformly formulaic Hollywood blockbuster is hardly a surprise, it still comes as a wistful disappointment when one envisions the film it could have been. Nonetheless, Journey to the Center of the Earth holds an undeniably endearing charm beyond what the shoddy script deserves, proving enough to raise a reluctant smile on the majority of adult viewers and easily enough to glue children to the screen. Those entering the film with no expectations will be graced with a forgettable but simplistically enjoyable adventure romp, whereas those seeking substance over superficial flashiness will find their lips curling in scorn within the first two minutes. Take it for what it is, and the film proves exceedingly difficult not to enjoy. -6/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth

I have been thinking for a long time on what to rate this movie. I have now come to a conclusion.The film was a disappointment. Surely it was better than Land of the lost but man it was a little stupid. I am sure that when they made it they were intending on a film with brains. This is an entertaining film. But certainly not art.The film occasionally aims for laughs. It has a couple but can't quite make it. It seems a little too short. Just a little. I will give it to them for visuals. and I will give it to them cause, though there is about an 85 minute length there isn't 30 boring seconds. Alright, the film is silly. But it works to some extent. 3-D might have been a different story. I like Brendan Fraser. I always have. But none of his films in 2008 were spectacular. But he did have a comeback. Though I for some reason enjoyed The Mummy 3. My original rating on this film was a 6. Then I realized that I didn't like The Mummy more than this. So I upped it a little.The story: Well, it's not based on Jules Verne's classic tale. It's about a professor named Trevor Anderson. His brother went missing many years ago. When his nephew Sean(played by Josh Hutchinson) visits, they discover notes inside the book""Journey to to the center of the Earth"" and realize that he might have been up to something.So the two of them travel down to God knows where to find the entrance. With the help of some chick, they travel down to the center of the Earth on accident. Of course. And try to find their way back home.The actors are likable. Or at least Fraser and Anita Briehm are. So is Josh Meyers, though he isn't in it much. The film is just stupid fun.

We talking about no other than the latest in the long line of screen adaptations of Jules Verne's classic book ""A Journey to the Center of the Earth"", which has been adapted dozens of times in the past fifty years. In regards to this version, which was presented in 3D, but is just as good in 2D, it's funny, its low-key, its short, and its enjoyable. I liked it a lot more than I did ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008) and this was a sort of reward for having to sit through that torturous disappointment. No, this is not a great movie, but it's entertaining nonetheless and I was not depressed after seeing it like I was after sitting through the previously mentioned catastrophe.The plot: it's still the same. A scientist (Brendan Fraser) finds out that there's a pathway that leads to the center of the earth, where fantastic ancient life still thrives. But there's a twist: Jules Verne's book exists in this version. So it's not entirely a basis. Fraser suspects that Verne's tale may be a true one and he enlists his nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and an Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem) to go and search. There is no rival party this time, thankfully, for I'm tired of that formula, and no pet ducks like in the original 1959 film and it's just one silly scene after another so that in the end, I was more than pleased.The movie is advertised as being presented in 3D and it is. If you see it in 3D, you'll get lots of surprises with creatures and yo-yos and other things lunging out at you, but if you despise 3D like Roger Ebert, then see it in 2D and you'll get just as much fun out of it, I think. There's not a single intelligent or witty moment in the film, it is really more of the same of people running from dinosaurs, man-eating plants, and trying to find a way home, but since it disposes of the other really unnecessary elements that usually consume movies like this and just plays as quick-moving fun, I enjoyed it.If you want dinosaurs and other dangers, you'll be more satisfied I think than I was with the 1959 adaptation, which I am still surprised to admit that I did not enjoy seeing as how I typically prefer the classics over the remakes. Fraser, Hutcherson, and Briem encounter all sorts of creatures, none of which are scary save to maybe young children, see fantastic sights, and soon find out they have to reach the surface before the world boils again. Now there is a logical lapse to that element, but I won't let that take over my review for it didn't spoil any of my fun.This is a very fine adaptation of the Jules Verne book, but in a way, it's not quite satisfactory. Again, there are many retellings of this classic story starting with the original 1959 version and I myself have seen three of them and while I did enjoy two of them, they didn't reach my expectations. There has not been a great version done just yet. But maybe someday there will be. For what it is, this version is quite all right. Not extraordinary, but quite all right and very delightful after having witnessed the mind-numbing ennui to be found in ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.""",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Blatantly written for ill-educated children, ""Journey..."" has only its 3D visuals going for it. Yawn. Fortunately, I watched this one while multi-tasking and thus only needed to look up when the ""action"" was happening, most all of which was video game oriented, said video game probably being more interesting than this film. Brendan ""The Mummy"" Fraser takes a paycheck, though amiably enough, while Josh ""Bridge to Terabithia"" Hutcherson gamely plays Robin to Fraser's Batman, Icelandic RADA grad Anita Briem provides the love interest, and Seth ""SNL"" Meyers grabs another resumé-enhancing paycheck as well.

55,vip_ebriega,"Hardly the Foot Notes of Jules Verne, but pleasant.",6,21 December 2009,"My Take: An enjoyable adventure movie for the whole family, despite some of the effectiveness comes and goes with the 3-D gimmicks.Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a rousing all-boys adventure novel with everything kids in the day love about adventure: rappelling in caves, perils at sea and of course, battles with prehistoric monsters. With so much distractions nowadays, it's hard to say that kids today will find any of those old-school stuff effective, but Eric Brevig's 3-D adventure JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH makes a good shot at trying. Using the same gimmick as the SPY KIDS movies, this version may find it easier to attract to the youngsters in the audience. But like some of its 3-D brethren, some of JOURNEY's joys comes and eventually goes with the 3-D.Since I saw JOURNEY in the small screen on 2-D instead of in the theaters on 3-D as it was intended to be, I can relish that JOURNEY is a passable excursion; visually-pleasing but lacking in thrills as 3-D could easily give to its audience. In 3-D, the film would be smashing as the images of peril and scenes with roaring dinosaurs literally pop out of the screen. In 2-D, the film sort of loses its punch. The plot is fairly different from Verne's novel, yet it pays more than an homage to its source by stating that Verne's novel was actually a statement of fact, which Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) and his nephew (Josh Hutcherson) uses to find an underground prehistoric world inhabited by dinosaurs, prehistoric creatures and giant flora.Director Brevig, a former FX guru, has more experience with his pixels rather than actors. The first half, which introduces us to the characters plays like a bad Disney Channel movie. But when it comes to delivering his special effects-laden sequences, Brevig delivers, even if the action is more or less derivative in spots (There's a mine-car chase scene reminiscent from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM). In 2-D of course, none of these effects pack the same amount of punch. And yet, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH makes a passable diversion. Kids will love it, and I'm sure that 8-year old in your head won't resist seeing it. Maybe just once.Rating: *** out of 5.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
56,SanteeFats,Entertaining,7,11 December 2014,"First of all I really like Brendon Frazer. He plays his roles tongue in cheek and with out trying to be taken too seriously. In this remake of the Jules Verne classic they take a slightly different tack on the theme. Looking for an Icelandic expert Brendon and his nephew meet the daughter of the deceased man. So the three of them go on a trek and find the hole to the center of the earth. Here they find many adventures and come across the site of the nephew's fathers notes. Turns out the temperature is going to rise to 200 plus degrees. That will kill everyone. So after some trying times they set sail across the rising seas trying to get to the vent leading to the outside. Of course they end up returning to the ""real world"" where they came from. Now if the temp rises so high how does the animals survive? I can see the water species surviving if they can go deep enough but what about the birds and such? A watchable movie that I found pretty entertaining.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
57,fwomp,A Fun Diversion ...But Purists Beware!,6,22 November 2008,"It'd be tough to pin down exactly how many times JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH has been adapted to TV and the big screen, but a fairly accurate accounting might be ""too many."" I've been able to find at least eleven adaptations (a few of them foreign productions, but still productions). What's more puzzling is that in 2008 not one but TWO versions of the book made it to film. The first was a horrible television adaptation in January starring Rick Schroeder (SCRUBS). And the second is this supercharged action version starring Brendan Fraser (CRASH) who's probably best known for his portrayal as Rick O'Connell in the new Mummy series' of films.The big question as to this particular Jules Verne story's appeal is obvious: Why? Why so much fanfare and Hollywood hype? Many people have been critical of Hollywood and their lack of originality, and if you use Journey to the Center of the Earth as a barometer to that affect, then you'd be absolutely correct; they have to keep reinventing old shtuff because they can't come up with anything else.Regardless of your take on originality, the one large positive that comes from these hyperbolic recreations is that it introduces a new audience to Verne's masterpiece. And the action in this one is really fun to watch on a big screen with 3-D images plunging into your vision.Although this edition is cool from a visual perspective, I still hold the 1959 version starring James Mason as the penultimate adaptation. Quirky, funny, and outlandishly impossible (and in technicolor!), the '59 film was an adventure fantasy/SF film ahead of its time. At the 1960 Oscar's it was nominated for three awards, including special effects. I doubt this 2008 recreation will be so blessed. But...It is fun, however. You can't help but smile at some of the newly introduced lines (""What? You're thirteen, you can't calls dibs.""  when the two males in the party realized how attractive their guide was). But herein also lay a big problem: distance from the source material. With the exception of getting to the center of the Earth and how they leave it, there's not much Jules Verne left in here. For a beloved classic, that's a shame. But, again, the film will hopefully introduce a new set of readers to the novel.It is also noteworthy to mention newcomer Anita Briem as the incredibly attractive guide Hannah. A stunning looker in terms of natural beauty, she not only prettied up the film but also gave a surprising rugged quality to her character. Also of note is veteran child star Josh Hutcherson as Sean. Many will recognize him from his roles in ZATHURA, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, RV, and the soon-to-be-released CIRQUE DU FREAK. He played well next to Fraser and was the sympathetic character most will come to identify with.The final word...It's an okay diversion with lots of action and an update to Verne's classic, but it's not really Verne's anymore. Beware purists.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

The story started out very well in the first few minutes, but later it becomes too obvious with some dumb and silly moments throughout the film. The character depth was lacking at times and the ending felt pretty rushed. The fourth flaw that is even worst is it's clichéd script.With those flaws aside, everything turned out great. The scenery is very imaginative, the costume designs are perfect and the music from Andrew Lockington is excellent. The acting is pretty decent. Nothing great, but nothing awful. Brendan Fraser did excellent as the leading role, Josh Hutcherson did very good as his nephew and Anita Briem did great as the scientist. The dialog is OK, but nothing special, but the strongest aspect is the visuals for it's sheer excellence in detailing the look of what it's like in the center of the earth.

61,bopdog,"Silly, but surprisingly enjoyable anyway",9,13 July 2008,"The reviewers of ""Journey"" are probably all correct: the logic is spotty, the premise is silly, and the requirement of the audience to suspend disbelief is beyond a typically successful film. However, despite all of that, I liked it! I went to see it because in my small town the offerings are rather slim, and I had seen everything else (is it me, or did this summer's films seem a bit clichéd and lame?).Brendan Fraser has always been a great actor, with an agreeable presence. That he was the star here helped a lot. As did the newcomer actor, the Icelandic lady- Anita Briem. Somehow, one never seems to think of film stars as coming from Iceland. But she is comely and interesting to watch, and she looked good with Fraser. The supporting cast (and there wasn't much of them, as it was mostly CGI stuff, and not really populated with many humans, except for brief appearances) was also adequate, albeit they had little to do.Overall, then, this was science fiction with an emphasis on the ""fiction."" Little here was even remotely believable. Yet taken together, it made an interesting visual contemplation of ""what if?"" and an enjoyable couple of hours at the cinema (for example, the characters free-fall to the ""center of the earth,"" which would be 4,000 MILES down. Allowing for the rather slap-dash explanation of ""magma envelopes"" and all, we are nonetheless asked to believe they fell thousands of miles in a few seconds. The lava tube they fell down, fake as it was, was kind of evocative--- it did bring to mind a sense of mystery, and the powers of nature that are WAY beyond our everyday experiences, even if it was rather silly).Oh, BTW, an obvious logic flaw--- if there really was a magma envelope surrounding the interior ocean and lush tropical paradise--- why didn't the free-fall take them through that, it being a sphere and all?

I could slip in the bathroom and be out of commission for days, yet this fearless trio can literally fall thousands of miles down a hole and not get so much as a bruised hiney! They can speed over 60 mph on a rickety 60+ year old mine car without being derailed and jump farther than those Duke boys could in the General Lee! They can out run a T-Rex on the open field, explode through a volcano thousands of feet, cling to the underside of a rock like a fly, endure 130 degree heat without breaking a sweat, eat trilobites and not get the runs, and crash a hang glider from a thousand feet without skinning an elbow!!! At least the 1950's version retained some veneer of plausibility. These people even survived fiery explosions without a blister, found each other over scores of miles using a compass, and all in one and a half days? Yeah, I had fun watching it, but later on, you realize it may just have been the stupidest film you've ever seen! At least the script didn't call for the actors to take each other seriously, but this also robbed the film of any suspense whatsoever. Kind of like in a Spielberg film - you just know the kid's not going to get hurt no matter what.

Max Anderson, Trevor's brother, built the monitoring system and placed the units around the world 10 years earlier. For some unknown reason, Max did not return, leaving behind a wife and son, Sean (Josh Hutcherson). Sean's mother leaves the teenager at Trevor's house to get some quality time with his uncle. They look at Max's copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne and find a secret code. Back at the monitoring center Trevor compares the volcanic activity numbers and finds that they are exactly the same as the ones in the book. Trevor and Sean fly to Iceland to check one of the units and to see if they can find some information about where Max went. Trevor hires a beautiful mountain guide, Hannah (Anita Briem), to take them up the volcano. During an electrical storm on the volcano, they get trapped in an abandoned mine. They search for a way out of the mine and discover a wall filled with large diamonds. Unfortunately, the floor they are standing on can't hold their weight, and they fall down a volcano tube for miles and miles until they reach the center of the earth. Once there, they encounter prehistoric glow birds, flying piranha, man-eating plants, and T-Rex dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years. They find that they are seeing the same things that were printed in the Jules Verne book. This gave them hope that someone was able to escape from the center of the earth and return to the surface.(My Comment) This is one fantastic movie in digital 3D. The 'Real D 3D' lens are glass and not the old red-and-green cardboard lens. They have new 3D frames that are large enough to fit over your glasses. If you see the movie, you must see the 3D version, because it was the best special effects in 3D that I have ever seen. There are some scenes that will make you jump, because you think the object is about to hit you, or the object is within your reach. I actually put out my hand several times to touch an object, that is how real this movie was to me. The 3D was so good that I looked at it almost as much as looking at the acting. As you can see, I thought the new 3D technology was just incredible. The 3D effects are crystal clear and so realistic. The effects of small objects coming out of the screen are better than large ones. The movie itself has some thrilling moments and of course the Jules Verne story is a great fantasy that you will love from beginning to end. I enjoyed the movie and loved the 3D effects. I am giving the movie my top rating just for the new 3D effects. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:32, Rated PG)(10/10)",Journey to the Center of the Earth
67,dilipbts,Journey to the centre of the earth,7,10 June 2020,"Don't go and see 'Journey' if you're expecting either a solid interpretation of the Jules Verne novel, or a thrilling summer blockbuster. 'Journey' is light hearted fun, but as a piece of light hearted fun, it excels.The story centres (no pun intended) around publicly abhorred professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) whose lab in New York faces closure just as things are getting exciting (cough cough) with his research into volcanic something or other, a project derived from his obsession with the unexplained disappearance of his late brother. To further complicate things Trevor gets landed with his smart alec techy nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and thus premieres a generic 'odd couple' relationship as the stuffy academic trades words and yo-yos with his post-mod companion.Anyway, as soon as this gets underway, Trevor finds an excuse to jet off to Iceland where for one reason or another he descends two hundred feet into a volcano and after one big 3D disaster leads to another, he finds himself (big shock) at the centre of the earth, wherein he, Sean and annoying Icelandic guide Hannah (some unknown Icelandic actress making her unconvincing debut) encounter all manner of 3D perils and wonders including carnivorous plants, troublesome fish, massive great geyser thingies, and the impending doom threatened by an up and coming volcanic thermal heating up whereby everything gets roasted...oh, and a dinosaur...he's cool :D.The good stuff? The storyline is a lot more cut to the chase than I've made it sound, the 3D effects are cracking, and despite being landed with the name 'Trevor', Brendan Fraser makes for a great lead. I've always been a casual fan of his since seeing the Mummy as a child, and whilst this role isn't much of a challenge for the erstwhile Fraser, he commands the screen when he's present and is thoroughly entertaining throughout. The kid who plays Sean is decent support as well. There are some truly great visuals, and although the mine cart chase disappoints, the raft ride does not; it's a visual feast and a great action piece that would be perfect if not for the 'we're on a fishing trip' line thrown in by Hutcherson.The bad stuff? Hannah Asgeirsson is cringeworthy as the love interest/ guide figure, a character it is impossible to like or even find interesting. The storyline is pretty predictable, and in terms of story and set pieces, 'Journey' doesn't really offer anything that hasn't been done before, and often better. A couple of the jokes fall flat, and the 3D glasses are pretty annoying, although probably not nearly as bad as the film would be in 2D; I can only assume it loses much of its merit.So 'Journey' is never going to compete with previous genre flicks such as Jurassic Park, but it never really sets out to, which is the salvation of the film; everything is done with a casual wink to the audience; we're all in on the joke that the film is a bit naff. Whilst you're in the cinema it's great fun, but on reflection 'Journey' is little more than a memory jog of better films. Go for the 3D cinema experience, but don't bother with the DVD, because the more you watch this, it's probably going to become more and more tired.Ultimately, Journey to the centre of the earth is a solid family film that thankfully never tries to be anything more.

It's very obvious that this will be a roller-coaster ride somewhere, complete with dinosaur spittle being hurled at you, I bet!

I am kind of sad to report that they managed to (kind of)screw it up. Brendon Fraser does make for a dashing figure as the brother of the professor who got lost in Iceland,searching for the world within the world. The screen play manages to take elements of Verne's original & fuse it with a modern day spin. I guess my real problem with all of this is the fact that,although the female lead is very easy on the eyes, the romantic subtext was bulls**t (there is no romance in the original novel). The 3D special effects are,however,a corker to watch (it's always a hoot to see the members of the audience who have never seen a 3D film before).

The instant strength of this film that comes to mind is the great use of the 3D technology. It has plenty of surprises, and it doesn't over do it at all. HOWEVER, this does not excuse the blatant cheesiness, stupid typical one liners from Brendan Fraser, nor the underutilization of such a fantastic concept.The story isn't really based on the book by Jules Verne, it's more based on a group's adventure that uses the book as a guide. It's certainly a fantasy adventure that kids will enjoy, but adults may find themselves getting restless by the time the third act reaches us. I also have very strong complaints about the predictability of the film, which was so bad that I could predict what the characters would say, in addition to what was about to happen on screen. That's bad. It's a classic case of flashy visuals, horrid plot execution. It's a wasted concept that could have been a lot better had the film-making branched out from the narrow scope it obviously uses. In fact, I could see this exact premise working PERFECTLY in a Guillermo Del Toro or Tim Burton type horror film.We really only got three characters in the movie (and less than ten speaking parts), so a lot rides on our three leads. First, our headliner and box office draw, Brendan Fraser. He may not be the best actor, and he may say some pretty stupid one liners that get old after the 800th time, but he still has the same charm that makes him likable in the Mummy films. I really think that this film is further proof that Josh Hutcherson is THE best young American actor. He's blossomed into a great young actor, after a stunning turn in Bridge to Terabithia, in addition to great shows in Zathura and Little Manhattan. I've never seen a kid (especially a boy, as the girls tend to be better performers at ages 10-16) show so much emotional range, not only in this movie, but throughout his already prolific career (he's 15 and has 24 acting projects in his career). He's one to watch for a very long time. Our third lead is Icelandic actress Anita Briem. She neither added or took away anything from the film, though I suppose that can be blamed on the script, as she is not well developed. Seth Meyers (yes, THAT Seth Meyers) provides some laughs at the beginning and end of the film.I felt that the chemistry between performers was very good, and was one thing that kept me interested. I came to care for all three of them, and they worked well together. Fraser and Hutcherson in particular worked well as uncle and nephew. While I was disappointed in the narrow scope of the film's vision, what was contained within said scope was well done and entertaining. The 3D really made it better. Without the 3D, this film is nothing but a mere C-class fantasy adventure that will bore anyone above age 10. However, the chemistry of the actors and the 3D save it from somewhat disaster, and make the film a bit enjoyable. It's worth the price of admission to a 3D theater, for sure, but I advise you to bring a younger person with you (who knows, maybe you'll feed off their energy). To put it simple, every kid under 10 or 11 will love it, then watch it again in 10 years and go, ""what was I thinking?"".WITH 3D: 5/10 WITHOUT 3D: 3/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth
77,mirosuionitsaki2,Amazing. I beg you to see it,9,17 October 2008,"When the movie started, I was getting so close to calling this movie a failure that it's not even funny, but my mind changed and I began to enjoy the silliness of this movie. Who would have ever thought that a 1864 book would be mentioned in it's own film adaption? And who would have ever thought that the movie would just be based on the book? Makes a great movie.Sean and his Uncle are together for the weekend, and his uncle finds what he was looking for. His brother's work on the center of the Earth written in his copy of the book Journey to the Center of the Earth that would help him find.. well, the journey to the center of the Earth. So now it's this big adventure with a mountain guide named Hannah and Trevor Anderson and Sean Anderson to escape the center of the Earth in the most action-packed compact french fries that explode way. I use amazing descriptions. There's also a romance with Trevor and the mountain guide and there's a lot of comedy.I loved the 3d, too. I think this was my first time seeing a 3d movie in theaters (or at all) with those weird glasses, most likely it was. It gets annoying at first but then I just accept it and it's pretty great. I think it kind of used it a little too much with the yoyo swinging at your face in the beginning of the movie and stuff but it was still alright.You will probably enjoy this movie if you are those who like to watch a movie with your child (or the type of movies your kid will beg you to see with him if you had one). Great movie. I love how these kids movies change from Spy Kids (which was a horrible movie) to a thirteen year old Sean with a PSP and a cellphone. Amazing. I saw an article in a newspaper about how cellphones would change classic movies but the cellphone thing actually made a funny scene with Sean and his mom calling him while he's fighting underground fish in the center of the Earth with a huge wooden pole as a baseball bat. Hilarious.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
78,jerekra,Good Family Fun Film.,8,9 December 2008,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is a good fun movie. It is not as serious toned as the original film by the same title. But it is good in a different way.The story basically involves a rock scientist, Frasier, and his nephew whom he had not seen in a while. While conducting some tests they soon begin on a journey to the center of the Earth by accident.CGI plays a big part in this film. CGI is becoming a more and more used tool in movies today and sometimes it ruins films and other times it does not. I think that that they may have used a little too much, did they really need those birds that glow blue? THe CGI is pretty good quality though, I just think they may have used too much.The acting was great. THe bond that Frasier's character and the nephew character develop is great. And the female guide that goes with them was pretty good also. I think Brendan Frasier may be one of the most under rated actors of his time. He has been in a few bad films, but he has a lot of good films under his belt as well.This film has good pace as well. You do not have to wait long for action, and there is plenty of action.SO this is a good action packed film with good acting. I prefer the original, but this is a really good film.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
79,carlos37andre,"It's not good, but you can be entertained if you go with the right mindset",5,5 June 2020,"I remember seen this movie back in the theatre back in 2008, and I remember I liked it, even though I almost poop my pants when the dino showed up. I have to admit it didn't age very well, for a movie that's barely a decade old.The CGI is bad, there is no way around it. They over use it, and some scenes look really really bad. The Dino is bad, the green screen in the sea shots, and almost every wide shot in the center of the earth is not good.The movie itself isn't that bad tho. Sure, I could nitpick a bunch of weird stuff here, but if you can get pass the bad CGI, I think the movie is entertaining enough, in it's short 90 minutes run time. For comparison I definitely had way more fun watching this one, than watching the 2012 sequel with The Rock. The acting isn't great, but the story is fast paced, goes straight to the point, and has some fun moments (some are fun cause they are supposed to be, others you can just laugh at it, like Brendan Fraser fighting a plant).Overall tho, the movie definitely has flaws, it aged poorly for something that's only 12 years old, the acting isn't great, and the CGI is horrible, but it's fast paced, I found the few jokes way better when you compare to its sequel. It isn't great by any means, but with the right mindset, you can be entertained for 90 minutes.Obs: I almost forgot, one of the elements that aged poorly, but it's kind of funny when you see the movie now, it's that it was clearly made at the period of time people were trying to figured 3D out, and doing some obvious shots where something goes straight to the screen and flows there for a while, or some shot that lasts 1 or 2 seconds longer, just cause it would be cool with 3D glass. Well, it's just weird when you see it in 2D, and its funny cause it feels sort of stupid (not that it was cool back then, cause... it wasn't). Anyway, just a lose thought.5,5/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth
80,rparham,"Not a ""Journey"" worth taking",4,23 July 2008,"I have never read the novel Journey to the Center of the Earth, nor have I seen the best known filmic version of it, made in the mid-50s (I did see a TV miniseries version a few years ago), but I am reasonably certain that Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D is not what you would call a close adaptation of it's source material. Unfortunately, the individuals behind this new movie have not assembled elements to make an entertaining package, no matter how closely (or not) they have followed the source material. Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D is a mostly underwhelming experience, lacking much in thrills or excitement, but providing a great deal in the way of boredom.Set in the modern day, we are introduced to Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), a professor of geology whose brother disappeared a decade earlier. The lab the two ran is now threatened by budget cuts, and during a visit of his nephew, Sam (Josh Hutcherson), long dormant sensors in Iceland begin registering activity and Trevor, with Sam in tow, travel to Iceland to investigate the disturbances.They meet up with a guide, Hannah (Anita Briem), who takes them up the mountain where the sensors reside, and they find themselves trapped after a cave in. Upon exploring, they determine that the original Jules Verne novel was, in fact, an actual account of the experiences of it's hero, Lidenbrock. Now, Trevor and company must brave lava, giant man-eating fish and plants, and dinosaurs to try and reach the surface and safety.Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D is designed almost exclusively as a thrill-ride film, featuring several ""Wow!"" moments that are intended to take advantage of the RealD 3D format the film is presented in. However, between those few moments, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D is a mostly monotonous experience. The character development of Trevor, Sam and Hannah is paltry, bordering on non-exisistent. The characters are thinly-drawn, with little or no interest. Brendan Fraser is his usual affable personality, but it isn't enough to carry the film. Hutcherson and Biem are serviceable, but hardly spectacular.On the visual side, which is what Journey of the Center of the Earth is riding on, the effects are decent, but not so spectacular as to be unique. The action sequences are nothing tremendously exciting or unique, merely okay. If you are looking for the promise of an action-filled spectacular, you will be sorely disappointed by what is on display with Journey of the Center of the Earth 3D.With the re-emergence of 3D as a viable medium, thanks largely to computer animated movies, it is not surprising that there would be a live-action project that would come about. It is unfortunate that the first example, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D, is such a poor product. Hopefully there will be a better one to follow it up.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
81,NJMoon,Raiders of the lost Jules,7,12 July 2008,"Not the Jules Verne novel on film and certainly not a patch on the 1959 version, but a clever, modern riff on the book, none-the-less. The saving grace of this summer action flick is its 3D, and quite an improvement on the 3D films of yore, even if not quite as good as those seen at (say) a Disney or Universal theme park. Like it's summer neighbor Indiana Jones, this film revels in the unbelievably silly/fun action scene - this one a 'direct to theme park' mine shaft ride. Brendan Fraser is his usual sensitive hunk character, complemented with an Icelandic blonde girl guide and a Michael J. Fox-ish teen nephew.

82,vranger,Good family film,8,13 July 2010,"If you aren't a Brenden Fraser fan, stop right here and search for another film.If you are, you'll like ""Journey"".This is a good family film. We were able to watch it very comfortably with our 9 year old grand-daughter.The movie, which is about three people trapped far beneath the earth with prehistoric plants and creatures, is both exciting and funny. The main characters are all likable, and Brendan Fraser is at his charming and funny best.Sadly, even if you do all the work to correctly track down the 3D DVD version of this film and the 3D glasses. it won't do you much good. The home 3D presentation doesn't exactly jump off the screen at you, so my advice would be to skip the extra trouble and expense that I went through to that end.Suspension of disbelief is no greater for this 'follow-up' film than it was for the Verne book or for the original movie with James Mason and Pat Boone. The special effects are good, and the same solid dinosaurs about to eat people type that you've come to appreciate ever since Jurassic Park. The story is NOT meant to be a cover of the Verne book, it is sort of a sequel, in a way. That element of the movie was handled in a very interesting fashion.This is not the best movie you've ever seen, but it is enjoyable, and one of few you can enjoy with the family, so it does have value",Journey to the Center of the Earth
83,Ric-7,Old dude enjoyed the film,8,23 July 2008,"I didn't see it in 3-D, but I have to say I enjoyed it a lot. I am so tired of the current plot convention that an assortment of interesting characters must be introduced at the start so that at least half of them can be killed off in unpleasant ways before the film is over. Supposedly to make it ""realistic."" As though the rest of the film was totally realistic and believable.In this film, (here's a spoiler--stop reading now), no one dies. They come close, but no major character is sacrificed in a gruesome manner along the way. I think the film makers succeeded in their attempt to make Jules Verne's ideas seem even remotely possible. They chose to set it in contemporary times rather than in Verne's (easier and less expensive than a period piece), but I think the writer missed a major gag opportunity for nephew to answer Mom's question about what he did during his 10-day holiday with uncle. (I also was disappointed that they didn't also have the skeleton pointing to the Way Out.) I enjoyed the film a lot. I don't want to watch people die. I don't find that very entertaining. This film is not art, and not a top ten contender. I fear that The Dark Knight (a very deserving but different kind of film) will have totally eclipsed this film. It probably will not be in theaters for long. But if you are looking for a good film for grandma to watch when she's babysitting the kids, I think this would be an excellent choice.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

All he has to go on is an odd connection with Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" They head to Canada, and with the help of Hannah (Anita Briem), they find an entrance to the real center of the earth, and it turns out just as it was written in the book.Their adventure leads them through the deepest parts of the earth, and they realize they need to get out before they roast to death! It wasn't a bad film, it was good for families, but it's no epic that I was expecting. I didn't see it in theaters, so seeing it in 2D when its supposed to be in 3D is a very huge difference, and it deflects from the main point of the film. Not to mention that it's relatively short and the characterizations are fairly weak. Still, however, it's an enjoyable light action family flick.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

I asked the kind cashier behind the pay counter: ""Ma'am, is it just me or is Wanted not in your movie house?"" She politely replied: ""Oh yes good sir, Wanted is already fini. They had to replace it with Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3D."" Bewildered, I asked her: ""Journey what-ey?"" She replied: ""Its a film in 3D but currently its showing in 2D and it stars Brendan Fraser, do you want a ticket sir?"" I had no idea what I was getting into because prior to that, I had no idea such a film existed. But since the title sounded enticing I decided to watch this and blew off my 'Wanted' plans. Oh well, guess I'll just have to wait until its released on DVD.So anyhow, the film is inspired by a Jules Verne novel and is about this scientist of some kind who, along with his nephew and their mountain guide, embark on a perilous journey towards the center of the Earth.Well in my opinion, after watching the film I felt empty. It felt like I was robbed of my money because the film that I just saw was just plain hollow. Its your regular adventure film complete with the cheesiness and overloaded with clichés that only Hollywood can do best. The acting is plain. The story is quite dull, there were some funny moments but at best you will only get a mild chuckle out of it. The only advantage of this film or so they say, is the 3D factor but too bad because I saw it on 2D, so yeah it's just average for me. Maybe if I was like 10 years old then maybe I would have given this film a higher rating so I'll settle with 5.Damn. Should have seen Mamma Mia! instead.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Alas, here I am. Sadly though this was right around when things got real rough for him.Based on the classic Jules Verne book, except only sort of, because the book itself is actually essential to the plot in the movie which was a clever idea. The execution of said plot line though is somewhat lacking. Definitely geared toward a younger audience. Noticing the CGI now versus watching it in 2008 was a bit distracting, but it was made specifically for 3D which was effective.

I was simply ready to be entertained. Well, when it started up, I immediately became interested, because it looked enjoyable and entertaining and I was being fair on it, no matter how much it was against my nature to try and bash it. After awhile, as the movie continued on, I got a little restless, and at points flat out bored and uninterested. It was a good movie, but a lot of things were just unneeded and uninteresting, and also they tried to hard to make a cool, awesome, totally tricked out film when they should have focused a little bit more on plot and character structure. (They tried to hard to please the audience, as far as I could tell.) The performances were decent enough, I should add, as well.Well, overall, it was a nice, enjoyable film, but it is nothing that I would just praise down to the very core of the film, or really care to watch again, because there is not much that absolutely ""wows"" you throughout the movie, but it entertained, and there were some pretty cool action scenes I guess.

The focus here is all on the spectacular, indeed completely over-the-top, effects and action scenes.It's easy viewing, but not all that exciting. The characters never feel like (or act like) they're in that much danger even though they're buried deep under the earth with little chance of escape. Can't be too critical though.

This means that one of the film's main draws was neutralized. Sans 3D, Journey... is mediocre, basically a children's story that even most modern children would find rather, put bluntly, lame. It's not science fiction. This, and Jules Verne's novel, is per fantasy, and the film attempts to neutralize this by making it silly. Discounting the fact that all of this subterranean world is lit up by a non-existent source of light (except the birds, with are photo-luninescent), the adventure is studded with clichés.

Watching this movie is about as exciting as watching planes land and take-off at an airport. Sure some people may find that exciting, but most people don't.If I had to sum up this film, I would say it lack's heart. The writer's of the screenplay certainly went out of their way NOT to do, or say, absolutely anything to offend anyone! This is the ultimate perfect film for small children. It's so plain vanilla, parents will have nothing to worry about! Unfortunately, for the rest of us, it wasn't marketed as a children's only film!I don't expect a Jules Verne story to make sense - it's a delightful fantasy.

From what I can gather from this adaptation, it is a simple shallow adventure flick designed to lift your spirits and get your adrenalin rushing.The plot here I somewhat missed as in writing the script it has been paid little attention; special effects, fast-paced action sequences and overused corny comedy clichés make up the bulk of the film. But this picture clearly encourages you to put aside the plot and enjoy the brainless little ball of fun that the film is. However it there is no denying that it does occasionally make attempts to acquire some emotional depth, while those efforts are most honourable and noteworthy this movie will always be far from touching.In fact I now realise that in the above mentioned ways it is quite similar to 'Star Wars: A New Hope' (1971.) Starring mega action superstar Brendan Fraser, a puberty-struck but nevertheless brilliant Josh Hutcherson and the fiery and beautiful Anit Briem; it's appeal comes almost entirely from the fact that it is new, but given a few decades to age and lose it's sparkle it will seem as pathetic as Star Wars.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
94,simonparker1990,"Big, dumb, Summer Fun",8,12 July 2008,"I first saw the trailer for Journey to the Centre of the Earth last Christmas when I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas in 3-d. I also remember clearly thinking what a load of rubbish it looked like. It appeared to be a gigantic gimmick, cashing in on the latest 3-d technology. The various TV spots and images I saw of the movie in the past few months has done absolutely nothing to dispel this notion. However this past week something happened I didn't really expect, the critics were giving it quite decent reviews, most praising it as ridiculously good fun. I was still sceptical, but also in some way intrigued, perhaps the trailers were just poorly done. So I went to see the movie today, of course in 3-d (more on that later) and was absolutely amazed at how entertaining the movie really is. While the movie does feel like a gimmick at times, do we really need that yo-yo scene, the movie also does seem quite well made. The performances too were good for a movie that really could just have been a cash in, Brendan Fraser is surprisingly likable and good in the movie, and Josh Hutcherson continues to deliver performances that all Hollywood kids should be delivering as good as. But most importantly its so much fun, the action sequences looks incredible in 3-d, and the landscapes of the actual Centre of the Earth do look beautiful. This is a 3-d movie, and make no mistakes by thinking it is worth watching in 2-d, it really isn't. The movie is a kids movie, and so we get an all too happy ending, but there is a brief moment of darkness before the end, and that too makes the movie all the better for adults.So onto the performances. Brendan Fraser as I have said delivers a decent performance here. He seemed to have disappeared in recent years, but with both this and The Mummy 3 arriving in cinemas this year I am sure we might be seeing some more of him over the next few years. While he does have to deal with a lot of clichéd lines in the movie, he does also ooze charisma and seems a genuinely nice bloke. He also does a great double act alongside Josh Hutcherson as his nephew. Hutcherson really is an A-lister in the making in my opinion, while his performance here doesn't match what he did Bridge to Terabithia, he still makes a potentially average brat into a likable characters with genuine motivations. His characters transformation neither feels forced nor corny, and one moment with Fraser in front of a sunset is one of the many highlights of the movie. Anita Briem is also surprisingly good as the ""Best mountain climber in the world."" Once again this could be a run of the mill plot device character, yet she makes it a much more interesting one. The script gives her some good moments and she does have considerable chemistry with Fraser.But of course the main attraction of the movie has to be its effects and of course the 3-d. The early part of the movie does feature the most gimmicks of the 3-d, we get the yo-yo scene, the spitting scene, etc. While they get the kids excited they're not the most exciting things to watch in the world and certainly don't make a good movie. Its when the trio go up to a mountain the 3-d really does work. Not only does the scenery look beautiful, but it feels alive as it pops out of the screen at you. Nightmare Before Christmas didn't do the 3-d too well, but Centre of the Earth really does it brilliantly. A mine cart chase is the cinematic equivalent of a roller coaster ride and really does get the adrenaline pumping. The much promised T-Rex sequence does not disappoint, and a surprisingly tense magnetic rock sequence (don't ask) looks all the better for the 3-d. The script is also much better than it really should be, in fact it actually works better than your average blockbuster to be honest. But as I keep saying do not waste your money on the 2-d version. I understand why they're releasing it in 2-d, the producers do need their money back, but it really will not be the same thing. Having seen Beowulf in 3-d and 2-d I know how much a disappointment the 2-d version can be after seeing the beauty of the 3-d.Overall Journey to the Centre of the Earth may very well be the biggest surprise of the summer, and quite possibly the year. While it won't win awards it does entertaining, and the hundreds of kids who were in my screen today seemed just as impressed and entertained as I was. Also the promise of a potential sequel at the end of the movie didn't horrify me, in fact I'm ashamed to admit I'd quite happily watch another one if its delivered with the same quality.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,6,14 July 2008,"I knew this was going to be a disaster as soon as I heard they were re-making it - it was a pretty terrible movie the first time around, and that was WAY back before the internet, CGI, space shuttle flights - WAYYYY back! And then they said it was going to be 3D too - yikes - didn't make me want to see it any more, but I think the 3D is the only redeeming feature in this movie - I mean, it could be made into a credible ride at a theme park, where you wouldn't think too much about how stupid the idea behind this story is.They did try to change it a little by saying that Verne's book must have been based on fact, but unfortunately that just made the movie even sillier because we ALL know it just isn't possible to journey to this place because we know about science now.At the time Jules Verne originally wrote this the genre of science fiction wasn't really even invented, so at that time it was a huge hit and amazingly original - but the director should have realized we have come a long way since then and this kind of story (remember The Core - ugh, that was actually worse than this movie!), doesn't work for this generation.Kudos on the 3D - it's probably the only way this movie can make any of its money back.Bad luck to Brendan Fraser on having 2 similar style movies coming out at around the same time - this movie could have a negative effect on the Mummy part 3! See this only in 3D - and make sure you're not tired (unless you want to pay for a nap in the movie theater, as you might get bored!).",Journey to the Center of the Earth
98,midge56,Surprisingly excellent and refreshing,9,17 March 2010,"I bought a huge stack of DVD's at a reduced price and nearly bypassed this movie, thinking it was just another boring remake of a classic... like most of the other remakes. I was most definitely wrong and surprised at how wonderful this movie was.This has spoilers...(for those of you who are thin skinned about reading reviews and then complain because you read reviews which included the storyline.) I loaded up a 5 disc DVD player and put this one in last because I didn't expect much out of it... and to my surprise, it turned out to be the best movie in the stack. One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a while. I bought the normal DVD version of Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser. Nothing fancy. This was not a 3D version.There really was not a boring moment in the entire movie. It was fun, interesting, well written, well acted, well directed and had wonderful visuals and special effects. It was all unique and refreshing. I was glad they did not sour the movie with a bunch of unnecessary and unbelievable subterranean tribes or inhabitants like we see in other movies like this.Definitely a great family movie. No violence... other than that of the creatures they encounter but that was also a nice feature. No blood, gore or killing of any characters in the entire movie. I really get tired of that in other movies. It is amazing how enjoyable a movie can be without those things.The story was fast paced, kept our interest and exciting to watch. The movie didn't dawdle too long in any one scene. The scenes were fresh, exciting and innovative and not repetitive of any previous movie versions. Anyone who has read my previous reviews knows I do not give out a review like this which is all positive. I usually have complaints even on my most favorite movies... but no negatives on this one on any aspect of it.For those of you who care about these things... the dialogue and gadgets were technically up to date with the times. So you won't have the teens complaining about it being old fashioned. But at the same time, it met all of the needs of the older audiences as well. It was a quality movie.The photography & sets were beautiful and unique. The action and story were fresh. The relationships between the three characters were well written and the actors were all wonderful in their roles. The nephew's role was scripted just right... and you don't often see that. Most movies have the kid too bratty. But they did a great job with this character of Sean as did the actor (Josh) who played him. His relationship with his uncle and his interactions were well written and acted and quite believable.The luminescent birds were a nice touch. I got a kick out of the ending with the bird. That was great. It is something I would have done in his place... so that was well received by the audience. The CGI barracudas and sea creatures were superb and very realistic. I liked the interaction they had with those nasty looking fish with the really hideous teeth. I remember seeing some fossils with similar teeth... so they were more realistic than most people might think since there isn't anything quite like that today.The magnetic rocks were a fun scene and quite unique. Bravo on the effects of the rock rotating. That was very realistic and would have been overlooked by most directors and special effects experts.But the best CGI scene was the one with the giant Venus flytraps. That was very realistic... and having him wrestle with them was well done.I will say that the mining cart scene was a little over the top. With thrilling effects, it was more like the ultimate Disneyland roller coaster ride... but just a little beyond credibility when it jumped the chasm and all three separated cars landed perfectly on the tracks... Then a few minutes later did an impossible 3 direction split of 3 cars onto 3 tracks simultaneously which could not occur without rail switching, and even then, only one at a time per switch. However, other than taking a bit too much creative license... it was a thrilling scene with a lot of excitement. Same comments on the falling scene. A bit much on the extended falling like dropping out of the sky without a parachute and remaining in the fall for a ridiculous time period (similar to spy kids 3) but they handled the end of the fall fairly well at the end.We especially thank the writer & director... for once, it was refreshing to see a character bring back the fringe benefits with them at the end of the movie. We really get tired of these movies where they find things like that and then lose them in the end. Finally! Someone got smart and actually brought back the goods and benefited from them. Thank you for not leaving the audience frustrated with the characters stupidity like we see in all the other movies.Very nice ending! The movie was a delight to watch from beginning to end.You'd have to be a real curmudgeon not to like it. I recommend it for everyone... all ages... except curmudgeons who are never satisfied with anything. Leave them at home or wait until they are gone so they don't ruin the enjoyment of the movie for you.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
99,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,"Congratulations, Lenny!",1,6 September 2008,"So, Lenny, the unforgotten retarded from Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"", listened to George reading him aloud a Jules Verne book, and had the idea to turn it into a puppet theater show, with characters made out of sticks and cardboard... What happened later isn't very clear, so I can't explain how came his innocent child's play to come on screen (and in 3D,for all that!), but heck - what does it matter? The script is a lame attempt to update Verne's book, the direction is outright silly, and Brendan Fraser is as expressive an actor as Valentina Hassan when sleeping. As so many people said, the only meaning of the movie is the 3D - which becomes boring after 15 minutes, having said all it had to say (long BEFORE the three stooges reach the volcano). The narrative skills shine by absence - very soon, one starts to yawn and wonder where the hell is all the pace and suspense gone. The dialogues seem plagiarized from a kindergarten book. Not to mention the ridiculous lack of any reason and logic.I can't not wonder if at least ONE of the incompetent bunch of fools who committed this insult to cinema ever heard that Jules Verne's books were only DISGUISED in science-fiction - they were instead esoteric handbooks for the Rosi+Crucian initiates. ""Journey to Center of the Earth"" signified, in truth, the initiatic way to the center of the SELF. And speak about that preposterous sub-plot with the so-called ""vernians"", at the beginning! But, of course, Lenny never heard about Freemasons, Rosa+Crucis, Golden Dawn and other such bull. Lenny just listened to a nice story and he imagined he was making a movie.Congratulations, Lenny! Have a candy! ...Or maybe it was Forrest Gump? No way! Forest is a GENIUS, in comparison with Eric Brevig, Mike Weiss, Jenny Flackett and Mark Levin - all piled up together!",Journey to the Center of the Earth

It is not a direct adaptation of the Jules Verne novel (which I want to read after watching this!), it is about a scientist, a guide, and the scientists nephew going on an adventure and discovering that Verne's novel was right. It has a good sense of humour. The special effects are awesome, and there is quite a bit of excitement. A couple scenes were a little bit scary, but enjoyable. The actors did a very good job.

101,bwdude,Only for the young ones,4,1 October 2008,"I admit, visually this might be impressive in 3D (I saw it in 2D only).But by all other means, it is just dumb and naive. Maybe for the young (but not too young) ones, this might be fun. For a grownup it gets more unbearable with every minute. There are so many constructed scenes and plot holes that sometimes it feels as if the movie was cut down to fit a target length, regardless of the storyline.It steals some ideas from the Indiana Jones Series and Jurassic Park. But while the latter still made watchable (or in the case of Indy, even great) movies, this one stays kinda flat and boring.it's is a good example, that CG and an interesting back story (I loved Jules Verne as a kid!) does not equal a good movie.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
102,vegeta3986,Journey to the center of my hurting eyes,7,29 October 2008,"I know that title sounds a bit rough, but i did not hate this movie. quite the opposite in fact. i'm actually surprised in how much i enjoyed this movie. i really only rented it for the 3-D, but you know what? i had a lot of fun. and honestly, that was the best movie i've seen Brendan Frasier in since ""the mummy"". Brendan really is a lot better in action films then he is in comedy or romances. he should stick to action.The film was a good time all in all. The characters weren't annoying as hell, it was a cute PG plot, and it taught some fun lessons.I've been looking on the board and seeing that there's a lot of ""that couldn't happen!"" and ""this movie is childish!"" OK. look. it's a PG movie called ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". It isn't a political documentary. Suspend your disbelief, sit back and enjoy it. Unless of course you want to hand me your 30 page dissertation on why Doc Brown's time machine is an impossibility. If you're not one of those sad lonely people, you'll find this movie quite a lot of fun. Not an epic masterpiece, but a lot of fun.If i had to voice one problem is that they need to stop giving anaglyph glasses. it kind of hurts your eyes after a while. They have good 3-d glasses, don't they? they give them out in Florida for Terminator and the Muppet show, so why don't they include those? that would definitely make the movie better in my opinion.Other than my hurting eyes though, this movie was a nice break from monotonous depressing dark plot based films.With a fun premise, tongue in cheek humor, and decent 3-D effects, Journey to the center of the earth gets 7 glowing birds, out of 10",Journey to the Center of the Earth
103,les6969,"Not too bad a film, Better in 3D",6,11 August 2009,"To be honest this is just a fun piece of escapism and if you view it that way it isn't half bad. Parts reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ( namely the rail ride through the mine ) the special effects were actually quite good throughout. The factual errors are many but not important on a film like this. It isn't really meant to be taken seriously. Brendan Fraser may not be the worlds best actor but he is believable and that is all that matters. Good chemistry between all the leading characters and over all I would say worth the price of a DVD. I now have to write more lines to fill this in, which is really stupid. I don't know who's idea it was that these comments have to be a certain length? I would prefer to read shorter comments and I would find that more interesting than the padded out versions I have to read through.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
104,Foobarman,This was one damn boring movie!,3,1 February 2009,"There is not really that much to say about this movie. It had a good plot - which gave the movie great potential - but they decided to turn it into a stupid, boring childish ""adventure"" film which was a pain to watch.I'll admit that some parts were not that boring, but the majority of the movie was. I totally advise anyone to not watch this movie - unless you are very young. The acting was alright - not horrible but certainly not great. So basically this movie is just a movie that has absolutely nothing special to it.Its just one of those movies that you just aren't interested in. I watched it expecting some exciting adventure plot and it turned out to be of no good at all.The ending was a very expected childish happy ending. So don't watch it!",Journey to the Center of the Earth
105,zerogirl42,Silly & Fun Adventure,8,8 August 2008,"Put on those ridiculously over-sized, 3-D glasses which is THE ONLY way to see Journey to the Center of the Earth. ""Nerd alert"" was what people were shouting in the theater before the film, so it was nice to be surrounded by a festive crowd.Journey to the Center of the Earth really beckons to the time of 1950s horror flicks with huge monsters chasing the hero and heroine who escape situations with luck and crazy logic. It's a fun ride with weird creatures biting at your face and things flying around that you will feel the need to swat at, even though nothing is really there. It's not everyone's taste, but I love these types of films. I was probably one of the few people who enjoyed A Sound of Thunder because of this.I highly recommend this for a family outing. Kids will love it. No nudity or foul language. Little kids may find some of the monsters scary, but nothing gross happens.I saw it with my long-time boyfriend and it was just a hoot. It's not a film to take too seriously, but not all films are meant to dredge the soul. It was just a very nice escape for a couple of hours and was very easy on the brain.All the acting is decent enough. Even the teenage boy who seemed like he would be really annoying at the beginning won me over.There are some very cool special effects. I wondered how the film was going to answer the question of lighting in the center of the earth, but that's summed up quite nicely. Beautiful landscapes show that a lot of imagination went into the set development. The film moves quickly. I really felt like I was on ride at Disneyland.The plot is simple enough. Brendan Fraser plays a scientist who's brother disappears while investigating volcanoes. Several years later, he discovers something very curious in one of his brothers books which leads him on his journey to solve the mystery.There are only two annoying things, a sentient creature who really shouldn't be sentient and a scene where the characters run into someone who doesn't speak English, so one of the characters adds an accent to his English so the guy will understand him.The trailers were done well too. All were in 3-D. We saw ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and ""Bolt."" Both looked like great fun.Journey to the Center of the Earth would rate about a 6.5 without the 3D glasses. I'd only bother to see it in the theater if it's in 3D otherwise it'll be a waste.So get that popcorn, put on those nerd specs and have a jolly good time.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
106,georgebush,Fine film,10,16 July 2008,"This is a fine film for all ages. Obviously, the cynics and pessimists will not like it. Sure this is science fiction or fantasy. I would expect that people who do not like science fiction or fantasy will find this film not realistic. Of course that is a criticism of the entire genre of science fiction. Same goes with the genre of fantasy.Of course Star Wars was science fiction and no one really believes that the Stars Wars universe really exists. The same goes for fantasy in which no one believes that unicorns really speak in Narnia or that Lord of the Rings really happened. Basically if you do not like fantasy or science fiction you will hate this film.This is equal to or better than the excellent Indiana Jones. It has less comedy and is more dramatic. It is also less violent and is fine for any age. This film is also way better than the 1990s version of Journey to the Center of the Earth. There was also a version of Journey to the Center of the Earth in 1959. That 1959 Journey to the Center of the Earth with James Mason was also a good movie but quite a bit different than this one. This new film reminds me of the original Time Machine with Rod Taylor. It has a genuinely strong tragic moment and has the feel of the great Robinson Crusoe on Mars from the sixties. The acting was no problem and the mountain guide was a nice change of pace because she seemed real and not a fashion model. The teen is fresh off the fun film Firehouse Dog. And Frasier turns in his usual good performance. The film is full of excellent special effects and you will get your money's worth. I highly recommend this inspiring film for science fiction and fantasy fans. It is one of my favorites.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
107,Keyska2004,Very good remake of a Classic Sci-Fi Movie,8,21 November 2010,"Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem work together very well in this humorous remake of Jules Verne classic ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" I am a very strong fan of the first movie starring James Mason and Pat Boone. I believe that movie was never intended to replace the original, but to compliment the writings of Jules Verne by making his writing come to life in the 21st century What a great way to remake a movie, especially with the availability of special effects. Anita makes a good guide to get the movie started. The mining train ride was especially good in 3D at the theaters. This is a great action movie in it's own rights. I truly hope that a sequel will follow! Brendan Fraser reminds me of Harrison Ford when Harrison began the Indiana Jones series. Everyone likes a great action/comedy film. I am impressed on how all of my friends aged 7-60 really enjoy watching this movie.I have watched this movie at least a dozen times now, and I still enjoy it as if I was watching it for the first time.If you like this film you may enjoy some of my other recommendations that are similar to it: Dragon Slayer, Atlantis-The Lost Empire, Stardust, or InkHeart.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
108,geekgirl101,Inconsistent load of junk,4,20 October 2012,"Seriously, this movie should never have been remade, it's cringe-worthy with poor attempts to turn it into an Indiana Jones style movie.An uncle and his young nephew go out on a journey to finding a way to the center of the earth and in search of his brother.On getting there they fall down a near-endless pit and miraculously survive the drop into a lake, meet some exotic species that were thought to be extinct from since the dinosaur era including a bird which can facepalm with its wings, only to realise they have a limited time in which to get back to the surface before it gets too hot that they'll die from the heat.It leaves you wondering how did the dinosaurs and birds survive if the temperature keeps rising, and how can dinosaurs live that long when there's barely enough food to go around?",Journey to the Center of the Earth
109,erostew,Truly Pointless,3,26 December 2008,"I went into this with pretty low expectations and I was still disappointed. It liberally steals from other, better, movies like the Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It's like they put a bunch of scenes from successful ""family adventure"" movies in a hat and then made the movie with whatever came out of the hat.This ""film"" has zero to do with the book or the original film. It has lacklustre special effects, terrible direction, poor acting and an incoherent script. You can tell that the director, Eric Brevig, is a special effects supervisor by trade. He seems to have very little idea of how to direct actual living people, and it shows. Surprisingly, for a movie directed by a special effects guy, the special effects are quite bad. Maybe it was better in 3-D. Without the 3-D it's a gimmick movie with a missing gimmick. Truly pointless.The one small bright point is Anita Briem. Not that she's a great actress or anything. But she doesn't stink too badly and she looks great and has a sexy accent.If you have kids you can throw in the DVD sometime and leave them alone to watch it.

110,shido-san,O how art you fallen?,8,27 February 2010,"Actually, I was impressed by this remake of Jules Vernes classic story. Updated to current pop-science, the film-makers made the story something we could relate to today -- and that was a good thing, at least for me. I must confess that I am getting tired of retro films; given the choice Present beats Past and Future. Plus, now the graphics and film limitations are more expansive. It is possible to make the impossible believable.I should confess that I like movies that tie up loose ends (Beetlejuice, for example). Journey has a good start, character development,reasonable conflicts, and then the wonder of CGI bluescreen -- maybe the only stretch being Brendan Fraser's character's ability to instantly identify a living creature he'd only seen fossil remains of (a little too Bond-y there). I got a kick out of the idea that there are ""Vernians"" out in the world that believe the literature to be fact and that the characters end up depending as much on the literature as their scientific knowledge to attain their survival and ultimate escape.Speaking of CGI, I loved the plesiosaurs! Definitely a childhood dream come true for me. Good choice, people! Casting-wise, all good choices, but hey! Finally a role Brendan can truly own since he swung out of the trees as George Of The Jungle. Loved everybody in this.The only negative, apart from the obvious 3D headaches in viewing, was the fact that this movie was built to be an action movie and so, pardon the pun, lacks the depth that would needed to garner a higher rating. But, hey, at least we get a good ride to Italy in the end.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
111,Happy_Evil_Dude,A simple straightforward harmless adventure...watch it in 3D if you can,7,28 July 2008,"This comment is based on the 3D version of the film.This movie joins Bewitched as an unusual adaptation where the characters are aware of the adapted book. Indeed in Journey To The Center Of The Earth, the characters know Jules Verne's classic book and actually use it as a guide since they find out that, well, Jules was right.Not much can be said about the story. 3 people fall to ""the center of the Earth"", discover a prehistoric ""world within a world"", realize they must get out or be boiled alive by the rising temperatures, face a variety of dangers and challenges and get out. Don't go to this movie expecting depths of dialog the level of Zodiac or Eastern Promises or even expecting badass action as in Iron Man. Don't forget that you're watching a movie designed for the whole family. Journey is just simple straightforward harmless adventure which moves at a very brisk pace. Indeed the film, though more than 90 minutes long, feels incredibly short, which, depending on your view, could be a good or a bad thing.The 3D in this film is probably of a better quality, but it basically works in the same way as Spy Kids 3D and Sharkboy & Lavagirl. Once in a while, something will really stretch out of the screen (most often a hand) but most of the time the 3D adds a...""more real"" depth to the image, I guess you could say. The effect is certainly interesting, but is it really better than watching a 2D movie? Is Journey in 3D better than Journey in 2D? I couldn't say for sure, but I'm pretty sure it is, the 3D makes it special. But what I mean to say is this: would the Indiana Jones films be better in 3D? or the Die Hard films? etc... Honestly I don't think so. Perhaps when watching a 3D movie on a really humongous screen could it really give a heightened sense of realism, but it would really have to be huge, because the screen I saw it on was already pretty damn big. Thus, I'm really doubtful that 3D is the next big step in cinema. It's fun and cool to see a 3D movie and to have some come out from time to time, but I think 2D should remain the mainstream and I'll even go as far as to say that I believe 2D can be more involving than 3D (strange, I know).All that being said, I think Journey should be watched in 3D if you have the chance. The first feature directed by Eric Brevig (ILM visual effects whiz who supervised the effects on many movies from Total Recall to The Island, directed the second unit on some of them and also directed a few episodes of Xena) is an innocent, fun ride which should keep you entertained if you remember not to take it seriously. Far from being the best movie of summer 2008, it is nevertheless enjoyable and I wouldn't mind seeing the hinted at ""Atlantis 3D"" sequel.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Among the lamest CGI I've ever seen; supposedly better in 3-D by reports, but I doubt it. The characters? vapid, narcissistic, joyless. The 'drama?' none in evidence. The comic bits? not funny. The sleazy pseudo-science? mind numbing. The sets, the design? like the landscapes that hang in a cheap motel-room. The dialog? a spew of clichés collected by an 8 year old for his brother in 8th grade. Believable situations - not. Adventure, excitement - not. A real sense of wonder with the weirdness at the center of the earth? not.This is boringly banal rip-off of one of the grand ideas of Western literature. Jules Verne was indeed the master of taking simple but wild, seemingly implausible ideas and giving Everyman a chance to live it out adventurously, to it's most reasonable conclusions.This movie is made by those who think glowing cartoon humming birds would make wonderful pets.

Which was all started after they discovered discrepancies in a copy of Trevor's brother's copy of his most cherished book Journey to the center of the earth, were he wrote side notes, that coincided with actual geometric signatures happening at that moment which leads them to embark on this adventure.My Spiel: This was actually a entertaining movie, granted most of it was made to be displayed in a 3D format rather then a regular screening of the movie. I started to watch the 3D on my DVD and well let me just say it is horrible quality. Nothing like seeing it in a formatted theater. So I took it out and slapped it in the regular screened version and started the show. It made me laugh at the first 30 minutes, from when they call dibs on the mountain guide, and another bit which has eluded me. You really can't take this movie to serious so I just tried to watch it not with the plans of reviewing it. The graphics were really good and funny to say I knew I would like this Brendan Fraser movie over his ""Mummy 3"". This is way better then that. This you will actually get something out of, and isn't just a filler movie. This was rather quite original, but not really by them going by the book of the original J.T.T.C.O.T.E. man that is a long title, but aside from that! I did enjoy this they really didn't try to over do it in this, except for the miner shaft buggy ride down! Granted the fall from them being blown out of....... Never mind just enjoy this movie not really thinking about the logic of a actual adventure to the Center of the Earth.End Result: This was a very entertaining movie, I am sure I would of liked it a lot better if the 3D quality on the DVD was way better. Also if I watched it in a formatted 3D theater that is obvious! But I kind of enjoyed this movie granted it had some ridicules parts but it was a story I kind of wanted to see follow threw even though what someone needs to take into consideration is that, no sooner as you would reach the center of the earth you would then have to leave because of the unstable environments. So what is the purpose of even going! Yes, I know it was a accident they made it down there, but I'm getting ahead of myself, just watch this if you are a fan of mystic environments, and journey's to exotic areas not yet reachable by man.Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D (2008) Review: 6/10",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Basically a children's film but the CGI makes it a wonderful, adventure land, thrill ride, for all.

This is a PG rated production, but parents 'BE WARNED', do not leave your under 10 year old children, to watch this film alone. There are some very scary sequences, that may leave younger children feeling, uncomfortable, with resulting nightmares. So if you want to take your younger set, go along with them, and enjoy.

Just one of the truly repugnant things about this movie that keeps reverberating in my mind is the fact that two (males) of the three main characters continually say, regarding the third character (female) that they have ""dibs"" on her. This kind of unfunny behavior has got to stop! If you are in the mood for this sort of thing (a movie pitched at early teenage boys) you would do much better watching ""Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005).""",Journey to the Center of the Earth

It made me be bothered to create an account to add my review.I was expecting nothing, especially after seeing the sequel first. However this film was a great experience. I wish they had used the same actors for the sequel.Yes the film is a cliché but do not let that worry you. For it's all the good things you like about fun family films you have seen before, put into one film.If you have a good/kind heart and fancy a change from normal adult films, this film should be for you!!!

119,darlybrito,A good thrill ride,8,9 October 2008,"I wanted to see the movie in IMAX, since everybody is saying it was amazing, but there isn't a single IMAX theater where I live at. I saw the movie in a regular theater and I thought it was a great thrill ride from the point the journey began. Since the movie open on the same weekend as Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, I wasn't planning to see it. But I just thought why not watch two movies on the same day.Trevor (Brendan Fraser), a college professor and his nephew Alex (Josh Hutcherson) go on a journey to Iceland to find the missing brother of Trevor. Upon there journey, they meet a girl name Hannah (Anita Briem), who knows the way where Trevor and Alex are heading to. When they finally arrived, they start looking for anything relating to Trevor's brother, but they end up discovering something bigger than ever when a storm force them to go to a cave.Everybody gave a good performance in the movie. Brendan Fraser was great as Trevor. He was funny, but a very smart person also. Fraser has always been a good actor to me and I thought did a great job in this flick. Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem did well portraying their characters. There were times where I felt like they weren't as natural as other scenes. But overall, the acting was good enough.Journey to the Center of the Earth is an amazing thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The movie takes you through an incredible journey down beneath the Earth's surface. I thought the creatures were original and seem to fit with the story very well.Journey to the Center of the Earth is a great fantasy and family movie. I'm really excited to see how the sequel will turn out.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

I thought the special effects were very good, and a lot of the 3D effects were a lot of fun. More than once, I wanted to reach out in front of me and grab something coming off the screen. The bad part, was that the plot was just plain silly. It tried to stay glued together like National Treasure, which was also far fetched, but it never really quite made it. While I realize this was an action/adventure movie, some of the sequences were just too outlandish to garner any believability. The original made in the late 50's had a greater impact on me than this one did. But to balance out this critique, it was an enjoyable movie and I don't regret seeing it in 3D. I just think that with a little more effort, it could have gone from a lightweight yet entertaining movie, to a really strong blockbuster.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

We went ahead and sat down and watched it and enjoyed it so much. It's very exciting and has kind of the feel of being on a really good ride at an amusement park. I'm pretty sure some of it was actually filmed on rides at an amusement park. Brendan Fraser is gorgeous as is the female counterpart and fun to watch! The whole movie is very entertaining and escapism and thought-provoking. It was a good time for the whole family!,Journey to the Center of the Earth
122,bmcdannell,From a 50-plus perspective: Thumbs Up,7,17 July 2008,"My wife and I are way over our first run summer movie quota this year, having played host to our granddaughter for much of the season. But I wanted to see JTTCOTE on the big screen and in 3D so my wife indulged me and we took in an afternoon show.The original Journey has been one of my all-time favorite films since I first saw it in the theater when it was brand new and I was a pre-teen - and whenever it pops up on TCM or elsewhere I'll be sure to watch it. I can't say exactly why. It has something to do with imagination, whimsical charm, and period costuming and mannerisms I guess...and nothing to do with Pat Boone's singing. At any rate I've been enormously disappointed by all the subsequent movie and TV remakes of Verne's classic - until now.Don't get me wrong; this movie cannot compare with the original, but at the same time it turns out to be delightful in completely different ways. Both of us enjoyed it immensely and that's really saying something considering that my wife's taste in movies runs heavily toward Jane Austen and anything about the English queens. But both of us enjoyed Brendan Fraser in films like The Mummy and George of the Jungle and I think that if you liked him in those you'll like him in this.My first thought part way through the movie was that it was too bad our granddaughter had already returned home - she would have loved this. The caves and crystals, the luminescent birds, the dinosaurs, the very light romance...it's all right up her alley. But by the time the movie was over I also realized that this is the most refreshing movie from a parent's (or grandparent's in our case) perspective I've seen in a long, long time. No objectionable language whatsoever. Nearly free of bodily function humor (not counting three spit-takes - one by Fraser, one by Hutcherson and one by dinosaur) and also very light on the sexual innuendo. And it is totally free of the insult/nasty sort of humor that has all but redefined what is supposed to be funny - nobody finds humor in this movie at the expense of someone else's pain or humiliation. It's all action, adventure and wonder - with nobody getting hurt and people learning, growing and coming closer together along the way. True, it all requires a major, major willful suspension of disbelief, but hey, what are movies for anyway? We've managed to see nearly every summer flick this year (Kung Fu Panda, Ironman, Wall-E, Get Smart) and from the point of view of taking kids to a movie we would readily recommend every one of them except Wall-E. But of them all, JTTCOTE is the one that we believe both children and adults will enjoy equally - and it's the only one we'd readily watch again. Yes, with the availability of 3D the film makers go out of their way to make you jump out of your seat on a regular basis, but I don't think this is a movie that will frighten children: every BOO! moment is immediately followed up with comic relief or other silliness clearly designed to ameliorate the effect of the scare.I'm sure the movie will be far less entertaining without the 3D, so try to catch it in 3D if you can. But in sum, it's an enjoyable, imaginative romp that both children and adults should find to be a thoroughly good time - and what more could you ask of a summer movie?",Journey to the Center of the Earth
123,moviefan1725-1,Take the Journey,8,13 July 2008,"The only way to review this movie fairly is to review the 3-D version of it. Not a remake or adaptation of Jules Vernes novel, it instead goes on the premise that Vernes novel was a true story, and that the book was more of a guide than a story. Brenden Fraser takes his nephew, and a local mountain guide on journey to find out what happened to his missing brother. Their trek takes them, of course, to the center of the Earth where they encounter underwater oceans, man eating plants, and a T-Rex, among other things. The story moves briskly, although there are many plot holes to dodge, and the actors are capable, likable, and don't grate on the nerves. But ultimately the enjoyment of this movie is based on its visual effects, and the 3-D experience, which I'm glad to say, is first rate. There are the typically redundant ""comin' at ya"" 3-D moments that serve no purpose other than to drive the effect home. But mostly the effects actually serve the story. They do what they are meant to do, which is put you in the moment. They make you feel like you are in this environment, and more than once I saw people in the theater ducking and dodging incoming objects. So, as a flat 2-D experience, the movie would be an enjoyable, if forgettable movie. As 3-D experience, however, it's a great time at the movies.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

I was able to go to Knoxville, TN, to catch the world premiere of this movie where I actually met Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, and the director. They were all three very nice! The movie is very fun with not having to think at all. I've never read the book, so I have no idea how ""true"" to the book it is. The movie clocks in at 92 minutes, which is a great length. I saw it in the REAL 3D, and I am so glad I did. The new technology makes the 3D just incredible. Some of the special effects were very much animated and you could tell, but the movie itself is visually stunning, very entertaining, has no bad language, nudity, nor sex scenes.

The premise is kind of silly, but somehow they survive. There is zero suspense.I think it's a good kids movie. Don't bring your brain or you'll hate it.The CGI is ""ok"".

That's where the similarities end.There is a story attached to it and the book by Jules Verne is only a part of the story, not the story itself.How many times have we seen the reluctant, sometimes sarcastic teen dumped on relatives to end up being a better, more rounded person? That's what happens here. Through progressive struggles, Sean ends up being ready for anything and even has closure concerning his long lost dad.The dad, it seems, was part of a secret society of people who believe that what Jules Verne wrote was fact, not fiction and it turns out to be true.The characters were real enough to make the audience feel for them, though maybe a bit thin and it's really only about the three principal characters plus the missing dad/brother. They build some haphazard relationships between themselves. Perhaps, it was stronger than that but my cynicism sees it as a bit thinner.The actors did a reasonable job with the computer generated bits and pieces and the CG bits and pieces were nicely integrated. It was obvious that the film was made for 3D but worked just fine in 2D. It didn't look like the typical film where they spent 99% of their time pushing the 3D effects on you.

That being said, it was a fun little family movie you can watch with the kiddies and a bowl of popcorn if there are any families out there who still do that. If the story doesn't do it, at least you can talk about the awesome visual 3-D effects. If you don't go into the experience expecting to be enthralled, it'll keep you interested enough but by no means will you be adding it to your favorites or watching it again anytime soon (if ever).Brendan Fraser is no longer in danger of getting typecast, it has happened. He seems to always have that same dumb, just a bit overwhelmed but gonna do it anyways even though he not sure what 'it' is look on his face.

That said, it's saved by the 3D which was excellent.I would say however that it is quite possible that it is BECAUSE it was in 3D that the story was not great. In my mind I can see a room full of writers and a director saying, ""oh wouldn't it be really good if we did this in 3D"", and wouldn't it be good if we did that.... rather than ""how can we do justice to the book""Also whatever you do, don't expect technically accuracy.. so many things did not make sense!In conclusion, I didn't come out disappointed, but then I didn't come out thinking wow!!",Journey to the Center of the Earth

I absolutely loved. I went in expecting a four or five, and came out with a 10. This is one of the best family movies of 2008, if not the best.The movie is a lot like National Treasure, so I easily fell under the spell that this movie casts. The basic premise of the movie is that a Bachelor Geological Scientist, Trevor Anderson, is losing his lab at a University. His sister in law is dropping his nephew off to stay with him for a few days. Trevor's late brother, Max Anderson, died looking for ""The Center of the Earth"", and his wife is giving Trevor some of his possessions. Trevor's nephew, Sean, misses not having a father figure in his life, and only likes to play his PSP.While Trevor is looking through Max's possession's he finds a copy of ""Journey To the Center of the Earth"". Trevor opens it up and notices that the seismic activity is the same that month, which is ten years after Max died, as it was ten years ago. He takes Sean to his lab, and finds that there is a new reading in Iceland. He wants to go check his Seismic scanner in Iceland. So he and Sean hitch a ride to Iceland.The story takes off from there, and you get to see a really great movie. I would highly recommend it for any family.

Yet, this 3D version fronted by Brendon Frasier and Anita Briem (""No one has dibs on the mountain guide."") both looks impressive and boasts a well-dialogued script. It reliably delivers good-hearted fun, with a mine-train ride to outdo Indiana Jones' doomed temple.This being 3D, the movie builds in flinch moments that will all but touch your nose.

The script is just awful and the movie was boring 10 minutes in. The movie was only about 90 minutes and it felt like it dragged on for hours and hours. The plot and some of the things that happen are just stupid and almost like a farce even for a Verne novel. My best bet, don't spend the extra fee theaters are charging for this 3D waste.

""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" on one hand, makes you understand that it cannot even hold a candle to the likes of 3D, fiction, prehistoric era, etc,even though it tries its best to embow our minds towards thinking that we're about to see another Jurassic movie. Here we have Brendan Fraser as a professor Trevor Anderson, very determined, but somehow no-one seems to dig into his exploits, and toils,.. his lab faces closure, and just when things seem to be going way too downhill for him, he discovers what could possibly be the missing link with his brothers disappearance a decade earlier. With high spirits, we find Trevor, and his nephew, off to Iceland , where they meet spot-on with their new Icelandic tour-guide Hannah, and then to the turning-point of this flick, which commences when they all get trapped in an underground abandoned mine. One share of kudos, and a prompting for me to give this flick some éclat, is the ""rollercoaster"" ride in the mine.....some enthralling 3D effects, that makes the audience part of the scene, and you can almost feel the ups and downs, in the most realistic of ways. For a moment, My actual reality was enveloped in a blanket, and i was feeling the pangs of Trevor and Hannah, when the slightest mistake could lead to the thread to which their lives held on to, being cut. Perhaps they should have given a different name to this film. The very name made us subconsciously expect a prehistoric fantasy, locked underground, and shattered by the presence of Dinosaurs, ready to gulp you down in one mouthful. A pity that the producers were unable to live up to the high standards, which were standardised by Jurassic Park. Another parallel is ""Aliens"", in which the line between reality and fiction, becomes buried, and we are all made subconsciously a part of it. Sorry to say, that this flick was nothing on the likes of this standard.A flick full of adventure scenes, and uncertainty, and the unknown, yet not too realistic either. We could attribute this to our clinging on to the reminiscence of Jurassic Park, and our craving for a worthy sequel, or better still, an even worthier title-holder.

Even so, I was surprised at just how bad it was. It was bad enough that I was unable to finish watching it.Interestingly, the exposition was the best part of the film. I actually found myself liking the characters, and I began to entertain hopes that this would not be such a bad film after all. Sad to say, as soon as the three protagonists arrived at the center of the earth, the film became painfully dull. The subplot involving the love that Brendan Fraser and his nephew feel for their deceased brother/father really bogged things down. The prehistoric world was perfunctorily created, and evoked no sense of wonder in the viewer; the dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures were not given enough screen time, and their presence did not generate any real drama (the characters predictably manage to outrun 40-foot tall tyrannosaurs and escape being eaten every time, sigh ...). The humor was lame, the ""love interest"" pointless ... the list of complaints could go on and on.All in all, I got the sense that the filmmakers were just trying to make a buck on a quickly-made genre film aimed at a very undiscriminating juvenile audience. They clearly had no feel or respect for the kind of material they were presenting (in spite of all the faux-adulation aimed at Jules Verne). The special fx were the work of studio hacks, and the plot was really just a series of trite clichés strung together in a manner that bordered on cynical - there was no heart or soul anywhere to bring the story to life.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Sure, the filmmakers could have taken it a direction that would be more enjoyable to adults, but they would have had to move it to at least a PG-13 rating for that kind of intensity, and then it wouldn't be the family movie that it is.

Judging from the preview, I didn't have very high expectations. I went for the 3-D--seriously. And seriously, the 3-D is the ONLY REASON to go. Although I was rather shocked to find that the theater I went to had bumped up the ticket price to see the film in 3-D (Why?), I was astounded to see such a sharp, clear picture with real depth. Not all of the in-your-face effects worked (but I did find myself ducking once early on), but it was MILES away from ""JAWS 3-D"" and the like from the last 3-D renaissance in the 80s).The movie itself was lame and I can't imagine anyone bothering to see it in 2-D...and enjoying it. Utterly dumbed-down for kids (I'm thinking this was aimed at the ""Spy Kids 3-D"" / ""Shark Boy & Lava Girl"" crowd...I SAW ""Spy Kids 3-D"" and barely survived the crap... As much as I love 3-D, I could not bear the thought of another ""Spy Kids"" experience, so I PASSED on the ""Shark Boy"" thing...), it had the look and feel of one of those Amusement Park simulator rides (like the old ""Back To the Future"" ride at Universal Studios)...with a stretched out running time.It takes an amazingly long time (at least it seemed like it) for the adventure to even begin. When it does start, one highly implausible event after another ensues---and, I'm sorry, I just can not suspend my disbelief THAT much.But for what it was (mindless 3-D entertainment), it sufficed.

Sometimes it is just fun to go to a movie, let go of reality and pre-conceived notions and enjoy a fun ride. Journey to the Center of the Earth is that type of movie. Is it perfect? Is it true to the book? Is it the same as the original? No. No. And No. But it is enjoyable nevertheless. In addition, the 3D aspect adds an additional degree of fun. Normal 3D usually gives me a headache, but this Real3D was easy on my massive brain and I was able to watch the entire movie without any issues. Grab some popcorn, some candy, and a large soda and enjoy a fun movie. It is great family fare!",Journey to the Center of the Earth
147,halbarad_loire,Good film. It was really worth the Journey,6,11 July 2008,"Lets start off here. Now, i know there's been about 50 million Center/Centre (whichever way you like to spell it, depends which country) films. What does this one have to offer? This film has a good story, good adventure and Brendan Fraser. The other actors are good, but i like Brendan Fraser.I saw the film today originally intending to go out and watch a different film and pass this until it came out on DVD. I'm honestly going to say that i'm really happy i saw it now. The experience is well worth the entrance fee and more. The scenery was done brilliantly. The other effects, such as the dinosaur, was also done really well. I also failed to see anybody laugh at certain parts of the film.Overall. The film is really worth the watch. Not the best film, but by no means even average. It's an above average film, with good acting, good imagery and a good story. 6/10 at least.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
148,Enosh Sunny,Excellent Adventure!!!,6,26 July 2008,"An amazing adventure for family and friends. Brendan Fraser delivers the performance of a lifetime, not in the terms of acting, wasn't necessary, but a complete action/adventure Hero. The film delivers exactly what is expected of it, sheer fictional adventure. From the very beginning of the film the audience is taken beyond the confines of a common, regular science fiction mingled with childish comedy in a complete blend which gives an undeniably exhilarating family flick as an outcome. Journey to the Center of the Earth does more than that. Without slaughtering raw on making base ground for the story they begin with a quick introduction of all characters and adhering them all in for an adventure worthy of beholding. Although the story is not elaborate, doesn't include meticulous writing, but the new digital 3D effects make it worth every penny of the ticket price. I bought it for $14.50, which is a bit more than the regular ticket price, guess the hike is for the glasses. Brendan Fraser is just over the top. It is not surprising that he does so well in this genre of films. The movie is not made to render your mind with details of science development in the earth's core. Do not watch this expecting logic and insight. It is simply the most enjoyable film, with 3D effects, so far this year. Then again enjoyable in the terms of a family film. 7 out of 10 stars. Deserves a higher collection at the box office than it is gaining. You will definitely give a round of applause when the end credits roll. I guarantee that. A MUST SEE.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
149,stlmbrsn,Journey to the Center of My Heart :},9,11 July 2008,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. After seeing the preview of it many times, I found myself thinking ""Eh, has potential, but could be REALLY cheesy"". I went into the theatre today expecting the movie to be the usual cheesy, but semi-entertaining flick, but I came out wearing my 3D glasses and smiling. I have never read the book by Jules Verne, so I am only basing my opinion on the movie. Brendan Fraiser played a scientist named Trevor searching for his brother, Max. Normally, Fraiser chooses to play the ""geeky"" roles (sorry dude):}, but this time was different. He found a good balance between the nerdy scientist and the brave scientist. In addition Josh Hutcherson, who played Frasier's sarcastic nephew, Sean, did a great job. He has obviously worked hard and has come a long way since ""Little Manhattan"", ""Firehouse Dog"" or ""Bridge to Terebithia"". I look forward to seeing him in future blockbusters if he continues to do what he is doing! I had not heard of Anita Briem until seeing this movie (sorry...again). She does a great job as well playing the feisty mountain guide, Hannah. She was a great addition to the cast. Overall, my advice is to go into the movie open-minded. Expect cheesiness (is that even a word?) and you'll get a pleasant surprise. Don't expect it to be Star Wars or Harry Potter or you will despise every minute of it. In the end, it was worth the time and money to see this movie. Good special effects, better acting, and adventurous moments fill the theatre. (And yes, even the grown-ups will find an urge to reach out and try to touch the screen. :})",Journey to the Center of the Earth
150,siberianflashhusky,Amazing Journey - Adventure Movie,10,16 July 2008,"First off, I went into the movie expecting to give it a six, maybe. The previews had looked enjoyable, but by noon of opening day, the movie only had a c+ rating. I don't normally go to movies if I think they are going to be cheezy. But my younger brother (8) wanted to go, so we went with my dad. I normally take awhile to be drawn in by a movie and the characters; I was into this movie after the first scene with Max running from the dinosaur.As for performance, Brendan Fraser was amazing, with his likely hero character, Trevor. Josh Hutcherson, who played the nephew, Sean, was absolutely amazing. His acting in Bridge to Teribithia, Firehouse Dog, and RV was awesome, and he has still improved from there. As long as he continues to get better, I will definitely look forward to seeing him in future movies. I can't remember the name of the actress that played Hannah, the mountain guide, but I think she was also really good, acting as the pretty but tough chick.The movie is charming from the beginning, starting with the excellent 3-D effect of Trevor spitting into the sink. Journey is well-scripted with some cheezy one-liners, but yet brings humor to the audience. If you don't compare it to books or other movies, it is very enjoyable with great acting, humor, and eventually turns into a race against time.I was not expecting to cry in this movie, but when they found Sean's dad, Max, dead, I was glad to be in a very dark room with over-sized glasses covering half of my face. Josh Hutcherson acted that scene very well as well as Brendan Frazer.So anyways, I walked into the movie, expecting maybe a six, and came out with a ten+. It is worth the extra three dollars to see it in 3-D, and I am going to see it again in a couple days time.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

153,bruin-8,Journey to the pits,1,11 July 2008,"This has to be a contender for the worst film of the year, if not the decade. Let me say, I like Brendan Fraser. I liked the Mummy films, I'm not an intellectual snob. I'll happily sit there munching popcorn watching daft nonsense with the rest of 'em. But oh god, this film. It managed to take a moderately intriguing notion - that Jules Verne's books were based on fact and if you could only follow his implicit instructions you could enter his worlds - and turn it into the worst conceivable hokum. Of course fantasy films are - well - fantasy. But the best of them - the Indiana Jones films, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters, The Mummy etc. follow some internal logic so that you are transported unquestioningly to each film's world and enjoy the roller-coaster ride. This had no logic at all. The protagonists would have died in the initial fall (of several hundred or thousand miles!) before they ever reached the bottom, and the geyser ride back up the same distance was equally implausible. The creatures they encountered - how did they survive the periodic lethal temperatures? None of it made the least sense. The dialogue - written on the back of the smallest postage stamp in the world - was appallingly clichéd and hackneyed. The effects were occasionally slightly impressive (I didn't see the 3D version; maybe they were better) but often quite ropey. It was as if the producers had blown 90% of their budget on securing Brendan Fraser's services and didn't have anything left for decent writers, plot developers or an effects team. The plot was by the numbers, plagiarising every other genre film - all the above mentioned, with roller-coaster rides, dinosaurs, and so on. The most impressive thing for me was how, in moments of stress, Brendan Fraser got so bug-eyed he looked rather like Marty Feldman, a feat I thought no-one else could achieve. And didn't Anita Briem look remarkably like Kirten Dunst? I can only hope that if the intended remake comes along - Atlantis seems to be the theme - enough people will have been conned into seeing Journey... to make the producers enough money to be able to afford make the sequel a halfway decent film.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

155,emilyweiland,"Very fun, decent story/acting--recommended",7,12 July 2008,"While it may not be the deepest, sharpest, or most deeply affecting movie this summer, it is certainly one of the funnest. Lots of action, and while some of it is a bit overdone, it's sure to keep you interested. Despite its PG rating, I can honestly say that my (21-year-old) sister and I had a lot of fun seeing it.Like pretty much any 3-D movie these days, things fly at the screen with startling regularity. Though occasionally annoying, it adds to the experience--this isn't Gandhi, after all. The acting is above-average all around, and the characters mostly believable. In a feat not seen in what seems like centuries, it features a 13-year-old boy character who--wait for it--actually acts like a 13-year-old-boy (believe me, I would know.) Though the story is mostly predictable--scientific breakthrough leads to trip to Iceland leads to center of the Earth--it actually has a couple surprising points, where it does the opposite of what the formula would expect. It's just a couple tiny shake-ups, but it prevents the story from falling prey (mostly) to hyper-mediocrity. It gets tired and over-the-top at times (glowing birds! geyser! dinosaur! 19th-century literature!) but really, that's what summer movies are all about.While it may be too scary for very little kids (the theatre had some crying toddlers) pretty much anyone over the age of 3 should like this movie.

Were all amused by Brendan Frasers dim-witted-character character, and my parents are perked up when they see J. Hutch get out of the car. And then.....Everything flops over, dies, and we have to look at it for a little over an hour.The acting was unmemorable. The lines are stuff any movie-watcher has memorized from the countless other cliché films he/she has watched. Little kids wont complain, but teens like me and parents will. I mean, the ground starts to shake and instantly we know what's gonna come from Brendans mouth, ""Hold on to something!"". The attempt to add poignancy by The fate of Shane's dad is respectable, but only to die-hard optimists. Sorry guys, not enough development! The lady character was an eye catcher, but.... that's bout it.The effects were surprisingly awesome. The camera-work was hand-to-mouth, though, but it's bearable. Sound? I heard everything what needed to be heard (except for maybe some original dialogue).Truly and honestly? I wanted to love this film. Maybe not the way I loved Million Dollar Baby or Terabithia, but in a way in which I'd actually want to pull the DVD out and relax with it playing on the screen. Sadly, I did not find myself too attached to it. Instead, i found myself struggling to point out really redeeming qualities when my dad stated that, ""It wasn't very professional.""

The visuals are not impressive, it makes the special effects on TV shows more real, but then again maybe they had their reason. Also the acting was OK, but the direction was way to pushy.

Film plot does make a sense in the beginning and main characters try to create some kind of comic dialogues and then slowly discover a mystery behind past events narrowly mentioned. Then film rolls on with out any sensible plot and with number and boring dialogues and even absurd geological ideas. Still, it's a Hollywod production but even a small children know that boiling water must burns and so does lava. Any physical reasonable laws are awfully denied by scenes and then you start to think that whole story does not make any sense at all. Film refers to Indiana Jones and perhaps some other great adventure movies done in 80s but it only copies it badly with some lame blue screen effects. In addition you watch an unexpected love affection plot with poorly dialogues and acting. Perhaps only good thing about that film is a few CGI scenes but that is just a narrow part of a film.This film for sure will entertain children between age of 5-9 but no one else.

Being my first full movie 3d, I may be biased, but dammit, I enjoyed every minute of it. Why the 6 grade, then? I enjoyed it, but that doesn't mean I don't realize it wasn't a good movie. However, it was entertaining. The story was far from being interesting, nor the script was special in any way. I wasn't expecting them to end up by mistake in the center of the earth. I thought I would see some preparations and a real journey. Instead, what I got, was an ""Accident to the Center of the Earth 3D"". And just don't get me started on the extremely funny for me, tragic for the characters scene where they bury the kid's dad. It was simply pathetic. The acting was mediocre, and without Brendan Fraser I think the movie would have been a flop. A big one. Brendan isn't a great actor, but he does his job most of the time. Or maybe I just like him. But whatever the case, he has something that makes you smile. Let's leave it to that. Anita Briem, on the other hand, was downright awful. I realize that her only role was to look good and to be the ""love interest"". Whatever. I just didn't like her and her accent annoyed me. Josh Hutcherson was decent. I didn't love him, but didn't bother me at all.After the criticism, the question is: Why did I enjoy the movie? It had its good parts. I loved the visuals. Brendan was funny. It was 3D. I was on vacation. (It really could be a reason. I really doubt I would have liked it if it weren't 3D and I would have watched it on my DVD player) Overall, I think it's worth the money.

I genuinely like Brendan Fraser as an actor, and despite some of the film choices he's made (the less said about Dudley-Do-Right, the better), he's a genuinely good actor and has been excellent in some of the films he's been in, including serious dramas (Of Gods and Monsters, The Quiet American), action (The Mummy), and good natured comedy (Bedazzled). Josh Hutcherson also played a good role in Bridge to Terabithia, so things seemed pretty okay at that level.The movie starts off well, setting up the characters and how they interact with each other, and gets into the adventure part fairly quickly, within about fifteen-twenty minutes from starting, which is very nicely paced. The actors are well picked, and are very capable of expressing a range of emotions, and while the 3D enhances the scenery and effects, it would be still be a good solid popcorn adventure film without the 3D. Don't get me wrong, this film probably may not win any awards, and the 3D session price is a little extravagant, but it's a very good way to spend a spare afternoon if you feel in the mood for some adventure.Recommended.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
173,pinkyoshi77,i had a couple of laughs,6,23 February 2015,"So my friend recommended this movie and I was like, OK, a movie based off of Jules Verne book (I read it about five years so and barely remember it). The movie had this amusing suspense to it and there were a few good scenes in the whole production. The characters acted well and the uncle and nephew bond was very strong. The romance was pretty cheesy (almost like the small romance portion was there just to appeal to a wider variety of audiences, but I guess a part of me was thankful that it wasn't just an action packed movie. I did enjoy the science-fiction ""comes to life and is real"" theory and I am glad I watched the movie.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
174,SinisterCreep,As expected...a complete travesty of Jules Vernes book!,1,5 August 2008,"I wasn't expecting much from this film and my expectations proved to be correct. When I read that the original writer left because the film was turning into a theme park ride, that immediately set alarm bells ringing and the end result is nothing more than that. The special effects are pretty good and the 3D is also good but because the film has virtually zero story (unlike the adult Beowulf in 3D) the ONLY thing going for it is the 3D. Brendan Fraser is his usual self, just passable as an actor (though he's much worse in this than the Mummy) plus cheesy lines, Josh Hutcherson is plain annoying (just like those annoying brats in Spielbergs Wotw) and the rest of the cast just seem to be uninterested (not surprising seeing how bad and clichéd this film is). Things like the cart chase are obviously just thrown in to show off the 3D (also a rip off of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) same with the yo yo, plus other things and the whole movie is just one big gimmick without any substance whatsoever. the T Rex looked good in some shots, bad in others along with the underground rocks, scenery etc.This should never have been just a kids movie considering it's based on a classic book (it's not even a good kids movie) and I bet it would have made a lot more money, gained much, much more respect and had lasting appeal if it had been made like Peter Jacksons brilliant version of King Kong. As it is, it might well just be throwaway garbage that won't have lasting appeal. This could have been a real classic of the cinema if they had followed Verne's story a lot more closely, had it in the same time period as the book and used Vernes characters and I'm suspicious and question any professional critic/reviewer who says this is good. Both Michael D. Weiss and Jennifer Flackett should be ashamed of themselves for writing such garbage (along with the rest of the film makers), especially as they've pinched the title from a great book.So to sum up......another in the long list of Americanised abominations of great books by Hollywood (another recent one like i've already mentioned was Spielbergs War of the Worlds which was a complete travesty of Hg Wells masterpiece book). If you're brain dead or a 3 year old child then you might just enjoy this but to think they've cashed in on Jules Verne's title and then ignored everything he wrote is an absolute disgrace.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

He played a cocky and corny professor with horrible pathetic one liners and silly jokes. The believability of even the imaginary sequences of the movie was low. For instance, how does the plant life survive with no sunlight? Why is the shiny bird smart enough to comprehend what the young boy is asking of him? And how does he shake his head at the boy's attempts to cross magnetic rocks? Not too far through, I gave up trying to reason my way through this film and its rushed plot. Thumbs down. On the floor.

177,chrisnf,Completely Implausible,2,19 November 2008,"I saw this movie in 2D, so I'm sure I missed a lot of the visual effects. I have to say, although I went into this knowing I wasn't going to get a great story, this movie was way worse than expected. In fact, I think it's the worst story since ""Lady in the Water"". So many incredibly implausible things happen that you can't stop laughing. Surviving rising on a steam geyser which helps them travel hundreds of km in mere seconds using not nearly enough water to do it, takes the cake. But, a kid that can hang on to a ""magnetic"" rock by just his hands and toes was a good laugh too. Never mind that these ""magnetic"" rocks appear to be some crazy sort of non-polarized magnets. They are repelled no matter which direction they are facing to the magnetic source. Oh, and the mountain guide who doesn't know one should lay flat and distribute your weight when on cracking ice (or rock in this case) was quite stupid too.OK, OK, before you shout at me that it's fiction and a movie, I want to say that I'm a huge science fiction fan. I think when done right, it can be fanciful, impossible, amazing, yet entirely plausible. This movie just requires a suspension of disbelief that I could not muster.On top of it all, the dialogue is terrible, Fraser can't act, and the CGI visual effects (at least in 2D) are way too easy to notice. As the movie approached it's finale, I couldn't help but wish it would hurry up and end, and I didn't care what happened to the silly and undeveloped characters.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

179,LANLORD,A Delicious Disney Epic.,6,1 November 2008,"What a journey!!! Fit for the kids and grandparents alike, Brendan Fraser dives head first into this action thriller. After watching this movie not only do I feel, unlike religion I am convergent there is a center to the earth which you can travel to. The adventure the, the dipstick's, it was all there, waiting you. The magnesium, why doesn't always blow up when there is lava there every day, why do the plants not die from heat, and why do the dipstick's, why are the birds blue. I just didn't fully understand this sci-fi epic. It makes no sense, it really doesn't the kids I saw it with loved it, and I hated it. They were on a mine rail and the woman kept pumping the bucket even when going down hill, why?! why did she pump? The bucket. Spoiler: Max the dad of the kid dies, and manages to bury himself under rocks. ANd what happened to the girls dad, he probably found it and the guides dad got no credit always talking about Max all the time, cant have that thats not fair, where were his diamonds, he didn't get any diamonds, they all needed more diamonds. When they were in the bucket, there was a 3-way split (they were in individual buckets) this cannot happen, I have a train set and it will not allow such a split, so why does their train set work so differently? And the kid had a good ride and Brendan didn't this was just a joke. Why was there one dinosaur, how did it eat, and if the dinosaur eats another dinosaur does that make him a cannibal, is it wrong then? whats with that? Should humans eat livestock? Just a theory, you don't know, whats going on there. Classic Disney timing, (the kid didn't die at all). The CG was great, but just classic Disney, you could feel the dip locus but not be too scared. My kids hated it however, but I'm not one to not take them to movies staring Brendan Fraser, he picks excellent movies, Bedazlled comes to mind, so if you like this movie go see Bedazzled. A few road blocks in this movie particularly the explosion at the start from the lighting. My wife didn't understand why the birds were blue, I couldn't answer her, but really I think we all need to be thankful that Brendan Fraser was a scientist during the film, without the magnesium they couldn't return to the surface. A few more questions come to mind, such as where is the sequel, going to Atlantis? I look forward to it. Will this be set underwater I don't know, I'm assuming it is as I think thats where it is, but how will the film go on for so long with Brendan wearing a snorkel the whole time, I just don't see it happening. 3/10 but my wife said 4 so I don't know. My mum also said when the boy held the floating rock, I wish your father could do that to me. So I didn't really want to think about that during the mountain, I was very impressed with this stunt 9/10.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

Good chemistry between all three of the leads. Absolutely my highest recommendation. A movie the whole family can see and enjoy!! Even the previews and credits are in 3-D. We saw this last night and not one person left until all the credits were through at the end of the movie. I have enjoy other movies this summer, Speed racer, Hulk, Ironman, Narnia, just to name a few, but for sheer ""never a dull moment viewing"" This has been the best I've seen.

And yeah I'm a 17 year old film buff telling you this. So anyway the original Journey to the center ote I have seen about ten times since I was about 5 and it runs circles around this garbage even in the special effects. The story of this new movie was dreadful, the acting was horrible all-around and please don't add in the dead uncle/brother, the movie was already campy don't try to light an emotional match in a rainstorm, and the only reason I figured to go see this movie was some cool 3D action and it was terrible,they face only two monsters the whole time and go down an abandoned mine shaft(thats original) that was it and the 3D was terrible, I thought spy kids 3d was bad this was worse, barely anything cam out at you the whole movie!

Of course it's utterly implausible (aren't most adventure films?), but so what? it's a kid's film, and doesn't pretend to be anything else. The thrills and scares are pitched just right, the humour is not bad at all and sometimes genuinely funny. Brendan Fraser does his constantly-startled-hero turn - and very good he is too. And his co-stars are likable and energetic. There are some scary and surprising moments, wide-eyed thrilling set pieces, great effects, and some good ideas. It pays thoughtful homage to Verne's novel, using its premise and structure, but adding 21st century spin. Refreshingly it's not too long. What more do you want from a kid's adventure film?

184,masterofsillythings,Pretty good stuff,6,2 August 2008,"Don't go and see 'Journey' if you're expecting either a solid interpretation of the Jules Verne novel, or a thrilling summer blockbuster. 'Journey' is light hearted fun, but as a piece of light hearted fun, it excels.The story centres (no pun intended) around publicly abhorred professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) whose lab in New York faces closure just as things are getting exciting (cough cough) with his research into volcanic something or other, a project derived from his obsession with the unexplained disappearance of his late brother. To further complicate things Trevor gets landed with his smart alec techy nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and thus premieres a generic 'odd couple' relationship as the stuffy academic trades words and yo-yos with his post-mod companion.Anyway, as soon as this gets underway, Trevor finds an excuse to jet off to Iceland where for one reason or another he descends two hundred feet into a volcano and after one big 3D disaster leads to another, he finds himself (big shock) at the centre of the earth, wherein he, Sean and annoying Icelandic guide Hannah (some unknown Icelandic actress making her unconvincing debut) encounter all manner of 3D perils and wonders including carnivorous plants, troublesome fish, massive great geyser thingies, and the impending doom threatened by an up and coming volcanic thermal heating up whereby everything gets roasted...oh, and a dinosaur...he's cool :D.The good stuff? The storyline is a lot more cut to the chase than I've made it sound, the 3D effects are cracking, and despite being landed with the name 'Trevor', Brendan Fraser makes for a great lead. I've always been a casual fan of his since seeing the Mummy as a child, and whilst this role isn't much of a challenge for the erstwhile Fraser, he commands the screen when he's present and is thoroughly entertaining throughout. The kid who plays Sean is decent support as well. There are some truly great visuals, and although the mine cart chase disappoints, the raft ride does not; it's a visual feast and a great action piece that would be perfect if not for the 'we're on a fishing trip' line thrown in by Hutcherson.The bad stuff? Hannah Asgeirsson is cringeworthy as the love interest/ guide figure, a character it is impossible to like or even find interesting. The storyline is pretty predictable, and in terms of story and set pieces, 'Journey' doesn't really offer anything that hasn't been done before, and often better. A couple of the jokes fall flat, and the 3D glasses are pretty annoying, although probably not nearly as bad as the film would be in 2D; I can only assume it loses much of its merit.So 'Journey' is never going to compete with previous genre flicks such as Jurassic Park, but it never really sets out to, which is the salvation of the film; everything is done with a casual wink to the audience; we're all in on the joke that the film is a bit naff. Whilst you're in the cinema it's great fun, but on reflection 'Journey' is little more than a memory jog of better films. Go for the 3D cinema experience, but don't bother with the DVD, because the more you watch this, it's probably going to become more and more tired.Ultimately, Journey to the centre of the earth is a solid family film that thankfully never tries to be anything more. Good summer fun, and the finest effects you'll see this summer.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
185,Luke444-1,"Hugely over the top, yet somehow still incredibly bland",2,17 July 2008,"I went to see this film with high expectations. The trailer looked great, and Journey To The Centre Of The Earth appeared to have everything a good action/adventure movie could possibly want - dinosaurs, man-eating plants, volcanoes and more. What could possibly go wrong? Turns out, a great deal.One thing I have to point out is I didn't see this film in 3D, and I'm sure it could have made the experience a great deal more entertaining. Nevertheless, a bit of 3D magic cannot hide what is essentially a film that falls at almost every hurdle. For starters, a good film must be believable. This isn't the same as saying a film needs to be realistic - I love films with great imagination and creativity - but after a while the constantly fantastical and illogical nature of Journey To The Centre Of The Earth starts to wear thin, and I for one found myself unable to immerse myself in the film or care for the characters. It just ended up being one big joke. By the time the film heroes were comfortably outrunning a t-rex, which for all its roaring and fierceness was barely strolling after its prey, I just wanted it all to end. I could forgive all of this however if the end package, with all its 'action' scenes, delivered something tense and exciting. But no. The dramatic music may fool you into thinking something amazing is happening, but in reality your just watching a kid cling to rotating rocks for ages, or something equally uninspiring.Add on to all of this the fact that there is zero plot beyond trying to get in to the centre of the earth...before trying to get out again, or the fact that there is virtually no character evolution or interesting relationships between them (of course, Anita Briem's character was thrown into the equation only to serve as a half-hearted love interest for Brendan Fraser - no interesting chemistry whatsoever) and your left with a bad taste in your mouth. I know this is by all accounts supposed to be a brainless blockbuster film, but I've seen far far better films of that type than this. Disappointing.",Journey to the Center of the Earth

It was well worth the effort! The story isn't based on the book like the earlier film of the same name, but is cleverly written about a 21st century group of people who retrace the book's steps, which I thought was a clever angle. The ways our new gadgets are introduced into the movie are very funny, especially when the boy gets a call on his mobile from his mother, while he is in the center of the earth!

The female lead was acceptable for the most part, but Fraser's and the kid's performances were truly awful. Often the actors lacked conviction, most likely due to the ludicrous plot, cringe-worthy dialogue, inane situations, and having to spend the whole thing in front of a green-screen.This movie was shot in 3D, could you tell? There are countless instances of stuff flying at the screen for no apparent reason, such as the unimportant yo-yo, the pathetic fish monsters and so on. On this note, the CGI in this film looks like it could have been made in the '80s, it's so damned bad. I constantly found myself saying: ""This is dreadful,"" especially during the mine cart sequence. It's just pathetic.To sum up, everything in this film blows, from the acting, to the plot, the characters, the directing, the camera-work, the dialogue, the CGI... everything.

The emotional issues men and boys face in life are handled succinctly, giving this movie more depth than the non-stop action would seem to allow. The 3D effects truly add to the excitement. The few gratuitous/gross ones were just plain old fun & funny. I am disheartened by all the ""no plot/no story"" comments. Almost all are followed with complaints about a lack of blood, sex and violence. Gone are the days when the STORY itself was enough to entertain folks. I know it is weird to say that about a film that relies heavily on CGI/3D but even when viewing the home version without 3D this movie is enjoyable. Why? because the characters matter, their relationships to each other matter. The other complaint I can't understand is bashing Fraser for his ""one-liners"" and ""cliches"". Um, people you do understand that he is not writing his own dialogue, don't you? Besides, loosen up. The quips are harmless fun and there are enough of us out here that kinda like 'em.

Having seen IMAX Polar Express 3D a couple of years ago, it seemed like the format was finally beginning to mature.I had high hopes for Journey based upon the trailers that I had seen - finally a real adventure movie with legitimate acting talent shot in 3D. Could it be a 3D movie that would finally exploit the format without going for the cheap ""poke something into your face"" tricks? Sadly, Not this time.From the first scene, it was obvious that the cheese was still there - Trilobyte Antennae sticking out of the screen --- Toothpaste spit splattered on the screen - and it kept up throughout the movie. I guess its fun for the preteens in the audience (I heard a lot of giggles and Eeeeew's behind me), but It left me wanting a real movie that used 3D instead of yet another 3D trickfest.There was potential in the plot line, but at least for me it was lost in the 3D trickery. Its too bad Chart didn't stay on as Director and make a true 3D adventure.

Great family movie, with most movies now being R rated it is a nice choice for the younger family. I won't spoil the movie so just wanted to add my 2 cents that it is better than the 3 out of 10 I saw on the previous post. Did not care for the sexual competition so much, this would be the only thing keeping it from being a Disney type movie.

As adult I can say that the script is very simple (and very predictable) and since it is not a Hollywood super-production (i.e. not a big budget) the effects are not very good... just fine. However they are enjoyable. Additionally, I have to talk about the acting of Brendan Fraser. In some parts of the movie we can confuse his character with that of Rick O'Connell in ""The Mummy"". We don't buy that he's a professor and all. He could had win a nomination for worst actor in the Razzie Awards very easily.

So far its the best remake. This year a made for TV remake of the same title also came out almost as if they wanted to maybe confuse people into buying the wrong DVD.

Most of the 3D did little to bring the story plot forward - it comprises of little things like a yo-yo jouncing towards the screen, etc. 3D in more exciting screens - the dinosaur, for example - are negligible, or perhaps it was only me who did not notice? In fact, I would say that, in my opinion, the CGI were better than the 3D, and it would have been better as a normal show.I thought the storyline was okay, nothing outstanding. Might as well read the book, I suppose, if you hadn't. A movie to watch once, perhaps, out of curiosity - but I would certainly would not go to watch it twice.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
212,VigintiTres,"needs more science, less fiction",2,20 July 2008,"While the 3D special effects were cool, they don't add anything to the bad writing and acting. The storyline was terribly predictable and bland, basically throwing in everything a 7 year old would love to see, whether it makes sense in the story or not. It leaves many questions unanswered, so its best to not question it and just accept that its all founded purely on imagination. Fraser, while his acting was mediocre in this movie (compared to his other work that i enjoyed much more) it was still a highlight for me. Hutcherson, however, seems to ruin every scene he's in with his either lack of expression or over-acting. Something about it just seems so unnatural and dissonant.

Trevor spots volcanic activity in Iceland, him and Sean travel to Iceland and end up meeting a mountain guide. And through a series of events they end up at the center of the Earth. And after wondering for a while they have to escape to the surface before it gets too hot and lava reaches them.Thats the basic storyline which is pretty predictable, I personally found this movie a bit too corny and a the special effects are a bit overused.

Whilst Indiana Jones may get away with impossible feats (In the three films we've seen him in, RIGHT?) these guys certainly don't.

Awesome! The 3D glasses they gave out were good quality. Not the cheap throwaway cardboard glasses. They were RealD brand with plastic frames that actually fit over glasses if you wear prescription lenses.The action and story was steady and sometimes on the edge of your seat. Only a few slow scenes, but it picked up speed shortly with a new action scene. I have not read the book, but have seen a few of the other versions of this, including the one made for TV recently. I would give this movie a very good effort competing with the original movie still be the best. Afterall it had great effects for back in 1959, but don't compare with todays technology.A must see on the big screen. And its PG, so take the family. No cursing, nudity, or gory graphics.

The supporting cast (and there wasn't much of them, as it was mostly CGI stuff, and not really populated with many humans, except for brief appearances) was also adequate, albeit they had little to do.Overall, then, this was science fiction with an emphasis on the ""fiction.""

It seems as though the script-writers and director got together and threw together as many disparate scenes as the could and then picked them out of a hat, out one by one and put them together in random order to turn them into a movie with absolutely no credibility whatsoever.The original motion picture score was the only thing that kept me interested in this movie and I will be looking for it on line to add to my collection (sorry, no modern music, just great orchestration) when it comes out.3-D glasses are the only things that make this movie worthwhile seeing.

I was hoping for better in special effects--guess this was low budget movie. Its just all too ""cute"" for my taste; the nephew who hates being with his uncle suddenly flying over to Iceland with him, the beautiful guide who happens to be the daughter of another Vernist, the mini-tram ride in the mine, the falling for 5 minutes, and just happening on the old home of previous explorers/brothers.

The actors weren't bad, but I had seen better performances of them. The story is kind of a standard one. A guy with no close relatives has to watch over a boy and goes on an adventure with him. I'm not gonna spoil the ending, but I'm probably not gonna be able to... Now, I do have to say that I wasn't bored during the movie; it was acted out well enough, and it had its thrilling moments. But those things wouldn't be enough to recommend it for, though. My main concern was that some scenes were just too obviously made to make the movie adventurous. (like a 'rollercoaster-ride' in a mine). The only thing I would recommend it for would be the Real-D. It's a huge difference with the regular (IMAX-)3D. The image is crystal clear, and it all looks very realistic, and it seemed like some shots were especially made for the 3D-effect (which really made me jump sometimes). So, if you're interested in new techniques, go see it in 3D, it's an interesting experience. The movie itself is just not really worth your money. It's a regular adventure-movie with good SFX, but nothing original or special in it.",Journey to the Center of the Earth
