0,Leofwine_draca,Couldn't get into it,4,25 June 2021,"Not a great film. I didn't realise that Peter Berg did it and I have to say I enjoyed his DEEPWATER HORIZON a lot more than this one. A hackneyed buddy cop action movie, apparently based on an old forgotten TV show. Mark Wahlberg does his thing but seems a little too smartass for the viewer to warm to him, and the rest of the cast have no presence at all. The conspiracy style storyline isn't bad at all, but the execution is middling at best and the regular action scenes feel by rote, despite some decent stuntwork. I just couldn't get into this one.",Spenser Confidential
1,Prismark10,Spenser Confidential,5,9 March 2020,"Based loosely on the 1980s television series, Spenser For Hire. This Netflix film is a noisy violent action film with very little originality.Directed by Peter Berg. He teams up again with Mark Wahlberg for Spenser Confidential. Wahlberg is ex-cop Spenser who went to jail for beating up his superior officer over an investigation of a murder.On the day of his release, that superior officer is killed and another dead cop is blamed for it. Spenser decides to investigate further. He teams up with a MMA fighter Hawk and they find a conspiracy of dirty cops, drug trafficking and the redevelopment of a dog racing track in Boston.This is a stupid buddy action comedy and cliched to hell. It never moves from second gear.",Spenser Confidential

On the day that Spenser is released, Captain Boylan and an honest police officer that was Spenser's friend are murdered. Spenser decides to investigate and teams-up with his roommate Hawk (Winston Duke) that lives with him in the house of their landlord and friend Henry (Alan Arkin).""Spenser Confidential"" is an entertaining action-comedy-crime film directed by Peter Berg. Mark Wahlberg's character is predictable following his code and the movie is funny in many moments. The conclusion is a cliffhanger for a possible sequel.

3,kosmasp,Unlikely Buddies,7,18 October 2020,"The buddy movie genre ... it has been here for a long time and it will continue to exist for a long time. I can only assume of course, but I'd say chances are good - especially if you get good efforts like this one made. It may not be perfect, but it is more than good enough.And the chemistry between our two lead actors and characters is really something! Add to that the humor and the fact they are so different (always a great sign and ingredient) ... let's just say you'll be thoroughly entertained. If you don't mind that it does get a bit violent at times, this Netflix production will tingle you just the right way. Even when it seems to be undecided on where to focus (main story) at times, it never stops being funny ...",Spenser Confidential

5,classicsoncall,"""Sometimes you just gotta kill the cat.""",7,9 January 2021,"Familiar territory for Mark Wahlberg no matter what side of the law he finds himself on in one of his pictures. In this case, he's both an ex-cop and an ex-con, trying to get to the bottom of the murder of two police officers, one dirty and one clean. This one has a Dominican drug gang, corrupt cops and politicians on the take to fund a Boston casino in order to launder illicit money. Sounds a little bit like ""Ozark"" there, doesn't it? I like the nickname for Tracksuit Charlie (James DuMont), and was glad to see Black Betty have a role in the final showdown against the bad guys. Pretty typical action adventure stuff here with some humorous dialog thrown in, but why the gratuitous bathroom scene between Spenser (Wahlberg) and bimbo girlfriend Cissy Davis (Iliza Shlesinger). It would have meant nothing to the movie if it was left on the cutting room floor. Neither particularly good or bad, this could be one of your quick Netflix choices if you're looking for something to while away a couple hours.",Spenser Confidential

He is soon a suspect in the murder of two of his former colleagues so he enlists the help of his new trainee and his sassy, pain-in-the-ass (and extremely irritating) ex-girlfriend Iliza Shlesinger (""Cissy"") to track down the culprits. It starts off glacially slow but does heat up a bit as their search hones in on ""Driscoll"" (Bokeem Woodbine - quite an intimidating baddie) via some dodgy cops, a criminal hoodlum and a yellow Ferrari. Unfortunately, however, it doesn't have an original frame in the can - and the comedy is way too obvious and crass.

7,zardoz-13,Routine Stuff,5,8 March 2020,"Thoroughly routine from start to finish, ""Patriot's Day"" director Peter Berg's ""Spenser: Confidential"" stars Mark Wahlberg as a former Boston Police Sergeant who lands in prison for a nickel stretch for punching out another corrupt BPD captain. Seasoned scribe Brian Helgeland of ""Payback"" and freshman writer Sean O'Keefe revive novelist Robert Parker's detective, but there's nothing here but mediocrity done slickly enough to make this potboiler palatable. ""Spenser"" wastes a grade-A cast in what amounts to a predictable conspiracy thriller about corrupt cops and a drug syndicate that never really delivers the goods. Berg and Wahlberg coast throughout this by-the-numbers whodunit bristling interesting characters, including a machete wielding gang of drug thugs and a balded dastard who likes to nail dead cats to a house. Basically, no surprises give this thriller a boost as ex-con Spenser walks out of prison only to learn that the dirty captain he was sent up for beating down was up to his ears in gangland shenanigans. Berg and Wahlberg must have needed some quick cash. Skip it.",Spenser Confidential
8,Calicodreamin,Great action!,6,14 March 2020,"Loved the action/fight scenes in this movie, they were well choreographed and the action definitely kept the pace of the movie going. The plot itself left a little to be desired, there wasn't much in the way of a twist, and there were a lot of players whose involvement wasn't always clearly defined. However, it was a solid action packed movie and the acting was fairly good.",Spenser Confidential
9,trashgang,good promotion,7,26 March 2020,"First of all, well done to the promoters to put Wahlberg together with Post Malone on their advertisment. By doing so you have the attention of the older and the youngsters. And I agree, both can see this flick.It's a pure action/revenge flick but be honest; it isn't a Mission Impossible or a 007 full of action and special effects. This is on another budget but it's still okay to watch. For the lovers of American vehicles, you got a Corvette Z06 in it and a Dodge Challenger and a nice Peterbilt truck.The flick do contains the typical situations, ex-love comes in, failures, situations that you think, this goes wrong, bad cop/good cop. You know what I mean, a flick to watch with the whole family, everyone will have his moment.Gore 0/5

10,deloudelouvain,Too much bad macho moments.,5,18 June 2020,"It's one of those movies that I find normally easy entertainment but in this case there are just too many flaws for it to be really good. The story is what it is, you've seen it before and you really don't care about it. To me there are just too much macho moments, and not good ones if you know what I mean, like ""You hit me first a couple times, and then I'll hit you even harder"", or ""I have a gun and can easily arrest you but let me just put this gun down and solve it with a fistfight"". Moments like that are maybe entertaining to some, I just get bored by it. The acting wasn't that great either. I normally do like Mark Wahlberg but in this movie it wasn't his best performance. In short, Spenser Confidential is one of those movies we saw plenty of times, one I will forget everything about it the next morning.",Spenser Confidential
11,FeastMode,can i get some cinematic feel in my movies?,3,14 April 2021,"I don't really know what gives a movie a cinematic feel. But i'm so sick of the straight-to-dvd feel that so many of these movies have. This seems to be the case with anything made by netflix. Just because a movie doesn't go to theaters, does that mean it's not allowed to feel cinematic? Maybe there's a rule i'm not aware of.This movie is below average in basically every area. Writing, story, comedy and general entertainment are all lacking. It's not horrible, but not worth my time (1 viewing, 4/13/2021)",Spenser Confidential
12,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Another below average Wahlberg actioner,4,11 May 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter dishing out his own brand of justice to the corrupt Captain Boylan (Michael Gaston), unorthodox cop Spenser (Mark Wahlberg) is sent to jail for a few years. Upon his release, he goes to live with his uncle Henry (Alan Arkin), who acts as his sponsor, along with fellow ex con Hawk (Winston Duke) with whom he forms an uneasy bond, as well as trying to patch things up with his neurotic ex Cissy (Iliza Shlesinger.) But then his life is plunged back in to chaos when Boylan and another cop are found murdered, and he is fingered as the suspect.While many rappers turned actors are quickly dismissed, and turned away with scorn, Mark Wahlberg (or Marky Mark, as he started out) has certainly crafted quite a career for himself. While not the greatest actor, he definitely has something of a presence in action films, none of which I've ever found particularly remarkable, and Spenser Confidential sadly proves no exception. His fifth collaboration with director Peter Berg, with whom he obviously has a good working relationship, this is marginally better than their awful last endeavour Mile 22, but that's really not saying much.This is aiming for a Lethal Weapon style action and comedy mix, in opposition to the straight and serious tone of the pair's previous work, but while the comedy does work in parts, it always feels awkwardly inserted into the proceedings, and doesn't gel well with the development of the plot. It might have been okay if it had had about twenty minutes or so trimmed off, but it overlaps a bit, and just drags on. While the story does require a bit of attention and brain power, it has nothing like the originality or substance it needs to make it really stand out.Wahlberg and Berg must have something between them (other than the word Berg!) that produces some kind of success, and good luck to those that warm to it. But I'm not on that train. **",Spenser Confidential
13,MOscarbradley,Watchable and no more....,4,17 March 2020,"I wish Peter Berg didn't make such formulaic films because he's certainly a skilled filmmaker and he uses those skills to lift material we've seen a hundred times before. His latest movie, ""Spenser Confidential"" is another buddy-cop film...well, let's call it a buddy ex-cop and his boxing room-mate film. They're out to find the killers of a couple of cops, one a good cop and the other a corrupt one, in Boston. The ex-cop here is Mark Wahlberg and the room-mate is Winston Duke and the movie is below the standard we have come to expect from co-writer Brian Helgeland. It's not bad exactly but you get the impression that Wahlberg and everyone else are only there for the pay-checks. Next time round, maybe they might actually earn their money.",Spenser Confidential

15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Keep it quiet.,6,4 October 2021,"'Spenser Confidential (2020)' is a detective action-movie centred around an ex-cop who gets into trouble when he immediately starts investigating the death of Boston's police captain after leaving prison. The film is basically what you'd expect, with a decent but generally uninspired mystery at its core and a handful of against-all-odds set-pieces. The movie is decidedly unfunny - to the point that most jokes wouldn't even register as such, never mind provoke a giggle, if I didn't know the thing was supposed to be part comedy - but its characters are typically rather enjoyable and its action is certainly serviceable. There isn't anything particularly interesting about the flick. Having said that, it moves quickly enough and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not great, by any means, but it's just about effective enough to recommend to fans of either its star, Mark Wahlberg, or its director, Peter Berg. I wouldn't be surprised if Netflix springs a sequel on us sooner than we'd expect. 6/10.",Spenser Confidential
16,The-Sarkologist,Enjoyable Crime Drama,7,17 March 2020,"Well, it seems that I got myself caught by the Netflix algorithm that suggested that this film was quite popular in Australia. Honestly, I probably should have done what I normally do and check the rating on IMDB to determine whether I actually want to waste my time watching it or not. Anyway, it did happen to star Mark Whalberg, and he does happen to be a pretty cool actor, and his movies aren't all that bad either, so I decided to give it a go.Anyway, the film is about this guy named Spenser who beat up his sergent and ended up in gaol (oh, he is a cop, to avoid any confusion). Anyway, he is finally released and he is trying to put his life back together when he discovers that his former sergent, and another cop, have been killed. Suspecting that there is something fishy going on he decides to investigate, despite the fact that not only is he not a cop, but that he is also a convicted felon.Well, it turns out that there is this massive conspiracy involving corrupt cops, the Irish mafia, and Mexicans (yeah, it has to be Mexicans doesn't it). Anyway, you can probably work out what eventually happens because, well, this is one of those films that is like that. Mind you, the whole explanation as to why he landed up in gaol happens halfway through the film, and yeah, it is an exposition, but sometimes you really can't avoid it. Mind you, while you can generally guess the ending, half the fun of such films is working out how they got there.Yeah, this is another one of those corrupt cops trying to make money type films because, well, being a cop doesn't actually pay all that well, and it turns out that it is the honest ones that end up suffering. Look, as a film it wasn't too bad, but it really wasn't all that outstanding either. In a way it does seem to be trying to be one of those gritty crime dramas, which I do happen to like, but it doesn't quite have the same charm that the really good ones happen to have. I guess in a way it has a lot to do with is being a straight to Netflix type of film.Look, if you like crime dramas then you may like this one, but the reality is there is nothing about it that makes it stand out. In a way it is just another film that simply adds to the list of the thousands of films that are already out there, and there are most likely much better ones to watch than this particular one.",Spenser Confidential

18,cruise01,Easy to pass the time with a decent action comedy flick but forgettable.,6,10 March 2020,"Spencer Confidential (3 out of 5 stars).Spencer Confidential is a fair action comedy film with very little laughs, boring plot, and decent fun performances by Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke. It's a buddy comedy film about an ex cop Spenser (Mark Wahlberg) who was put away in prison after he beat up another cop for seeing him being abusive to his wife. After 5 years, he sees that another officer is murdered and blamed for being corrupt. He investigate the crime about the officer to prove he is innocent. Which he discovers police corruption involving murdering, drug trafficking, ect.It has a few laughs with the performances likes by Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke. They make a great pair. Wahlberg being a temper wise guy. Winston being a big brute and very soft personality. Alan Arkin is a lot of fun as well as Spenser's elder friend. Iliza Shlesinger is good as Cissy, Spenser's former love interest and a loud mouth and all attitude.The plot suffers with clichés and predictable twists with the bad guys. Nothing really surprising with a story about cop corruption and a little crammed together about an organization trying to rise up with a casino named Wonderland. The story is forgettable. Music score by Steve Jablonsky was disappointing. Making the movie feel dull and tedious.Overall, Spenser Confidential is a fair film. It has some decent action and some humor to make this worth watching. But the story, script, and its dull direction does make this action film forgettable.",Spenser Confidential
19,Floated2,Solid entertainment,6,24 May 2020,"Nothing exactly special about this film. It is the typical Mark Wahlberg actioner, and directed by Peter Berg whom they made several great films together (Lone Survivor, Patriots Day), we knew somewhat what to expect. This is an upgrade from the underwhelming Mile 22.However knowing that this film went directly to Netflix rather than theaters like their previous collaborations, the expectations shouldn't be as high.With an interesting premise (had no knowledge of the original material) Spenser Confidential does what it's intended to. Deliver an engaging enough plot, some thrills and action, sone typical comic relief. Well likened characters.It started off relatively well then dragged a little in the middle but finished solidly. Perhaps just a one time watch but that isn't exactly a bad thing.",Spenser Confidential
20,eddie_baggins,The Berg and Wahlberg show comes to a grinding halt,3,15 March 2020,"Since the 2013 surprise box office hit Lone Survivor, filmmaker Peter Berg and his leading man favourite Mark Wahlberg have made a further 4 films together, all too varying degrees of quality, ranging from the very good (Deepwater Horizon) to the very very bad (Mile 22), with Netflix release Spenser Confidential certainly falling more towards the latter pool.One of the most pointless and strange features to be released so far in 2020, it's hard too know exactly what the point of this whole exercise is, as Berg and Wahlberg mould crime thriller, comedy and action in an odd rebooting of Robert B. Parker's ""Spenser"" novels.There's been worse films that have come our way so far this year but Spenser fails to justify its existence outside of letting Wahlberg show us all his still in tip top physical condition and for Berg to put away his shaky cam aesthetic to throw a bunch of classic songs at us to mask the fact his film is devoid of any real character or energy.There are no surprises here within Spenser's story as Wahlberg's justice seeking cop is released from a stint in prison to find himself instantly investigating a leading cops mysterious murder, an investigation that sees him teaming up with Winston Duke's wannabe boxer Hawk, in what should be a mismatched buddy win, but a team-up that never gets out of first gear due to Hawk's seriously underwritten role.Both Wahlberg and Duke have charisma, evident through their recent works but together they never get to shine as Wahlberg takes over most of the films key scenes and Duke gets shunted to the side (perhaps a reason why his accent seemingly changes from scene to scene?).With everything story wise too predictable and generic, the films best chance to become something memorable or enjoyable was to get the most out of its leading men but Berg and his screenwriter's Sean O'Keefe and Brian Helgeland were on evidence here unable to come up with the core ingredients to make this happen.For Netflix this is a big step backward for many of their recent high-profile efforts which have all ranged from great to thoroughly enjoyable, while for Berg and Wahlberg, this instantly forgettable event is perhaps an example of while their frequent collaborations could do well to take a decent break.Final Say -There will be worse films released in 2020 but Spenser Confidential is one of the most lifeless and pointless, failing to justify its existence as it meanders along its way to the finish line.1 ½ cloud rants out of 5",Spenser Confidential

It's isn't, the vibe is different, the origin of Spencer and Hawk are different. While both content seem to celebrate what Boston is, Mark Wahlberg seems to be more focus on what we expect of Boston. I don't think Robert Ulrich who originated the character did that.
But I should not compare, it really feels like a Spencer from an alternative reality. Taking this movie at complete face value, like I said it seems to drive on a focus of the character that is Boston and the people native to it. Which I liked.
Director, Peter Berg and Wahlberg make an amazing team, especially when they do blue collar boys, especially if them blue collar boys are form Boston.
Winston Duke as Hawk...was just ok. He did good but I felt they could have gotten him to do more. They may have tried to hard to make him unsterotypical to separate him from the walking stereotype that was Hawk in the original series, but they may have taken out too much. They could have gotten more out of Duke if they wanted, but at least Duke and Wahlberg had chemistry when they were on screen together.
Alan Akran was a little more perfect. Just the right amount of Akran doing the loveable cranky old man. A solid performance.
Overall, the movie is good. Loved the action, loved the comedy and loved the drama. If you like Mark Wahlberg, good. That's really important to liking the film.",Spenser Confidential

ex-cop Spenser(Mark Wahlberg) who just got released from prison, pulls himself into a mystery, solving the death of two policeman, with a new partner named Hawk(Winston Duke, Black Panther, US). Spenser attempts to shake the trees in hopes to flush out the killer, but the question is, will he?
An fun action film for anybody who loves action films. Mark Wahlberg brings his awesome caring humorous charm to the character of Spenser, it's a loose remake of the show that starred Robert Urich. Winston Duke also shines has Hawk. Alan Arkin is also good too. If you are looking for a modern action fim, then Spenser Confidential is that film for you.",Spenser Confidential
25,alindsay-al,A Poor Generic Film,3,8 March 2020,"This film is amongst many that are being released on Netflix over the next few months and I have now seen Spenser Confidential and this is my review of the film. The premise of the film sees an ex cop who has just been released from prison drawn back into the world of crime when a former friend is killed.
Main Character
Mark Wahlberg plays the lead Spenser in the film and he does an okay job in the film, he definitley has the presence of a film star and he manages to somewhat rise above a very generic and basic sript. However, there isn't really anything interesting about his character, he is very one dimensional and not very interesting as a lead performance to make you root for him.Supporting cast
Winston Duke plays Wahlbergs closest ally in the film and he gives a decent performance, he is more likeable for sure and has a real presence about him on screen. But we just don't learn enough about his character in the film, his development is sacrificed in order to see more action scenes which I thought hurt the film. Alan Arkin plays Wahlberg's mentor and I just really like Alan Arkin as an actor, he has plenty of charisma on screen and he is just there as the older likeable character. But I must admit I wasn't a fan of the girlfriend role in the film, it just felt like a forced element of the film and one that doesn't have any substance or development in the film. Also all the villains are very basic and there is very little substance to them as well.
Story
The story in the film is pretty boring, if you wrote a basic story of a buddy cop film it would probably be pretty similar to this one. There is no imagination involved in the story, you can predict where it is going from the first minute to the very last and it really believes it is a clever film with clever twists but it really isn't. For me when you can predict everything that is going to be happen in a film and the characters arcs aren't explored enough that equals a boring story.
Script
The script has a few funny moments but not enough for it to be considered good, if it was going for a comedy then it isn't funny enough and the drama doesn't hit any emotional levels and is just there not really doing much or achieving anything of any kind.
Style
It cannot be denied the style of this film has some entertaining action scenes in it, mainly involving chase scenes and cars but this film is really choppy when it comes to hand to hand combat. It is edited so much that it is really hard to follow, the amount of quick cuts makes it really jarring and hard to buy into, especially when you are clearly suppossed to.
Overall
Overall this is a poor film, it is one of the most basic and generic films I have seen in recent memory and a few decent performances isn't enough to make this film worth a watch for anybody.",Spenser Confidential

28,s3276169,A reflection of Hollywood's myopic world view ....,5,20 March 2020,"A Myopic perspective on entertainment has rendered a faltering Hollywood incapable of looking beyond its own shortcomings.""Spenser Confidential"" is, in my opinion, symptomatic of that perspective. Beyond the woke nonsense that they keep churning out is a repetitive and predictable tendency to produce ""safe"" formulaic entertainment.Formula's that were once new and worked but are now badly dated, becoming their own faded cliches. Spenser is yet another example. Its a plodding, by the books, action flick with ""a tough nosed, stand up guy, against the corrupt system"" set up.Its not bad as such. The action is alright, the actors are capable but its doing nothing even remotely new or even a little clever, with its story. Its not as if there is not innovation on offer either. Just look at some of the creativity out there on sites like Youtube with short films that are often superior to mainstream offerings.In short an alright watch if you don't mind the predictable, grinding repetition.A thoroughly bored 5/10 from me.",Spenser Confidential
29,aidanratesmovies,"Silly, but it is a blast",8,2 April 2020,"Although at times it can seem a bit overly-macho, Spenser Confidential is by far a massively entertaining ride that is truly more fun than it should be. Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke make for a great pair, with both providing rather solid performances that are both enjoyable, and as the film goes on, very likable. Alan Arkin's performance can at times feel a bit forced, but his role is undeniably enjoyable from time to time. As for the other supporting actors in the film, they seem rather realistic for this type of flick, which I thought was quite refreshing, not shying away from their flaws and those affected by it. The film can be a bit cliche at times, with various formulaic incidents causing me to roll my eyes at the screen, but the final result of the film is something so stupidly entertaining, it's hard not to give it a break. Going in to the film, I expected it to be a lot worse than what I saw. The film does have its fair share of cliches, cheesy dialogue, and over the top moments but the film is surprisingly very interesting, and I will be surprised for anyone who isn't at least somewhat enjoying its ongoing unraveling of its story. In the end, Spenser Confidential is a enjoyable time, that may be silly, but is certainly worth a watch.

30,questl-18592,Wahlberg Confidential,4,15 March 2020,"Mark Wahlberg plays a tough, hard hitting, smart mouthed, Boston cop searching for justice in an unjust world. Sound familiar? Probably should cause it feels like that's his go to role.Spenser Confidential is slick, stylish and all that, but at the end of the day it's just doing the same old thing. This is a straight to home video kind of movie that somehow managed to grab a couple of decent names. It doesn't help that I'm not the biggest fan of Wahlberg in the first place. That said, Winston Duke is always a fun screen presence to me and that's still here.This isn't a terrible movie or anything, it's just horribly uninspired, bland and unremarkable. Background noise, nothing else unless you're a big fan or Wahlberg.",Spenser Confidential

32,AudioFileZ,Like A Good Cop Crime TV Movie,6,10 March 2020,"This is Wahlberg's range so you know it will be watchable if it isn't anything like an evoltuion of an actor. Walhberg plays Spenser who because of his lack of depth goes for what he inherently feels is right. It didn't work out for him so well as a police officer in a corrupted PD. After a stint in prison he's out and suddenly he finds himself in a familiar spot. That would be trying to rat out that corruption that just boiled over much worse almost on the very night of his release.The above seems a bit by rote, but why would we watch if Wahlberg's Spenser just calmly walked into a regular life? This is where watchable means a lot. The man can be fun to simply watch.Without too much effort the character of Spenser is just right for Mark Walhberg. Boston is rigt for the story even if it's far from being anything amazing. I don't see this as much to do with Spenser for hire either for instance. This is just meat and potatoes cop crime stuff done good enough for what it is. The other characters including Alan Arkin add some flavor to the preceedings.Don't expect too much and just go on the ride. The mix of being very watchable with light comedy is decent enough to zone out for an hour and change. More or less a made for TV movie that's decent enough to enjoy.",Spenser Confidential
33,a_chinn,"Enjoyable, but lightweight and very loose adaptation of Robert B. Parker's Spencer novel",6,7 July 2020,"Writer/Director Peter Berg is a mainstream commercial director who I love. His film are never masterpieces, but they are consistently enjoyable. From his first major film (and The Rock's film debut), the enjoyably goofy action/adventure film ""The Rundown"" to his heartfelt movie and TV adaptation of ""Friday Night Lights"" to directing a new documentary on Chris Cornell. This track record made me excited to see his take on Robert B. Parkers tough P.I. character, Spencer, previously best known from the Robert Urich 80s TV series. Then casting Marky Mark in the lead, where he gets to go FULL-Boston, made me even more exited about this project. However, ""Spencer Confidential"" is pretty lightweight and immediately forgettable entertainment. I was entertained by Berg's loose adaptation of the Parker character, even if he didn't have the hard-boiled edge of the books. Overall, this film was a disappointment, but I was entertained and so will most viewers if you don't go into this Netflix original with too high of expectations (which I mistakenly did). Alan Arkin, Iliza Shlesinger, Bokeem Woodbine, Marc Maron, Coleen Camp, and Post Malone also appear in the film.",Spenser Confidential

Starring Mark Wahlberg, Winston Duke, Alan Arkin, Ilza Shlesinger, Bokeem Woodbine, Hope Olaide Wilson, Michael Gaston, Mark Maron, Colleen Camp, Ayana Brown, Dustin Tucker, Austin Post. (R)Crooked police captain Gaston gets killed the same day that ex-cop/ex-con Spenser (Wahlberg) gets out of the joint; Spenser had a grudge against the deceased, but decides to investigate anyway, blowing the lid off a stewpot of dirty cops, drugs, murder conspiracies, the usual. Garden variety convoluted-but-uninteresting action-noir-mystery is a study in tonal disarray, with scenes of somber reflection and brutish violence crashing against Shlesinger's abrasive ""Bahston"" kook and Arkin's patented irascible wisecracks. Filmmakers try to solve the erratic pacing issues by having a fight break out every twenty minutes or so; fortunately, the music and camera filters will cue the appropriate whooping or cringing response. Duke, as a soft-spoken ""gentle giant"" of a wannabe-MMA fighter, plays the only compelling character onscreen (when not forced to go through the ""buddy comedy"" motions).

I'll agree that I enjoy Marky Mark beating the crap outta disposable baddies the way 80s/90s heroes did, which is why Spenser Confidential stayed watchable throughout. It, for sure, breaks no fresh ground in terms of storytelling, comedy, or even set-pieces. The climax set-piece (featuring Black Betty) is the only juicy bit of action worth recalling. Winston Duke is a massive dude and can play the beefy side-kick's role in future action comedies, if utilized judiciously.The writing (by Sean O' Keefe and Brian Helgeland) is largely by-the-numbers. The mystery element (of who's the big crime daddy) is practically non-existent. While the action is partly enjoyable (by Peter Berg's standards), the forced bromistry and connect-the-dots plotting fall flat (Helgeland, what happened mate?). With a racier script, a shorter run-time, and well-written protagonists, Spenser Confidential could have been much better.",Spenser Confidential
41,Prashast_Singh,A fast-paced action comedy that does what it's meant to do.,10,9 April 2020,"Alright, I finally got myself my own Netflix subscription and this was the film I started with. I got exactly what I was expecting: a fun action comedy with lots of action, decent amount of humor and some intriguing mystery. Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke make nice on-screen buddies, and the tone/treatment of the story works for the two.Spenser Confidential wastes no time in setting up the plot and jumping to the action sequences quickly. The fights are in plenty, and quite raw as well. And then we have chases too, sprinkled with some really hilarious parts. For a moment, I felt I was watching a lighter version of Mark's 2008 actioner Max Payne which was quite dark. Well, the film does have a simple-looking plot but also has ample twists and turns to keep one awake.At the end of the day, it's a movie meant to be enjoyed and not taken seriously. It doesn't get graphic with violence/language/sexual content, and keeps it mostly in check. However, that doesn't make it a kid-friendly ride. Spenser Confidential is just a very fun action movie that combines an interesting story with breakneck action. And that's what it was meant to do, again.",Spenser Confidential

I watched it with two other guys, one of whom is a fan of the novels. All of us agreed that this was mediocre at best. Obviously they're trying to start a franchise, but this was so lame it's hard to imagine it succeeding without a change of actors. This two hour film probably has a script consisting of 30 double-spaced lines and character development is nil. This flick is completely emotionally flat and the plot totally hackneyed. Basically take a 1970s cops and robbers TV show and amp up the production values by an order of magnitude and this is what you'd get.

51,kjproulx,"Likeable, But Not Fleshed Out Enough",5,16 March 2020,"Movies that revolve around characters that don't get along very well, but eventually have to settle their differences in order to work together and get things done, I personally have a soft spot for. If the characters are well-written and the story itself is good enough to have some great moments, then those are some of my favourite films to watch. Sadly, when you have a great cast, but a script that's only mediocre, then it becomes slightly disappointing and it just feels like a lot of wasted potential. Spenser Confidential has likeable aspects to it and some viewers may find it enjoyable, but here's why you can probably skip this one.Fresh out of prison for beating up a police officer, Spenser (Mark Wahlberg) finds himself back in the thick of things when two officers are murdered. Teaming up with his roommate Hawk (Winston Duke), they start taking down the criminals behind these killings. The premise is very straight forward and the series of events are something everyone has seen a thousand times, so I'll start by saying you'll like this film you place your expectations far, far away. Being a Netflix original, it's a passable little action film with some solid moments, but being directed by Peter Berg, I expected a lot more.After his streak of films like Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriot's Day, Peter Berg seemed like a director that has matured his career and become a filmmaker that shouldn't be missed. Well, in 2018, he directed a film called Mile 22, which ended up being one of the very weakest films of that year. Seeing that his follow-up was going to Netflix isn't exactly a red flag anymore, as some Netflix movies even win Oscars now, but I can sort of see why this particular movie was released by them. Although nowhere near as bad as his previous film, Spenser Confidential is average at best.Written by Sean O'Keefe and Brian Helgeland, their team-up felt very reminiscent to that of the main characters in the film. It felt like a series of clashing ideas. This movie seemed to be unsure if it was a comedy or a drama, but always knew it wanted to become a flat-out action film by the climax. There are moments of clever writing and the backstories of these two were good enough to make a significantly fun action film, but nothing quite clicked for me. If for nothing else, Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke are actually quite good together. I truly believe they deserved a better film here.In the end, Spenser Confidential could've absolutely been much worse. In fact, I enjoyed watching about half of this movie. The climax is fun, the chemistry between the leads was definitely there, and the makings of a great buddy film felt like they were screaming to come out. I feel that this movie wasn't fleshed out enough before it went into production. I didn't mind watching it, but I feel this film will be extremely forgettable in months to come. A decent attempt that just didn't come together.",Spenser Confidential
52,JohnRayPeterson,Robert B. Parker's popular character resurrected,7,23 March 2020,"By far, the Robert B. Parker character 'Spenser' is one about who the author has written the most novels. 41 to be specific. I used to watch the tv series based on those novels and I enjoyed the made for tv movies also; and now we get a full length feature movie. Good!If that wasn't enough, the title role is played by Mark Wahlberg. If you know anything about Spenser, you know he is a Boston P.I. (private eye) which makes Wahlberg an excellent choice to play the role. When I think of Boston, I think of Wahlberg (i.e. 'The Departed'). Also, true to the novels, we find the character Henry, Henry Cimoli played by Alan Arkin. The chemistry between Wahlberg and Arkin alone is worth seeing the movie. Then a new face, at least it was not one I recalled, Winston Duke playing another staple character of the novel series, Hawk.The plot is standard, no unseen before bad guys or crime, but sometimes standard is good when you spice it up with new faces and a bit of humour. Wahlberg knows how to deliver a snappy remark when he gets hit by a blow that would knock out most of us mortals.

66,ethanbresnett,"Ridiculous and stupid, but entertaining nonetheless",6,17 June 2020,"Spenser Confidential is probably toward the upper echelons of the bang average section of Mark Wahlberg's filmography. Its a popcorn movie, plain and simple. Its nothing special in terms of plot, acting, action etc, but doesn't fall short in any of these respects either.Initially the character of Spenser and the way the film was set up didn't draw me in, but this film did grow on me. A large part of this was due to the plot. It did have a few decent twists and turns which, while not wholly unpredictable, were veiled enough to generate some level of suspense. The plot is one where you will massively have to suspend your disbelief. It's a thoroughly ludicrous plot, but that comes with the territory of a popcorn movie.Wahlberg put in a decent performance as Spenser, the character was very similar to many many others he's played so he could do this job in his sleep. What baffles me the most though is that Mark Wahlberg is a good actor! I don't know why he's constantly slumming it with these bang average action films. They do all start to blend slightly and Spenser Confidential definitely can't be deemed original. One of my more major criticisms of the films was that Winston Duke's character, Hawk, was not very nuanced at all. I don't think much time went into refining the character, which is a shame as Winston Duke is a great actor.The action was pretty tight in some places, more generic in others. A pretty decent mixture of gun based action, had-to-hand etc. Nothing as exciting as John Wick or The Raid but fun to watch. There were attempts to inject humour into the film, and you know, some of it hit the spot. A lot didn't, but some did.Spenser Confidential isn't going to blow you away, it won't leave you begging for more, and it won't make you think too hard. It will, however, entertain. And sometimes films like this are just what the doctor ordered.",Spenser Confidential
67,MovieCriticOnline,Disappointing....,1,8 March 2021,"Peter Berg is actually a fairly good director with a few gems under his belt, however, this was not one of them. Berg generally approaches films with a sense of realism. This was not done here. Maybe it's a Netflix thing, but Netflix just doesn't have a good track record with producing good quality realistic films. Most are too political in nature with specific woke messages.I also think the writer was the problem here. Compare this to Patriots Day which was great writing, real writing, and amazing acting and it all felt so real and documentary like. This was too much style and slickness over substance. Very Michael Bay'ish. Too ""Hollywood."" Also, I am not a huge fan of music scores that are there to manipulate how you are supposed to feel. I find it to be lazy filmmaking when you need to add certain music to create an emotional response.It all felt like we've seen this before. Black and white buddy film team up to fight the bad guys. This is more of a wishful fantasy than any basis in reality.I think Winston was just added as a cast member because they didn't want to have a white guy ""saving"" the poor vulnerable black woman, so adding Winston would neutralize any backlash from SJWs.Why does Wahlberg even care about the dead cop after he beat the hell out of him and spending 5 years in prison for him? Why was he ready to turn his life upside down while on parole over people he didn't care for? That makes no sense.And Wahlberg doesn't know how to work a computer after 5 years in prison? He still thinks everything is DVD? iCloud has been around since 2011 so that seemed pretty ridiculous, like he had been hibernating for 40 years.There are too many irrelevant characters in this. I mean, how important was Alan Arkin? Not at all. And Shlesinger was way over the top stereotype nagging ex-girlfriend.And why do they have FBI agents behave like comic book caricatures? It is ridiculous. And of course he uncovers a grand conspiracy. The staged choreographed fighting didn't help the film.The whole premise was unoriginal derivative, too campy and everything moved too quick which makes the film suffer from careful character and relationship development.Go watch Patriots Day instead. So much better.",Spenser Confidential

I really wished Peter Berg could have directed a sequel of Mile 22 rather then him making this movie. I thought this film is good not fun full on action, but I thought it was one of those okay type of flicks now I know it's not a full on action I know it's a comedy, mystery, crime film I know what peter berg is trying to do something different but it worked fine the film wasn't boring I thought it wasn't exacting not watchable or unforgettable film but this movie is type of movie it's designed for Netflix not for theatres.To all the people who rate this a 1 star what did you expect? Seriously? Were you expecting an Oscar academy award winner or a perfect script well this isn't for you and it's designed for people who doesn't care about anything and giving this movie a shot that's all it is simple as that look it's one of best movie or greatest but I thought its enjoyable the story was good the jokes were funny and laughable their wasn't too much action in movie expect for ending part I really wished Peter Berg would have touched idea like 6 underground and make that with Mile 22 sequel rather then him doing this film, I thought it was slow and I don't understand why people call this a action film well it's not I knew what it was.
The story follows Spenser (Mark Wahlberg) who was a cop that everyone knows he bustard an old man then got fired went to jail he spent time in jail I liked start of role when he beat the crap of everyone and guess who was in movie Austin Post Malone I wished Mark Wahlberg could off punched him dozens times in face until I can't recognize him at all he has bad acting his overrated singer and actor theirs millions of another rappers they could of used who in earth picked Post Malone? His acting was a like block of wood. Spenser gets out prison reconnects with his mentor Henry (Alan Arkin) he has a guest that lives with him while Spenser was in prison a new roommate he also he trains MMA but in a no-nonsense MMA fighter with heart Hawk (Winston Duke) so Spenser goes out their and investigates the killer that killed girl and killed law forcements so Spenser becomes a cop/vigilante type. I thought acting did fine, their wasn't full on action it's more of crime, comedy, mystery type of movie but nothing to exacting end of day it felt like I wanna put on Mark Wahlberg film Mile 22 peter berg film before this. I liked another cast like Cissy Davis she did fine in movie she was funny in some scenes she worked fine, I liked Bokeem Woodbine in movie he worked with Mark Wahlberg in Big Hit a 90's action-comedy film that peter berg could taken that idea from big hit. The twist is like you see it coming, it's not like uh I saw it coming miles away nothing to shocking at all ""Spenser Confidential"" has comedy, action, crime, mystery type of genre mixed of odd commotion. A sentimentalism and all the basic, vital ingredients, none of which rise above the level of average. It's kinda like the movie's sort of 'muted', like softened up, watered down, muddled, call it what You want. You've seen and felt all of this before, probably a load of times. So, looking for silver linings, the cast (mostly) provides decent performances, some jokes land and some action parts are well done and edited the pacing was good I love movies that has a nice pacing 1h 51min but the running time minutes could been worse lucky this wasn't a 2 hour long film because I almost got bored with film but it's like trailer has done a better job than the movie I don't know if that's me or not but that's what I think like that sometimes But it turns out to be plot wasn't boring. Was it dark and depressing like many crime drama's? no. Was it stupid like most comedy crime dramas? no. Was it boring like most everything else? No! but the film had Potential in it I don't know how to explain it, but you feel there is without it then I would have never stand film at all. The ending of showdown was good but was fun, but it was great either. Obviously, it's not masterpiece and but it's exactly that kind of pleasant movie on a Friday night film. Marl Wahlberg & Winston Duke have a great chemistry together, both have some funny moments, and along with Arkin, it's what sells the movie and will keep you watching threw out film like you won't even turn it off or watch something else. I can see someone else directed this movie not peter berg but I wished peter berg could directed sequel of Mile 22 rather then him directing this movie I like Peter Berg's directorial style, and you can't go wrong with Mark Wahlberg in Mile 22 he was a half goody and half bad guy type of guy he was badass in that movie then to this rather than me seeing him Rather than getting kicked crap out of Spenser from another characters constantly gets beat up but Spenser always fights back in the same time I had fun watching this film it was funny entering, cast with Mark and Winston has a great chemistry together I thought story and funny lines worked well but it's not next Rush Hour or Last boyscott type of buddy film I really wished this would have been a bigger action comedy crime film like Stuber Dave baustia film that came out theatres last year could been like this movie for explame but peter berg I know he can do much better than this movie I know he can I really wished this could been a better much better job for this movie I know he can but maybe it's small budgeted film but all I can say is I wish this movie could been a better movie that's all I can say 7.10 give it look if your die hard fan like me who loves Mark Wahlberg or peter berg as director who worked with him couple movies then this is for you, but I rather watch Mile 22 over top of this movie.",Spenser Confidential

71,stevenrotherforth,Perfectly serviceable for a Saturday afternoon,6,8 March 2020,"Spenser Confidential
Whilst there is enjoyment to be had with this latest Mark Wahlberg/Peter Berg
collaboration 'Spenser Confidential' is nothing more than another regurgitation of an old tired and tested formula.
Think 'Last Boy Scout', 'Lethal Weapon' or any other buddy/partner movie that was churned out in the 80's and your on the right track.
Wahlberg plays Spenser an Ex cop and Ex con who partners up with his room mate, Hawk played by Winston Duke to take down the murderers of two Boston Police officers.
For a buddy cop style movie there isn't much of a relationship between the two leads and whilst there is some comedic moments they come mainly from the excellent Lliza Shlesinger who plays Cissy, Spenser's slightly nutty girlfriend.
Alan Arkin also lends a hand with the laughs and Bokeem Woodbine plays the generic villain.'Spenser Confidential won't linger in the memory banks for very long but it is perfectly serviceable for say a Saturday afternoon watch. It's typical Netflix fodder and it doesn't deserve a theatrical release.
Berg and Wahlberg have made some gems in the past. 'Lone Survivor' instantly springing to mind.
This latest effort though like their last, the totally uninspiring'Mile 22' is average at best.In terms of audio and visual quality. This movie is presented in Dolby Vision.
It is a good looking movie.
It doesn't have the visual pizzazz as say '6 Underground' another recent Netflix offering but this film does have a crisp 4K image.
Sound is effective. As all action movies should be.
The Dolby Atmos mix is sparse with overhead effects but bass is punchy and surround sound is evident throughout.'Spenser Confidential'
ends with the possibility of a sequel. The question is.

""Bright"" and ""6 Underground"" are spot-on examples & now ""Spenser Confidential"" has joined the bowl of expensive but mediocre action flicks.""Spenser Confidential"" is Peter Berg's fifth movie in a row (!!!) starring Mark Wahlberg, and the last two were a downgrade for both. Spenser (Mark Wahlberg), an honest, hard-headed ex-cop with a strong moral compass gets out of prison, reconnects with his mentor Henry (Alan Arkin) and his new roommate Hawk (Winston Duke), a no-nonsense MMA fighter with heart. Spenser got in prison for trying out some vigilante justice & that is exactly what he's going to do for the entirety of the movie, just now with his new friend Hawk. The story is as old as the world and nor Peter Berg nor the screenwriter Brian Helgeland (who really can do better than this) has done anything much to spice it up.

The Comedy genre Is by default made for wider dumber audience. And that's often why 90% are so corny. How many crappy adam Sandler movies does one need? How many Weddings and christmases comedies can we muster from hollywoods b team? Well people just can't get enough and those are calling themselves sane? In the end It bows down to If the actor/actress Is worth your time. Me too like comedies that makes you think or have a certain style. Actors that usually doesn't do comedies tend to be way way more realistic. Like Jason statham. Michael Pena. funny just by being themselves. While comedy proffessionals like Will Ferrel, danny mcbride are almost never funny. And I find Mark to be great at that. I can always have a few laughs even if the movie is more then forgettable. Some actors just clicks with your own personality and Mark does just that. His movies also holds a certain degrees of quality.

In this action-comedy, when two Boston police officers are murdered, ex-cop Spenser teams up with his no-nonsense roommate to take down criminals.

This is the fifth collaboration between Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg and the films are getting stale. It's time to change up the formula, men! I didn't hate ""Spenser Confidential"" but I didn't love it either. It's decent for a one time, Saturday night watch and then you forget you ever saw it. There were a few comedic moments from Wahlberg and the action sequences were entertaining, and I did enjoy that in the action there wasn't so much CGI. In the end what genre of movie was this? Overall, see it once if you're up for it and then move on, but it's time for Peter Berg to return to making films like ""The Rundown"" and ""The Kingdom"".

78,DeBBss,Nothing Special,4,21 May 2020,"Spenser Confidential is an action movie that is typical of it's genre. It's a comedy action that barely succeeds in any of its categories. It's rather boring in the aspect that it doesn't try something new; it does everything safely. I mean, what would you expect from a Mark Wahlberg flick; his acting style is so repetitive that it eventually gets annoying. The biggest issue with this movie is Mark Wahlberg in my opinion. His character is literally the same character he plays in all of his most recent movies. Because of Mark Wahlberg, Spenser is so bland and boring, which is a big problem because Spenser is the protagonist in this story.Surprisingly, the plot isn't that poorly written, it's just really boring. I have no issues with crime action movies, but you have to do something unique because this genre is overly saturated. There are some questionable plot devices added in that feel forced, like how Spenser went to prison. I feel like it really wouldn't make a difference if Spenser didn't go to prison in the first place. There should've been more scenes in prison to justify this plot device, because it feels like the whole prison thing was made for Spenser to get introduced to Hawk and have some cheap jokes. Another problem with the script is the horrible comedy. I never laughed, and I barely even cracked a smile at times, and part of it is the acting, but man was the comedy cringe.The acting and characters are terrible in Spenser Confidential. Mark Wahlberg didn't add anything to his character; Spenser is just another hero that makes cheesy jokes. One thing that is promising about the acting is Post Malone's performance. He didn't do anything crazy with his performance, but for not having an acting background, he did a pretty good job. The characters are really poorly written. None of them were interesting and they barely had any character traits. Hawk and Spenser both like boxing, and Spenser likes helping people, what else? All of the characters were really stupid too, like why would a cop leave his tooth pick on the ground right before killing someone when he knows there's going to be an investigation. There's a lot of other moments in the film that shows how stupid these characters are, but there's too many to list.Spenser Confidential is a movie that doesn't strive to be something different. The writers and actors played everything safely, and that was the downfall for Spenser Confidential. I didn't have high hopes for this movie going in, and you shouldn't too. If you like cheesy flicks, then it's guaranteed that you'd enjoy Spenser Confidential. Overall, Spenser Confidential is a movie that's boring and unoriginal; not good enough to get a rating anything higher than a six from me.",Spenser Confidential

Director: Peter Berg
Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Winston Duke, Alan Arkin, Post Malone, Iliza Shlesinger, Michael Gaston, Bokeem Woodbine etcOverall rating 71/100When police officers are being murdered. Ex con Spenser (Mark Wahlberg) and his new roommate must track down who is behind the scheme. Spencer Confidential was a fun little buddy cop movie that was held together by it lead performances, but it didn't really add anything new to the genre so let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the performances and the chemistry between the characters was great. The performances from Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke held this movie together very well. Mark Wahlberg didn't do much different in this film to what he usually does. But his kind of enthusiasm, fun humour and likeability was what this film needed. Winston Duke also surprised me as well with his first comedic performance that I have seen from him. He worked well with all his other Co stars his character became more and more likeable as the film went on and he really became a fundamental part of why the film largely worked. Also, Mark and Winston had great chemistry with each other throughout making them both very enjoyable to watch. All the relationships within the film had great chemistry and believability as well. With Ilisa Shlesinger being a great addition to the movie as well.Next the film was very funny and had effective uses of flashbacks. This film made me laugh on multiple occasion. Like previously mentioned the chemistry between Winston and Mark was infectious and very funny to watch. As they both got put into awkward situations especially with Spencer's girlfriend, they managed to balance the two action and comedy tones very well. Next the film effectively used flashbacks in order to create a greater understanding of the characters and character depth. It made you understand the reasoning behind Spenser's arrest and made you connect to his character a lot more; it was also used effectively to reveal previously unseen things.However, my first two negatives would be that the film was very predictable and some of the characters made very questionable decisions. You could tell what was going to happen at every point in the movie and this did effect the impact of the reveals greatly. You could tell who the antagonists were going to be before they were even revealed making some of the usage of flashbacks sadly pointless. Some characters also made very questionable decisions. I felt like for a large majority of the film Spenser's girlfriend was just an annoying distraction from him actually doing his job which didn't really work for me until the final act. And one of the wives of the dead police officer knew things about her husband but she didn't tell the police making her come across as not willing to do what's right which I thought was a slightly odd decision.My next two positives would be the films use of gore and entertaining final act. The film used gore for shock factor very effectively, keeping the film entertaining for a longer period of time the crazier it got. This led to the final act being very entertaining. As the location of the big final fight was revealed you couldn't help but feel slightly excited about what was going to happen, and they certainly didn't disappoint doing a convincing job of making us question who would win the fight.My final points would be the films good use of action but the reasoning for the action being slightly to odd and ridiculous in places. The film had plenty of hard-hitting action that kept you mostly entertained throughout with Mark Wahlberg doing a very convincing job at really hurting people showing that the comedy or action genre is his strong point. But in this case, I found a lot of the action either really forced or slightly to over the top and ridiculous to be plausible for the movie. So, this for me limited how much I was entertained throughout.Overall Spenser confidential is a fun buddy cop movie that should keep you entertained with a great teaming of Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke. But I feel like this was one of Mark's weaker movies. Due to its script issues and problems with its action and predictability.",Spenser Confidential
80,ginocox-206-336968,A jumble of familiar tropes,4,9 March 2020,"Spenser Confidential (2020) is a jumble of familiar tropes with the look and feel of a made-for-television production.Chekhov wrote that if a character hangs a gun over the mantle in the first scene, that the gun must be fired by the conclusion of the play. The act gives the object significance in the mind of the audience. Spenser Confidential hangs Chekhov's guns all over the place, but doesn't get around to firing many of them. Two central characters devote considerable time and discourse to career goals that are never realized, although they use related skills. A character is seriously wounded on multiple occasions, but seems unaffected. An unofficial private investigator accesses surveillance video, but the police never seem to bother.Like many contemporary films, the movie strives for political correctitude, often neglecting plot and character development to devote attention to social issues. An act of domestic violence is shown multiple times in flashback scenes, but seems extraneous to the plot. The cast is culturally diverse to a fault. The female love interests are maternal, age appropriate, and always fully dressed, even during a sex scene.Yet the filmmakers seem ambivalent about liberal narratives. The villains are generally Hispanic or black, with the exception of some Aryan types who are pussycats by comparison. The protagonists employ enhanced interrogation techniques and sexual victimization to extort confessions. An investigative journalist is a staunch defenders of the truth, while television journalists mindlessly parrot false accusations. A dog lover is attacked by a vicious dog.The plot is paper-thin, with reversals announced well in advance. The only surprises come when characters behave in ways that make little sense. The denouement sets up a possible sequel, although it's difficult to imagine anybody wanting to watch it, after viewing this film.",Spenser Confidential

The plot was fairly common, and there were no gaping plot holes. They tried at comedy a couple of times, but the efforts fell flat. There were also a few missed opportunities for comedy, that i'm surprised the movie didn't go for. Overall, I would say that none of the intentional humor worked. I thought this would be more like Ted or The Other Guys, but it was just a generic cop-action-movie.

It checks all the boxes, and stars one of my favorite actors, Mark Wahlberg. I know a lot of people won't like it because it's too cliched or whatever, but it's such a good cliche. It's part action comedy, party mystery thriller, and part buddy movie, but all fun.Yet another collaboration between Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg, this manages to be one of Netflix's most solid offerings in my opinion. Berg is a good director who stages scenes well and knows how to do action scenes.Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke are great, and they do have chemistry. Wahlberg owns his role as usual. I think he's a great comedy actor and he was pretty funny in this. Also, not many other actors look as good beating up people and throwing foul-mouthed insults as Marky Mark. Duke, of Black Panther (2018) fame, has a larger role here and flexes his acting muscles a little more. He's funny and likable, and the perfect calm presence to temper Wahlberg's ferocity.I appreciated the mystery, and the plot was suitably twisty, though I guessed some of it. I appreciated the story and character development that went into it, and that the mystery didn't take a back seat to the action and comedy. This is probably one of the most well executed and balanced hybrid genre films I've seen.The action sequences are more than entertaining. This movie has lots of fights and violence, and it's all good. The prison fight, the bathroom fight, the restaurant fight, and the final battle are all great, and Wahlberg goes all in for the fight scenes. He once again proves himself as a leading man, and this ranks as one of my favorite films of his.I'm a sucker for buddy/action movies like this and I just love the formula. So I guess that makes me biased, but this movie felt very 80s/90s, and I enjoyed that. If you're a fan of that sort of film like me, than I think you'll enjoy it. Spenser Confidential managed to entertain and engage me all the way through, and I can without hesitation recommend it as one of Netflix's best movies. If Netflix is the new direct-to-video, then this movie proves that that may not be such a bad thing.Also, is it just me, or doesn't this feel like a spiritual sequel to The Last Boy Scout (1991)? A disgraced ex-cop tries to solve a conspiracy with the help of his African-American friend. And the white guy gets beaten up a lot. The similarities are too much.",Spenser Confidential

It features a light-weight and easily solved conspiracy, explosions, and a few cheesy one-liners. So, Mark Wahlberg (he is an additional box) plays a former cop named Spenser who, when released from prison, find himself amidst a coverup murder of two police officers. Wahlberg doesn't do much to be an interesting part of the film - somewhat of a hard boiled Bostoner with a grumpy look, he plays the most boring kind of antihero imaginable. He might be brutal at times but it's all for a good cause. Instead, the highlights of the film are some of the more spectacular action scenes and every time Alan Arkin appears, bringing some life to this otherwise quite flat action-comedy. That should also be addressed by the way, on the film's Wikipedia article, its description as a comedy needs to be provided with sources. Fully understandable. The film isn't very funny.

102,nebk,Confidential & Boring,4,6 March 2020,Spenser Confidential sees Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg teaming up for about the 5th time in what is supposed to be a crime thriller action movie. Spenser played by Mark Wahlberg is an ex cop who spent 5 years in prison for assaulting a superior officer. On the day of his release that same officer who is now the Police Chief of Boston is murdered. Spenser is then one of the suspects as well as apparently the only person trying to figure out who killed the chief as well as another policeman who was blamed for it. The rest of the movie has Spenser dealing with corrupt cops and Dominican Gangs who are all involved in some convoluted drug running scheme as well as land development.The good points of this movie are the actors including amongts others Alan Arkin and Winston Duke. The movie however feels like it was rushed and at times it resembles a cheap made for tv film rather than a big budget feature film. Certains scenes have so many choppy cuts that it feels like the camera does not spend more than 2 seconds on any one person. The story is weak overall and predictable as well. The action is ok but it gets unrealistic and the humor mostly falls flat and ruins any atmosphere of the movie. Overall this is a forgettable film that feels rushed. Best avoided.,Spenser Confidential

If you had stumbled upon the film without having seen a trailer or read a blurb about it, the premise of the movie is made perfectly clear in less than five minutes in the opening flashback scene. It's seamless, you know some of the key plays - Spenser and the Boston Police - and what it's about - corruption. They also do a great job in those first ten minutes and the rest of the movie at showing how tight of a community the police force is, keeping you suspicious when one shows up since you've just learn it's about corruption. Spenser Confidential could have easily been a serious dramatic movie on the subject but the comedy shows its head rather quickly, whether it's in Spenser's and other characters' quips or unassuming jokes that are set up a few scenes back that cracks you up when the punchline is revealed (e.g. Pearl).Story wise, there are a few minor twists that are trying to keep this movie from being too predictable, and they work on some level, but it's still a somewhat predictable film. Earlier I mentioned the comedy and Spenser Confidential has its moments, I chuckled a lot watching it and recognized a lot of funny moments that didn't necessarily make me laugh but I could see the comedy in it.The cast is good, they pull off the comedy and the action, Wahlberg and Duke make an interesting pair and they work. I don't remember seeing Iliza Shlesinger in a movie so I was interested to see her in this, and damn she's good. She's funny and all but I didn't see a comedian acting in a movie, I saw an actress with great comedic timing forgetting that she's a legit comedian. Post Malone was kind of the same, it's a small role but he's memorable, face tattoo aside.The action sequences are good but not on the level of Mile 22, but it's nice to see what Peter Berg can do with an action comedy. So Spenser Confidential is a nice movie to start off your weekend and laugh a bit.",Spenser Confidential

108,basilisksamuk,Confusing,5,7 March 2020,"I have never read any of the Spenser books written by Ace Atkins but I have read all of the Robert B Parker books and, as a result, found this film very confusing. It seems to be an origin story taking place before Spenser becomes a PI proper. Mark Wahlberg makes for a good Spenser and all the wisecracks are in place. Winston Duke is also good as Hawk but not quite as cool as I expected. Overall I liked a lot of the movie, especially Wahlberg's portrayal but I missed Susan, an important character in the books.I don't believe films have to slavishly follow the books they are based on but in this case it seems they just used an approximation of Spenser and Hawk then threw in Pearl the dog. This did not need to be a Spenser film and they could have given the characters different names and we would never have known what they were based on. As such it would just be a fun action film.Despite my carping I did enjoy the film except for the hideous music soundtrack which was cranked up so loud that I had to constantly change volume - up to hear the dialogue then down for the ear-splitting music whenever there was any action. I would have preferred them to use a jazz-inflected score which would have suited the mood better but that might just be my age showing.",Spenser Confidential

Iliza Shlesinger was brilliant as an aggressive Southie girlfriend, and Bokeem Woodbine is as charismatic as ever; both almost stole the show. Black Betty was a good example of film personification, as well.

Ever since 2019 though for me it felt like Netflix had a lot of winners. Might not always be Oscar worthy but it gets the job done. Spencer Confidential is no exception. It's great at what it does: it entertains. It's perfect for Netflix. Something you can watch at home on a quiet day.Even though Spencer Confidential is a straightforward crime-action movie there are nuances that gives it an identity of its own. The action in this movie feels realistic. The punches really hurt and there are real consequences during fights.The music is not your typical movie music but a bit of uptempo rock music that manages to hype you up when watching action scenes. I don't remember a moment when I was bored during this movie.It isn't your typical NYC or LA cop movie but it takes great pride in showcasing the city of Boston.And it has soulful characters.

The director of this film Spenser Confidential saw Post Malone's image as the perfect guy to play an inmate in this movie and wrote some super-gangsta lines for him and what does Post Malone do: butchers his lines and ends up sounding like a total nerd. So Post Malone misses a huge opportunity to look cool and gangsta so what does this guy Winston Duke who plays ""Hawk"" do tries to be waaaaaay more gangsta than he really is and ends up seeming way unrealistic as a straight up BAAAAAD-dude who's like a Steven Seagal X10 at kicking bad guys butts. What saves the movie for me and has me giving Spenser a 6/10 is Illiza Shlesinger who is absolutely perfect in her role as the crazy girlfriend who's held out and waited 5 years for Spenser to get out of prison. She's just so naturally funny and really good looking. It would have been nice if Winston Duke could have somehow played off her vibe a little better but Winston Duke is totally off in his own world where he is like indestructible and totally disconnected from the other actors in the movie. I really look forward to Illiza Shlesinger getting a bigger role in her next movie. She is going to be a huge star! Mark is the same Boston cop he is in all the other Boston movies he's in.

150,Eric266,"Not Suer Why its Called ""Spenser""",6,15 March 2020,"First off, I enjoyed the movie as a strict action/detective flick. Wahlberg is likeable in just about everything he does. Alan Arkin as Henry Cimoli was perfect. Iliza Schlesinger as Cissy was sexy (those breasts!) and comical. Her standup gets annoying so keeping her screen time to a minimum in this move was a good choice. Winston Duke didn't do much with the character of Hawk other than looking imposing because he was big, not because he oozed menace. Still, it was a fun action movie that moved along at a brisk pace and had lots of great action scenes.However, this version of Spenser has next to nothing to do with the book or TV series character other than his name. I'm not sure I understand why they bothered calling it Spenser if they changed everything about the character. The series ended over 30 years ago so its not its not like it had great name recognition. They could have called it Joe Confidential and it would have had the same impact. Spenser was a renaissance man. He was streeet smart, suave, quoted literature, was a gourmet cook, had a moral code, was loyal to his girlfriend (Susan; a college professor) and was kicked off the force for being a smartass and not blindly following bad rules, and never went to jail. Hawk and he met as young boxers and went their separate ways, one into law enforcement and one into the criminal life. They crossed paths many times, but respected each other, even if it meant squaring off against each other. Its what made their relationship special. Its why I gave the movie a chance, to see if they explored their earlier life together. I guess it did that, but they went for the cheap character development in favor or more smash ups and fist fights. Wahlberg and Duke as roommates at Henry's place was just lame writing. There was so much fertile ground that could have been covered here and they blew it.As I said in the first paragraph, it was an enjoyable movie, but it didn't do anything to distinguish it from every other action film that gets made these days. Spenser is a unique character with such a rich background and that was just ignored for more set pieces.",Spenser Confidential

Secondly, the background of the story and characters was so way out of the park that you kind of know this could never really happen, far too many lucky coincidences and knowing the right people so you stop believing the story.

Watch it, enjoy it, and move on. There's no real message or point in lingering. We already know that in the real world most of the bad guys get away with it and win. It's a 1 hour 30 minute fantasy that lets us think they don't, that's all.",Spenser Confidential

This is yet another Netflix Original along with 6 Underground and Red Notice that features either copy/paste action sequences or cliche hooks and twists. They get decent actors like Mark Wahlberg and Ryan Reynolds and make utterly forgettable films one after the other.

Jackson. This is there 5th outing together. Although a different kind of movie, a detective action/comedy, the chemistry is still felt even if the movie is a little lack luster. Always filmed in Boston, Mark tries to clear the name of a dead cop while dealing with and older case that sent him to jail earlier. I didn't mind this movie it was similar to 2 Guns mixed with Broken City both of which I like more but the mix of action and comedy is there. The comedy mostly from Alan Arkin and
Iliza Shlesinger. I was never bored at all and found the film to be quite entertaining even though it does get a bit silly and predictable. I don't think it tries to be as epic as The Nice Guys but more of a The Last Boy Scout.6.5/10.",Spenser Confidential

Wahlberg is likable and solid as the cop sent to prison for having a moral compass. He gets out and eventually finds himself investigating murder in his former police department. The action is solid, especially the hand to had stuff - and there's plenty. The story skims the surface and the film is more vulgar than it needs to be with generous F bombs and sex that was clearly unnecessary to the story.

Why did the old timer go home? The acting of everyone was poor. We once did it and we can do it again thing has to stop. It's 2020 not 1990 anymore so this movie did not came out right to me.

Although it is somewhat different than the series, it is a good PI movie that you will enjoy. The thing that people have to remember is that you have to judge movies based on categories. This will never win an Academy award, but I would not compare it to titanic or pretty woman because that's not the type of movie it is. This is an action, comedy, and some what of a mystery.

This is the type of movie people pause to take a telephone call and never finish watching because it can't hold their interest enough to re-launch it. This has a disjointed story line that jumps around and doesn't make much sense because they include scenes that are a distraction and not necessary to the plot. And they don't set up the story well.
So half way in many viewers may still not even have a clue of what the movie is about. It will seem to them an unrelated collection of scenes that don't seem to fit together in any way. I got the feeling very early that much of the footage could have been cut from this film and not hurt it at all. It's as if they inserted some fight scenes into the film like they felt they were obligated to do so. Just stuck them in there because an action movie needs fight scenes. Like the one with the police at the police station. Which served zero purpose for the plot and was redundant. ""Get out of Boston."" Yeah, he already heard that. Several times. Spenser's ex-girl friend has a lot of useless scenes and useless dialog in the movie. This character really contributed nothing important to the story and could have been written out. Her character is like cardboard filler. And her dialog mainly consists of swearing a lot with a Boston accent. Bokeem Woodbine's character is so transparent you have his number right away. A predictable movie with a shallow plot. And the Director did an absolutely terrible job. What kind of scene selection is this? A: Sloppy. The film's editors can take some blame for this mess.

Nothing special about it.Worst part is so many aspects of the cop world were not accurate or believable. Things that just don't happen in the cop world. They could have at least kept it real.

However, the other main message about teamwork and honesty was diluted by by this and many other such commentaries in the film. This led to the unfocused film that made it a chore to sit through.The mystery was also badly done. The ""investigations"" in the film felt unrealistic and too convenient. For a comedy film that wants to also be a mystery film, this is simply not good enough.That being said, Peter Berg really directed the action scenes well.

A relative newcomer Winston Duke stars as Wahlberg's roommate as they share a room under the roof of Alan Arkin who always delivers a fantastic performance. The 3 develop great chemistry and deliver lots of action and laughs. Bookeem Woodbine, Iliza Shlesinger round out a very entertaining cast with a surprise debut from Post Malone.

Who doesn't love Alan Arkin? Iliza Shlesinger used her comedic background to intentionally play an over the top character in Cissy Davis that was much better than I expected. The action choreography is great, the plot moves the well written story along with the help of the Boston based band soundtrack, cinematography, and editing. It's a detective action thriller directed by Peter Berg. That's what I went into it expecting and I enjoyed it very much as that. Especially with that perfect casting and strong performances on both sides of the camera. I hope they make it into a series, or give us at least another movie with the same cast and crew.",Spenser Confidential
212,Booboboo,Numb afternoon movie without any originality,4,18 March 2020,"This is an incredibly old-fashioned movie with no plot twists, no surprises, no particularly interesting characters, and a lead actor that plays a dumb, moralistic man with a helper complex. Wahlberg has no ideas himself and is being nudged around by the other actors. All the time looking like he is somewhere else in his thoughts. It's all a bit unrelatable, simplistic and straightforward. Not sure why this movie was made, as it has no clear idea of character development or advancement, the fighting scenes are mediocre and it all takes about half an hour too long. Well-made though, so that saved it from a 2 star for me.",Spenser Confidential
213,ian-dodkins,Just a great film.,8,5 September 2021,"Is the film deep, is it art cinema, is it pretentious? No. But one thing it has, is great writing. The dialogue is great,the fight scenes, whilst favouring the hero, are not outlandish but more real... (hero gets stabbed, beaten down). For an example about the writing, the woman who loses her husband asks if she can keep the letter because it has hos writing on it. Now that is touching and well delivered in a subtle unobtrusive and thus ultimately powerful way in the film. I'm sure the writer and director could make an Oscar winning masterpiece. They definitely have the ability, but this is not the genre that would appeal in that way. It's a paletable film for 15 and above without excessive or gratuitous violence. It's a crime film with ultimately loveable characters and a really satisfying progression and ending without fulfilling tired tropes. It's not a comedy but there are amusing bits in it in both the dialogue and the action (guy's head being held underwater in the water of a foot spar whilst woman who was usong the footspar looks on). The scene where one of the characters compares them to batman and robin in a cynical way is just delivered really well such that it's amusing. I just loved the way everything fitted together. For me it was better than say any of the Bourne trilogy, but possibly because it is lighter hearted and the main character is more interesting.Really, I believe it rates as a 7 (I rarely give films an 8 or more unless veru very special) however I gave this a 8 because I think it has widespread appeal. Im not a fan of action movies, I just like good stories. Maybe the story doesn't contain too many surprises, but the delivery of the scenes and the small touches in the dialogue brings this film to life. If you like films with investigations , you'll loe it. But to be honest I can't imagine anyone that wouldn't enjoy this film. Of course, I nearly didn't watch it because of some bad reviews. I'm guessing this has more to do with them comparing it to the book and being displeased. I never read or even heard of the booo, so I can't comment on that. However I feel it's unfair to just be critical of a good film because you liked the book more. I think I'll try and find the book, but if you go into this film fresh faced, you'll love it. Watch this film. It won't change your life but if you don't like it I'll refund you the cost.. that's how confident I am that anyone would enjoy it.",Spenser Confidential
214,kking-68641,Pretty good mindless action.,6,25 March 2020,"It's your standard PI/vigilante ""beat people up until you find the bad guys at the top, then beat them up too"" kind of show. An enjoyable, not-too-deep watch.One pointless sex scene with no nudity that adds nothing to the show.Some fairly amusing personalities and a bit of moderate humor.Fairly good entertainment, no more no less.

215,MyContribution,An insult to the 1980s classic series,2,7 March 2020,"As a remake of the original Spenser: For Hire series, this movie gets a zero. As a typical Mark Wahlberg movie (ignoring the Spenser-remake angle), I'd give it a 3. So overall, a 2.The plot was cliché. The dialogue was predictable and failed miserably the few times the characters tried to deliver a 'clever' line. The scenery was dull, even though it is meant to be beautiful Boston. The sound track was intrusive. The characters of Spenser and Hawk were insipid. The girlfriend was utterly obnoxious. The other characters were just stock. The storyline was farfetched and contrived. There just wasn't much to hold your attention.The original series was classy, intelligent, thoughtful, and dynamic. This movie, by contrast, was trashy and trite. Even taken on its own, though, this movie just falls flat.",Spenser Confidential

Crime element is somehow okay as the conflict revolves around cop/police but I didn't feel the mystery vibe much. Actions are good especially with Winston Duke being ""Thor"" in this movie. Dogs were more villainous than human antagonists, maybe the best title for this film is ""Cats and Dogs"". I mean what's more terrifying than attacking by a dog?",Spenser Confidential

Mark Wahlberg was perfectly cast but honestly is almost outshined by all the other actors. That's more of a compliment to the other actors, than a negative criticism of Wahlberg. Winston Duke's character made me smile every time he shows up. Same with Alan Arkin and Iliza Shlesinger.
Definitely worth a watch.",Spenser Confidential
220,vam-vm,Is Marky Mark entering Nick Cage territory?,4,12 March 2020,"Possible spoilers
Very early on this movie let it be known what it was all about. The over used story line that brings back memories of 70's made for TV movies. Good guy gets out of prison after serving time for beating a bad cop. Before getting out however he has to do battle with 3 bad ass dudes who want to kick his ass. He sits in the prison library, alone, when the baddies come in. Not a hint of concern for this hero. Fighting 3 hard pipe hitters doesn't faze M W. Alan Arkin plays the stereotypical older mentor. A role that's been played by dozens of character actors through the decades.
You know at some point the baddie is going to use him to get to Mark.
We are introduced to Marks former partner and if you didn't know he would turn out to be a leader of the corrupt cops then you weren't paying attention to the hundred movies it borrows from.
The only hiccup in the formula is the crazed girl who has a weird relationship with Mark. Although he tries desperately to stay away from her when it becomes dangerous to stay at his crib he moves in to her house along with Arkin, Hawk and dog Pearl. Hawk is another stereotypical character. They clash at first ( which is mandatory in these type films) but then, after some attempts at humor that makes the rubes chuckle, they become best mates.
The final scene is telegraphed half way through the movie. ( you didn't think black Betty would make an appearance?
Very lazy writing and if Mark doesn't want to follow Nick Cages career path he better be more selective in his choices. Those reviewers who chastise reviewers for being too hard on a movie by saying "" what were you expecting from this type of movie ? It wasn't going to win an Academy award"". There are a over a hundred films that won't even be nominated, that doesn't mean I should neglect the obvious flaws in a film.",Spenser Confidential

Good actors, a workable plot and the budget allowed for fun to be had. Overall, it's ok, and that's my main complaint-the OKness of it.The fun was there, kinda. The humor shone through in sparse patches and the action was suitable. Overall, though, it could have been so much more fun. I'm willing to forgive a questionable plot when I'm enjoying the ride, and I did enjoy the performance of the leads, but they were held back by meh directing and bland writing.I would love to see these two leads partner again and be given more freedom to riff on their chemistry.Ultimately, this movie is very watchable and middle-of-the-road with few memorable moments and no great takeaways.

I personally don't watch action movies for the writing, nor horrors etc. People these days just love to complain. And seem to think they're experts on everything. And I can't help but think that some of these reviews were politically motivated due to the films little jabs at the ""fake news"" slogan that's slapped on every news story that doesn't fit a person's narrative nowadays. And as we all know, people who put party before everything, can't watch a movie or tv series and forget about personal politics and god forbid laugh at themselves once in a while.This era we live in now is the worst in my lifetime when it comes to speaking about things that don't even matter. I only wrote this review to try and balance out the bad ones, even though I did enjoy the film. If I hated it, like these other people say they do, I wouldn't give it another second of my time.

Try and get to the bottom of a police cover up. They throw in a twist or two to make it interesting (that you'll probably see coming), but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment. Wahlberg & Duke have a great chemistry together, both have some funny moments, and along with Arkin, its what sells the movie and will keep you watching.The choreography in the fight scenes is also good. It looks very raw and authentic. The bathroom & restaurant brawls are the standouts. The only negative is that the fights scenes throughout the first hour or so are all very quick. All are under 2 minutes, and feel like they could (and should) have gone on longer.Overall, I'd recommend giving it a watch",Spenser Confidential

236,PJK,"Good, but not Spenser.",5,10 March 2020,"As far as mystery/ detective action movies go this is a decent one.Not the kind where you can solve it in advance and the plot is ultimately overly complicated and inconsequential but it is genuine fun watching it unfold.I'd probably have given it a 7 if it wasn't for the false advertisement that I'd be getting to see Spenser and Hawk. These two aren't them.Spenser and Hawk are meant to be two men who while physically intimidating are more dangerous due to their intelligence. A fight is their last resort, notable as they would win every fight.There is not one single line of dialog to illustrate how educated these two are, if anything, the contrary.And while the Private Eye who gets beat up all the time is a staple of the genre, it's not Spenser, who spends most of this movie getting knocked around. And while Wahlberg throws punches he never takes a fighter's stance even though he starred in The Fighter. Spenser is a boxer. He is so well trained as one that other fighting styles don't stand a chance because the fighters themselves lack Spenser's discipline in his chosen form.I hope they paid the Parker estate double for this insult to his creations.Hawk especially as the character as originally written could have been the hero these modern times need. No slam on this actor, he's got skills, and the fault is primarily the script, but he should have sat down with Avery Brooks, who likewise had to overcome script issues when he played the part but was still able to find the soul of the character. You knew it was there, even when it wasn't in the script.Mark Wahlberg just plays Mark Wahlberg. It works here but he's the worst Spenser to play the part even if he's the most accomplished actor.Alan Arkin is perfect. Marc Maron is enough fun that he should have had a bigger part.",Spenser Confidential

I mean the direction's good and Mark Wahlberg's always a good lead but this fell flat for me. It felt like I was watching a movie starring half of the A-Team. Winston Duke's character is sort of likable but so dull Mark Wahlberg had to carry the movie. I just thought the plot was watered down, the action was just okay and quite frankly I only watched it a week ago and I already forgot the ending. Probably because this movie has been done too many times. Then the scene where a truck literally called Black Betty rolls in towards the end and you don't play the song Black Betty?! Criminal. All in all the most entertaining part was watching Iliza Shlesinger. She should be starring in movies not Amy Schumer because she's twice as talented and attractive.

They are a lot of fun and they clearly had a lot of fun making this movie. As a fan of buddy action comedies from the 80s and 90s, it's nice to see another movie like this made. It's also very Boston-centric and I love when movies like this feel like they take place in an actual community. The bad thing here is the tone. It's just all over the place. There's no shortage of conviniences and contrivances that tried to make the pieces of the plot fit together. Also, it doesn't really add anything new to the genre.

I love me some Mark Wahlberg and I love many of Peter Berg's movies, for your basic shoot-em-up mindless entertainment. I do. No film snobbery here.BUT, OMG, this is NOT Spenser. I've read all the Spensers and yes, I watched the series with Robert Urich and Avery Brooks (surprisingly good) and this movie has NOTHING, NOTHING remotely like Spenser. Gone is the fantastic wit and repartee between Spenser and Hawk, which makes the books. Gone is the fact that these are two ""hard men"" in the traditional sense. Hawk projects quiet lethal force, everywhere he goes and is an intellectual that hides it under his ""OG"" persona. Spenser cooks and has other endeavors. They both lift heavy (at the beginning of the series) and toughen their bodies, BECAUSE they are hard men. Not pushovers and NOT guys who get ""beat up a lot.""Hawk is not some wanna-be convict MMA fighter. He's a tough man who will kill you as soon as look at you--but he has another side. Spenser is the same--a tough guy that can be witty--but his capability for violence is always RIGHT there.It's not some hamfisted buddy movie COMEDY. I am horribly disappointed in this film and honestly, if Peter Berg were standing in front of me, I'd smack him. It had everyone it needed--right actors (mostly), right director, right screenwriter, but WHAT HAPPENED? Honestly, this was sooooo bad.And I'm sorry, but the black guy--being big isn't the same as being lethal. Yes, Hawk was large, but he just isn't the right guy for the job.

You have a miniature Spenser, you have a Hawk who looks good but isn't the coolest, deadliest Zen philosopher in the city of Boston like he's supposed to be.

Cons: too short (barely 2 hrs. if it was half and hr longer maybe it can flow more smoothly).

266,EarlGenesis,An incredibly generic action film,5,25 April 2020,"I think Mark Wahlberg is one of the most unappreciated actors outside of The Departed. He's had so many great performances in his career that it kinda doesn't make sense to me that he would agree to do parts in movies like Transformers and this. While there is some fun to be had watching the film, it's such a typical cookie-cutter action film with incredibly generic characters and a plot that's just too simple to enjoy completely.Do I completely hate it?

The story is logical, (which is half the battle with with the idiot plot, mystery for the sake of mystery formula that we have come to expect from certain platforms).

Robert Urich and Avery Brooks had more class in their discarded fingernail clippings than these guys have in their entire bodies. Avery as Hawk was an incredible character with unmatched class, and he exuded POWER from every pore. His character was spun off into his own series, A Man Called Hawk. Brooks was so identified with this character that his Deep Space Nine's Capt. Sisko was quickly turned into Hawk from the lacklustre original character he portrayed.Urich was the perfect Spenser, intelligent, well-read and a great cook among other qualities. If it seems that this is more a review of the TV series than the movie, well I guess that is because people would be better off watching the TV series than yet another tepid big screen rehash of a loved series that should have been left alone. Hollywood seems to be totally bereft of new ideas, and this is one more time they have gone back to the television troth to find something. For some reason, they have yet to learn their lesson as not one TV show rehash has been successful to date. Not one conversion to film has been able to capture the original spirit of the television show and this is just one more failure.",Spenser Confidential

So when I saw the trailer come up on Netflix, I was both intrigued and skeptical. Wahlberg usually hits one note, albeit very well. It gets the job done in his roles. However, I was not expecting him to be able to take on the Spenser character and ignored this film until tonight.I must say, though it was wholly unbelievable in a real world sense, I was thoroughly drawn in and enjoyed this piece of work. While the classic Mustang wasn't present, nor Hawk in a trench coat and shaved head, the film superseded the cosmetic changes from the series. Plus...Alan Arkin!

288,Tucch,One of the oddest commercial movies I've ever seen..,5,14 March 2020,"I don't know what to say, it's neither bad nor good. I'll just list some stuff...The movie begins super serious. I knew nothing about this movie before I began watching it so I had zero expectations, I didn't even know the genre, but it starts off like a SUPER serious crime drama & then dives into a typical jokey, 2 Guns style Wahlberg picture. It was odd to say the least, it just didn't feel right, immediately I was unsettled.Winston Duke (Hawk) felt absolutely empty, like he had no business being in the movie. You could have re-wrote the screenplay & written out his role in about 30 minutes, plus there was zero chemistry between him & Wahlberg. I don't think it was entirely Dukes fault, there wasn't enough in the script for him to really evolve, he felt kinda like some guy who's just finished university & landed a movie role by some absolute fluke. I felt like I was high whenever he popped up on screen, you remember when you used to smoke out & you'd analyse movies in really odd ways, that's how he made me feel.Characters aren't balanced at all, it's like, ""Oh hey Alan Arkin..."" And he's gone for an hour... Who even was he? A parole officer? For a while I was convinced he was Wahlbergs dad & I was waiting for him to call him by that label at some point, thinking it was being withheld to make the audience go ""ooohhh"" maybe my attention lapsed when his character was introduced, I don't think so though.Mark Wahlbergs girlfriend, WTF, how annoying can a character be? & who was she, his wife, his gf, did he live with her, seriously I just don't understand character relationships in this movie..& yet, I've given it 5/10, which kinda feels like a slap in the face to every film I've ever watched.It feels like a TV movie, it feels like a Netflix movie, at times it feels like a movie, some fight scenes will make you feel sick with how fast the shots are chopped, I tried counting at one point, there's a scene in a Mexican restaurant where each shot lasts less than half a second for about 30 seconds, it's extremely difficult to focus on and get any enjoyment out of the fight choreography, I felt asif Peter Berg got Paul Greengrass to shoot the fight scenes for a moment.Idk, this film is so odd, I think it needs to be witnessed, it's ugly, it's super digital, characters don't gel well, entire characters feel like they had no reason for even being in the film, its just, almost impossible to put into words, I feel like changing my rating to a 3/10...",Spenser Confidential

306,whitestar_man,Confused as to what kind of film but mostly enjoyable.,6,25 January 2021,"I wanted to enjoy this more, it was ok with occaisonal good parts but its pacing is off and for me it was confused as to what kind of film it wanted to be. Part police corruption story, part buddy film, part comedy, part action but none of them done well.
The part of Hawk is excellently played by Winston Duke (Black Panther) I found him the most interesting character and added a higher level to the film.
Alan Arkin is his usual excellent self.
Mark Wahlberg is well his usual self, ok but not really a great lead.
The girlfriend though is super annoying and the rest of the cast your average B grade cop drama stereotypes and forgettable.
As to the story, its kind of there but not very convincong.
The most annoying part for me was that Wahlberg's character is meant to be this heart of gold, do gooder cop. What makes this unconvincing is that he does this by constantly getting into fights and beating people up or getting beaten up himself. He just comes across as a thug who thinks he is better than the other thugs because he beats up thugs.
It has some good moments but generally disappoints.
In the end Winston and Arkin make the film more than it is. And if you like Wahlberg you will probably enjoy it.",Spenser Confidential

And while this isn't a great movie, I wouldn't call it bad either.Most important thing, it's an action comedy, and a buddy cop movie. It doesn't try too hard, and while this isn't enough of an excuse to call it good, it manages to be a little appropriate to the genre with all these old jokes.

312,Scotthigginsmre,Constantly distracted by terrible female lead - Slight spoilers,5,22 March 2020,"Fairly enjoyable yet predictable flick. Obvious bad guys, evil assassins easily becoming inept when needed for plot and unlikely characters brought together in friendship.
Action scenes decent and Wahlberg doing his usual tough guy with heart of gold thing throughout. Easy to switch the brain off for majority but consistently distracted with annoyance at the appalling female lead. For some reason, she is written as foul mouth, aggressive and annoying, an extremely overdone accent, with no indication why her and Spenser like each other, except for sex. Even toward the end, where I thought there would be redemption in her character, she is seen stuffing her face and making stupid remarks with food hanging out of her face. Ugghh...! Maybe I'm being too delicate but if I ever saw a relationship like that in real life, and I do, it's usually connected with domestic violence.
If you can ignore her character, which seems largely irrelevant to the story, you should have an enjoyable enough time watching. Probably a 7'ish if you exclude the female lead or rewrite her completely to someone that it marginally likeable.",Spenser Confidential

317,dolphinfish,Characters Badly Named,7,14 March 2020,"Buddy-buddy action movies have a long pedigree and a manual that comes in the box telling you how to put them together, a bit like IKEA furniture. It isn't rocket science. Either the thing works, or it doesn't. This one pretty much does. It's well put together and, like the wardrobe you built in your bedroom, it holds all the stuff it's supposed to hold in a relatively pleasant way. Spenser Confidential ticks all those boxes. Wise cracking tough guy lead (Mark Wahlberh)? Check. Hard core sidekick (Winston Duke)? Check. Wise old mentor bringing the two initially sparring and antipathetic leads together (Alan Arkin)? Check Sexy, ass-kicking female lead (Iizia Shlesinger) Check.Now you need one of two things: a suitably oily, preferably British, villain (think Alan Rickman in Die Hard) or a corrupt police department. This one goes with the corrupt cops angle. Personally, I always find that the weaker option. It leaves the movie less focused and doesn't give the audience a single antagonist to boo. That's the thing that brings this one down, and the fact that the final ingredient required for these kind of movies -- exciting, well choreographed fight sequences -- IS present here is not enough to elevate it above a seven star rating in my opinion. Still that seems better than a lot of the ratings the movie has been receiving. So, why all the down votes?Because the characters are badly named. Spenser and Hawk, the two leads, are based on the characters created in a series of novels in the seventies and eighties by the detective writer Robert B Parker. Parker was, for a time, the pre-eminent hard boiled mystery writer in the US, but in reality, he wasn't really all that much better (if he was better at all) than the great peloton of detective writers out there. Parker rose to prominence because he targeted a very specific audience of readers within the first generation of people who had gone to university en masse. People who fancied themselves as intellectuals, but were actually too lazy or too stupid to engage with heavyweight ideas like those of Thomas Aquinas or Friedrich Nietzsche. Parker's trick was to take a couple of stock mystery story types (Spenser and Hawk), invest them with a slightly medieval code of the warrior ethic, and then, mainly via the medium of Spenser's in-the-novels girlfriend, psychologist Susan Silverman, occasionally mix in a soupcon of serious intellectual concepts. Together with a few literary references (""The name's Spenser with an S. like the English poet""), he had the pseuds eating out of his hand. I know. I WAS one.After I started shaving, I grew out of the Spenser phenomenon. Unfortunately, a lot of guys have stopped shaving since the seventies and many of them don't like the fact that the producers of this movie have bought the Spenser name off the estate and used it to make a move like this, which is actually pretty good on its own merits. They should really have just made the movie and called the characters something like, I don't know, Reilly and Boggs or whatever. A lot of the criticisms are from guys with their noses bent out of shape by the use of the Spenser name when this story bears no resemblance to anything Parker ever wrote about. It IS a bit cynical, but if you can forget that bit, it's quite enjoyable as an actioner.",Spenser Confidential

Because all of his movies look like a continuation of the last one. He's always playing the same thing.Hawk (Winston Duke): Very little to say. A not-so-much of a sidekick. A character completely void.Henry (Alan Arkin): Actually he's the only one who saved the day with a decent performance.Cissy (Iliza Shlesinger): Flat-out horrible. Not so much because of her performance but because of the role per se. The prototype of the modern so-called independent strong woman we see lately in movies: rude, unpleasant, aggressive with men (she keeps insulting, pushing and poking Spenser every time she sees him - well, him and any male crossing her path) in order to show... value??I'm not gonna elaborate too much on the details of the plot. I'd rather not spoil the movie, but I'll say this: what kind of ex cop goes around after leaving jail interrogating, intimidating, beating up and arresting people? I though he no longer had a badge. He's even holding a meeting with the FBI? A regular citizen? What the hell, Peter Berg?I usually write here to say just a couple of words, good or bad, but after wasting my time watching this movie I had to get this off my chest. Save your time.",Spenser Confidential

336,TheAvenger95,Beer n lobstah,7,14 March 2020,"Set in the heart of Boston, this flick revolves around an ex-cop, recently released from prison, who stumbles into a conspiracy that not only ties to the reason he was stripped of his badge and locked up for 5 years, but also the recent deaths of 2 police officers. Spencer and his new roommate and aspiring fighter, Hawk, set out to unravel the mystery and give some payback...This is Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg's 5th collaboration, after films like Lone Survivor, Patriot's Day and Deepwater Horizon. This one however, goes in a different, less self-serious direction as it harken back to the buddy-cop action romps of the 80s and 90s. In fact, it doesn't need to try too hard as it's actually a reimagining of the 80s' private-eye series, Spencer for Hire.While there's certainly nothing new or original on display here, Spencer Confidential is an easy watch. The movie delivers action and laughs in equal measure with the cast's chemistry and charisma stealing the show. Aside from Wahlberg being given the reigns to do his thing, Winston Duke and comedian Iliza Shlesinger in particular, both shine respectively as Hawk, the tough-yet-lovable new best friend and Cissy, Spencer's unapologetic and whirlwind of an ex.Best enjoyed with some ""beer n lobstah"", this worth checking out on a lazy Sunday afternoon - or - on a Corona-fearing day of self-isolating in your home.",Spenser Confidential

338,dparchert,Definitely Worth The Watch,8,15 March 2020,"This movie was definitely worth watching. I loved the combining of the novel, Wonderland, twisted into a long episode of Spenser: For Hire. It blended flawlessly.
Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke had great chemistry on the screen. Alan Arkin and Iliza Shlesinger provided some great comic relief.
The plot was fairly typical of most Mark Wahlberg movies, and stereotypical movies of the genre as a whole, which is not a bad thing whatsoever if you enjoy them. You just know what to reasonably expect and won't be disappointed with it if you enjoy these type of movies. What makes this better, is that it can be streamlined into an excellent movie series bringing back a tweaked mid-1980's t.v. show that was a favorite of mine which I really wish they would.
There are quite a lot of overly thought out armchair ""critic reviews"" that seem to be rating this movie, and so many others, based upon their Oscar winning potential. This isn't an award winning film, just a action/drama/comedy movie that is highly enjoyable. So if you're looking for something good to watch I would highly recommend this one.",Spenser Confidential

But there is nothing in this movie which Robert Parker would recognize as the great characters he created. The most disappointing part is Hawk. In the books and the original series, he is a force of nature - cool, deadly and competent. Winston Duke is probably is a fine actor, but they wrote the character as if he were Michael Oher in the Blindside.All that said, this is a good enough distraction as a whodunit action film.

The good cop/bad cop stories come and go, and I'd watch them all over again, rehashed, whatever, but unfortunately, Spenser Confidential.... it's not a great movie. It's not a good movie.

Same with OMG Winston Duke, so great as M'Baku in Black Panther and soooo wasted here, if I didn't see his name in the cast, I'd think he was a new actor with zero acting skills. Really. He was so bland! No register of emotion! Aaarrghh! Can't blame Mark Wahlberg, though. He really tried, it showed, with whatever script he had. But it's really not enough.

The case brings to light his former partner, played by long time great actor, Bokeem Woodbine, who was once his partner before his stint in prison.The movie does some justice in bringing back a long time beloved television character. In this time of many remakes or reboots, Spencer: Confidential is a great homage.Mark Wahlberg displays his growth as an actor while simultaneously tossing in some light comedy to a once serious television series character.Director Peter Berg reigns in the much overdone explosions, instead ensuring the story is forefront in this awesome rendition of the characters. Easily a movie one could watch over again simply for the light comedy and great characters working off each other.Well done.",Spenser Confidential
395,Nick-Priquette,Typical Cop Mystery Mark Wahlberg Movie.,5,6 February 2021,"Watch at Home with Snacks
Sitting down to watch Spencer Confidential, a cop action movie by Netflix, I was hopeful of having Mark Wahlberg and Winston Duke (Black Panther's M'Baku) lead a story that would become one of my favorite movies of 2020. Unfortunately, I'd say it was a bit lackluster. The opening scene presents us with Spencer, an ex-cop, in the library of a jail and the action immediately starts. A fight breaks out between an inmate (Post Malone) and some other Aryan Brotherhood prisoners. He kicks butt, fairly easily, and gets told a message ""Get out of Boston.""
The story is basically that Spencer had started digging into a case and was ordered by his captain to drop it. He didn't. He ended up beating up the captain and that's how he ended up in jail.
Long story short, corrupt cops are working with some gangs in Boston and Spencer gets out of jail and immediately sets to the task of figuring out what's going on. The biggest problem, and potentially because of the choice of actor, was that you could figure out WHO was responsible and WHAT they did. As a movie lover, I don't wanna know what's going on. I want to be surprised, but this movie made it too easy to figure out the ending.
This movie has a great soundtrack, has some pretty good action scenes (the restaurant scene), along with some really funny moments, however, unlike Guardians of the Galaxy, there wasn't much connection between the characters and story with the audience.
Originally I listed this at 6 of 10, but I'd say it's closer to a 4.5-5 out of 10. I know movie reviews don't matter if you love the movie, actors, directors, etc. So I'm just putting out what I think out there!",Spenser Confidential

Iliza's execution of her character and her lines were fantastic. Too bad there wasn't more of her in the plot. The police corruption with mob ties, and Latino drug thugs plot line was far from original, and so poorly executed. Every ""hook"" was too convenient: he is a boxer, so he gets in lots of fights, plus the cliche throw gun down and fight like a man scene; he goes to truck driving school and drools over a big rig truck, only to use it in the climax of the movie in one of the most half-baked ""let's just run over the bad guys"" scenes. Each cliched hook after hook really insults the audience. This movie jumped the shark when the drug runners only fight with machetes. The script and directing are horrible.

404,huubvisserajax,Great acting in action packed movie,8,4 April 2020,"In my opinion this is one of the greatest action movies of 2020 so far.
The story line is insanely good, everything is connected which makes it very interesting to watch.
Acting is class, all character really fit the role they play.
I wouldn't really consider this movie to be a comedy, it is a thriller like action movie. There were some jokes there, but they didn't really fit in there. The movie would have been better of without the comedy, as you kind of feel like you're switching genres while watching. -1
The action part of the movie is great, using flashbacks, the perfect amount, to tell you the true story of the past. As you watch the movie things start to become more clearer, and when it's nearing the end, you know it all. When a movie can give you that exciting feeling, you know it's a good one.
A downside is the fighting, that sometimes seems a bit unrealistic and to far fetched. -1.
All in all, if you like a good, coherent storyline plus a movie where you will not get bored; watch this one, it's worth it.
Rating: 8/10.",Spenser Confidential

Gone is the literate, well-spoken Spenser with his love of fine food and lovely psychologist lady-friend.

That should be enough to be entertaining and it was.The plot is enough to keep it interesting and the pacing is good. The production has everything you should expect from a high budget movie, and the dialogue is effective and funny.
Don't expect it to be a ""The Departed"" movie. It's not that deep. This is more like a classic ""Lethal Weapon"" flick, and does it well.A solid 7 plus 1 for entertainment value makes this an 8 in my book. A low 8.",Spenser Confidential

430,Moz_Sakura,I simply cannot recommend this.,2,11 March 2020,"I dont even know how to start this review, with everything that went wrong with this movie. I had a nice start, the film seemed to be building an interesting story and then it went down hill very fast.The acting is average, we see a solid performance from the main lead, but nothing extraordinary. The rest is mostly forgettable. Every scene that has emotion being expressed manages to pull it off on the account of screaming and that is all.There is nothing special to add about the setting, the typical town movie, nothing too fancy about it. Most action scenes are delivered in such a cliché and unrealistic way, that even though possibly well executed, there is nothing satisfying about them.Nothing to note about the sound, overall forgettable as well. Sound effects are not terrible, but not particularly worthy of mention.The real criminal in this movie is how badly it was written. To express myself in better, more illustrative terms: has a more solid script than this.SPOILER starts ---------------------------------the typical best friend/old partner is the bad guythe ""unwanted friend"" that goes out of his way to help some dude (a complete stranger) to fight some incredibly powerfull criminals, risking his life by recklessly entering fire fights and risking being emprisioned for life on accounts of murder (very realistic)the old guy that must carry the comedy elements of the movie, but happens to have terrible artificial and shallow dialoge, average performance and is NOT funny at allthe wife/ex-wife/ex-girlfriend that hates him to the bone, but does everything to stick around, drives into a criminals´ ambush because reasons and eventually they end togetherthe unrealistic way the criminals drive their business, how they typically kidnap someone of importance to the main character (obviously the old dude, because he couldnt keep himself hidden and had to return home), how they have an unrealistic show down at the end of the movie where the good guy starts losing the fight, but ends up winning - at this point, this should almost be consider plagiarismSPOILERS END ----------------------------------------This movie is rotten to the core with bad writting, copying every single action movie that came before. There is absolutely nothing original in the acting or plot to drive it forward and every promise of a good movie at the first 10 minutes is metodically murdered throughout the film.If you have never seen an action movie before, then maybe you can overlook the flaws in writting and how shallow, thin and unrealistic the plot and characters are. Maybe you can even overlook the cringy attempts at comedy.Dont recommend it.

435,TRGerry,This Is Batman Business All The Way,7,29 March 2020,"Five years after a confrontation with Police Captain Boylan (Michael Gaston) sent him to prison, former Boston Police Officer Spenser (Mark Wahlburg) is released from prison. Staying in a boarding house run by his former mentor Henry (Alan Arkin) he plans to build a new life in Arizona as a Truck Driver until a gangland style murder of a former colleague forces him to re-confront the corrupt Boston underbelly that got him locked up all those years ago. Finding unlikely allies in his silent giant of a roommate Hawk (Winston Duke), his crazed ex-girlfriend Cissy (Iliza Shlesinger) and boat dwelling ex-reporter Wayne Cosgrove (Marc Maron), Spenser will have to solve one last case if he ever wants to earn his freedom.Spencer Confidential is Netflix's big release for March 2020. An almost two hour R-rated Mark Wahlberg vehicle that succeeds on skill of its all star cast. Mark Wahlberg plays our protagonist Spenser, a good hearted yet immature man who can't help but get involved in situations if he sees injustice. It's definitely to his character's detriment making him a literal glutton for punishment. There's not a scene in this movie where Wahlberg isn't bloodied or bandaged. Wahlberg plays a character we've seen him play countless times (the solve your problems with your fists charmer) and his performance would be almost unremarkable if he didn't TOTALLY nail the comedic side of his character. Winston Duke plays our side kick Hawk with a restrained intensity. It's very interesting to learn more of his background as the story progresses. That being said I wish there was more character development for Hawk especially when you consider this movie is almost two hour long. The only problem for Duke is the script makes Hawk out to be a young tech savvy guy compared to Spenser, while thirty three year old Duke seems too old for this role, especially after his performance as Dad Gabe Wilson in 2019's horror hit ""Us"". For me Iliza Shlesinger is the stand out role in this movie. As a professional stand-up her comedic timing and line delivery is perfect. While her character is written with an almost outdated misogynist crazy girlfriend trope, she brings some of humanity to the role. She makes Cissy a real person with needs and wants and gives her the most depth out of anyone in the movie. There are several other stand out performances from Bokeem Woodbine, Alan Arkin and Dustin Tucker (who manages to do a LOT with such a small role) that any fan of crime comedies would enjoy. The only character that disappointed was Post Malone as the Inmate Squeeb. Post Malone's face was all over the marketing I saw for Spenser Confidential which had me excited. It shocked me to find out he only has roughly six minutes of screen time. This disappointed me at first but was actually a blessing in disguise. His character is all over the place, from reasonable inmate doing what he needs to do to get by to full psychopath. It's a very strange and very flat performance from a character that only exists as a tool to move the plot along.Speaking of the plot, the story beats may be the most jarring part of the movie next to the editing. While the initial execution of the story is solid, the writing takes over and forces the story to progress unnaturally. I found it almost derailed the third act by having the weakest and out of nowhere set up for a final showdown I've seen in recent memory. Without the great action in the third act the movie could have been ruined by the story's forced conclusion. The writers could have added an extra ten minutes to the run time and gotten there naturally, especially with this being a Netflix release. The editing also doesn't do Spenser Confidential any favours. The action scenes have a lot of cuts which work for one or two sequences, but can't cover up some shotty staging. Characters disappear between cuts and it hurts the enjoyment of the fight scenes. While the dialogue is witty and engaging the editing again shows its ugly side with some very simple conversational scenes containing lots of cuts. It attempts to create tension but it breaks immersion with what would otherwise be a great scene.In the end Spenser Confidential is a funny and enjoyable ride filled with some grade A talent. While the writing and editing may fall short the cast definitely saves the day. This movie is worth the watch if you need laugh to stave. For those reasons I'm giving Spenser Confidential seven stars!",Spenser Confidential

He did.I saw this come up on Netflix and got so excited! Just what I needed in the midst of a pandemic. But I wasn't sure... so I went to YouTube and watched the trailer. Ugh. I have never been so disappointed, and indeed angry, at a movie. Why use the Spenser series??? Just give them any names and you would have a perfectly fine cop movie. But, by trying to tie in the perfect detective series, the movie becomes an insult to the legions of Parker fans.In the end, I gave it one star more than it deserves. Why?

None of the characters depicted in this movie are anywhere near the characters he created in his marvelous books, up to and including Spencer's dog. (Pearl is a laconic red Setter in the books.) And Spencer's girlfriend in the movie is the exact opposite of Susan in the book. And in Parker's minimalist, Hemingway-like writing style, Hawk is the epitome of that--a menacing, dark, dangerous force barely kept in check, who just happens to like Spencer's lifestyle..but just barely and only occasionally. The only thing In common with the Spencer books is the name, sadly. So many attempts have been made to capture Spencer on film, all have failed badly.

Was it so thought-provoking I'll be reliving it the rest of the day? No but it was a fun action-filled diversion that made me laugh and despite being somewhat predictable, kept me engaged to stay around to see how it finally ended.Overall, I give a big thumbs up on any movie that just outright gives me something fun that doesn't depress, scare me or have stupid slapstick comedy.

The cast is great, the script and plot are good enough. Berg did shoot it a little simplistically- too many pensive ""Wahlberg driving the car"" for my taste. But it's a fun 2 hours.Fine comedy. Decent plot, although it does get a bit hard to follow or fathom for about the last half of the second act. Then it all sort of comes together and the plot starts to make sense, even if it doesn't quite really make sense. I won't spoil it but... the rise of the ultimate antagonist doesn't really work for me. It is a better character arc, but the 0-100 is a little bit of a stretch. They should have written the beginning arc better. Then end is fine.There are a few things that become obvious if you are like me and notice ""callback bait"" but it paid off in a great way for me. I knew it was coming and still loved it.The top cast is all good, and it is obvious they had fun making this. I'll watch a sequel or three.Again- if you are a devotee of the Spencer canon you have to leave that behind. It doesn't fit in (aside from character names and the city of Boston) and it in no way tracks with the he Parker/Atkins book on which is it ostensibly based.But it's a fun show that is a decent way to spend a Saturday night.Only spoiler- not safe for those who are profanity averse.",Spenser Confidential

Parker. I cannot believe his family allowed this movie to be released. There are so many discrepancies from the books. Just to name a few: Spenser never was in prison; He was raised by his father and uncles and not his mother; His love interest is an intelligent professional woman rather than the ditzy blond in this movie; Hawk is a slick professional assassin who drives a Jaguar and dresses in style; Pearl the wonder dog is a German short haired pointer rather than a fat old beagle. Also, the movie plot bears little resemblance to the Ace Atkins novel on which it is based. The ending gives the impression that it is a pilot for a series.and I hope that is not the case.

Spenser is a convict? That's not Pearl... etc. Then I started to think of it as a younger Spenser that we haven't really met yet. After that I had a blast, as except for some changes the movie views almost exactly as the books read.I have no problem with Wahlberg as Spenser, he's tough but he gets knocked down just like anyone. The character has always been kind of ridiculous and macho, that's the fun of it. But he's not %100 serious until you want him to be. I worry that someone new to the series would see just another white male stoic action movie hero, but I felt the history of the character in the writing and performance.Winston Duke as Hawk is good as a toned down version of our favorite co-badass. Henry and the new character Cissy are amusing and believable.
There are many dogs... in the film.The books often got bogged down by too many names, they avoided confusion pretty well in this film despite a decent number of characters only met once or twice earlier on.In short if you grew up with the books this is like a gift to you.

533,skipm624,"Not Robert B. Parker's or Ace Atkins Spenser, but a typical Wahlberg vehicle",5,18 March 2020,"Ok, here's my full take on Spenser Confidential, currently running on Netflix.It begins with a question. Why did they bother transferring the characters and general location of a Spenser novel and then, work counter to the entire Spenser story that began in 1974 with The Godwulf Manuscript. Yeah, Hawk is in the movie, but he's not even remotely the 'Hawk' we've all come to like and appreciate. Alan Arkin plays a credible and enjoyable Henry Cimoli, gym-owner and boxing trainer. But there's no Susan. No Quirk or Belsen. And no Zebulon Sixkill, an apprentice of Spenser that author Robert B. Parker introduced to the series a year or two before he died.They could have made this film and called it anything they wanted. Wahlberg's character could have been called John Smith and Hawk could have been a character named after any animal - Wolf, Python, whatever.The book is loosely based on a novel by Ace Atkins, entitled Wonderland, written two years after Robert B. Parker died in 2010. Atkins was chosen by the Parker family from a list of potential candidates to continue the Spenser legacy and he was a good choice. I was initially suspicious of almost anyone who would try to continue that series, but Atkins, to this day, has done a credible job of it. He's paid homage to the work of Parker and stayed true to almost every aspect of the original series. Wonderland was his second Spenser novel. He's gone on to write six more, the most recent of which was Angel Eyes, published last year.The transfer of any written work to the screen (or stage, for that matter) is often fraught with a variety of issues and in only rare cases, does the result satisfy fans of the written work. A fan of any written work will usually enter a theater shouldering a fair amount of skepticism regarding what they're about to watch and for the most part, it'll be justified, because such a transfer is almost always difficult, no matter how much of an effort the adaptation makes to stay true to its source.Independent of its source, Spenser Confidential is not too bad. It's kind of fun, moves right along toward its climax and in general, is fairly entertaining. But it should not have been tied to Robert B. Parker's or Ace Atkins' Spenser. I suspect that in agreement with either or possibly both the Parker estate and Atkins, the producers and screenwriters Sean O'Keefe and Brian Helgeland (who won the 1998 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for L.A. Confidential and was nominated in 2004 for adapting Dennis Lehane's novel, Mystic River) couldn't just the steal the plot and call it something else with different characters. So we Spenser fans get our hopes up, only to have them dashed with this Mark Wahlberg vehicle.Really, though, it's hard to gripe about such a thing, because it happens all the time and truth be told, producers can't tailor their approach to a film based on what is likely to be a miniscule percentage of a potential audience; in this case, the number of people who've ever read a Spenser novel or really care whether a movie stays true to that source.Addressing that miniscule percentage of folks who have read and deeply appreciate Spenser, you might want to know going in that Spenser Confidential's Spenser (Wahlberg) is nowhere even near as sophisticated or witty as the original. Wahlberg's just a standard, Hollywood off-the-shelf tough guy. The film's Hawk is nowhere near as menacing as the original (or TV's Spenser for Hire Hawk, played by Avery Brooks). In fact, of all of the character transfers, this one is the worst. This movie Hawk (portrayed by Winston Duke) seems almost dumb. He's like a sledgehammer that needs to be wielded by someone in order to be effective.I did like Alan Arkin's Henry, even though he didn't really match up with my expectations of that character. I don't think (not sure) that this character ever played a role in any of the other Spenser adaptations; TV's Spenser for Hire with Robert Urich (in which I played an 'extra' once) or the later three-movie TV series with Joe Mantegna as Spenser (barely remember that series). As originally written by Atkins, the plot (of Wonderland) centers on Henry, who lives in a condo on Revere Beach, home of the original Wonderland (amusement park from 1906-1911 and dog track from 1935-2009). A developer, looking to put up a casino is being a bit heavy-handed about throwing Henry out of that condo and he calls on Spenser to help him, who, with the assistance of the aforementioned Zebulon Sixkill, does so.This is not the plot of Spenser Confidential, although it does utilize the basics of the potential Wonderland casino and the corrupt influences at work to make that happen. I'd have to watch it again (and I probably won't) to remember whether they actually mentioned the name of the town where the casino is being developed (Revere Beach, which just so happens to be my first experience of the ocean), but I don't think they did. And as noted, no Zebulon Sixkill.Worth seeing? Sure. Competently constructed and paced with expected solid performances by Wahlberg, Arkin and as a Spenser girlfriend named Cissy Davis, Iliza Shlesinger, who brings that now-iconic Boston accent to the front every time she's on screen with some well-written snappy monologue.They've purposefully left the door open for a sequel to this. Spenser, basking in the glow of his success in this movie is watching a TV report about somebody who's been arrested and on-camera is screaming his innocence. Henry, Hawk and the girlfriend are all hollering, ""No! No"" Don't do it"" at him, but we can tell that Spenser's already in ""get it done"" mode. I'd watch the sequel in the perhaps vain hope that someone (screenwriters, producers, possibly Wahlberg) would try to get a little closer to the source material.",Spenser Confidential

Spenser is portrayed as a shrimpy little dude who can hardly fight, constantly getting beat up. Hawk is a big hulking giant. Henry should be a feisty ex-boker. And Pearl isn't even the right breed.

The only connection this movie has to those books is the names. Spenser is not a literate, wise-cracking ex-cop private investigator -- he's now an ex-cop ex-felon (which would prevent him from getting a PI license). Hawk is not a handsome, stylish thug with connections to organized crime -- he's just a kid who wants to be a boxer. And I can't imagine the REAL Spenser (the one created by Parker) would ever have spent five minutes with a foul-mouthed blond who truly doesn't come close to the classy, educated Susan. If you are looking for yet another action/comedy with forgettable characters, this is your movie. I'll think I'll go re-read one of Parker's books -- much more interesting.",Spenser Confidential

Everybody did a great job in this movie! Peter Berg also did a Cameo in this movie. As the news reporter over the radio. I wish that he was actually in the movie that would be sweet. Peter-Berg knows how to direct action! And Mark Wahlberg is a great action star! lliza Shlesinger definitely was one of the biggest highlights of this movie and I Always love seeing Alan Arkin in any movie. I really enjoyed Mark Wahlberg and Winston is duke chemistry in the film! They were definitely Boston's Batman and Robin like they say in the movie LOL Also Bokem Woodbine Reunites with Mark Wahlberg they were in one of my favorite movies ""The Big Hit"" that film is very underrated.

564,jim-162-93871,For those who can't understand the negative reviews,2,25 March 2020,"This is not a terrible movie. But it's an unforgivably terrible Spenser movie.If you want to make a generic 90s buddy action movie, go ahead. I'll watch and enjoy along with the rest of them. But don't call it a Spenser movie unless you plan to make a Spenser movie.These aren't some shoddily drawn characters from an 80s TV show that you can recycle like the big screen versions of popcorn fare like The A Team, Dukes of Hazzard, CHiPs or Baywatch. These are characters with distinct lives, back stories, and ways of talking and acting that millions of readers are intimately familiar with through 45 years worth of novels.Wahlberg and Duke are fine, but they bear no relation to Spenser and Hawk. The end credits claim this was based on the novel ""Wonderland"", but the fact that it has an old dog track called Wonderland in it is not enough to make that claim. This plot has no connection to the novel at all.The fact that Spenser starts out as a felon means, as one character helpfully points out, he can't get a P.I. license in Boston. That's literally the entire character - that's who he is! Spenser gives his reason for taking on this case as something do with the widow reminding him of his mother. But Spenser never even knew his mother!One of the writers on this is Brian Helgeland, who is a perfectly good screenwriter - he wrote LA Confidential (is that the reason for the title of this one? What the hell does Spenser Confidential even mean? I'm none the wiser after seeing it). However, Helgeland clearly isn't a Spenser fan. I would question whether he's even read one of the novels.And THAT is why, for the people who don't get it, this perfectly fine, run of the mill generic action comedy is getting some low ratings. It's not because people are expecting an Oscar worthy film. It's because people expect an incredibly popular and well loved franchise might be treated with the tiniest bit of respect.",Spenser Confidential

Enjoyable as usual.,5,6 March 2020,"Frankly a bizarre piece, what with janky dialogue, goofy plot holes and wince-worthy melodrama throughout.I was drawn to it for the same reason I imagine many others will be - Mark Wahlberg punching people, with Post Malone thrown in to add some up-to-the-minute intrigue. I'm in. The trouble is, Spenser Confidential can't decide what it wants to be. Is it a weak black comedy, a caper-filled crime thriller or a stylised gun-toting action flick? All of the above are thinly mixed together to form a clunky, mis-matched soup of confusion and uneven flow.The upside to all of this is that this movie is gloriously dumb. Watching it doesn't require actual use of one's brain; it's harmless fun, with some very well executed fight work to its credit.More of a personal gripe but it did miss a massive trick by not being 'Boston' enough.

There is NOTHING here beyond the names Spenser, Hawk, and Henry Cimoli. Henry comes closest to matching his bio but Spenser and Hawk? Not even remotely like the originals. So many other regular characters, like Belson and Lt. Quirk, are never even mentioned.

572,tmalatesta-05325,Thelma and Louise Confidential,2,29 November 2020,"Would have rated it a 5-star average Wahlberg movie, neither good nor bad really.But ""Spenser"" and ""Hawk"" have a rich and complex history spanning almost 50 years and 40 novels by the original author Robert B. Parker with an additional 9 novels carrying the characters forward written after Parker's death by Ace Atkins and Helen Brann. (Not to mention a TV series and movies which do actually attempt to bring the characters of the novels to screen).I don't know why this movie even bothered trying to tie in to this legacy, as the characters of Spenser and Hawk in this film carry zero of that history and zero resemblence to the characters whose names they hijacked for this film, aside from Spenser being an ex Boston cop. Rather than asking Walberg to make an honest attempt at bringing the character of Spenser to life for a new generation, they simply turned ""Spenser"" into another Wahlberb character, and a rather generic and pedestrian one at that.Might as well have called this movie, ""Sherlock Holmes: Confidential"" and just changed their names in the movie to Sherlock and Watson.

576,inboilsgang,"In the End, More of the Same",4,23 March 2020,"Anyone who's read the Robert B. Parker novels about the lovably honorable private investigator, Spenser (with an ""s""), will likely suffer irreversible dismay within the first few seconds of ""Spenser Confidential,"" Netflix's shameless misappropriation of the private eye's namesake. That's because the latter bears no resemblance to the former.First off, Parker's Spenser (with an ""s,"" in case you've forgotten), a former California state trooper turned private investigator, never went to prison. He also never wandered the streets of Boston without any means of gainful employment, which Wahlberg's character seems to have no trouble in doing. Moreover, Spenser in Netflix world is a crass, knuckle-dragging buffoon, in stark contrast to the Spenser in Parker world, who is cerebral, mild-mannered, honorable. The decision to diverge so completely and unequivocally from the seminal character is both baffling and exasperating. But in all fairness, it is a movie, and unless you're willing to overlook such trivialities, you'll likely never fully appreciate the rest of the film's abject absurdity.The story opens with Wahlberg recounting in his customary leaden monotone the events that have resulted in his five-year incarceration-a spontaneous beat down of his former boss, Captain Boylan (Michael Gaston), an abusive, corrupt cop who has finally gotten on our antihero's last evanescent nerve. We then cut to a bespectacled Spenser, clearly wiser for his suffering, sitting in prison, surrounded by fellow ne'er-do-wells whose intentions are as hard to read as the permanent scowls on their faces. A predictable confrontation erupts-because, as we all know, no one likes cops, even bad ones, in prison-leaving Spenser, bloodied and sporting a shank in the kidney, none the worse for the wear (must be the sun salutations he's been doing in his cell each morning).Upon his release, he's harried by cops who clearly have difficulty scaling the Big Blue Wall, and decides his best option is to leave Boston altogether and move to Arizona, where his plans include driving a big rig and contemplating sunsets. But before that can happen-insert totally unexpected plot complication-Spenser becomes embroiled in the sudden murders of his old boss and a young officer working in some vague capacity as an informant for the FBI. The plot thickens like molasses.
Having recently been released from prison for assaulting his superior and subsequently threatened by the entire Boston police department, Spenser naturally decides to put his ambitions to become a truck driver on hold and remain in the city where virtually everyone hates his guts. He recruits his
former boxing coach, Henry, played by veteran actor Alan Arkin, along with an up-and-coming fighter named Hawk, portrayed with suitable reserve by relative newcomer Winston Duke as a character whose reluctance to get involved in a serious police matter represents the sole instance of common sense in the entire film (spoiler: it doesn't last). On the periphery, though never out of view, is ex-girlfriend Cissy (played with exuberant abandon by IIiza Schlesinger), an acerbic-tongued bombshell whose life as the long-suffering girl of a guy who can't control his temper has been derailed. Exactly what that life is is anyone's guess, though it appears to involve lots of dogs.
Her anger at Spenser is manifest, evinced by an incessant string of insults and a quick romp in the men's room. Perhaps the writers (Sean O'Keefe and Brian Helgeland) are trying to tell us something profound here about the nature of forgiveness, or horniness, or some such nonsense, or, more likely, simply straddling us with yet another limpid scene in the time-honored tradition of Hollywood gratuitous . Either way, it's hardly enough to rescue this disaster of a film from its own folly.What ensues is a farcical dramedy in the tradition of such memorable gems as ""Bad Boys,"" ""Starsky and Hutch,"" ""Tango and Cash,"" and ""The Other Guys,"" another Wahlberg buddy film. The movie's premise, and, we must assume, its raison d'etre, rests on a highly convoluted, plodding plot involving drug traffickers, mobsters, and of course dirty cops, all looking to get their honest share of the profits from a new casino set to be installed at an old, abandoned dog track known as Wonderland (the title of the Spenser novel by Ace Atkins). The obvious culpability of Spenser's former partner, Driscoll (played by Bokeem Woodbine), is one of the film's more subtle attributes, though one can hardly fault screenwriters O'Keefe (Lair, Pursuit Force) and Helgeland (Man on Fire, 42, L.A. Confidential) for including a stereotypical villain in an otherwise stereotypical film. As for Wahlberg, whose acting chops are on prominent display in such worthy films as ""The Fighter,"" ""Invincible,"" and ""Boogie Nights,"" his rote performance here is what we have come to expect from a seemingly overweening infatuation with silly, mindless entertainment: emotionless dialogue, shirtless posturing, and clumsily executed stunts. One wonders if this reflects Wahlberg's own aesthetic tastes or a dismal lack of quality scripts. Perhaps both.Despite an experienced and capable ensemble of cast and crew, ""Spenser Confidential"" ultimately fails as even a marginally entertaining brand of pure escapism. It does, however, remind us of a nearly universal truth: books are typically better than the movies they inspire, however obliquely. As a book lover myself, might I suggest you skip this hackneyed tale and visit your local library instead and check out a few of Robert Parker's novels. They're well worth the trip and, if nothing else, will spare you 111 minutes of wondering why you're still watching a movie as pointless as this one.",Spenser Confidential

578,dariuschurchman,Wow this sucked,3,7 March 2020,Really the jokes and dialogue were bad. Editing made the acting look even worse.,Spenser Confidential
579,pricechristinek,Mehhh,4,22 March 2020,"Another typical action movie that follows the standard predictable plot points and brings nothing new to the table. I don't expect them to rewrite the formula, but the least I want is to not be bored. Not a single laugh or likable character either.",Spenser Confidential
580,cordog-42902,This Movie,2,1 August 2020,Let's see... The best thing about this movie is that Post Moron got beat up. The worst part about this movie is that Post Moron didn't get beat up for the entirety of this almost 2 hour waste of time turdshow.,Spenser Confidential
581,williamrudacille,Ok for what they were going for.,6,9 March 2020,"This was about what you'd expect from a Warburg movie. Characters were ok for the most part save 1. Iliza Shlesinger was absolutely horrible. Shy anyone would even think this person belongs in Hollywood is beyond me. I almost turned this movie off because of her. Her sex scene in the bathroom sounded like it was from a porn movie. Too bad she can't act that good nor does she even look that good.Outside of that, movie wasn't too bad even though you knew exactly were it was going.",Spenser Confidential
582,jgjanik,Good Movie,8,8 March 2020,"This was an overall good movie. The bad part about this movie is that there wasn't more scenes of Winston Duke beating the s&!t out of dirtbags. I would like to see more of that I could watch him do that all day. I don't think there is a Mark Wahlberg movie I don't like, very talented smarta$$ actor, real fun to watch and whoever paired him with Alan Arkin is a genius. Keep doing that!",Spenser Confidential
583,cas-74158,A great beginning,10,15 May 2020,"Really enjoyed this new version of Spenser, by Mark Wahlberg. I hope they decide to make a whole series of films regarding Spenser. Interesting note Wahlberg and Bokeen Woodbine we're both in the film ""The Big Hit"", the film also included Avery Brooks, who plated the character ""Hawk"" in the tv series ""Spenser: For Hire"" & the spin-off ""A Man Called Hawk"", would have been interesting if either Avery Brooks, and / or Lou Diamond Phillips also had parts in this film update of the Spenser character.",Spenser Confidential
584,mmccullough-70598,"Good old fashion good cop, bad cop movie",8,24 March 2020,"First of all let me just start with Mark Wahlberg is in it. Enough said. It's a good movie, lots of action and entertainment. Glad I didn't listen to the 6.2 star review. This is a solid 8 movie.",Spenser Confidential
585,natashacameron-08558,Character Dynamics and Fighting the System,8,11 April 2020,Watched this from beginning to end without having to move an inch. Transfixed and pleasantly surprised with the two main characters and their relationship. This is ultimately a feel good movie that attempts to bring down a corrupt system.,Spenser Confidential
586,briantfc-87025,Such a dissapointment,2,7 March 2020,"So bad its embarrassing . Corny , lightweight story ( seen it before ) forget it .",Spenser Confidential
587,joshmarper-98504,Not Bad,7,11 March 2020,"A pretty good watch, good amount of comedy and action!",Spenser Confidential
588,alexamurphy,I can't wait to forget this movie,1,19 December 2020,"Everything about this movie was predictable. Zero originality, zero plot twist, zero excitement.Storyline was simply there as a build up for another lame fight scene. Character development is nonexistent. The whole presumes/ purpose is quickly grazed over so they can get to the ""action""I'm not someone who is usually bothered by poorly made movies, but I hated this so much. Truly a horrible/ sorry excuse for a movie.",Spenser Confidential
589,outnow-42435,Very entertaining Spencer movie,10,20 December 2020,I found this movie entertaining. I look forward to a sequel or a tv series with the same actors.,Spenser Confidential
590,crazyloud,Intensely underwhelming,3,12 March 2020,"To be honest, this movie felt like a prolonged episode of a bad tv cop procedural. And that ending was absolutely cringeworthy.",Spenser Confidential
591,heulnicht,I liked it,6,6 March 2020,"Typical Mark Wahlberg flick with likeable actors. Nothing new, still entertaining. I don't get why some people have to analyse this kind of movies to death just because it's not Oscar material.",Spenser Confidential
592,rer-99756,Great film,10,18 April 2020,I like it. Congratulations. U must watching it. Actions and policy,Spenser Confidential
593,gregmasding,Good stuff,7,29 April 2020,A good film to watch late at night or if you're looking for something fun with a good amount of action. Hope they make a sequel.,Spenser Confidential
594,jentlala,Great movie!,8,7 March 2020,I have always liked all Mark Walberg movies. But him giving Posty a part was very cool! And he did a really good job playing Squeeb,Spenser Confidential
595,dolittleduo,Why can't anyone make a Spenser movie?,1,22 March 2020,"I've been waiting for years. I'd often wondered why the Wahlbergs or Damon or Affleck hadn't taken a run at their home town hero. Then Mark steps up and in my opinion, completely ignores the vision that Robert B Parker had. Wahlberg as Spenser? Sorry, no. Winston Duke as Hawk? With a beard? Even worse, Alan Arkin as Henry? Henry is supposed to be a pint sized plug of muscle, not an old man who looks like he hasn't lifted a weight in his life. The A&E movies with Joe Mantegna as Spenser? Give me a break. I couldn't even sit through Confidential. I felt like I was disrespecting the wonderful books that I've loved for so many years. I guess I'll keep hoping.",Spenser Confidential
596,hshah-40182,Nice Ride !!,8,8 March 2020,These days OTT shows a lot of dark stuff of which most of them are masterpieces but at the end of the day you feel much loaded with stuff. This one is a pleasant roller coaster .. funny at times and good watch !! I enjoyed the movies .. good stuff,Spenser Confidential
597,wtudorin,Was expecting more,4,14 March 2020,"If in other movies I saw Mark W performing as true actor where emotions are real and the audience is captured by that, the storyline is full of suspence and unexpected turns. This movie in that regard seem a dead man flat line heart monitor. Too much forced and unnecessary swearing. Stereotype sex scenes. Action scenes totally unbelievable with little if not no body damage after kicks and punches. I could have written the rest of the movie storyline once seen 25% of the movie.",Spenser Confidential
598,sandyturner-91548,Entertaining but bad adaption of the book,5,29 March 2020,Love wahlburg as actor but is mini Spenser compared with original Urich. Haha nothing like original. Way to nice.,Spenser Confidential
599,ikawthar,for the cat Scene,1,20 February 2021,It's all good but you really deserve a one star just for the cat Scene,Spenser Confidential
600,edinark,What was this based on again?,6,14 March 2020,"I've read 33 of the 40 or so Spenser novels by Robert B Parker, and about the only similarity this movie has to the books is the names of some of the characters. Rename the characters, and I wouldn't have had a clue it was based on the novels.With that said, it was an OK movie. It was just disappointing that yet again excellent works of fiction were so warped as to be unidentifiable.I've long said that someone should make a series on the books; they have so much potential. Maybe someday.",Spenser Confidential
