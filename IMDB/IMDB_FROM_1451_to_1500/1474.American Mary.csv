0,Leofwine_draca,Cronenberg wannabe,2,15 November 2015,"American Mary is a story of surgical horror and body modification, done on a budget and starring Katharine Isabelle (of GINGER SNAPS fame). Isabelle plays a young medical student who gets drawn into the world of a murky, gangster-run nightclub in order to make ends meet, and after suffering an ordeal at the hands of a senior doctor she decides to get revenge in her own inimitable style.Unfortunately this is the kind of grotesque, sub-Cronenberg wannabe that seems to be ten a penny these days, although it in no way equals the class or professionalism of an early Cronenberg flick. Instead it's a complete bore and a mess of a film, with plotting that goes all over the place and characterisation that never really works.I loved Isabelle in the GINGER SNAPS trilogy but she feels miscast here and I would say the role was beneath her; certainly when you see her gyrating or suffering you can't help that feel she herself is being exploited somewhat as an actress. In any case, the characters are all unlikeable, and the scenes of body modification and the like are merely repulsive and repellent rather than properly horrific. American Mary is trash, made with a bare modicum of talent, and a film with no purpose other than to gross you out.",American Mary
1,SnoopyStyle,so much potential,5,14 February 2019,Medical student Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) is desperate for cash. She answers an ad at a strip club and ends up doing illegal medical work for $5k. She is pulled into a world of blackmarket body modifications. She is raped by her teacher Grant. She uses her underworld connection to seek revenge.Beatress Johnson is a great weird character. I was intrigued right away. She sets up a great ascend into a surreal slice of the world. It does do that at times but I want more. I like the twins and gimp Grant. I want less of the cheesy strip club. I want them to go to a body mod club where Mary is welcomed like a new messiah. I want extravagance. This movie is limited. There are issues with flow. It has so much potential but it can only fulfill so much.,American Mary
2,nogodnomasters,WHO WANTS TO WATCH NOTHING SHOCKING,7,5 December 2018,"Mary is a med student studying to be a surgeon. She is ready for her internship and has financial problems. She answers an ad and as one thing leads to another, she becomes an underground unlicensed surgeon for people who desire odd body modifications. There is the added horror of murder and torture.It is nice to see something new in horror. Katharine Isabelle as Mary was great, but I never connected to any of the characters, who were fairly cardboard. Indeed, I did not find myself rooting for Mary as the film is not engaging. The picture could have been done better which seemed to have ached for a Jane's Addiction soundtrack.Worth a rental, not a keeper.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity, off screen rape.",American Mary
3,kosmasp,American and bloody,8,29 October 2012,"Female directors are rare. Female horror directors even rarer. Female twin sister directors who do horror movies? Well we found one pair and the movie I had the pleasure to watch was really good. The idea as it is might not be original (especially if you follow the media, there are some cases of this beauty craze in Russia and other countries), but it does fit fine into this story.Plus we have a great female lead. You might feel that her drive is slowed down at one point mid-through the film, but that would mean you're missing the point. It's more character driven than story driven. And it works that way. Social commentary and other things included of course. Watch it if you can",American Mary
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Surprisingly good, very well acted.",8,5 February 2021,"So many times I've felt cheated by film suggestions, but American Mary, I'm glad I watched it.Mary Mason is a struggling medical student, who's happy to earn some easy money by performing underground operations. What starts off as a strange favour soon becomes something more complex.It's a fairly disturbing movie, with some pretty grim ideas, and very graphic scenes, scenes that actually look pretty good.I liked the story, it creeped me out, but best of all waa the acting, Katherine Isabelle, wow she's good.I enjoyed that. 8/10.",American Mary
5,gavin6942,An Impressive Breakthrough,7,1 September 2014,"The allure of easy money sends Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle), a medical student, into the world of underground surgeries which ends up leaving more marks on her than her so called ""freakish"" clients.Since this film's release, the Soska sisters and Katharine Isabelle have been touring the convention circuit creating plenty of buzz about this film. But it is not just the buzz -- there is plenty of substance to back this up.Isabelle is best known for playing Ginger in ""Ginger Snaps"", but her role as Mary might just make people start forgetting that. (Although ""Ginger Snaps"" remains one of the best horror films of the last few decades.) She is quite a strong character that should appeal to a wide audience.The Soskas made a mark with ""Dead Hooker in a Trunk"", but this film proves they are serious. The writing and directing are strong, with some very beautifully colored cinematography. The story does lose some steam later on, but this is far above and beyond the average film being made today.",American Mary
6,jboothmillard,American Mary,6,18 August 2019,"I had never heard of this film before it was broadcast on television, but I do like a good scary movie, and this sounded like it was going to be a very gory one. Basically, surgical student Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) lives in destitute and desperate for money. She applies for a job at a strip club, performing massages, without removing her clothing, there she meets club owner Billy Barker (Antonio Cupo). In need of a medical professional, Billy offers $5,000 to patch a man bleeding in the basement, with no questions asked. Mary accepts the money but spends the next few days terrified what criminal activities she has got involved with. Mary is approached by stripper Beatress Johnson (Tristan Risk), who works at the club, and has had extreme cosmetic surgery to resemble cartoon character Betty Boop. Beatress offers Mary a large sum of money to perform illegal surgery on a friend of hers, Ruby Realgirl (Paula Lindberg), in a veterinary clinic. Ruby wishes to be transformed into a human doll, but surgeons are unwilling to grant her requests, to remove her nipples, external genitalia, and partially stitch and close her vulva shut. Mary performs the surgery because she needs the money and is convinced Ruby's desire is genuine. Mary follows up on Ruby's website, this introduces her to the world of extreme body modification. Mary begins her residency in the surgical specialty, and her teachers and mentors praise her promising skills. Mary is invited to what she believes is a networking party with several of the head surgeons at her hospital. However, Mary has been invited on a ruse, and the surgeons commit lewd acts on the others in attendance, who are obviously escorts. Mary is drugged, choked, and raped at the party by her former teacher, Dr. Alan Grant (David Lovgren), he films the assault. None of her teachers or mentors show guilt or remorse for her attack, and Mary drops out of her residency. Mary hires Billy and enforcers from the club to kidnap Grant and bring him to her apartment, there she gets her revenge and performs involuntary surgery on him. Mary goes into consensual but illegal body modification surgery full-time, word quickly spreads, and she becomes known as ""Bloody Mary"", a surgeon of great skill, willing to perform any extreme surgery desired. She establishes herself in Billy's strip club and uses his contacts for her new business. Police Detective Dolor (John Emmet Tracy) approaches Mary about the disappearance of Dr. Grant and the collection of disturbing tapes found in his apartment. Dr. Walsh (Clay St. Thomas), who invited Mary to the party, gave Mary's name to the detective on a long list of women who might have a grudge with Dr. Grant. The doctor is actually being kept alive by Mary, she is using him as ""practice"" material for her extreme surgeries, using pictures of his modifications for her business portfolio. Mary is forced to kill a security guard who finds Dr. Grant, while Billy, who has become attached to Mary, kidnaps and beats Dr. Walsh on her behalf. Detective Dolor approaches Mary again, asking about the two missing doctors, and questioning if she was victim of abuse. The police are getting closer to the truth, with suspicion raised about the disappearance of the second doctor, and Mary's recent wealth. Mary begins to unravel, worried that the police will find that the tape of her rape will be found and following the death of her grandmother. A disgruntled spouse (Travis Watters) of Ruby Realgirl finds Mary and attacks her with a knife, the attacker is overpowered, but Mary is bleeding heavily. Mary is able to sew her wound up, but bleeds to death in her operating room, to be discovered by the police. Also starring Twan Holliday as Lance Delgreggo, Nelson Wong and the Soska twins (Sylvia and Jen, also directing) as the Demon Twins. A very attractive Isabelle gives a terrific performance as the innocent upcoming trainee medical student dragged into the dark world of sleazy underground surgeries driven by obscene revenge. I myself have seen look-away stuff like this before, in documentaries like The Body Shocking Show, some people want very freakish things done to their bodies, this film doesn't shy away from showing that, it is shocking, humorous and thought-provoking, a watchable horror. Good!",American Mary
7,Woodyanders,First-rate little shocker,9,2 July 2013,"Disillusioned and financially strapped med student Mary Mason (superbly played by Katharine Isabelle) finds a successful and profitable niche for herself in the shady and sinister underworld of extreme surgery and body modification. Writers/directors Jen and Sylvia Soska offer a fascinating depiction of a twisted, yet alluring and compelling subculture while smartly addressing such pertinent issues as society's obsession with physical appearances, compromising one's morals in order to eke out a comfortable living, and the radical, grotesque, and even depraved measures people will resort to in order to satisfy their wants, desires, and fetishes. Moreover, the Soskas maintain a dark, grim, and edgy tone throughout as well as further spice things up with a wickedly warped sense of pitch-black humor and treat the oddball members of the body modification community with admirable compassion and dignity. In addition, it's genuinely chilling to see Mary become more increasingly cold and ruthless as she descends into the abyss. Isabelle's stellar central performance holds the picture together; she receives excellent support from Antonio Cupo as sleazy and smitten nightclub owner Billy Barker, Tristan Risk as sweet and bubbly dancer Beatress Johnson, David Lovgreen as hard-nosed instructor Dr. Grant, Clay St. Thomas as the jolly Dr. Walsh, John Emmet Tracy as the pesky Detective Dolar, and Twan Holliday as hulking, yet thoughtful and sensitive brute Lance Delgrego. (The Soskas also appear as a pair of freakish twins.) Both Brian Pearson's sumptuous widescreen cinematography and Peter Allen's elegant score are up to speed. But what truly makes this movie so startling and impressive is its striking audacity and originality. Highly recommended.",American Mary
8,Tweekums,A disturbing but humorous horror with original ideas,8,18 December 2019,"Mary Mason is a promising medical student but she has trouble paying the bills. This leads her to apply for a job in a strip club; the owner is surprised when she presents her CV to him... he is also pleased as he is in need of somebody with medical skills who will work without asking questions. Shortly afterwards she is approached by Beatress, a stripper at the club who has had radical surgery to make her look like Betty Boop, she wants Mary to operate on a friend who wants radical body modification surgery; the money is good so Mary does it. Her studies continue and she takes up a residency at a local hospital, one of her mentors invites her to a party where she is drugged and raped. The results of Mary's work leads to her being approached by other people wanting body modifications... the man who raped her will be the ideal person for her to hone her skills on. Inevitably it is only a matter of time before the police start looking for him.I really enjoyed this Canadian horror film. It provided plenty of disturbing moments as of humour. It plays nicely with ones expectations as the 'weirdos' in the body modification scene come across as far less disturbing than the 'normal' characters... especially the surgeons who are far more perverse than everybody else. There are moments of violence, scenes of surgery and a scene where the rapist is dealt with that is definitely disturbing even if the character is deliberately unsympathetic. With its body horror themes and Canadian origins I'm not surprised that many reviewers compare this to the films of David Cronenberg; however the director it made me think of was Takashi Miike, the Japanese horror maestro responsible for 'Ichi the Killer' and 'Audition'. That said it doesn't feel derivative; writer/directors Jen and Sylvia Soska did a great job. Katharine Isabelle is great as Mary; her natural beauty contrasts with her modified clients but more importantly she makes it easy to believe in her character. If I have any complaints they are about the ending; I found it a bit sudden although that does mean it avoided the horror cliché of dragged out endings. Overall I'd say that the subject matter may put some people off but if you are a horror fan I'd certainly recommend this.",American Mary
9,BA_Harrison,There's something scary about Mary.,7,28 February 2013,"Katherine 'Ginger Snaps' Isabelle stars as cash-strapped medical student Mary Mason, who decides on stripping as a means of extra income (she certainly has the right qualifications for the job!). During her interview (""strip off and show us what you've got""), Mary's career takes an unexpected turn, her boss-to-be offering her an alternative way to earn big bucks: as a back-street surgeon fixing up shady characters in need of medical attention.Mary's reputation as an unscrupulous medical genius for hire soon reaches the ears of stripper Beatress Johnson, part of the on-line body modification community, who pays her $10,000 to perform an unorthodox operation on her friend Ruby. Mary's improved financial status doesn't go unnoticed by her instructor Dr. Grant (David Lovgren), who surmises that his star pupil is on the game, and that it would be perfectly OK if he got himself a freebie. Drugging and raping her at a party proves to be a bad idea, however, for Mary isn't about to take that sort of thing lying down (OK, she does take it lying down, but you know what I mean).With a little help from her strip-club owner pal Billy (Antonio Cupo), Mary exacts bloody revenge, but seems to lose most of her marbles in the process...As you can probably tell, American Mary, directed by twin sisters Jen and Sylvia Soska, is a rather preposterous tale, one that frequently borders on the ridiculous in its desire to be as demented as possible; as such it is difficult to be absolutely certain of the filmmakers' intentions. Is this supposed to be a serious, tragic body-shock horror experience in the vein of fellow Canadian auteur Cronenberg (whose film Dead Ringers gets a visual reference) or a sly parody of the genre with split tongue planted in pierced cheek?Whatever the case, American Mary is certainly a consistently entertaining experience thanks to its provocative 'body modification' subject matter, excellent in-your-face gore, and Isabelle's bold central performance.",American Mary
10,paul_haakonsen,But it could have been so much more...,5,10 June 2018,"When I stumbled upon ""American Mary"" I initially dismissed it, believing it was just another movie about another pointless urban legend like Bloody Mary. Then I saw that Katharina Isabelle was in it, and that made me actually pick up the movie and watch it.I will say that ""American Mary"" definitely had a lot of potential and it did indeed have a storyline which proved promising. However, directors and writers Jen Soska and Sylvia Soska really didn't bring out the full potential of the movie. And that missed opportunity lead to the movie being halfhearted and felt mediocre at best.There were some fairly brutal scenes in the movie and some rather disturbing things, which does of course count for something. But visceral scenes hardly does enough to lift the movie out of mediocrity.""American Mary"" had some good acting from the cast, especially Katharine Isabelle whom really carried the movie nicely.The end result that turned out to be this movie, was unfortunately just a mediocre movie. I've seen it once, and believe you me, this is not the type of movie that you return to watch a second time around.",American Mary
11,Coventry,"American Mary, Stay Away From Me!",7,14 September 2013,"In these nearly hopeless times of redundant remakes, lousy amateur nonsense, dire zombie comedies and lame found-footage flicks, ""American Mary"" definitely stands out as one of the most innovative and surprising new horror films in years. The basic plot concept leans closer towards the classic genre movies from the 50's and 60's, featuring mad scientists and deranged surgeons, than towards the nowadays booming trend of torture-porn flicks, but the twisted eccentric characters and sickening gore effects are very much 2013. Mary Mason, a med student of Hungarian descent, most certainly has the intellect, ambition and talent to realize her dream and become a successful surgeon, but unfortunately she struggles financially and applies for a job in a striptease club. Instead of taking off her clothes, the dubious owner Billy urgently needs her to perform an illegal underground operation in the club's basement. Her surgical talents are noticed by uncanny Betty Boop obsessed stripper Beatress and, through offering a lot of cash money, she enrolls Mary into the freakish and deranged world of ""body modification"". Because of meeting all these crazy characters, and facing a personal disillusion regarding her medical education, Mary herself also increasingly grows dangerous and insane. As said already, the main trump of ""American Mary"" is the originality and the overall shock-effect. Finally we have a new horror movie that is genuinely unethical, effectively satirical and downright revolting. The Soska twin sisters, Jen and Sylvia, take a deep dive into the bloody underbelly of illegal surgery and the result is a freshly inventive, flamboyant and uniquely twisted film. The twins both appear briefly in the film, as patients with an awkward physical desire, and they look as creepy and bizarre as the scenario they penned down. The gorgeous, sexy and charismatic Katharine Isabelle (forever a horror muse since the ""Ginger Snaps"" trilogy) is terrific in the titular role and many of the relatively unknown supportive players deliver good performances as well. My only main complaint is that the plot takes a couple of abrupt and illogical twists and turns near the climax.",American Mary
12,hitchcockthelegend,Caustic Cuttings.,8,1 March 2015,"Some horror fans love it, others not so much, which where horror film fans are concerned comes as absolutely no surprise. So roll the dice and take your chance here then!American Mary is written and directed by Jen and Sylvia Soska. Katharine Isabelle (looking uncannily like Mary Elizabeth Winstead) stars as the titular Mary of the title. She's a medical student who during a cash crisis is lured to the underground world of surgeries not deemed as the norm in medical school circles...Hoo-hah! Get ready for sexual deviance, dismemberment, human splicing and a whole host of other things that are brilliantly caked in a caustic satirical sauce by the Soska girls. Imagery is strong, the aftertaste lasting as you enter at your own peril a world of repugnant beings masquerading as humans, of fetishists pushing the boundaries, it's noirville but not as we know it Jim. But always there's a pierced and bloody tongue prodding the cheek, even if the odd period of time spent in bizarro world fails to add up.Wonderful. Go Mary! Go Soska Girls! Just don't call on me any time soon, huh... 8/10",American Mary
13,Hey_Sweden,"""You're gonna make a great slasher.""",6,17 October 2014,"Modern imitation of some of David Cronenbergs' filmography is nonetheless interesting and watchable on its own terms. It's really more of a drama than a horror film, with touches of gore and dark comedy, and is slow paced enough that it may have some viewers fumbling for their remotes. It plunges the audience into a world of sordid and off putting characters in a tale of sex and fetishism. Ultimately, it works its way towards a somewhat conventional finish, but getting there is still an amusing enough experience.The lovely Katharine Isabelle, best known for her role as Ginger in the ""Ginger Snaps"" series, stars as Mary, a promising med student in desperate need of cash. So she accepts the offer from nightclub owner Billy (Antonio Cupo) to patch up a mangled associate of his. This leads to offers from other people, people who are into radical body modification, to perform a variety of ""underground surgery"". As Mary is immersed in this world more and more, it really takes a toll on her well-being.If it weren't for Ms. Isabelle, who looks extremely sexy in a variety of outfits, this would have been a little harder to get through. She delivers an engaging lead performance, and is believable throughout Mary's personality arc. It is fun to see Mary take her new business so seriously that she dismisses one potential patient who's willing to settle for something as mundane as piercings. And we do get to see a number of individuals who've had some pretty nasty things done to themselves.Some people may want to note that at least the gore in this movie is serving the story and never *becoming* the whole reason for its existence. The effects are generally well done.Sibling directors Jen and Sylvia Soska (who also cameo in ""American Mary"" as the German twins) do have some potential, so it will be intriguing to watch the progress of their careers.Six out of 10.",American Mary
14,morrison-dylan-fan,Nip/Tuck.,7,8 November 2019,"Hopefully attending a film festival soon where a remake of Rabid will be screened, followed by a Q&A with the film makers,I felt it was best I check the other credits of the Soska sisters. Becoming aware of the film years ago after reading a review in Empire magazine by Kim Newman praising the title,I was intrigued to learn it had been made by the Soska's,which led to me meeting Mary.View on the film:Filmed in 15 days and supported by their parents re-mortgaging their home to fund the project, co-writers/co-director Jen and Sylvia Soska closely work with cinematographer Brian Pearson in avoiding the lashings of gore usually found in ""Mad Scientist""/ ""Mad Doctor"" movies, by instead slicing into a clinical Body Horror atmosphere, where the limited sets are lit with a stylish neon glow over Mary's operations.Whilst the Soska sisters do drill into welcomed gory body modifications, they keep the tone of the film distinctly respectful, rather than repulsed, with real life members of the body modification community playing Mary's patients, whose requests are clearly shown as being treated with utmost professionalism by Mary.Keeping everyone else in the film in the background, the screenplay by the Soska's dissect a low-key indie character study of struggling student Mary. Although they make Mary's progression to being completely at ease over doing operations move a little too fast, the Soska's sow over this with a real care in drawing Mary going from a struggling, nervous outsider, to a completely at ease with herself confidence.Bringing revenge into the room with a rape on Mary, the Soska's display a excellent thoughtfulness in staying away from the Grindhouse slime of Rape/Revenge, by keeping the script and camera solely focused on Mary's face during the horrific attack, with the Soska's taking a step back when raising Mary's head as she maps out a operation of revenge.Appearing in every scene, Katharine Isabelle gives a excellent turn as Mary, thanks to Isabelle balancing her sexy leather-clad covered in blood Scream Queen image with a growing care Mary has on the professionalism of her operations, for all those who make a booking for American Mary.",American Mary
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Disappointing and only somewhat successful,4,15 October 2016,"Desperate to make ends meet, a promising surgeon ends up taking a one-off job as an extreme body-modifier only to find that her skills and success in the field draws her into the world even further and become increasingly concerned about leaving with her sanity.This here was quite the disappointing and rather troubling effort. One of the main problems here is the rather overt and extremely clumsy manner in which this one goes about integrating her into the cosmetics field here, which is one of the central parts of the film as a whole. The way of which she gets put into the society, initially as a freak occurrence at a job interview that requires her to take the offer for an extreme cosmetic offer at the last second, which by itself is quite a coincidence that is purposefully built into this one for no real reason other than giving her something to get her into the world required here only that's incredibly clunky and ham-fisted by tying it more into the strip club than the medical school. On the whole this is a facet that makes more sense than how it plays out here as that's quite a clumsy read which brings about quite a bit more useless moments here detailing her in the club than it really should knowing how this one really plays out. Moreover, that makes for quite a lot more bland and overall unneeded moments here where we follow her around and generally aren't that impressed with what happens as it's a series of scenes with her simply brooding over what she's done and turning herself into, and all of this is so flimsy and shallow that it really makes her gradual turn into a serial killer and butcher seem all the weaker due to how over-the-top silly it all appears. This one really could've made the build-up into that section of the film quite a bit more appealing since the character-study aspect of her turning away from her schooling to a more lucrative and appreciative society would've turned this one around considerably as the gradual turn into becoming a body modifier becomes coherent and realistic rather than just simply to get off on showing all the crazy procedures dreamed up to disfigure the human body which is what this one really feels like. That aspect is well-handled with plenty of rather gruesome and somewhat intriguing displays of her work as she goes along and starts gaining notoriety, being able to showcase the work she does rather well with plenty of graphic images about the different surgeries and what's going on with her descent into madness as that becomes part of what's going on giving it rather bloody and disturbing which marks the film's best parts. Still, it's quite sizeable flaws really bring this one down.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, a Rape scene and drug use.",American Mary
16,FlashCallahan,Boop Boop de doop......,5,23 February 2013,"Mary becomes increasingly poor, and disenchanted with the surgical world she once admired. The allure of easy money sends Mary into the world of underground surgeries which ends up leaving more marks on her......... than on her so called freakish clients......The Soska twins/sisters/whatever, try and give us a movie that will shock and make us think, but look underneath all the freakish abnormalities and the parlour tricks, it's basically another 'all men are b***ards' and girl power is forever.And this is why the movie fails on many levels. Its not the casts fault, Isabelle is a wonderful screen presence, and next to Danielle Harris, she is the second best female working in horror today.It all has a retro punk nineties feel to it, almost like Hardware or even The Crow, and this gives the film a little seedy feel to it. It's a gory film, and the men are portrayed as pigs with no brains, but the most disturbing thing I found to be was the Betty Boop faced 'associate', and this was a work of genius, probably the best factor of the film.If you have just finished with your boyfriend, and hate men at the moment, you will probably love this, if not, it's nothing really new, apart from some good make up and a great performance from Isabelle.A little offensive, not all males are pigs..",American Mary

18,trashgang,ginger snaps again,7,4 February 2013,"Have you really seen my summary. Well, then you will get the link I guess. Katharine Isabelle (Mary) does deliver again an excellent performance. She looks believable, she delivers the creeps and she sometimes really looks sexy although she never undress but is walking around as a beauty queen and has one strip performance and again doesn't reveal anything but some will need their Kleenex. I was a bit afraid to go watch it because it's directed by the Soska sisters and I wasn't positive about their first attempt Dead Hooker in a Trunk (2009). But what an improvement they made here. Excellent edited and directed with a good score. But that doesn't always make a good movie. There will be people who will hate it again because it's very slow and very into the character of Mary. Oh yes, she does nasty things but the horror isn't the main thing here. It's Mary you will follow. A girl not popular and not having a boy friend who needs the money. By accident she's been contacted by a weird looking girl Beatress Johnson (Tristan Risk) to help a friend to remove her nipples and stitches up her vagina. From there on her life becomes a mess after being raped by her teacher. She makes friends in the strip bar and underworld and is out to hunt and disfigure people (who wants it and does who are tortured).You will indeed see some weird people towards this flick, people with scarification of all kind. Split tongues, you name it, you will see it. The red stuff do flows a few times but it's really Katharine who makes this flick what it became. I could watch it as for what it is but it's typical Soska style and still not for everybody. Some did mention Freaks (1932), to some point yes, their area weirdos to spot, some did mention Human Centipede (2009), that I wont agree, in some parts yes, the transforming of bodies. What it does show is that girls can gave weird things going on too. And for the Soska's , they are twisted sisters. Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",American Mary
19,christopher-underwood,fantastic central performance,9,3 December 2013,"Its clear that I think more of this film than many others but maybe that's because I always rate a film according to how much I have enjoyed the experience. Nobody should look at my ratings to access whether I think the film well made in the normally accepted sense. Basically, if a film works then I don't care about the finer details of technique, I'm too absorbed by the content. I thought this was great and was most surprised how stylish, bold, thoughtful, amusing and flinch inducing it really was. Helped enormously by a fantastic central performance from Katherine Isabelle this explores the weird world of body modification and is a most impressive achievement from the Soska sisters. It is true to say that this drops a stitch or two towards the end and it is for that I don't give this the full star award it maybe deserves. Because of the Canadian origins I have seen Cronenberg's name mentioned and perhaps with all the surgical instruments and the modification business this would appear appropriate but I must disagree and suggest that this never looks the least like one of his movies. What I couldn't help thinking when I had a chance to pause for breath was Japanese cinema and its tendency towards the cold, the clinical and the ability to go where others may not. This reminded me more, in looks and tone, of the mighty Miike's, 'Audition'. Sensational.",American Mary
20,Red-Barracuda,The female of the species is deadlier than the male...,7,12 January 2013,Even at this early stage this interesting feature from Canada has the look of a future cult movie. It's decidedly left-field in subject matter. In it a female medical student with financial troubles turns to the shady world of underground surgeries. Before long she is carrying out more and more outlandish procedures. Pleasingly this one is directed by women. It's ridiculous in this day and age how rare it remains for women to be given the director's reigns. This film shows that the female vision can be very twisted and macabre indeed. The directors are identical twins Jen and Sylvia Soska who appear in a cameo as Eastern European sisters who crave bizarre body modifications. Their direction is very stylised but with grit where necessary. I'm not usually queasy when it comes to movies but I can honestly say that one surgical scene left me looking away. The third female presence is star Katherine Isabelle of Ginger Snaps fame. She is very good in a dark and sexy performance. She is a great anti-heroine and her revenge moment on a man who attacked her is one that had me inwardly cheering.Seeing as this is a Canadian horror film perhaps a comparison with David Cronenberg is inevitable. But in this instance it's a fairly relevant one as in many ways this is another example of the body horror sub-genre. It's a film that combines contemporary sadistic horror with a view of an unusual subculture of people who modify their bodies through surgery. It isn't a very story driven film to be fair and it sometimes lacks a bit of overall dynamism but this is only a relatively minor observation and it is pleasingly original for the most part. Overall the feature could perhaps best be described as what would happen if Clive Barker was to direct a film that combined elements of Hard Candy and Audition.,American Mary
21,bowmanblue,There's something twisted about Mary,7,3 December 2014,"I'm not sure how best to describe 'American Mary.' The easy option would be to call it a 'horror,' but that doesn't seem to do it justice on its own. It's more of a dark, horrific drama, charting a young medical student's disillusionment with her studies and pursuing the 'easy option' instead. This takes her into the path of some particularly weird and unscrupulous people.I read online someone describing the film as having a great beginning and middle, but lacking in the end. I'd tend to agree with that. The ending does seem a little sudden, like the film-makers kind of didn't know how best to end it in a way that would appeal to everyone. Your view of the ending will depend largely on how you view the characters.And the characters all play their parts well. Special kudos to Katherine Isabelle, who plays the title role. The film depends on making her role work and I think she succeeds.I don't know who I'd recommend this film to: it's one part 'torture porn,' one part horror, one part revenge movie and some general bloodthirstyness thrown into the mix. I suppose if you dabble in any of those sorts of genres, you should get something out of it. For some reason, I found the overall feel and 'story structure' most similar to the similarly titled American Psycho.",American Mary
22,A_Different_Drummer,"Under-rated, unappreciated",8,9 November 2014,"Canadian actress Katharine Isabelle popped onto the scene in Ginger Snaps, one of the most original and memorable films ever to emerge from a country that specializes in tired sequels and technically perfect but massively dull x-mas special and lifestyle movies.(Typically, they tried two sequels to Ginger, each worse than the other.) Mainstream should have snapped her up, she has both looks and talent, but this guilty pleasure from the Soska sisters, which branded it as a cult film from the moment they put film in the camera, nonetheless gets a great and memorable performance from Isabelle.She deftly plays against type, but being coy in a part which shows her visually to be stunning and characteristically to be a killer.

Her clients are freaks who, for a variety of reasons, want to modify their bodies. While doing these procedures, she gradually alienates herself from her ""normal"" life and delves deeper into the morbid world of body modification.This Canadian indie horror was written and directed by Soska twins, who also appear in the movie. In a sea of bloody ridiculousness that prevails in the world of horror, this is a real refreshment that rightly can be considered a horror. In style and atmosphere, it is somewhat reminiscent of Barker, and as a dedication to this giant of the genre, one of the characters bears his last name.8/10",American Mary

Lower rating because DVD lacked menu items such as chapters, special features, and most importantly subtitles which made dialogue difficult to fully appreciate especially w/so many enunciations, poor & other wise. Body modification was one theme & actual modified personages were shown, but there are more extreme that could have been shown. Fairly good acting, and creative script.",American Mary
25,sol-,Body Horror,7,26 August 2017,"Strapped for cash, a medical student finds a lucrative career in performing elective surgeries on the black market in this highly unusual Canadian film. As the title character gains an underground reputation, she begins to perform more and more controversial procedures, including split tongues, offbeat piercings, horns and genital mutilation at the request at her diverse clientele who take pleasure in transforming their bodies in a Clive Barker or David Cronenberg sense. Katharine Isabelle is excellent in the lead role as she gradually goes from disliking the job to fully embracing it. The film is, however, compromised by a subplot in which she kidnaps and ever-so-slowly mutilates a date rapist. This leads to a bunch of dry, formulaic moments in which she has to contend with nosy detectives, whereas the juice of the film lies in the fetishes of her clientele. The film also spends little time on the pleasure versus pain debate that made Barker's original 'Hellraiser' so fascinating. And yet, there remains a lot to like in the film's insight into untold pleasures and the championing of individual expression through altering one's body. Quite acutely, Isabelle also seems to get more and more mentally unhinged with each repeated surgery, which pokes into some interesting questions as to just how much one can distort a human body without starting to feel a little distorted oneself.",American Mary

My main point of critic is that for my taste the execution of American Mary is a little too tame, the level of gore could be higher for that kind of movie - the story screams for it ;) Final words: what you get is a solid piece good enough to spice up some leisure time with dark fun and humor.",American Mary

The sadism is pretty stomach turning, and the film uses Schubert's Ave Maria once and Bach's version twice before it is over, a very strange choice of music, indeed. The premise is interesting and Katharine Isabelle is compelling in the lead. The patients seeking bizarre physical alterations is fairly disgusting. Jen and Sylvia Soska are the directors, and judging by this work, they are seriously disturbed women. The movie is extremely dark and it kept me interested to the last scene which was a bit disappointing. As a thriller, it is slightly above average, and a 6/10.",American Mary

In a striking example of ""We-ness envy,"" the so-called ""Twisted Twins""--Jen and Sylvia Soska--take out their frustration about NOT living in a country of one culture, as well as one language (there's a place called Montreal, Quebec, Canada, just a few miles north of the U.S. border, where someone who speaks Canada's ""Queen's English"" is worse off than being set adrift in Burkina Faso or Borneo) by having the gall to besmirch the folks who protected them from Napoleon, ""Stonewall"" Jackson, Pancho Villa, Hitler, and Hirohito through calling the main character of this tawdry film ""American"" Mary.

32,I_Ailurophile,Delightfully diabolical and different,9,23 October 2021,"Within minutes 'American Mary' gives us a lot of reasons to love it. The title character is readily painted as sympathetic given her dire financial straits. It's a joy to see Katherine Isabelle in the starring role - she has an unembellished ease, charm, and wit about her that makes her a natural fit for the protagonist, to say nothing of the poise and nuance she carries as an actress. The movie is filled with direly dark humor, exaggerated but excellently written characters, and a readily absorbing premise. The film had scarcely begun, and I was hooked.Devious and morbid at all times, 'American Mary' takes distinctly darker turns at multiple points. All the while the Soska twins fashion their screenplay and its realization with fantastic detail. Set design and decoration, lighting, costume design, hair, makeup, blood, props, music, sound - every aspect of the production is truly outstanding and carefully realized. Characters, dialogue, scenes, the overall narrative - all wonderfully complete, well-rounded, and engaging. A dash of psychological horror, a healthy helping of body horror, a precisely cut yet profuse bloodbath - there's a little bit of everything here, all woven organically into a feature that never feels like it's rushing or lagging, lacking or overfull. Mary's journey is absolutely fascinating, and every progressive step along a path ever more grisly is managed with the greatest of skill from the whole cast and crew, Isabelle, and the sisters.Despite myself, there's just not much more to say. This is marvelously entertaining and holds fast our attention from start to finish, superbly crafted in all ways. I feel remiss in noting that this is only the first film I've seen from the Soskas, but I look forward to enjoying many more. It's a wild, offbeat, and often gruesome ride, and even at that, there's an objective nonchalance to the picture that means even the most visceral moments aren't exhibited with any especial care for sensationalism - which is to say, horror purists may feel put out by the tone it strikes. Yet if that's no obstacle - nor a content warning for sexual assault - you need to watch this post-haste: 'American Mary' is an exquisite, weirdly refined slice of bloody horror with a compelling story, and it's worth a view wherever you may find it.",American Mary
33,begob,Hail Mary,6,19 September 2014,"Good performance from the lead actress, but plenty of problems with the rest.Some interesting oddball characters hanging around, but I just didn't buy the cabal of pervert surgeons because there was no background for it. The role of the niteclub owner was a bit vague and contradictory - vicious and meek at the same time - maybe they shouldn't have cast a pretty boy when he was never going to conquer Mary. The killer was well hidden, maybe too much. And the detective was pointless. Too many characters for a limited number of roles? Lots of energy and ideas + good gore. I thought the plight of the amputee surgeon could have helped develop Mary's character. She was played really well, and in the end I was wishing she managed to stitch herself together, leaving a trail of blood for the detective to follow.Recommended, but the story was a bit loose.",American Mary
34,brchthethird,"Cool premise, so-so execution",5,14 November 2014,"While this dark, twisted thriller delivers some great gross-out moments, it ultimately falters under the weight of its own sadism and is seriously let down by sub-par acting and some scattershot plotting. First off, I should say that overall I did enjoy the film. It kind of works as body horror, and the premise of body modification surgery allows for some fairly gruesome and grotesque sequences. However, this concept is never really allowed to cohere into a compelling story. The overall narrative deals with a broke medical student, Mary, who goes into the world of body modification surgery to make some extra money. That in itself is fine, but the way in which she's motivated to begin this work is rather cliché, becomes a half-ignored subplot and is then resolved in a rather mundane, anti-climactic way. The movie seems more interested in showing how weird it can be than really telling a story. Another problem with the film is the acting, because nobody (the lead included) really delivers a good performance. Some things I liked about the film was the rather eclectic soundtrack, which included dubstep, electronic pop and classical music. There was also one scene in particular, which takes place in a bathroom, that really stood out as building effective tension and conveying a sense of claustrophobia and fear. Also, the sequences where Mary does her body modification thing were (mostly) tastefully done. Overall, it's an OK movie but the experience is cheapened by poor acting, a muddled and poorly resolved plot and often taking itself too seriously. For me, a better movie that's similar to this would be EXCISION, although this wasn't bad enough to not necessarily recommend.",American Mary

Interesting stuff is going on but you are not part of it and you just have to sit watching uncomfortably until it is over.The acting, script, lighting etc. is all good. Katharine gives a stella performance, easily pulling off sweet, sexy and sinister, but it is not enough.There is initially an intriguing insight into a sub culture of people who want to express themselves through physical modification.

Apart from fobbing all my past-it's-best-before-date confectionery onto hapless trick or treaters, and jumping out from behind corners to try to give old people heart attacks. I've seen an alleged scary movie. And you're reading the review of it right now. Go you.It's all about this lady, see? She's in training to be a surgeon. After being assaulted at a party by her lecturer, she decides to chop his arms and legs off. Now THAT'S vengeance. Then she quits medical school, and becomes exclusively involved with performing body modifications on the weirdos in our society. Including: A girl who literally wants to become a Living Doll, two sisters who want to exchange their left arms as a sign of their closeness(?) and a dude who fancies a crack at looking like Beelzebub himself... Horns and all. It LOOKS good, but I thinks his dreams of working the till at his local Co-op are well and truly shattered.Will you want to avert your eyes on a few occasions, at the sight of split tongues, severed limbs and more blood gushing out than you'd find in a vampire's larder? Probably. But are there any moments, where you feel the hair prickle on the back of your neck, as something unknown creeps around the darkness, ready to strike...? Nope. It's all rather dull, with our heroine interacting with some not-quite-interesting characters, before getting busy with her operating table for long, drawn out procedures. Not too much of note happens, apart from the repetitive presence of REAL LIFE freaks as extras showing off their mutilations. Nice, guys.As for the ending...

41,TheSquiss,"The sexiest murderess on screen in a poor, irrelevant attempt to shock.",2,21 January 2013,"I was fortunate enough to attend a screening of gory horror American Mary followed by a Q&A session with the co-writers and directors, Jen and Sylvia Soska, and star Katharine Isabelle. Okay, scrap the 'fortunate'. And the scariest parts of the evening were the claim by the Soska twins that ""Some people have said this is the best film they have ever seen!"" and the bloke who told us all about the operations he was due to have on his legs before enquiring from the trio if he should go ahead.There's very little good to say about American Mary. I entered the screening room with high hopes and departed wide-eyed and dismayed. It's embarrassing to laugh at unintentionally funny moments in a film but there were plenty of them. American Mary is indeed shocking, but not in a good way.American Mary is clearly a vanity project from two girls whose executive producer parents apparently (part) funded the project. Two girls who have watched Human Centipede once too often. Two girls who are trying reeeeally hard to be rebellious and shock the world by doing naughty things on screen and swearing pointlessly and with embarrassing amounts of emphasis on each expletive just so we get how rude they're being. Such pain! Even in the Q&A they tried desperately hard to shock; the first sentence out of their mouths referring to some scallywag as a f****** c*** and then repeated, over-egged obscenities punctuating inane responses to toadying fanboy questions. Oh, to have been shocked and offended. That would have been a joy compared to the embarrassment of watching three children showing off to a roomful of adults. There's an old adage: If you want to be seen, stand up; if you want to be heard, speak up; if you want to be respected, shut up. I saw, I heard, I departed and I averted my gaze.American Mary is a horror flick about a disenchanted surgery intern, Mary (Isabelle) with financial worries who is sucked into the very dark side of plastic surgery aka body modification aka freakish mutilation. It starts out as a way for Mary to earn money (via torture and creating Barbie lookalikes) then becomes a hobby and finally a way to exact revenge and satisfy her perverse whims.I don't have a problem with the subject matter; it's great to be challenged. I have a problem with the dire script, the god-awful cod accents (the worst of which are from the Soska twins who cast themselves as, um, freakish twins) and the horrendous sound mix that changes mid-scene (!) and at one point had us all looking over our left shoulders to work out which member of the audience was moaning, only to realize it was the character off-screen in an entirely different direction! Random scenes are plonked into the film to separate others and to imply the passage of time. A cringeworthy scene in which Mary learns some news of her grandmother prompts further smothered guffaws and is just one more reason to condemn this amateurish tripe. This is just one long, clumsy, pointless film that really wants to be offensive but succeeds in being virtually irrelevant.Certainly there are a couple of moments when the stomach twinges with the implied gore, but mostly the horror is in the performance. Paula Lindeberg is so ridiculously excessive in her performance as the plasticized Ruby Realgirl with her squeaky voice and clapping hands that Isabelle comes across as subtlety incarnate. Antonio Cupo plays strip joint owner Billy Barker as though auditioning to play Mark Ruffalo and when John Emmet Tracy wanders on to the screen with intended sincerity as Detective Dolor, the thud was the sound of many jaws bouncing on the floor. Why does an American detective in an American film set in America have a 'British' accent? Well, according to Soska and Soska it's because they wanted their detective to sound exactly like their hero Clive Barker. It would appear no-one told them Barker is a Liverpudlian who now speaks with an LA drawl. Yup, that's about the level of American Mary.So why does American Mary earn two stars? Because the art direction triumphs, the set is pretty, the principal prosthetics are perfect and Mary's costumes get progressively sexier as the film rolls on. Costume designer Jayne Mabbott is by far and away the star of American Mary and by the time Mary dons her red surgeon's gown in a reference to Dead Ringers, Mabbott has made her the most erotic murderess on the big screen.Perhaps next time Soska and Soska are let lose with a camera they should be 'encouraged' to spend their budget on a few more talents like Mabbott.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",American Mary

43,in1984,Gore Modification,8,18 March 2013,"Shocking and unique, or at least rare. As another film from this year, Compliance, it is destined to be mimicked and inspire similar variations and plant seeds for films. Distinctly different films, however, with this sharing the odd, brutal horror of Saw and Human Centipede.Within the first 20 minutes, it's like watching a twisted variation on a medical school film involving an exceptional student. You don't know where it's going (which is always a good thing). It definitely sets itself apart and continues to throw in added surprises until the end.Besides going far beyond the normal teen/young adult fantasies of piercings and tattoos and wrapping them up with the usual horror gadgets and toys, it combines actors who have actually done what is normally left to FX and makeup. That's not to say there isn't impressive FX and makeup. The directors simply are smart enough to slip in real life people where appearance as opposed to acting is critical.The ending also steps outside the normal horror fix by being unambiguously final. It could fit better and I'd actually like to see a sequel to this, which may be why I find it a little disappointing.One of the few annoyances involves overplay of a ring-tone product placement for a massive phone corporation. It's not forced, nor is any of the audio and soundtrack, but you really don't want to be walking out of film with a mobile phone tune in your head.",American Mary

45,jackmeat,Another gem from the twisted twins.,7,1 May 2013,"Movie review:The twisted twins, Sylvia and Jen Soska, are back with their second full length feature. Now that people are taking notice to their talent, this time they have a budget (although they did need to take out a second mortgage to get the project off the ground). Anyway, this movie is about Mary, a brilliant med student studying to be a surgeon. Of course, money issues arise, as seems to always happen to college kids, so she decides stripping may be the way to go. While ""interviewing"" for the job, a strange occurrence puts here in the helm of a situation where she is needed to perform surgery at the club for quick cash. She soon realizes that maybe under the table surgical procedures may become a way to make money, so when a woman tracks her down after finding her resume at the club, she takes on a second patient. Mary finds herself juggling the task of student and surgeon on the side. Well, the life of being a student is crossed when she is invited to a ""party"" where she is the guest of honor, so to speak, and the world of the actual surgeons take a toll on her as she is drugged and raped. This incident pushes Mary over the edge and she takes matters into her own hands. This movie does a wonderful job weaving the tale of a woman that is forced into a life she wasn't prepared for, that of BME and revenge. It follows her downward spiral balancing reality with the virtually psychotic road she has chosen. The movie is much more polished than it's predecessor and it shows in the quality of camera-work and editing. The acting is very well done by Katherine Isabelle as Mary, and the other actors hold their own in their respective roles. Of course, the blood and gore is there, but not as extensive as their previous effort. It really wasn't needed for the story the twins wrote. American Mary had a limited theater release so you may or may not have had the chance to see it. If not, I again highly suggest that you see this movie. It is good to see new talent emerging with entertaining movies that don't follow the cookie cutter mold Hollywood has been giving us. 6.4/10 IMDb 6.0 .

The latest film American Mary kind of snuck under the radar but has been getting some positive buzz directed by the Soska Sisters, but does it deliver something new to the genre or will it be just another forgettable attempt? American Mary follows a medical student who is struggling financially and slowly becoming disenchanted with the surgical world. When she is put in a situation to earn some easy money sends her into the world of underground medical field that leaves more marks on her than her freakish clientele. While this film falls into the horror genre it isn't really a horror film at all depending on how you look at it. This could fall into an aspect of the torture porn genre, but from a self-inflicted nature. The story is pretty simple and starts off with little feeling new, but then it takes an insane turn creating a strange a bizarre world that is unlike most out there. There are a few characters that are hard to look at from the start both looking fake and strange, but as it moves along they seemingly become the norm as the twisted nature of this film takes over. Watching the evolution of this character from struggling medical student to this freak surgeon creates a film that is both interesting and original standing out from anything out there. There are a few gory moments and torture sequences that are really effective, even when you don't actually see what is happening. Part of the reason this film works is they weren't afraid to push the boundaries without feeling the need to force the gore down your throat.Horror fans love their gore, but sometimes less is more and here they mess with you visually as well as mentally creating a world that is sure to please. This is one of the most inventive horror-esque films to come along in this genre in a long time that actually builds to something and leaves you both creeped out and satisfied all at once.",American Mary
50,RockPortReview,Surprisingly Good and fun to watch!,7,6 April 2015,"The body modification sub culture is sort of the like the old time carnival freak show. People surgically mold, sculpt and pierce their way into something else but the person on the inside stays the same. The 2012 film ""American Mary"" features Katherine Isabelle, the breakout star of 2001's ""Ginger Snaps"", as a Med student who finds herself performing body mod surgeries that she finds out is quite good at.Being a poor college student Mary Mason answer's a Craig's List style ad for a sleazy strip club owned by an even sleazier younger guy. During her ""interview"" something goes terribly wrong outside and Mary if offered $5,000 to do some impromptu surgery on some guy. She is freaked out but does it. Word gets around to the underground body mod culture and she is approached by some pretty strange characters to help them finish their work. Isabelle plays Mary perfectly, she is desperate enough too take these strange jobs, but is still grounded and very professional. She provides a desperately needed service to the extremely rich who believe she is an artist who works in the medium of skin.She is first pursued by Beatrice who has transformed his/her body into Betty Boop. After completing a surgery on her for $10,000, her friend Ruby comes calling next. Rudy is transforming her body to look like an anatomically incorrect Barbie Doll and has a few things cut off and one thing sewn up. The film has a darkly comedic thread throughout. Ruby, Beatrice and the others are all portrayed as good people on the inside, but different on the out. While the exact opposite is true about the other so-called normal people.Back at school Mary is invited to a swanky party thrown by one of the big shot surgeons, but she has unknowing just stepped into the lions den. She is drugged and raped by the surgeon, but little does he know the unique skills that Mary has recently acquired. Mary exacts swift and painful revenge upon the Doc. Making him her test subject for new procedures, keeping him alive and aware the whole time. ""American Mary"" is full of interesting unique characters and well played throughout. It was written and directed by the Soska twins, Jen and Sylvia, who also play parts as customers to Mary. They bring a real sense of authenticity and care to the film, that would have been lost had it been done by anybody else.",American Mary
51,larry-411,Hell hath no fury like a female surgeon scorned,8,7 October 2012,"Co-writers/directors Jen and Sylvia Soska, the Twisted Twins, have created a highly stylized, exquisite entry in the horror subgenre known as the women's revenge film. This is the bloody nightmare an angry young female surgeon might have after watching ""I Spit on Your Grave.""We open on an extreme closeup shot of lovely Mary Mason (Katherine Isabelle) in her kitchen, sewing a turkey with careful precision. It isn't Thanksgiving, though, and there are no guests arriving. She's just practicing her surgery skills as a budding med student. But when professional relationships run afoul, fowl just isn't an adequate substitute for the real thing. And just when you think you know where the film is going, our hearts are touched by Mary's benevolent foray into a world few are aware of. So begins the occasionally chilling, often twisted odyssey of ""American Mary."" There's much praise to go around for this talented ensemble cast but, more than anyone, it's the exquisite Katherine Isabelle who brings the Soskas' script to life. Isabelle so inhabits Mary that she creates a totally original, unique character that raises the bar for all the actors around her. The reversal of roles in this narrative is clever and crafty. To be more specific would reveal too much. Things are not as they seem as stereotypes are shattered at every step of the way.The look of ""American Mary"" is a study in the almost-forgotten techniques of creative filmmaking. Single point lighting is used liberally, as Mary moves in and out of the shadows of the strange new world she's created. More than in most modern films, the color palette is central to subliminal psychological changes transmitted to the viewer. Black, the color of death, and red, the color of love (and blood), dominate in key scenes and trigger subtle emotional cues that slyly blend in with the milieu.Peter Allen's original score magnificently balances contrapuntally with the gruesome on screen action. Lush classical strains underscore unimaginable real-life horrors. We're watching a ballet of death. The more terrifying the images, the more charming and delightful is the opera in our heads. The beauty of the soundtrack belies the ugliness beneath.""American Mary"" boasts some of the most stunning camera-work of the festival. Cinematographer Brian Pearson exhibits such passion for the material that every frame is like a painting. Editor Bruce MacKinnon allows the film to proceed patiently, another departure from the typical genre production. Locations are like characters unto themselves, and the set design reflects that with tremendous attention to detail that allows the photography and music to work together with the backdrop to help propel the story.This is true art, rarely seen in cinema today. It's a slightly more civilized, 21st century take on torture porn with high production values and a killer narrative but there's much more here than meets the eye. Yes, it's hard to watch at times, but those who appreciate movies the way they used to be made won't want to turn away. In ""American Mary"" we gorily discover that hell hath no fury like a female surgeon scorned.",American Mary
52,torrascotia,Only interesting if you would quite like your arms chopped off.,2,8 March 2018,"American Mary is billed as a movie about a medic who turns her back on the medical establishment and becomes involved in underground surgery for paying customers, who wish to have surgery the establishment would refuse. For obvious reasons as its mainly for shallow aesthetic reasons.It is well known that there are groups of people who demand surgery to change their appearance for any number of reasons but standing in their way is a medical establishment which refuses on ethical grounds. Why remove healthy tissue for aesthetic reasons? It seems that this wish fulfilment of a trained surgeon who will perform this type of surgery on demand, if you are rich enough, resulted in the character of Mary. She is basically a body-mod kinksters dream come true. It it doesn't take long for us to see the movie for what it is. It's a thinly veiled revenge movie against the medical establishment, most likely because they refuse to get involved with surgery this scene, where the supposed hero is much worse than her prey. The writers and directors the Soska twins, who I have never heard of before this movie, look like the cheeky girls at a goth disco. They turn up, assault a dancer for no reason then ask to have their bodyparts swapped for no sensible reason, other than they think it will be cool and they are rich enough to pay for it. This tells you pretty much what you need to know about the writers of this movie. There is the theme in this movie that wishing to use surgery to change your appearance is somehow leftfield or subcultural, however plastic surgery is now so mainstream celebrities don't even bother to conceal the fact they have had it. The only difference seems to be style. Most people by adulthood will realise that by dressing in back or adopting a subcultural dress code doesn't make people individualistic, especially when that subculture all look the same. If anything, they look more conformist in their uniforms.The movie seems to send quite a shallow message which is wearing black is cool, pointless violence is cool, swearing is cool, being rich is cool and prolonged torture is cool as long as its revenge. However, for revenge films to work properly the revenge has to be proportional. In this case its not. She is by far the worst person in the movie, however we are supposed to believe she is a good person because she still chats to her grandmother on the phone? That doesn't quite balance out against the sadism. As a result you don't care what happens to her.There are very few movies which deal with body modification which could have made this an interesting project. The movie seems to focus on the trendy for some fetish scene of body modification and is very shallow as a result. There didn't seem to be a mention of the well-known phenomena of people who wish to have healthy limbs removed and will risk death to achieve this outcome. There is surprisingly very little debate in this movie about the ethics of people who wish to have serious modifications of healthy tissue and the medical professions rejection of these procedures. The ridiculousness of some of the procedures in the movie beggars belief, but because Maybe this is why the bad guys are medics and Mary gets to torture them?This movie will likely only appeal to a mostly teenage subculture audience who already have an interest in body modification, which is very very few people. The problem with movies which focus on specific fetishes is they have a very narrow appeal. Unless you get off on bodymod stuff, which I suspect where most of the high ratings for this movie comes from, you may have a better use for your time.",American Mary

54,ThreeGuysOneMovie,A refreshingly original entry to the horror genre,7,21 May 2013,"For the most part I was impressed with this film. Katherine Isabelle was great in the lead role and it was one of the most impressive horror movie with a female lead I have seen since Angela Bettis in Lucky McKees May (2002). Tristan Risk steals the show here though as Beatress. A character you will definitely not forget. It's been a long time since I could say I saw a horror movie that wasn't mostly derivative and this was a refreshingly original entry to the genre. I do have some gripes however. The plot is a bit shaky and requires a little suspension of disbelief at times. Also, some of the editing is questionable at times and makes the movie a bit uneven and confusing especially towards the end where events seem to play out very quickly. Overall I was impressed with Soska sisters work given the small budget they had to work with. It's not perfect and I am sure you could easily spend your time picking the movie to pieces but if you are a fan of the genre you should find it entertaining.To check out our full review head over to 3guys1movie.com",American Mary
55,Michael-Hallows-Eve,Great little Revenge horror flick.,7,27 January 2013,This film starts of quite well and gets you involved in the story from the beginning. It was made by the Soska twin sisters and it tells the story of a medical student trying to work her way to becoming a great surgeon. But as she finds out there are people who like to take advantage of you when you are trying to make ends meet. It stars Katharine Isabelle (GINGER SNAPS) and she plays the role of medical student Mary Mason very well. The Soska twins have a little role each in the film also. I did like the story and how it moves along and some of the scenes are quite cringe worthy. The plot has a revenge element to it and you understand why Mary ends up doing what she does. This would have to be one of the Soska's better movies to date in my opinion. A great little horror flick. I give it a solid 7.5 out of 10.,American Mary

58,ikeybabe,"Flawed, but Still Entertaining",7,29 March 2014,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the fare to poor acting by some of the key cast members. The script was seriously original and spooky. The atmosphere was creepy as were the real villains - the professor and doctor who were teaching American Mary how to be a surgeon. The actress who played Mary did a good job, even though, her acting ""dead"" inside was a little too on point. It just seemed like she couldn't really act at all after a while. But, overall, this was a good flick. I have to agree with earlier reviewers. American Mary would be a great spin off on HBO or FX, like ""Dexter"" or ""Nip/Tuck."" I wasn't really thrilled with the ending, but it worked. Overall, it was a fun and thrilling ride.",American Mary
59,politehere,Disturbing Concept,6,15 February 2013,"I would like to divide my review into two parts: Technically speaking, the movie is almost flawless. The acting is perfect, the script is very well written, the story is very original, and everything is in its place, however,morally speaking, the only phrase I can come up with to describe this movie is ""utterly disgusting"". I've seen hundreds of horror movies, but none was quite as disturbing as this, because this shows what's actually happening in the real world. It's not a fantasy, and that makes it truly disturbing.I don't remember many movies that have affected me so profoundly. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one example of such movies, because it was based on a real murder case, but the concept this movie is dealing with here is absolutely horrifying. It is sickening to even imagine there are people out there who would do this to themselves. The only advice I can give is for people to avoid this movie for the sake of staying psychologically healthy. Yes, there are things that even horror movie fans like me find objectionable. This movie is advertising an abomination.Not recommended.",American Mary
60,Foxbarking,An Exceptionally Poor Try,2,6 September 2013,"I was at first a bit hesitant to watch this movie, because the description made it seem like torture porn. Only after seeing many reviews that did not paint it as such, I decided to give it a try. In retrospect, I wish someone would have called it torture porn to keep me from watching it.Getting that out of the way, I am not labeling this movie as torture porn, but it is the furthest thing from it. I have to commend the filmmakers for taking a concept that screamed of a torture porn plot but avoided making it such. The writers and directors tried to make this film less about the body modifications as it was about the change in personality of the lead character. However, they did such a poor job doing this that they should have just made an idiotic torture porn movie. ""American Mary"" is basically a film about a poor med student who begins to take body modification jobs to keep her bills paid. At first she is reluctant to do so, but this changes over time. When one of her former professors drugs her and rapes her, she quits med school and after beginning a long revenge scenario with him, she becomes a very distant shell of what she previously was. The nice girl trying to get through school becomes emotionally blank and immorally bankrupt.This movie fails because its plot is way too unlikely. Mary's change happens too quickly and it seems to come about as the means for a plot device and not her character. By the time you get half way through the movie, any sympathy for Mary is gone. She has no morals and no redeeming factors. This is a dreary and boring and terrible film I suggest you skip over.",American Mary
61,wadechurton,"Unusual, captivating, repellent, and very, very good.",9,14 August 2013,"'American Mary' (2012) is the story of a would-be surgeon (she's attending medical college) with money problems who suddenly finds 'underground' work lucrative. Soon she's performing increasingly freakish 'body modification' procedures for fabulous sums, and her 'fame' grows. This one played out like a black comedy until around a quarter of the way in when something nasty happens to Mary which skews the screenplay into something a lot darker. It is an unusual movie but one which held my complete attention until the end; not something which happens every time with the horror genre. There's a little of the David Cronenberg, even David Lynch about it.

65,moviesmaniax,"some really freaky and imaginative concept, yet is not fully developed // instagram: moviesmaniax",7,26 July 2014,"So I was expecting some weird twisted body modification sh*t after I saw the trailer and the result is what I quite expected. However, there seems to be much doing but not so much showing (the result) which was quite disappointing. The GORE effects here look really realistic in a surgery scene and was very twisted and disturbing to watch. The SCARE here is probably how realistic the surgery looks but again, they show the cutting scene and stuff in which it has a really cool, bizarre, and jaw-dropping concept but unfortunately the film chose to not show much of that final result which was a major disappointment for me. Another disappointment here is the cluttered plot and the climax that just came out of nowhere making the pacing here moves quite slow and loses interest from time to time, but thanks to Katharine Isabelle's hot and tempting performance making the film more enjoyable to watch. Overall, the FUN of this film is seeing some unique and likable character personality in a weird way and some really freaky and imaginative concept even though it might not have been fully developed at the end >>C+<<",American Mary
66,quridley,Watchable but hollow and irritating,7,6 June 2017,"While original and well-made, ""Mary"" never rises to much. The premise is your basic rape revenge story given a modern twist but it doesn't take things further or deeper. In some ways this is more fetishistic and illogical than the legendary but somewhat cartoony ""I Spit On Your Grave"". This film's heroine is nothing like the classic victim: she's confidant, vain and has a sour attitude. But she grows tiresome and unlikable before anything bad has even happened to her. When your feminist heroine surrounds herself with gangsters and creeps, how can she be surprised that she is raped. The film promotes this narrative that female liberation = being used by men and then blaming everyone but yourself for it. American Mary works as a twisted fantasy and cheap wish fulfillment for victims, but it never becomes a halfway believable or intelligent criticism of misogyny or sexism. It wants to be as poetic, brutal and entertaining as Diablo Cody's ""Jennifer's Body"" but doesn't nail any of it, coming off like a cash-in only.",American Mary
67,filmbizarro,Decent entertainment in shallow horror about body modification,6,10 April 2013,"Plot: Mary Mason, a medical student studying to become a surgeon, gets into some shady business when she applies for a job to get some extra cash. The young student is quickly thrown into a world of body modification, and she is becoming the go-to person for the most extreme of modifications.Our thoughts: I might be in a minority of reviewers: I never watched or wanted to watch ""Dead Hooker in a Trunk"". It should've interested me, but it never did. It happens with certain titles, and this was one of them. It certainly didn't help that my partner on the website reviewed that one, which means I didn't even have a ""professional"" (hah!) reason to watch it. I haven't had much interest in the Soska sisters, and that's nothing personal, but when Katharine Isabelle got attached to ""American Mary"" I'll admit to being interested. As a huge fan of the ""Ginger Snaps"" trilogy, why wouldn't I be?""American Mary"" (it could be called ""Canadian Mary"", since Katharine is Canadian and so is the movie, but let's not be silly now!) tells the story of Mary Mason. She's a medical student who hopes to become surgeon one day. Hell, she's far along too, and quite a good student to boot. If you ignore her attitude, of course. She's more skilled than the majority of her class. But being a student of any kind means you're probably broke, just like Mary is. Her desperation leads her to apply for a job as a stripper, but the job interview takes a weird turn when someone associated with the club is in need of surgery - quick. Mary's dragged in and she has to perform surgery on this really messed up man. It's quite the job for a medical student to do, but she does it. And it changes her. People hear about what she did, and she gets contacted by people that are into extreme body modifications such as trying to look like a doll or Betty Boop. Mary soon throws away her ambitions to become a typical surgeon, and becomes a popular name in the underground world of body modifications.What is the rise and the fall of a movie like ""American Mary""? The rise for me most definitely is that Katharine Isabelle plays the lead role. She's a really likable actor, and it's hard not to want to watch a horror movie with her in it. Another rise (you know I mean ""positive thing"", right?) is that the storyline is quite to the point and easy to get into. Also the effects are quite good.Let's look at the negative things of ""American Mary"", which are often much stronger than the positive things. Most importantly is that I find little-to-no character development in our lead character. Even though Katharine Isabelle is likable, her character is not. And her character remains equally unlikable from start to finish. It would be understandable if a nice girl (nice girls can be strong too) becomes hardened and ""bitchy"" through-out the things that happen in the movie, but Mary starts with bitchy attitude and ends with bitchy attitude. There are just a few scenes that show anything beside that in her, and that's a real shame.Katharine Isabelle is still the better actor in the movie, hands down, and I don't mind watching her even if she's not likable. Several actors are less than fantastic, and sadly that can be said about our director duo too. The moment the two of them enter the movie it becomes rather silly with their German accents. The kind of focus that is put on the two characters makes you think that they would be a big part of the story down the line, but they aren't. It's understandable if directors put themselves or people they know in movies, but I don't know what the reason for this kind of attention to two characters is if they are not gonna be important. No surprise, perhaps, that they decided to make their characters the most odd ones in the movie - if you could choose your own role in a film, I'm sure you'd want something that stands out too. But Jen, Sylvia, you should probably rethink putting you in too much focus just because you are in the movie.""American Mary"" lacks a lot of things that would draw me into the movie. But it works as a rather shallow horror movie about body modification. It has several scenes that are underwhelming in both emotion and artistic decisions, characters that you don't develop, failed attempts at shock. Let's be honest - in 2013 it takes quite a lot to come off as shocking, and you either have to really show the most despicable things imaginable, or have us so invested in our character that it hurts us when they are hurt. ""American Mary"" is a few hundred miles away from that. I don't think it's a terrible watch, and some parts of it are quite alright so it definitely works as weekend entertainment.More reviews at FilmBizarro.com",American Mary

What makes this movie so different from other films about a sweet girl that goes to the dark side is that Katharine Isabelle is so damn good as Mary Mason. Hear acting chops are incredibly strong and she makes the movie extremely entertaining. There is something very cool about a chick in stilettos and a black nurses apron cutting up willing participants.

75,pjr235,"Watch, if you like a good revenge story..",7,28 January 2013,"Over-all, I'd say watch it if you're up for a nice revenge story with a 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' edge to it.I don't know anything about the directors, so I can't say if they improved or not. But for this movie and how it went, they pulled it off smoothly enough. Being a guy into movies like SAW and Final Destination, I would have liked to see the gore, and not because I'm a twisted freak, but because if you're gonna make a movie about cutting people open, in the worst of ways, then you should start with the mind and then go for the stomach... It seems like they got the first half right, and perhaps and I mean 'maybe' they wanted to keep the gore out... but again, this is a movie about chopping people up ... so it felt as if though they danced around a very fine line and managed to do just enough to tell the story without getting into it.It made me feel as if though it were actually tailored for women. Which is fine. Guys have SAW, Girls get American Mary. Deal. (If your a guy) Just don't expect a slasher of film. But don't take that in a sexist way, the opposite really, I thoroughly enjoyed this lead character and her journey to the dark side. Refreshingly delicious, and my kinda girl all the way. My only real gripe is the dialog which was a bit on the weak side and the lack of 'adventure' when it came to the 'body mods.' Other than that, it was okay. Also, she could have done without the odd relationship with the club owner, which seemed forced at every interaction.I'd imagine this to be a movie to watch with the wife/girlfriend to sort of please her appetite for horror (without actually spoiling her appetite :P ) (So, in that respect, very well done.)",American Mary
76,pendenquejohn,So so...,3,25 April 2015,"The film starts out in a very interesting manner but completely dies through time. The extreme overall creepiness kinds of gets the toll on the spectator and kills the novelty. Without taking into consideration that it really lacks any real action scenes. It becomes then quite repetitive and the end completely reflects that decline I believe.Katharine Isabelle is extremely cold, cynical and quite disturbing. That's a start. Her psychology evolves from being a ""normal woman"" to a total 'controlled' psycho or even a serial killer to say the least. But I hardly could really differentiate when she was her 'normal' self in the first part of the movie and before that dramatic event for her from these phases of psychopathy. Either her acting was too perfectly suited for the film, which I think it was at certain phases or either it was really uni-dimensional bordering boring at times. At such a point that her true emotions were rarely convincing actually, or if she had any. In other words, she cold as boiling water when she is a lovable princess and still in a similar state when she is in lock-down psychopath mode so, it really does ask the question why did they really try to paint out these two versions about her ? Was just to really build the cheap scenario ? The focus on her life pre- psychopathy is like 3 minutes of the film and there is like literally no build up towards Jekyll.Overall the movie appears totally creepy, disturbing at times no only with the surgical practices that she did but also the certain characters who are literally just weirdos. The combination of 'Mozart'- like music and creepiness tries to pull it almost as an art but not so much.Concentrating on the detective, John Emmet Tracy, his role is actually quite laughable. A true filler for the poor scenario. Casper's invisibility cape was working full time there especially when the end of the film is taken into account. I'm not sure why they actually played this card when they did not expand it to its full powers. The relationship between Katharine Isabelle and John Emmet Tracy is poor, falls completely flat especially when you as a spectator expects a build-up tension, conflict [...] none of it. Which makes me say that he was a complete filler and a cheap excuse to try and diversify the scenario.This film did not really know where it wanted to go. Full vengeance mode, in that case they should have created a better build-up (something which makes me remember Kill Bill, a reference) or a crazy serial killer and in that situation I would have expected a better relationship between the serial killer and authority. And if it was purely about decadence, then the psychology of Katharine Isabelle is somewhat well represented, though, again, you feel that there's always still that rope holding them back and preventing them from really pushing the movie far.Another poor relationship is the one between Katharine Isabelle and Antonio Cupo. You always had the impression that they were to fall in love or have a relationship. Certain scenes make you even believe that she was in love with him, yet, again, all this is really very poorly developed.So my overall and final feeling is American Mary is tame. The relationship between essential characters is left to be desired. Her acting was one-dimensional. But, it had potential which was very badly developed.",American Mary
77,liberty_lee,Really liked it,6,10 January 2021,"This film was different than other films I've seen. The revenge was the main plot which was very much more involved than I expected. You feel her pain at first like she has good reason to do what she does, although there are some confusing parts. I liked the character, although she became wooden in parts. The idea of the film was something sort of different which was cool and I liked it mostly. The pub guy, not sure about him. The detective was fricking hilarious, an american actor for seemingly no reason putting on a dick van dyke style British accent, not sure what that was about and it was very unnecessary and distracting. The ending was kinda necessary I suppose.",American Mary
78,BlueFairyBlog,Blood is Never Boring,7,19 November 2014,"There is something just so bloody good about a horror film that is nice and gory. ""Ginger Snaps"" alum Katharine Isabelle returns to the big screen as a medical student named Mary. Barely destitute but desperate, Mary answers an ad for a strip club, but is interrupted to perform surgery for a large sum of money. She begins in this vein as a very innocent and frightened young woman, who doesn't understand the world she is thrust into, but a thirst for revenge quickly spirals her into a realm of darkness and fury. This film screams for me to love it, and I do easily, thanks to its insatiable blood fest, grotesque imagery of surgeries, Katharine Isabelle's cold and conniving performance as Mary, and the exploitative antics on screen. Her professor (Lovgren) is probably the most gnawing thing about this film, because his behavior is insufferable, and his warped sense of entitlement over his students is just not realistic. I know we're supposed to hate him and that's the reason why he is designed in that way, but he's just so blatant about it. Mary changing to a bloodthirsty horror villain over his crime seemed a bit extreme. The ending was also anticlimactic for the story set up, and came out of nowhere. Otherwise, this film brutally entertains, and does so with all the lust and plasma it can muster.",American Mary

80,lazyaceuk,A fun throwback - Minor Spoilers,7,23 November 2019,"I came across American Mary in an appropriately graveyard spot on a film channel and I'm pleased that I bothered. This is throwback to the days when I used to trawl the local video shop looking for straight to video horror oddities before the days of the shelves being cleared of 'slasher' films which were deemed the cause of all of society evils.Katharine Isabelle owns the role of Mary, and I can't even imagine the film without her. The opening scene of the film hints at a quirky darkness which the Soskas present wonderfully on screen.Doing her best to make her way through medical school, but financially challenged, Mary decides to chance her arm as a stage dancer at Billy Barker's night club. Fortunately for Mary, and for us, her medical needs are required slightly more than her choreography and Billy begins to feed Mary with work and money that in turns captures the attention of her mentors.Keen to establish herself within the medical fraternity Mary accepts an invitation to a a dinner party from Dr Walsh. Things don't go as planned and for Mary the path of revenge leads to an even darker psychological path which involves her in questionable off the books surgeries for people with questionable tastes in physical re-modelling.There are moments where the film doesn't hold together well as the Soskas choose visual shock over story depth, but the ending is a visual feast worthy of Mary herself.Not for the fainthearted, but if you enjoyed the likes of 80s fun like Society or the universe of the Re-Animator/Lovecraft films this will be for you.",American Mary

83,marais-alexander,"Unusual, disturbingly beautiful film",9,20 September 2013,"American Mary is one of those independent horror movies that just so easily can get trounced. The storyline is something best discussed with an empty stomach. The treatment that the twisted twins, Jen and Sylvia Soska, give it however is remarkable. The film never goes overboard with excessive gratuitous violence. Violence occurs when necessary, the rest of the film (with the exception of a horrifying rape) just being an excellent buildup of tension. I cared for Mary. Yes, she became a horrific sociopath of sorts, but as an audience member what's so powerful - and SCARY - is she still remains a presence you against your better judgment root for. The actual mainstream streak of horror dashes into the film's revolting climax. I would call this film more than anything suspense. Sure, there's weirdness and body modification, but it doesn't feel like real horror. It feels like a drama with weird stuff thrown in. Katharine Isabelle is something else as Mary, perfectly transitioning from naive med student to cool, calculating predator. Antonio Cupo turns in a solid performance as a bizarrely empathetic strip club owner who aids Mary in her ""revenge."" Whoever plays Dr. Grant is excellent as slimy predator-turned- prey. All the other actors (including the patients of Mary) are solid. It's DEFINITELY not for everyone, as there is still blood and flashes (not lingering shots) of some explicit gore. But setting aside your problems with the movie's ick factor it's pretty interesting powerful stuff. It feels almost like a meditation on suffering, morality, and perception of one's self dressed as a gross-out horror film. But the horror's secondary, I think, to the emotion. While the Soska Sisters turn in a solid entry to the horror section, I'd be interested in seeing them tackle different themed projects as well. What really could be interesting is if they took a turn for the psychological - like James Wan. Like the Soskas, James Wan made his name with the SAW franchise. But then he made some competent titles in the psychological and paranormal horror section (i.e. Insidious 1&2, The Conjuring). I think if the Soskas were to make a film like The Conjuring it would be really, really interesting. I'd love to see that emotion in American Mary against a Gothic haunted horror setting.Overall the Soska's have churned out a brilliant film and I'll be interested in what they do next. It's safe to say I'm a fan of Twisted Twins.",American Mary

92,cjmccracken,"This is not only an exceptionally well made horror film, this is a turning point.",9,1 December 2012,"American Mary is, without a doubt, one of the most talked about movies of 2012. The Soska sisters' sophomore offering maintains all the charm and wit which made their debut 'Dead Hooker in a Trunk' such a success, but displays a significant development in style and technique which will undoubtedly solidify their high ranking status within the genre.Universal Pictures has recently acquired distribution for the film, which has been causing delight amongst festival audiences all year, and has scheduled a limited UK/Ireland theatrical release to coincide with the DVD / BLU RAY launch which will take place on January 21st. I have been fortunate enough to attend two screenings of the movie so far this year and so what can the uninitiated expect from the unexpected sensation of 2012?The story centres around a young, gifted medical student named Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) who, whilst being exceptionally capable, is suffering from extraneous pressures caused by financial and personal difficulties. This, inevitably, affects her ability to devote her full and undivided attention to her studies. Her fragmented academic performance does not go unnoticed by her tutor, who curtly reprimands her, threatening her exclusion from the class lest she falter once again. The strain builds and Mary is forced to look into new potential methods of financially supporting herself. Without giving too much away, her investigations lead her further from the conventional world of surgery and deeper into the underground realm of extreme body modification. The reason that I am choosing not to divulge more of the story is that American Mary manages to be one of the few horror movies which I have watched this year that genuinely had me guessing as to what would happen next. The Soskas manage to veer away from almost every pitfall and stereotype that mars so many genre features. What I found particularly effective was their definition of character. This was present, not only in the gender roles which were beautifully constructed, but in the very idea of our own personal perception. The unforgettable Beatress Johnson (Tristan Risk) is without a doubt one of the strongest on screen presences in the movie, the pathos which she creates elicits is reminiscent of Tod Browning's 'Freaks'. Indeed, just as Browning portrayed 'regular' society as beastly and cruel whilst simultaneously highlighting the sense of camaraderie and familial ties which existed amongst his outcasts, Jen and Sylvia Soska examine similar themes. There is strength to the female characters in the movie which manages to remain both honest and believable. They are neither over-exaggerated butch heroines, nor are they whimpering slasher fodder. They are well constructed, authentic characters with depth that combines faults and strengths in a testament to the writing skills of the twins. Tension is built throughout and plays alongside a growing air of intrigue and suspense, the like of which is very unique to this movie. American Mary is a blood soaked dreamscape which completely immerses to the extent that the running time simply flashes by. There is so much that remains to be said on the subject. This is not only an exceptionally well made horror film, this is a turning point.Colin McCracken also writes extensively at his website zombiehamster.com and can be found on Twitter as @zombiehamster",American Mary

95,freeist,Beware: The Doctor is In!,8,18 February 2013,"The Canadian film industry is beginning to make its mark. American Mary is the second film written and directed by Sylvia and Jen Soska, also known as the Twisted Twins. Their first was the comical 2009 Grindhouse take-off, Dead Hooker in a Trunk. Hooker was not only better than watchable, it was fun; for a movie made on pocket money and a cast doubling as the crew while doing their own stunts, that's like saying it's an Oscar winner.With their second movie, the Twins have exceeded my expectations again. American Mary is extraordinarily good, and the sinister duo have assembled an exceptionally talented and professional cast and crew here.The film is about Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) a struggling medical student wanting to be a surgeon, and who stitches up turkeys for practice (while wearing lingerie). The film begins with her behind on her bills and falling out of favor with her mentor (David Lovgren). She decides to answer a strip-club ad. When word spreads in the club that she's a surgeon, and quite a good one, one of the dancers, Beatrice (Tristan Risk) offers Mary a lot of money to complete a friend's radical (and hideous) body modification. From there, Mary drops from medical school and ends up in the world of underground cosmetic surgery. She finds her new skills especially useful for exacting revenge.This shouldn't be mistaken for a revenge movie, however. It neither begins with the offending act, nor ends when vendetta is complete. No, the Soska's have made something more sophisticated, a story of a woman who becomes alienated from her dream of being a healer, and realizes the people she admired most are contemptible. Isabelle does marvelous work as Mary, who starts out as a charming ingénue with passive aggressive tendencies. When her life reaches a crisis, she turns into a ruthless monster with a heart of ice, who fights like a cornered rat. She gets a piercing glare, when she realizes people in the underworld fear her. She takes to carrying her surgical tools around with her, you know, just in case. She even offers to help an underworld friend with enforcement. By the end, she regains some sense of mercy, I think, but that's a matter of opinion.Isabelle's costuming is outlandishly sexual, though Mary doesn't seem to be aware of it. She does surgery in stiletto heels and has black surgical gloves. The film obviously has a lot of costuming appeal for fans, and a lot of fetish appeal for the kinky. I could see this might start a surgeon fetish.In fact, all of the production values in this are good, superior for an independent film of this budget. The cinematography is splendid with a beautiful color palate. The make-up and prosthetics are superior, and it has an attractive score. For horror, the movie is not as bloody as you might imagine. The most disturbing detail is not the blood, but what is being cut and bled.Isabelle shows herself to be an actor of the highest caliber, and I hope this starts to bring her the recognition she deserves. The supporting actors behind Isabelle do great work. Tristan Risk is a standout as Beatrice, who's modified to look like Betty Boop. Risk has to play her part from beneath a mask that makes her look not like a cartoon, but an android. Yet, with her body and eyes brings Beatrice out, humanizes her, and matches Isabelle's virtuoso performance. Her accent and speech do sound authentically cartoon-like. I almost thought they were dubbed. Risk, a burlesque player in Vancouver, shows she has remarkable talent and skills. She becomes this character, who herself became Betty Boop.Antonio Cupo as Billy Barker, a strip club owner, does a good job with a part with almost as many challenges as Risk's, though different ones. How does one make a goon who beats people mercilessly and sexually abuses the strippers into anything likable? This is not a Martin Scorsese gangster. He develops a painful crush on Mary. The choice of him for the role seems quirky, however.Another odd choice of casting was John Emmet Tracy as Detective Dolor. A British accent for an American cop? Unlikely but not impossible. He still does a good job in the role. I was never sure if the character was as sympathetic to Mary as he made it look. I hoped so.The film is not perfect, however. The Soskas' make a cameo. They put themselves in a key scene as wealthy, depraved German twins seeking some radical modification. The Soskas cast themselves into these juicy roles, which they devour. Isabelle anchors the scene, and plays off of them straight. I think they had too much fun and needed a director to tell them to tone it down. However, a good friend of mine said it was his favorite scene, so I guess it can go either way.The only other problems are all minor. The sisters write the gangster parts to be likable, stretching believability. Billy seems less like a goonish strip club owner and more like a college dropout writing poetry in a café. The movie, which is so original with its plot, seems to stagger randomly at the end, where the time progression also becomes confusing. The Soskas chose to shoot many scenes in a crowded club, forcing them to turn down background noises when the dialog began, which detracts from atmosphere and immersion in the story.However, this film is remarkable considering it's only the Soska sisters' second movie. They're showing a steep learning curve, as American Mary is far above decent in quality. Mary is a monster that will haunt your wet dreams and your nightmares.

97,thor5894,"Mary gets even, then gets really weird",8,28 May 2014,"If you find yourself in a movie with Katharine Isabelle, you really should avoid pissing her off. The star of the excellent Ginger Snaps films (see all of them, seriously) plays a med student who gets involved in extreme body modification. This is a true original, and the Soska sisters are now officially on my radar. The script has some problems in the movie's second half, but the many virtues here make that easy to overlook. Ms. Isabelle is the biggest asset, giving a perfectly tuned dry and sardonic performance, while not sacrificing the emotions of all she is put through. The body modification culture is depicted without judgment, and there are a half dozen genuinely memorable characters. One thing I liked is how this avoids being a generic revenge story. Mary suffers a horrible violation early in the film, and to my amazement--because movies almost never work this way--she takes about five minutes to get her revenge. No dragging that out, the movie has other things on its mind.I'm not sure in the end what statement the film is making, if any, but it tells a gripping story of a life on the extreme fringes. I'm also unclear why the Canadians who made this gave it the title American Mary, memorable though it is. But whatever, there's a real talent here. Back in the '90s an offbeat vampire flick called Near Dark came out of nowhere, directed by one Kathryn Bigelow.

Gutsy, gory and gloriously unique, American Mary is a film that has propelled itself into the top ranks of my favourite horror movies. To say that this stylish, innovative and riveting piece is only the Soska sister's second directorial work is astounding. I was blown away by the storyline and by how beautiful the cinematography was, directed with such style and perfection, but with no fear of dark, gritty shots of blood and gore, everything about this film was incredible.We are taken on a journey following Mary, a talented med school student, who comes to realise that the world she is entering is not what she thought it was. I do not need to tell you the details of the story, indeed this film will be more of a pleasure to you if you avoid reading details and just see it. There are some scenes that are amazingly creepy, and the Soska's show they can ramp up the tension and bizarre factor in both subtle and glaring ways, and both are just as effective. It is disturbing and shocking, but delightful for being so. The surgery scenes are so well shot that it's impossible to look away, and they did such a good job of making me feel so deeply for Mary that when things begin to happen to and around her, I felt as brutalised as she did. This super-effective characterisation is in part down to fantastic writing, and of course down to the sensational performance that Katharine Isabelle delivers here. She carries much of the film on her own and is simply incredible. A thoroughly solid performance, she brings Mary to life as someone we equally feel for and fear, which is no easy task. She makes Mary personable yet brilliantly insane, in a haunting, creepy and oh so sexy performance. For me this is the stand out performance of the last few years, indeed Katherine Isabelle brings here one of the most impressive solo performances I've ever come across in horror. The Soska sister's cameo in American Mary brought about one of the creepiest sections, filled with the bizarre and I loved it. This is such a unique film, people are labelling it 'body-horror', and I can understand that, but for me it transcends the labels any one sub- genre can impose on it. It is sadistic, bloody and psychological, with some bizarre and gloriously disturbed scenes, and also provides moments of tension and sadness. It is an amalgam of a lot of great things in horror, and it works wonderfully. I cannot recommend this film enough. You have to see it. I have no doubt in my mind that Jen and Sylvia Soska are going to go on to become legends in our genre. I adore that some of the most creative, impressive work in a long time has come from female directors; we need more of them and I, for one, am damn happy that the Soskas are here.

It's driven by its mood, competent cast and its brazen disregard for conventional human boundaries. Miss Isabelle is pitch perfect as Mary. She's a quick-to-learn student who rapidly becomes a ""practicing"" teacher on her star patient. Miss Isabell's understated performance sets the mood with every character.

Although I suspect they probably wrote it with themselves in mind. It's only a short scene but one with so much potential. The Soska sisters play big characters in a scene that could have been wonderfully unsettling, but instead its a bit flat and clumsy. The girls just didn't have the physical presence or screen confidence required to fill out the roles.American Mary would have been excellent if it wasn't hindered by a few minor flaws and a weak ending.

But I would probably settle for being their pet if they asked me.Anyway, American Mary is about Mary, a promising medical student, who has financial troubles, so she decides to try stripping, but instead ends up performing surgery on a beat up snitch, when the owner of the strip club convinces her with plenty of money. I would give away the story if I told you too much more of what happens, besides that Mary ends up performing illegal, extreme body modifications, while at the same time having some other secrets.This is a very interesting and original film. The only horror film about body modification besides this one I can think of is Strangeland, which also is a very good film, but completely different from this one. I also think it's cool that they have brought in a guy who has real body modifications. Apart from that, the violence is well balanced, leaving some, but not too much, to the imagination. It also has some other really bizarre and interesting female characters beside Mary. I think movies like May, Alyce and now American Mary is showing that women are capable of making scary killers on their own terms with their own particular style very well. A lot of the older female killers has been characters that didn't differ that much from male killer and they also most of the time failed in being genuinely scary. This is not the case with those new ones.This is also, to my knowledge the first of those films that has a female director, and here there is two of them! And they are a couple of freaky, beautiful twins! Apart from that I also have a hard time deciding which one I liked best, this one or Alyce. Overall I would say this one is better, but Alyce has some peaks which American Mary doesn't reach.

In my opinion she is definitely an underrated actress who's acted in several movies but few of them have played such an important role in her acting career like this one and of course Ginger Snaps. American Mary is a well-developed movie that I very much liked it because it combines blood, flesh, drama and a good storyline with such a great acting from Katharine Isabelle besides I must confess that I'm totally delighted by her work, I really but really loved it. The movie is interesting from beginning to end, funny at times but mostly intense and what I liked the most was the evolution of Mary, at first you're gonna see a student, pretty and very smart living alone, working and doing little things in order to get some money but you'll end up seeing someone totally different, a girl with no fears, vindictive but mainly unstable. Well, in case I hadn't said enough I wanna add the fact that unlike the typical gore movies where you'll only see deaths and blood with no sense, American Mary has a very good storyline about revenge.Now you might be wondering why after this review I gave only 8 stars out of 10 and that's because of the ending, I didn't like it but I'm not sure if another one could have been better. Anyway, it's worth watching.",American Mary

113,vargind,Watchable but uneven,5,22 December 2013,"I gave this a 6/10, which in my book is ""a movie that was more interesting than most mainstream Hollywood dross, but not good enough that I would bother watching it ever again"".I didn't have a problem with the acting, and the pacing was pretty good. What really let the movie down was the plot.In particular the thing that bugged me most was it's a movie about a doctor performing operations. Could they not have avoided the giant plot hole of just how unrealistically they portrayed that? For example, Mary turns up and performs plastic surgery on someone. With no preparation. I'm pretty sure most doctors would want to read up on an operation they hadn't done before. She is also somehow an anaesthesiologist as well as a doctor, so knows the correct dose of animal anaesthetic to give a human.Not unrealistic enough for you? How about when Mary and one other guy cut off two people's arms and swap them? In her living room. No nurses, no blood transfusions, hell, not even a bucket of ice. Just cut them off and sew them back on again. Yeah, maybe it is that simple and awesome doctors can do stuff like that with no complications whatsoever and no nurses or anything to help, but I felt like I shouldn't have to suspend my disbelief like that for this movie.Other points that annoyed me: * Top surgeons who hold parties where they drug-rape people. OK, maybe that's realistic, but then inviting one of their students was surely a pretty stupid idea? * Mary has the rapist all tied up, and is about to start torturing him. But instead they just cut away and we don't see him again until much later in the movie, after all the torture is finished. Why even go to all that effort of setting up that scene and then not going through with it? Did they run out of special effects budget? And she'd branded (or whatever) some word on his forehead; I presume it said ""rapist"" but I wouldn't know because it was illegible. * It seemed quite stupid for her to then take photos of the guy and say she was going to put them on her website. I mean, she knew the police were looking for him. Was it supposed to show she was losing her mind? * After showing no romantic interest in the strip-club owner whatsoever, she is suddenly about to kill some other chick just for giving him a blow-job. It was very hard to understand her motives. Was it supposed to show she was losing her mind? * The whole plot-line with the angry husband of the body-modified woman seemed like a random sub-plot until suddenly they used it to wrap up the whole film.A lot of the reviews here seem to either love or hate this movie. I wouldn't say it worthy of either. It's a run-of-the-mill thriller movie (not a horror film at all IMO) and probably worth checking out if you can't find something better to watch.",American Mary

It had so much potential too, delving into the subculture of extreme body modification and combining that with anything horror ..seems brilliant! The truth is, it was just a mess.There were way too many jumps or assumptions in the story telling. One minute our main character, a medical student, is acting a certain way and the next minute she is acting completely different. We don't see that transition. When a movie does this too many times, it ends up being a mess of confusion.The only reason this film isn't on my skip it page is that the subject is interesting.BTW, the fetish club in the movie isn't like any fetish club in real life (I've been to many of them).

115,dr-deviad,A good start for a pair of directors with a lot of potential.,4,17 May 2013,"I was rooting for this film so hard when I started researching it. The girls themselves (based on the quotes and interviews I read) seem so bright, intelligent, honest, and passionate about my beloved genre. I sat down with two friends and started the film. **SPOILERS**I immediately noticed myself being drawn to the visuals. I loved the colors and shot choices. I had no complaints as far as lighting but I didn't see anything worth speaking of here. I liked Katharine Isabelle as Mary but I didn't see a definite arc in her character. She always seemed in control, even when she very clearly should not have been. The supporting cast was fantastic...except Antonio Cupo. At one point his acting was so bad all three of us watching let out a collective sigh of annoyance. Tristan Risk was fantastic and that Betty Boop voice creeped me out every time she spoke. Unfortunately, this is where the kudos end. The story itself was so all over the place and full of dead ends it was almost impossible to connect to. I respect them and what they tried to do. Body modification is a ripe topic for horror but it just didn't pan out. Based on what I have seen here it's clear that The Twisted Twins needed one or two more passes on their script before shooting. Maybe work from other people's scripts. I would love to be a fan of their work but I can't get behind a script like this one. I will continue to follow their work because I have a feeling they will put out some great films in the future. -David Roden",American Mary

118,ystump-1,God Bless American Mary,8,27 March 2013,"My streak of watching awful/mediocre movies is over! Thank you Soska Twins for making American Mary and ending this streak. This is the best horror of the year, so far, and I'm sure will be in my top 5 horror films for 2013. American Mary is the story of Mary Mason, a medical student, that needs some quick cash and discovers the world of body modification. That's all of the plot that I'm going to give away, sorry for being stingy but it's for your own good. American Mary does so many things right, no it's not perfect, but when you've watched as much garbage as I have lately you'll look past some little stuff. It's shot very well, especially the tracking shots. I'm obviously not a film student or film maker but I think it's a good looking movie with some nice, thought out shots. The gore is very well done, which is a must for a horror film. There's nothing that takes me out of a movie quicker than bad CG, especially CG blood, the CG looks to be kept to a minimum and the film is better for it. Like I said, the gore is very well done but this movie does a great job of implying gore as well. It's very easy to just show whats happening but leaving it up to the viewer to determine what's going on leads to a much richer experience. American Mary also has a bit of humor to it, at least I thought so, but maybe I'm a little messed up. The humor is very dark though, kind of like Excision, and it just added to my enjoyment of this movie. The acting isn't the biggest strength of this movie, it's not SyFy movie bad, but the lead (Katharine Isabelle) does a really great job. She's a genre veteran, Ginger Snaps & Freddy vs Jason, and very likable for the most part. Beatress is another character that I liked, she was a ton of fun and her makeup looked great (I hope it was makeup). One complaint though about the Soska Twins, they should never and I mean never act again. It really is that bad, I'm not exaggerating.American Mary is a fantastic movie, it does so much well and is a must see for horror fans. This will be one of favorites of the year and I think has some re-watchability. This is first movie I've seen from the Soska Twins, but after watching this I'm definitely a fan. These two are part of the future of horror and the future looks pretty good.",American Mary
119,writer93-354-983808,Interesting.,7,21 February 2013,"American Mary is a bizarre and twisted venture into the underground world of extreme body modification. The film is gracefully carried by Katharine Isabelle and the elements of black humour make the gory film easier to watch than something like Hostel. The gore in the film is pretty much what I expected when I first heard about it; the make-up was incredible and made for some quite difficult viewing. Beneath the gore, black comedy and the elements of shock horror there are allot of things to really think about when watching American Mary. There appears to be an undertone in the film exploring America and the red white and blue iconography mixed with the vast array of 'freaks' on show seems to be taking a swipe at acceptance and how we in the western world judge and react to people who are different. There is also a feminist message running blatantly throughout the film which is executed extremely well and manages not to be in any way preachy whilst exposing serious issues of rape and harassment. A stand out element of the film would be the set design and lighting. The sets really gave the illusion of an unseen seedy underworld and the lighting completely sets the atmosphere particularly when in Mary's home and when in the nightclub. Overall it is an above average 'horror' film which will live long in your memory because of the shocking imagery even if the film does at times lose itself within the second hour. It is an interestingly directed film with much more to offer than just shock value.",American Mary

The mood is gothic and darkly subtle, set under a highly viable execution of suave and sophisticated acting and scenery throughout. A good balance of atmosphere with an undercurrent of an unsettling and insidious tone throughout: this film has artistic depth and character. The visuals are nicely executed too - from the murky background scenery to the purposefully alternative and gothic portrayals in costume choice.This movie well depicts the concept of the dark and devilish streak that can lie buried in the human psyche. It also celebrates eccentricity via its characters, which perfectly blends in with the genre and intended audience.If you like a bit of that smooth, original-style gothic vibe with an alternative and edgy blend of performances, topped off with darkly-dramatic scenarios and characters, then this could hit the spot.

127,ElxDiablo,Live by the knife...die by the knife.,9,11 October 2014,"To call ""American Mary"" a horror film is somewhat of a misnomer. However, it is an understated gem that has clear horror elements, not unlike those in the movie ""May"".As usual, Katherine Isabelle plays her role to perfection, as a diligent and ambitious surgical student, whose life takes an abrupt turn when she finds herself being drawn into the world of illegal body modifications.Her sudden influx of cash catches the eye of her professor and his colleagues, who (assuming she's working in the sex industry) set her up to be drugged and subsequently raped at one of their parties; something we later discover is a regular occurrence. Her revenge is to use her professor as a live equivalent of the turkeys she's been practicing suturing on...only in this case, the procedures are far more complex and gruesome, with the element of torture that is absent in her new ""day job"".While some have written that sadistic streak that leads Mary to be a surgeon, I would contend that it the trauma of her rape that leads her to become increasingly desensitized to the extreme surgeries she's being asked to perform, and to the suffering she inflicts on both her professor and those who may threaten to expose her.The film truly is a subtle depiction of a woman who is slowly pulling away from the reality of what she's doing, but is not completely lacking insight, as one might expect from the typical horror villain. This is what sets this movie apart from many others in the genre. The role of ""victim"" and ""villain"" is fluid and often blurred. ""Gruesome"" is not necessarily synonymous with ""torture"" or ""sadistic"" (although sometimes it is). Our protagonist remains both terrifying and sympathetic throughout the film, aided largely by Katherine Isabelle's wonderfully nuanced performance.Perhaps this is why the film received such a mixed reaction from critics: It's not easily categorized, and the ending (which has been described as rushed and unsatisfactory) is actually a fitting finale for someone who ""lived by the knife"".For those who prefer straight-forward horrors or slasher flicks, you will probably find this film lacking, but for those who enjoy the more unconventional films falling under the ""horror"" banner, then this is definitely worth watching.",American Mary

Some of the characters are truly unforgettable and the surgery scenes are really realistic and disturbing.

Known for their unpredictable IFC Midnight film Dead Hooker in a Trunk, these ""Twisted Twins"" have brought about a new Universal monster with the film and the title character that is as precise as a surgeons hand in Mary Mason. Mason who is a surgical student that drops out after traumatic events and unknown opportunities becomes jaded and forever altered. She is embodied by the lovely, dark and talented Katherine Isabella of the cult Ginger Snaps films. Isabella's performance is powerful and emulates perfectly to the Soska's vision and direction. With American Mary, both Jen and Sylvia Soska enter the ranks of such innovative and original genre filmmakers like Stuart Gordon, Tom Six, Takashi Miike, David Cronenberg, Marcus Dunstan, Mary Herron and Tim Burton. The proud social statement by the Twisted Twins yet no-holds barred film never reveals too much building a solid foundation of style, cinematography and shock which is crafted at steady pace. While American Mary's plot could have been developed more and the conclusion less abrupt, the Soska's casting is fresh and high quality with deep, dark and eclectic performances by Antonio Cupo (Billy Barker), Tristan Risk (Beatress Johnson), David Lovgren (Doctor Grant), and the Soska's themselves who make a cameo appearance in the film. Overall, the Soska's are versatile in their craft whether its balls out filming like Dead Hooker or the refined, emotional and unique beauty of American Mary. The Twisted Twins show a class and maturity that the viewer will appreciate as their eyes, hearts and minds are put through heaven and hell. Stylish, original, funny and beautifully disturbing is what the buzz is all about and American Mary is worth the time and buzz as it is a film that is perfectly imperfect. DANKE.",American Mary

I gave it 2/10 because I thought that the acting, camera work and special effects were alright, but the storyline was awful. The plot doesn't really do much, it certainly doesn't develop and it doesn't draw you in. This film seems more of an unnecessary gore-fest that is possibly aimed solely at those who are interested in body ""modification"" (mutilation) rather than the majority of us who enjoy a good, well written story. Scenes jump about seemingly at random, for example there are dream/fantasy sequences that are not identified and therefore, as a viewer, when you realise that the continuity has just fallen apart you are left to simply assume that the sequence you have just seen can only have been a dream/fantasy and not part of the actual story.

Anyhow, she's been smoking hot ever since and apparently still is. This doesn't hurt the film one bit and was enough motivation for me to give it a spin.The story isn't one dabbled in often. We are introduced to a med student who is doing very well, and progressing through school by suturing up fresh turkeys on her Friday nights to practice her surgeon skills. She eventually begins doing side work out of her apartment for body modification club members. I won't give anything else away, but she was hurting for cash and it was either the titty club or start doing illegal surgeries. The film gets quite interesting with the seedy teacher from school and his med school parties and roofies and rape drugs. Let's just say, throughout her life experiences Mary becomes a bit demented. Her profession combined with everyone that does her wrong in this film, makes for an intense film. This is nowhere near perfect and the ending (imho) could have been a lot better. That being said, this is worth the $9.99 blu-ray release that is going on right now...or perhaps just a late night viewing sometime. Horror fans...this is a solid 7/10.

134,kidsparrow-760-609079,A true 'must see'.,6,9 August 2013,"Hands down my favourite film of the year. AM is not a studio big budget picture. It's a beautifully shot and well structured - albeit rushed - story about a girl name Mary. I won't say anymore about the plot, that's not how I do things. Let's talk about the film.American Mary is the second film by legends-in-the-making The Soska Sisters; a Canadian film duo (who are really twin sisters) with a big vision and a scrupulous eye for detail.The films has many amazing qualities and only a handful of flaws. The best choice the Soska's made was with casting Katharine Isabelle as Mary. I haven't seen that much alacrity in the eyes of a lead actress in a long time. Also, a surprising treat for those with an eye for film, are the homages paid to strong women in film, particularly Michelle Pfeiffer's CatWoman. I highly recommend the film and order anyone with an interest in independent cinema to take a gander. But don't watch it if Tom Cruise is your man and you're one of those suffering from big budget addiction (Hollywoverdose) as American Mary ISN'T a studio picture. It's an inventive second film from a pair of severely underrated (and shockingly unknown) film visionaries and a promise, if you like, of more to come. It's sexy, nuanced, deep in places, it deals well with common social issues and it's claustrophobically involving. However, I disagree with it's classification as a Horror, (even Canadian Horror), it's gory and it's shocking but it isn't horrifying as such; it's more a revenge thriller.",American Mary

It's easy to dismiss as a hack/slash piece of pulp, but I have to admit I enjoyed the film for its weird elements. It provides antagonists who are easy to hate and a protagonist who has a questionable lifestyle, yet is still very likable, due in no small part to actress, Katharine Isabella. She's smart, funny, and does a nice job handling a really bizarre story line. BE WARNED, this story is NOT for everyone. It has some very disturbing elements and is highly graphic in nature. That being said, the movie combines drama, dark comedy, and gore in a way I, as a viewer, found interesting. This is not a horror movie. Viewers going into the film with that notion will be disappointed. Again, this is a weird and graphic film and not for those who are easily (or even not so easily) disturbed.

137,keeperofthefates,Shoddy at best.,1,2 September 2017,"I don't get how this was seen as some great independent film in the genre. Let's start with the solid squandering of it's lead star, who can pull off a range of emotions and is a crack shot in delivering sarcastic one liners. You get 5 minutes into the film with only a couple quick camera shots of anything that would suggest Mary is having a hard time, but even if it had showed more the protagonist is so Socially stunted and emotionally aloof that you're not able to really FEEL anything for her at this point. It's like watching Daria Med School Drop Out, if they ever continued that cartoon from the 90's. Even after the rape scene, you don't get any real sense that she was traumatized so much as she had just found the excuse to act a little psycho. This is where I do however have to give props for a body modification story line, which is something you don't usually see. Still the pacing or outright lack there of in which the story drags out, coupled with 95% of it's characters, including it's protagonist being extremely one dimensional in depth, which was a shame for the material that was being worked with. The nail in the coffin for me was the ending, don't bother trying to guess what that ending is kids, because there is absolutely no foreshadowing, to show us that some inserted surprise guest murderer comes from OUTTA NOWHERE to kill off like 3 characters including the protagonist and her Living Dead Doll bestie. Given the cast, and the basic story, this should have been a far better movie that would have been far more deserving of the accolades it has gotten. It's not a problem with story which, I get is just opinion in the case of reviews, it was the sheer lack and misuse of certain KEY STORYTELLING MECHANICS, such as 0 pacing, character development, story development and foreshadowing, to lead us to an ending that made no sense whatsoever. I know others will try to make it out like some grand thought out metaphor about women something, something, because with it's creators it is easy to project that idea onto what you are seeing. Looking at it from a, I'm not an indy movie brown noser perspective I saw the point of the film, if there even was one being more more like Sh-t Happens and some dude you never knew was involved in the story pops out of the shadows and kills you, than any sort of PROFOUND statement made through interpretive movie making. A sad disappointment for the hype around it.",American Mary
138,SameeMan,Let me think of a few words to describe Mary...,2,16 April 2014,"Hmm... Let's see... BORING, PREDICTABLE, UNREALISTIC and STUPEFYING. If you want more words, you can also use WHAT, THE, HELL, WERE, THEY and THINKING (in that order). And of course there is the word UNFINISHABLE.I tend to finish the movies I start watching even if they are a bit on the lame side but fortunately I decided to stop watching this one halfway through. Please note that, this review is only about the first hour of ""American Mary"" but believe me when I say this, the way it was going it was not going to get any better in the last 30 minutes. I am not going to describe the movie plot here and spoil it for the people who want to watch it. Obviously there are people who are capable of enjoying ""Mary"", otherwise this would not be rated this high on IMDb. Simply put, this movie is the story of a surgeon (medical student) who faces some circumstances that makes her use her skills with the scalpel in a bit psycho-ish way. Sounds fun, am I right? Yes, it could have been, but it is not! ""Not even a tiny bit fun?"" you may ask. Let me put this bluntly, it is not fun at all! ""American Mary"" could only be a tiny bit fun if you have nothing else to watch or do and if you are completely bored, but you can always put some clothes in the dryer watch them roll instead of watching this. I know I am being very harsh here but I have no sympathy for this movie because it made me waste a good one hour of my evening with its bad script, predictable plot and unrealistic acting; an hour I would have otherwise spent watching a good horror movie, something like ""American Psycho"". I heard the actress who plays Mary (Katharine Isabelle) went to study surgeons in a real hospital to help her realistically play the character of a surgeon. I wonder where she went, maybe to a medical school for Barbie Dolls because her acting is nothing but realistic. The other cardboard cut-out people in this movie are no better (I think that was a problem with the script and not the acting) but the best script in the world would not have fixed the bad acting of the main actress. If you ignore the plot, script and acting, one more thing I found upsetting was the way body modification (and the subculture that surrounds it) depicted in this movie, and if you are interested in body modification practices, you would too. When Mary asked ""Have you ever heard of body modification?"" it made me cringe (not in a good way). If you think I am saying all this because of the ""disturbing/shocking"" nature of this movie, let me tell you, a disturbing movie doesn't put me off, I enjoyed Martyrs (which I rated 7/10) which is one of the most disturbing movies ever made (imo). To be honest, the so called ""disturbing"" scenes in this movie are kind of lame and toned down. That's one more thing I found lame about ""Mary"". When I was watching this movie, the only thing it disturbed was my need to watch it till the end and the only thing that was shocking was that it has a rating of 6/10 (at the moment) on IMDb.",American Mary
139,benjaminfeatherston,An undeservedly-acclaimed torture flick,4,24 September 2013,"""American Mary"" is the story of the medical student who is drawn into the seedy underworld of illegal body modifications. Despite the praise this film and its directors have received, it's a mess of lazy writing, stale revenge-flick tropes, and predictable torture scenes.The first act is promising. Mary Mason is a medical student who is flat broke, and goes to a strip club to apply for a sleazy but high-paying gig that will keep her afloat while she finishes her medical degree. When the mob boss running the club suddenly needs to prolong a mutilated man's life, he enlists her help. Before long, Mary is getting lucrative referrals for increasingly bizarre surgeries.Initially, the film appears to deliver on its promise. Katherine Isabelle is convincing as a competent but vulnerable woman who is out of her league. The narrative is smart and compelling. However, it does not take long for the film to go off the rails and lose us completely. (SPOILERS FOLLOW)Mary is invited to a university faculty party where she is raped by a trusted instructor. While many skilled writers and directors are able to handle the subject matter of rape intelligently, here it's used as a lazy plot device to get her to wholeheartedly turn evil and embrace a life of crime. This new Mary dresses like a dominatrix, enjoys inflicting pain, and revels in the criminal element which once frightened her. It's a huge change brought about in an extremely contrived manner, and it takes the audience out of a film in a way which never allows us to fully return. Mary goes on doing more and more extreme surgeries, but there is nothing really driving the film from this point on. The revenge on the professor is dispensed with almost immediately. The story then plods on with surgery after surgery and the occasional bout of vengeance, but we already know how the story will end. There's no suspense, and we are left to wait until the directors have decided that they are done with us. The Soska Sisters have drawn acclaim for being a much-needed female voice in the male-dominated horror genre. It is thoroughly undeserved. Even if this film had not used rape as a plot device, there is nothing here that hundreds of male directors could not have offered us. The body modification horror is actually quite banal; we're supposed to be shocked by suspension piercing, horns, and sub-dermal implants which are actually completely legal and known to anyone familiar with the real-world body-modification community. ""American Mary"" is the worst kind of horror film, the kind that fails to shock, scare, or amuse its audience.",American Mary
140,nibbler-933-593409,Mary is the only saving grace in this mess,3,25 February 2014,"A film about a struggling medical student thrown into the underground world of body modification sounds like a promising premise. Yet lack believable plot development, and speed in which she accepts the situation she's in with no real explanation makes the story feel rushed losing any credibility right from the off set. There is inconsistent acting throughout from the enjoyable Mary to the woeful strip club owner makes the experience feel disjointed. Yes there is some gore if that's what your after, but most of it is implied rather than on screen and the freaks and bizarre operations Mary conducts seem quite tame to anyone who has watched 'nip tuck'. This also brings up other issues regarding the surgeries themselves, viewers with any knowledge of the medical profession or watch medical shows will immediately pick out errors and the ease in which she conducts them with limited equipment is laughable. The disappointing and abrupt finale is so uninspired you will instantly regret sitting through this waste of time.",American Mary

Don't bother unless you are really into your bad horror? movies. Some of the lines are cringeworthy and so is some of the delivery. The main actress isn't bad to be fair but the writing, direction and the rest of the acting is pretty ludicrous.",American Mary
142,Pillory,Not bad!,7,29 September 2017,"Although I feel as though the film ended on kind of a low note, I'd feel confident recommending American Mary to anyone interested in darker drama films with a dash of gore.The story follows Mary, a grim medical student having trouble paying her bills so she looks for new... ""creative"" ways to get paid. From the get-go Mary is a very likable character that you hope the best for throughout the film. Katharine Isabelle, who you may know from the Ginger Snaps films, is perfect for the role of Mary: a modern day, grown up Wednesday Addams. There is something so appealing in a smart woman who is not opposed to a bit of violence.The move was shot pretty well: the scenes all featured believable and well lived-in sets. Also, the rest of the cast was generally cast pretty well. David Lovgren as the hateable Dr. Grant was a good fit and so was Tristan Risk's eccentric character ""Beatress."" Some minor characters such as Dr. Black and the scenes in which the directors cameoed in felt a little strange and unnecessary.The film definitely had its slow parts but I felt that my attention was held throughout it nonetheless. American Mary is by no means ground-breaking in terms story and script, but it remained interesting and fresh.",American Mary

147,jan-soutar,The Worst. UGH.,1,12 February 2015,"I can't help but live post about this movie called ""American Mary"" on Netflix about a woman who's studying to be a surgeon but winds up getting into extreme body modification and goes on a murdering spree. Spoilers ahead, ACTUALLY NO, F THAT, YOU CANT SPOIL THIS MOVIE ANY WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS... Here goes:OK, got it, Goth Katy Perry lookalike wants to be a surgeon but she's broke so she becomes a stripper. Sure, I'm with you on this ride...Wait, she gives her medical resume to the douche bad actor Mark Ruffalo lookalike strip club owner?!? Wow, way to figure out that exposition hole writers...Huh?!? She's not even in the club 5 min and they're asking her to sew up a dude for $5k? You know what, fine as long as Mark Ruffallo Jr stop talking, or even stops being in the movie at all. And now she's oddly getting clientèle referrals from a woman who's surgically modified to look like Betty Boop named Beatrice. Interesting, still kinda with you. Wait, this other lady wants to look 100% like a doll and get all her lady bits hacked off and sewed up. Really writers?! You don't think it takes more than a hacksaw some stitches and an hour to make that happen...? This is an insult to trans-gender in my mind. Dude, the acting and writing is SOOO BAD. All the male characters are one dimensional and all the female characters are caricatures. It's just... Bad.Also not one actor has chemistry with another.Just IMDb'd this flick and the writers are Female. Why would you write such horribly underdeveloped female characters? How is that even possible? And you're twins?!? Just saw they also directed it. Soooo... Yeah. SMH.Oh god, and the guy who plays the husband of the doll girl, ugh. He gets psychotic because she looks like a doll now. Jesus. Also that's horrible writing just to make more gore and bloodshed for the camera. Why are all the men in this film so outlandish? Not one of them has a subtle thought. Actually I don't think the writers know the meaning of the word. Actually after that Asian dude just yelled ""I'm a cutter MF'er!!!"" I'm sure they don't know the definition of subtlety. IN WHAT WORLD DO YOU JUST TAKE A GLASS OF WHISKEY FROM A WEIRD CREEPY DUDE AT A PARTY THAT IS 90% MEN WEARING BLACK CARRYING AROUND VIDEO CAMERAS??? THIS IS THE WORST PSA EVER. (Or perhaps maybe the best??)Her college doctor professor drugs and rapes her so now TORTURE HIM WITH BODY MODIFICATIONS IN A STRIP CLUB BASEMENT. YES. SURE. WHY NOT. OK, the chemistry between the bouncer and Mary is the first time I saw genuine chemistry. Really good scene for him.Ugh. Penis guy = friend of director who can't act.WHY IS THE COP British?!? Please someone explain this to me!!! Also why do bad writers use their characters names in every piece of dialog?!?Also: LESBIAN SIAMESE TWINS WHO BITE POOR STRIPPERS TONGUES OFF FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON?!? WTF. SERIOUSLY. WTF.The Mark Ruffalo lookalike scummy strip club owner is so bad it's laughable.Really?!? She's going to intimidate some poor girl because she gave a BJ to her strip club owning, bad actor, no chemistry having, Mark Ruffalo lookalike D-Bag? Thank you for setting all the feminism that you built up in the beginning of this film back to Zero. Ugh. And now she's going to give the D-Bag a lap dance and then stab him because ""dream sequence""Seriously, the metal looking bouncer is the best actor in this film. He's awesome. Even as a background performer. Not kidding. Hasn't THIS WOMAN LEARNED NOT TO ACCEPT WHISKEY FROM STRANGERS?!? How many times do you need to get drugged woman?!?So wait, the husband of the doll woman decides to kill his own wife, Betty Boop and Her?!? WORST PLOT POINT EVER. UGH.Oh yeah, right, she's totally gonna stitch herself up with 2 scissors and nothing else and not go into shock. Totally believe that.Uh-oh, Mr. ""I'M A British COP IN America FOR NO REASON"" just figured her out. Wait, she died?!? SHE F'ING DIED AND THATS THE END OF THE MOVIE?!? THE DOLL GIRLS HUSBAND AND HIS PSYCHOPATHIC KNIFE SKILLS ARE WHAT GETS HER KILLED?!? HOW ANTI-CLIMATIC CAN YOU GET?!? WHATS THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE???

148,petersenk22,that was hell of annoying,2,12 June 2013,"Boy, these two sister for sure have no frigging clue about how to tell a story (by film). Don't get me wrong, I think that's (at least potentially) some good material right here - body-modifications in the context of horror. Come on! That sounds a lot more promising than your next silly zombie/ghost/fantasy flick. And I'm pretty sure someone capable (in telling a story and filmmaking - both separate problems) could tell one hell of a story somewhere along that ""Blody Mary"". First to the story-telling: so you have that idea about a film with extreme body-modifications. Great. I already smell(ed) all kind of horrors. But where would you take such a thing and what would you do with it? What side of the human nature are you going to explore? Something along the lines of mutilation/self-destruction versus correction or beautification? Or rather something more wicked along the lines of Frazer's ""On edge""? Nope. You won't get much of anything the like or even slightly interesting. Unforuntately the soska sisters aren't much of explorers (which great film-makers, or more generally story-tellers, are!), so they don't explore (as in illuminate) anything. Not in particular anyways. This is a film where ""being raped"" is all the character development you'll get. But mind you, this is no ""Irreversible"". Not at all.Why was this rape-plot even necessary? As a catalyst? Nah... just to setup that revenge-sub-plot. And why was that really necessary? Because there would be no horror left. That's why. You see, that's the main problem: since not exploring anything, the soska sisters didn't manage to come up with a good (or horrifying) main plot. Extreme body-modification? Sure, no big deal, just count from 100 to zero and you'll be fine! They wake up and live happily ever after. Nothing else happens. No complications whatsoever. Nobody dies. No drama. Nothing. Just the barbie doesn't want to be regarded as sex object, that's why she 1) got herself huge breast implants(?! - and don't even try to argue here; we clearly are shown the scarfs from that booby-surgery) to then 2) remove the nipples (they might have removed brains in an additional step...). So there's nothing. Let's have some rape and then we can have the revenge-horror! DUUHHH. Also there is a cop that doesn't do anything, but hurray: another useless and derivative sub-plot! They tried so hard to create any kind of suspense... it's not even funny and it doesn't work on any level. Second; the filmmaking: it's horrendous. There is no flow, cuts and whole scenes are more often irritating than not. Ultimatively the soska sisters struggle with film language. A lot (to the point that it gets hell(!) of annoying!).",American Mary
149,bearkat03,Awesome find,9,5 September 2013,"I really enjoyed this film. I had actually never heard of it and found it on Amazon. I thought it was very well thought out and very well acted. I couldn't stop watching it. I wont ruin the show but to say I was disappointed with the ending, I did not want it to end. Many of the other reviews stated that this was a show for Women power and that men are a-holes, I did not see that in this film. I was shocked at how quickly she went from innocent student to artist. The interaction between the professor and Mary I felt that portion of the movie wasn't really followed through with throughout the film, especially the last scene that we saw him in; many unanswered questions. Overall, excellent film I will add to my collection.",American Mary

Katherine acted so emotionless throughout the movie that the character became boring and her motivations were not understood. I especially hated her money problems, a American med student would have a crazy amount of debt, and she had already been dealing with it for years. Also the rape scene...ugh...This movies would be-more interesting if based in reality, the surgeries should have been more realistic, arm transplant would be impossible and it would have been cooler if the surgeries would have been failures.

151,hwielbo,"American Mary - freaky, enticing, bloody brilliance.",10,12 January 2013,"Whilst I may not be a pro at reviewing films by any stretch of the imagination, I feel compelled to give American Mary by the Soska sisters the highest praising review I can muster.My expectations for the film were high, having been caught up in the hype around the critically acclaimed body-mod horror - thankfully I was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot of room for error in making the film, but Jen and Sylvia approached the gory side of the film perfectly, letting the viewer see just enough to be grossed out but not enough to warrant a sick bag. Whilst I was expecting fake blood and guts galore, the story and themes within the film were strong enough not to need the usual cheap thrills one might expect in a horror film, in fact I think the film wouldn't have been as good were there more gore. On top of this, the characters were interesting/well developed and thanks to a couple of good casting calls and better performances (namely Katharine Isabelle and Tristan Risk) I found it easy to connect to them in the 103 minutes I watched them on screen.As many others have commented, it's rare to find female horror directors that manage to hit the nail on the head quite as well as the Twisted Twins have manged to here, fingers crossed for a next project equally as exciting.",American Mary
152,agathachrist,All Good Except For The Man-Hating,5,14 April 2013,"I really wasn't expecting much of this going in, so I was pleasantly surprised at the talent on display, much better than the average indie flick from unknown directors. The acting is really first-rate all round, without exception, and with particularly creepy turns by Paula Lindberg and Tristan Risk, especially. Other reviewers have pointed out the debt to Cronenberg, and there is a good deal of that same unsettling fascination for the human body throughout the film. The first third I was very much impressed, at the sound, the cinematography, the atmosphere, and I almost believed the inevitable wouldn't rear its head but no, 40 mins in, up it came, right on schedule.Here's a new Bechdel test for women directors: try, just once, making a film WHERE NOBODY GETS RAPED. Apparently, this is much, much harder than it sounds, but TRY. Push yourself. I know you can do it. Try making a film in which men are actually human beings, and one whole half of the human race, instead of just some monolithic, oppressive 'Them'.This is a misandric film because there are no normal men in it: all of them, without exception, are depicted as evil, weak and pathologically hateful towards women. All men are either thugs or psychopaths. The only even slightly tolerated male character is the bouncer at the strip bar, (a thug Mary can manipulate to do violence for her) who gives her sandwiches and milkshakes, while telling her not to feel bad about killing people: ""you make sure they deserve it, then don't waste a minute of your time after they're done"". Yeah, you go, girl. Oh and there's a detective in it who actually gets to say (to the twisted monster serial killer) ""YOU'RE the victim here, Mary!!"". As usual, a single by-the-books fictional wrong is manipulatively inserted only to justify all the prolonged, orgasmic and utterly reprehensible violence upon men that then follows. None of it was surprising, and all of it is very much a cliché by now. Why do all films by women filmmakers dislike men so much? If you reverse the genders there is no way that this film could even be made, because both women and men would find the violence against women so reprehensible that no-one would show it, it would probably be banned, and certainly no-one would refer to the sick butcher within it as 'sexy'. Correct? But no-one in the reviews here or elsewhere even bats an eyelid at the genocidal hatred here displayed, they simply say it has 'a feminist slant', and leave it at that. And that hatred DOES emanate from feminist propaganda, so I guess they have a point, but it's a pretty ugly message it's selling, when all is said and done.I don't want to completely trash the film, as there are, as I've said, more than a few good points in its favour, but it sure leaves a bad taste in the mouth.",American Mary

American Mary is a difficult movie to place in any one genre which immediately ticked all the right boxes for me, When I first came across the said movie the synopsis had me licking my lips. Right from the opening scene I knew that a strange and intriguing journey had just begun. Everything about this movie had me ""hooked"", Characters that although darkly disturbing made me feel like I really wanted to know them ""for real"", I had previously watched The Soska Twins first movie Dead Hooker In A Trunk which is a twisted fun ride of a B movie (loved it) so in comparison... um well there is none, It is a mountainous leap from the depths to the ultimate level and The Twins should be commended for sharing their masterful surgical show piece, I for one will be waiting in anticipation for the next project to surface even though I See No Evil....",American Mary
155,harmern,One of the most original horror films of recent years American Mary is a darkly comic gore-fest about revenge and back-street body modification.,7,14 August 2013,"One of the most original horror films of recent years American Mary is a darkly comic gore- fest about revenge and back-street body modification.Mary (Katherine Isabelle) is a promising and dedicated medical student who, like all students at one point or another in their studies, falls foul of financial difficulty. Lured into the world of body modification by the handsome prices offered by weirdos with a desire to make themselves more unique, Mary finds a way to continue her studies whilst earning some pretty good money. Wrongly assumed to have become a prostitute by her creepy professor she is invited to a sleazy surgeons party unaware that he has ulterior motives that make her new found profession start to take over her life.American Mary is one of few horror films that's focus is on the female character's strength. Mary goes from being a hardworking model student to a psychotic body modification surgeon in a seedy strip club where she originally auditioned to work. The transformation from quiet student to headstrong surgical dominatrix after being violated is both empowering and contradictory of the traditional representation of women in horror. Katherine Isabelle is as charismatic as she is beautiful and she completely owns the character. She maintains an air of mystery which makes you constantly question her intentions towards the people she meets and her performance will keep you on your toes.Darkly comedic and completely twisted American Mary is one damn good reason for women in the media to be more prevalent in the horror genre; there's no fluff in this film, no cliché crap and very little predictability. It has no eye-roll moments of exploitation and Isabelle's performance is empowering for women as well as easy on the eye for the men; a good balance that excludes neither gender from the audience like so many horror films do. The Soska sisters show their love for the horror genre and its brutality but also its more sexy side (which is weird considering all the blood, but there we go!) and American Mary is clearly a labour of love and not just some uncared for cliché torture porn that's been churned out as a money maker. The settings are seedy and dark and the sleazy underbelly of society is well portrayed but in an almost desirable fashion that enables us to see how easy it is for Mary to get sucked in to this world where money comes easily if you're willing to leave your comfort zone.If you can ignore the occasionally questionable performances American Mary is an all round brilliant horror film that sucks you in to this brutal, seedy, sexy universe for 100 minutes and refuses to let your attention slip. What happens to Mary's professor is as genius as it is disturbing, but you will have to watch to find out for yourself.",American Mary
156,kerrioconnor202,Unbelievable... not in a good way.,2,3 February 2014,"I found this movie very hard to even finish. From the bad acting, to obvious plot add ins (grandma with bad accent always calling to give you some emotional connection to the otherwise completely one dimensional main character) this movie simply wasn't believable in any sense. Even the first surgery performed which included a woman who wanted to have her nipples and vagina cut off and sowed up to resemble a doll so she could be naked without being 'sexualised' was just obviously not very well thought through. The score is almost non existent which makes it even less engrossing and over all there is no vibe within the movie that makes you feel scared or even disturbed in any way. Mostly i just felt annoyed and there were a lot of ""oh come on"" moments for me. The fact that they make the main character appear to be quite cheap (physically e.g wearing skimpy clothing and having terribly tacky black gel nail polish) gives you less sympathy for what happens to her and in general for her money issues. it feels like the script, actors and plot were organized by a teenager with a torture porn fetish and no intention of portraying anything even remotely feasible. i didn't enjoy it at all and wouldn't recommend it.",American Mary

So- stupid. Stupid. Tis a shame. I also can not abide by a medical resident performing surgery without gloves and with her hair not tied up, and with NO CLEANING OF THE FLESH BEFORE SURGERY.
