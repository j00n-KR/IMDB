0,TheLittleSongbird,Terrific and very entertaining,8,9 March 2011,"I really like this movie and the sequel, this one being the better movie. The third act is silly perhaps, and the crime subplot could have been a little better handled. However, a lot of things make this movie terrific and very entertaining.I just love the songs, they are so upbeat and joyful, and they are wonderfully staged and sung. The nuns are great to watch, they are sweet, innocent and so easy to fall in love with. Whoopi Goldberg is absolutely terrific in the lead, she really gives it her all and it comes through loud and clear. The film looks great too, goes at a good pace and has a decent story and funny and charming script. Also, the direction is competent, and Maggie Smith is a welcome presence.Overall, thoroughly enjoyable and if you haven't seen the West End stage show, do, it's even better. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Sister Act
1,bkoganbing,Her own music ministry,7,12 March 2017,"Practically fresh from the Best Supporting Actress Oscar she won for Ghost, Whoopi Goldberg comes back with a pair of films as Deloris Cartier aka Sister Mary Clarence in Sister Act. Probably some of the best publicity the Catholic Church got since Bing Crosby playing a priest.Whoopi is the lead singer in a tribute Supremes act in Reno and mistress of casino owner Harvey Keitel. When she walk in on Harvey dispatching a snitch to the hereafter it's time to flee to the law.What to do with his witness against Keitel who is known to make people disappear is what Detective Bill Nunn has to solve. He calls in a favor and asks Mother Superior Maggie Smith in San Francisco to stash Whoopie in her big city convent under Sister Mary Clarence.Whoopie had a Catholic school experience and didn't take to it all that well is kind of an odd fish in the convent with nuns of all types and experiences. At this point Sister Act does become a lot like those Crosby films because in Going My Way Father O'Malley puts a little life in the church by organizing the neighborhood kids as a choir. And even more so in The Bells Of St.Mary's where the nuns are a rather nice choir.Whoopi puts her own music ministry together with some soul and some more contemporary music than Bing was doing in his day. But she still has Keitel looking to bump her off before trial.Some nice performances from those mentioned and from Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena as her sidekicks in convent mischief.I'm sure Maggie Smith who no doubt saw the Sound Of Music was beginning to create her own lyrics to How Do You Solve A Problem Like Whoopi.No problem for us at all, sit back and enjoy.",Sister Act
2,SnoopyStyle,fair simple comedy,6,21 January 2015,"Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is a singer in a Reno casino lounge act. Her boyfriend Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel) won't leave his wife. To her surprise, he's a mob boss and she witnesses him kill somebody. She becomes a witness for the police and they hide her as a nun in a convent run by the Reverend Mother (Maggie Smith). She clashes with convent life. She befriends some of the other nuns and she coaches the choir to some success. She also pushes the nuns to interact and clean up their rundown neighborhood to the dismay of the Reverend Mother. Meanwhile Vince has a large contract out on her life.The characters are likable. Kathy Najimy is fun. Whoopi has a bit of street wise edge that plays well with the other nuns. It's not anything with big laughs but it gives a few smile-worthy moments. It's conventional in its structure and humor.",Sister Act
3,Hitchcoc,Just Watch and Enjoy and Don't Think Too Much,6,30 December 2016,"Whoopie Goldberg dominates every scene. She is a woman of ""questionable"" character who finds herself in a convent, a true fish out of water. Her dominance on the screen is actually a distraction, however, because she stands in contrast to a group of competent actors who can't hold a candle to her. The sisters of the convent are a bunch of stereotypes. There is the shy one, the giddy crazy one, the severe mother superior, the somewhat irresponsible one. As Whoopie is absorbed into this new life, she begins to show her musical talents, forming a choir. I'm not religious at all, but there is something really crass about taking a group that have given their lives to God that doesn't wash very well. When they sing, they start out with the usual religious stuff but soon move into a more secular, upbeat presentation. It's as if the new arrival is saying, you need to go back to the world you left to give yourself to your God. I know it's a harsh comedy because there are people out there ready to kill Whoopie, but if I were Catholic I'd be a bit annoyed. It plays to the movie audience that thinks, boy those Nuns certainly have a great time! Watchable but hard to fathom as reality.",Sister Act
4,mark.waltz,...And then There Were Nuns.....,7,7 May 2015,"While the idea of an obviously Jewish nun was very funny in the initial plans for Bette Midler to star in this smash hit Touchstone comedy, the ultimate re-casting with Whoopie Goldberg probably did this more good in the long run. The story wasn't anything new, but the execution was so wonderful that it became one of the runaway comedy hits of the summer of 1993 and inspired both a sequel and a hit Broadway musical ultimately produced by the Whoop-ster herself. This basically could almost be called a semi-sequel to the 1960's pair of ""nun"" comedy's, ""The Trouble With Angels"" and ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"", as one of those film's nuns (Mary Wickes) is back again in the habit, and in the follow-up film to this (""Sister Act II, Back in the Habit""), she was once again behind the wheel of a bus, delivering funny lines and gently stealing the film from Whoopie and the most memorial mother superior in film history, the wonderful Maggie Smith.There's no originality in the plot of second string Vegas singer Goldberg hiding out in a convent after seeing her white mobster lover kill a snitch. But what happens in a convent hopefully stays in the convent, that is until Goldberg takes over the ultra flat chorus and turns them into earthly ""Supreme"" beings. Their singing gets the attention of locales not interested in church, and before you can make a sign of the cross, ""his holiness"", the pope, is on his way for a visit, and Goldberg's hiding place is about to be revealed. After all, even in a habit, she looks conspicuously out of place, but even with putting the convent in danger and disturbing Mother Maggie's sanctity with a Catholic version of a nightclub show, she changes many lives, especially hers.It is the music here that thrills, as do many of the wise-cracking comments Goldberg makes. Even the tightly wound Maggie gets in her usual acidic comment when Bishop Joseph Maher reminds her of her duty to those in need and her vow of charity. ""I lied"", she dryly says. Newcomer Kathy Najimy also gets a few good lines in as a plump cheery nun who has a singing voice that could be used to warn of air raids. ""My mother told me I should become either a stewardess or a nun"", she cheerily smiles, adding ""Coffee?"" Newcomer Wendy Makkena is the shy noviate nun who with Goldberg's help proves that she does have a voice. The foursome of Goldberg, Wickes, Najimy and Makkena becomes a lovable clique, while various Broadway veterans surround out the chorus of other nuns as well. The Broadway musical had a long journey from its initial try-outs in Pasadena and Atlanta to New York, and fortunately, what seemed forced and rushed in the early Pasadena staging (where the Reverand Mother was written much more colder than Smith's and lightened up greatly) came together once it got to Broadway. It was a crowd-pleasing hit for two years, showing that with some divine intervention, this lovable film could put a smile on the face of even the staunchest critics. Even Goldberg as producer got into the mix for a bit when she briefly played Mother Superior in London. Seeing both variations of the stage show gave me the deepest respect for the out-of-town tryout, and loving this film as much as I do, I can appreciate the need to have it on stage even if the film in its own way is pretty much a guaranteed sale. So whether your spirituality is total bible thumping or barely existent or maybe even absent, unless you've been grabbed by evil demons which require an exorcism, you can't help but adore this cheerful look into the world of nuns which make them much more human than their undeserved reputations have allowed them to be.",Sister Act
5,lee_eisenberg,"""Some Like It Hot"" meets ""The Flying Nun""!",8,14 October 2007,"I'd heard of ""Sister Act"" for years but never seen it. Now I've finally seen it. While not every scene elicits rip-snorting laughter, the general idea is really funny. Obviously, we should suspect something crazy just knowing that Whoopi Goldberg co-stars with Maggie Smith (plus Harvey Keitel). But once Whoopi enters the convent and has all her trouble adjusting - I just cracked up when she tried to say grace - the real humor starts...with some great music to boot! All in all, director Emile Ardolino followed up ""Dirty Dancing"" with another impressive flick. If you ask me, the real musicals are the sorts of movies that feature music - whether or not the characters sing it - to show an individual's personality, as opposed to just having people break out into song (have you ever actually seen a person do that?). In that sense, ""Sister Act"" is a real musical. I sure recommend it. Really cool. Also starring Bill Nunn and Kathy Najimy.PS: the next time that Whoopi Golberg and Maggie Smith co-starred was the 74th Academy Awards. Whoopi hosted and Maggie was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for ""Gosford Park"".",Sister Act
6,jboothmillard,Sister Act,8,7 July 2005,"She may have won acclaim (and an Oscar nomination) in The Color Purple, and won the Oscar for Ghost, but the leading actress became huge with this very good comedy from director Emile Ardolino (Dirty Dancing). Basically Las Vegas, Reno lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier (Golden Globe nominated Whoopi Goldberg) witnesses his mobster boyfriend (she didn't know that at the time) Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel) killing an employer. She goes to the police, and Lt. Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn) puts her under witness protection, placing her in a convent full of nuns. The only person who also knows about her hiding out is Reverand Mother Superior (Dame Maggie Smith), but she insists that Delores does not arouse suspicion from the real nuns, so she gives her the new identity of Sister Mary Clarence. Obviously for a while Delores is very unhappy in this situation, but after getting in trouble letting Sister Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena) and Sister Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy, a hilariously kooky performance, almost stealing the show) she has a purpose. Being put with the nun choir, Delores finds herself a job, replacing Sister Mary Lazarus (Mary Wickes) as head of the choir, and with her knowledge of Vegas music, she turns the awful singing into crowd bringing spectacle. She also makes a good image for the once failing convent, giving to the public (not just the singing). Of course, there is a point when the Reverand Mother is not confident with herself anymore, and Vincent was due to find Delores, but all is settled in the end. Filled with great comedy, great performances and great singing, just one of the best. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Very good!",Sister Act
7,ccthemovieman-1,Appealed To The Masses,8,25 May 2007,"I enjoyed this when it came out, just as millions of other folks did. It had a nice feel to it, good humor, great music and it didn't offend my at-that-time agnostic beliefs. It even had some action scenes. Many movies which combine genres (i.e. action and comedy) wind up successes. It's not a bad formula.Although Whoopi Goldberg is the undeniable star of this movie, Kathy Najimy as ""Sister Mary Patrick"" almost steals the show as the bubbly nun. However, always a sucker for a pretty and wholesome face, I preferred Mary Wickes as ""Sister Mary Lazarus."" She had this shy countenance to her before blossoming with her voice. Maybe that's why she had the name Lazarus as her personality rose from the dead.Over the years, I watched this three times and that was enough. By the end of the decade, I was a died-in-the-wool Christian conservative, so the very liberal Miss Goldberg lost her appeal to me.",Sister Act
8,ma-cortes,Whoopi takes over a ragtag nuns choir and organizes a swinging musical numbers,6,24 June 2008,"A Nevada club singer named Deloris(Whoopi Goldberg) is forced into the witness protection after accidentally seeing a murder by her mobster lover(Harvey Keitel). The police lieutenant(Bill Nunn) hide her and she takes shelter into a convent ruled by a stiff and waspish Mother Superior(the eminent Dame ,Maggie Smith). The Reno lounge singer donning nun's habit and organising the convent choir formed by sympathetic nuns who steal best laughs(Wendy Makkenna,Kathy Najimy, Mary Wickes, among others) and including a concert with presence of Pope John Pablo II.This amusing film with some genuinely funny moments follows the formula about a fish out water. Motormouth Whoopi Goldberg is pretty well the complete show and good performances for likable nuns,Makenna, Najimy and veteran Wickes and excellent Maggie Smith who disapproves modern methods. The musical numbers with a 'Diana Ross and the Supremes style', magical choreography and songs are catchy and done with gusto. The movie is amused and entertained with bemusing set pieces but don't let it make you expect too much. Well-done musical score with swinging tunes by Marc Shaiman and colorful cinematography by Adam Grenberg. The film is geared directly toward Whoopi Goldberg fans and young viewers .The motion picture is professionally directed by Emile Ardolino and was a surprising box office hit. Ardolino's speciality was dance and musicals. As it was, a semi-musical 'Dirty dancing', made his name in the cinema after years of Television specials and almost all the best moments in his few subsequent pictures were musical ones. Another speciality were comedies, such as he proved in '3 men and a little lady' and 'Chances are' . 'Dirty dancing and Sister act'were the biggest hits of his short films career , but he early died from AIDS. Followed by 'Sister act : Back in the habit', with similar casting and set in a rundown High School.",Sister Act
9,moonspinner55,Sweetly out of tune with reality,6,16 January 2004,"Watching this again on TV the other night, I couldn't help but noticing how polished and smooth ""Sister Act"" is--it looks like the perfect sitcom pilot. As a feature film, it seems a little cornball, with a completely unrealistic convent and nuns with different, colorful personalities. They unknowingly welcome a Reno lounge singer into their fold; she's on the lam from her mobster boyfriend (Harvey Keitel, game but looking a little strained). Film plays directly to the audience--after a one-liner, you almost expect a laugh-track; sometimes the sisters themselves provide a united chuckle. Flat at the beginning, Whoopi Goldberg loosens up somewhere in the middle, but she is overdirected and never gets to be human. **1/2 from ****",Sister Act
10,edwagreen,Sister Act-This Class of Nuns Rates ****,10,16 June 2007,"Terrific Whoopi Goldberg vehicle where she portrays a lounge singer on the run from gangster boyfriend Harvey Keitel. It seems that she has witnessed his goons killing the chauffeur.Whoopi is sent to a convent to hide by the police until the case comes up in court. This ""Some Like It Hot"" idea soon expands into ""Going My Way,"" where Whoopi becomes Sister Mary Clarence. She meets up with crusty Conservative Maggie Smith has the head nun. The two clash as Sister Clarence breathes new life into the convent by taking over the chorus and really livening things up.As for Maggie Smith, she gives one of her best performances since her 2 Oscar winning performances years earlier.The ending, like the rest of the film, is just hilarious. It's an exercise in smart spiritual healing.",Sister Act
11,studioAT,In the habit of laughing,5,3 January 2012,Sister Act is one of those films that you can sit back and just enjoy. If you don't really think about the details of the plot too much you'll find that this film is a fun way to spend ninety minutes and offers a great performance from Goldberg in what probably is her signature role.The basic concept in itself is fun and there are some nice laugh out loud moments along with some nice heartfelt moments.Goldberg is well supported by the actresses playing the nuns and Downton Abbey's Maggie Smith is on top form as the droll head nun.Overall this is a fun film worth watching if you haven't seen it already.,Sister Act

13,hitchcockthelegend,Mary Clarence? Like Clarence Williams III from The Mod Squad?,7,20 June 2020,"When a worldly singer witnesses a mob crime, the police hide her as a nun in a traditional convent where she has trouble fitting in.Whoopi Goldberg is the sister act of the title, and boy does she have a great time with the characterisation. It's hardly pulling up any trees, and it holds few surprises, yet it's so warm and gentle with its humour it's near impossible to dislike.The laughs obviously come from Goldberg's street wise gal trying to adapt to life in a convent. The big message that unfolds, as she gets more at ease with her surroundings, is that not only can earthy girls come to be honourable by learning new fortitudes, but also that they can positively affect those around them in a perceived stuffy environment.The trajectory of the nunnery choir under Goldberg's tutorship - from wailing cats to cherubic angels - is the film's highlights, while Maggie Smith as the prim and proper Mother Superior is class unbound. Harvey Keitel as the gangster who is after our sister's blood is wasted, and the ending is never really in doubt, yet this is a good pick me up movie, undemanding fun for those after a quick smiley fix. 7/10",Sister Act
14,CinemaSerf,"""Vince - we can't waste a nun!""",7,18 October 2021,"Whoopi Goldberg and Dame Maggie Smith are on top form in this engaging comedy thriller. Goldberg ""Deloris van Cartier"" witnesses her gangster boyfriend commit murder. When she is drafted in by the police to testify against him, she is put into a witness protection scheme with a difference. She is to hide out in a convent under the tutelage of Dame Maggie's ""Mother Superior"". After initial clashes on just about everything, Goldberg - ""Sister Mary Clarence"" - finally finds a sense of purpose with the choir - and soon that choir is attracting global attention, even the Pope is coming to hear them sing. Of course, the publicity isn't all good - and her boyfriend ""Vince"" (Harvey Keitel) soon tracks her down. Can she be rescued from his evil clutches? This is an enjoyable film to watch. Once it gets going, there are plenty toe-tapping musical numbers and both women at the top of the bill, as well as the feisty Mary Wickes (""Sister Mary Lazarus""), are clearly having some fun having a funny and well paced script to work too. The conclusion is pretty much as you'd expect, descending just a little too much into slapstick for my liking before a rousing Papal audience! To be honest - there is nothing here not to like. Good fun!",Sister Act
15,Calicodreamin,A personal favorite,8,16 August 2021,Sister Act is a personal favorite of mine that has withstood the test of time. The storyline is unique and lighthearted and Goldberg is in her prime. The whole cast of Nuns bring different personalities and humor. The 'Hail Holy Queen' scene is absolute beauty.,Sister Act
16,view_and_review,Most favorable nun movie you'll ever see,7,9 April 2020,"I'm not a big Whoopi fan. In fact, I generally avoid her movies, but I remember this being a good movie when I was younger. I was pleased to see that it was better than I remember. This is the funniest Whoopi Goldberg movie I've ever seen. Let me rephrase that: this is the only funny Whoopi Goldberg movie I've ever seen.Goldberg plays Deloris Van Cartier, a so-so lounge singer in a dive of a hotel called the Moonlite Lounge in Reno, Nevada. When she witnesses her boyfriend, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), kill a man she goes on the run. Agent Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn) hid her in a convent in San Francisco until she could testify against Vince at a trial. While there Deloris assumes the alias Sister Mary Clarence and revamps the convent. She got the choir on track, helped clean up the church, and did outreach work on the streets. It was nothing short of miraculous.I can't even say why, but seeing those prude old nuns singing and bopping tickled me. The older the nun the funnier she was. It was a very good natured movie that involved Catholicism without needing exorcisms and involved nuns without needing therapy. I think this is the most favorable movie you'll ever see about nuns and it was fantastic.",Sister Act
17,safenoe,A feel good movie,9,28 November 2016,"I loved Sister Act. I know Sister Act isn't a religious faith-based movie, but for a Hollywood mainstream feature, it had a sympathetic look at mainstream religion through Whoopi Goldberg's performance as lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier. The scene at the end where Harvey ""The Piano"" Keitel's character orders the execution of Deloris by his henchman, there was an in-depth calm of Deloris. For this scene alone Whoopi should have been nominated for an Oscar.Maggie ""Downton Abbey"" Smith also appears in Sister Act.",Sister Act
18,elo-equipamentos,A Sinner in the Habit,7,31 May 2017,"Musical comedy that's Sister Act, betting in the formula that two different person can lives together, that's the main point when you bring a sinner singer running for the mob, who hidden in a Covent managed for a strong moral code, the clash between Deloris and Mother Superior is simply unaivoidable, meanwhile the chemistry for both powerful actress Goldberg and Smith gave to the movie what it needs and end up to get strong when the musical acts finally build another atmosphere for the whole story, enjoyable movie even today, It was released on DVD in Brazil without dubbing it's a crying shame, so l'd to watch it on Netflix that has a dubbed classic version.Resume:First Watch: 1996 / How many: 4 / Source: TV-Netflix / Rating: 7.5",Sister Act
19,JamesHitchcock,Sister Whoopi,7,12 August 2020,"Deloris Van Cartier, a lounge singer, in Reno, Nevada, is having some problems with her lifestyle. Her musical career seems to be going nowhere. Her married casino owner boyfriend Vince LaRocca refuses to divorce his wife and marry her, citing his Catholic religion according to which divorce is a sin, although it appears to have escaped his notice that according to Catholic moral teaching adultery is also a sin. Deloris's life, however, is about to get a whole lot worse. There are two more of the Ten Commandments which have escaped Vince's notice, namely ""Thou shalt not steal"" and ""Thou shalt not kill"". His casino ownership is only a front for gangsterism, and Deloris accidentally witnesses Vince having one of his associates, whom he suspects of being an informer, executed.Horrified, Deloris reports what she has seen to the police, but thereby puts herself in danger from Vince, who would have no qualms about killing anyone who crosses him, including his own mistress. To protect Deloris pending Vince's trial, at which she will be the main witness, the officer in charge of the case arranges for her to be hidden in a San Francisco convent. The Mother Superior, who has reluctantly been persuaded to go along with the scheme, knows of Deloris's real identity and the reasons why she has been placed in the convent, but the other nuns simply know her as ""Sister Mary Clarence"", believing her to be a nun who has arrived from another, more liberal, convent.The plot of ""Sister Act"" essentially reverses that of ""The Sound of Music"" in which a music-loving nun goes out into the world and brings the gift of music to those she meets, especially the children of the von Trapp family. In ""Sister Act"" a musician takes refuge in a nunnery and brings the gift of music to the nuns. The Mother Superior, despairing of finding any other role for Deloris, gives her the task of running the convent's musical life, something she achieves with spectacular success. Before her arrival musical standards in the convent are dismally low; by the time she leaves their choir, performing jazz and popular music as well as traditional, have become so famous that even the Pope, on a visit to America, wants to hear them. (There is a parallel with the way in which Maria transforms the hitherto unmusical von Trapps into a singing group capable of winning a gold medal at the Salzburg Festival). Another influence on the plot may have been the 1989 version of ""We're No Angels"" about two criminals taking refuge in a monastery.The plot seems very farfetched, but then this is a comedy, and comedies are not always bound by the rules of probability which apply in the real world. ""Sister Act"" was, in fact, one of the most successful comedies of the early nineties, and much of its success is, in my view, down to the contrast in acting styles between its two leading actresses, Whoopi Goldberg as Deloris and Maggie Smith as the Mother Superior. Whoopi (nee Caryn Johnson) is a natural-born comedian, as one might gather from her stage name; no aspiring tragedienne is going to name herself after a whoopee cushion. She has made some dull films- ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" comes to mind- but if she gets the right material, as she does here, she can be a delight to watch. Her Deloris is a determined, feisty lady, fizzing with enthusiasm for music making.Maggie Smith is an actress I would normally associate with serious drama rather than comedy, and her Mother Superior is played with a poker face, the straight woman to Deloris's comedian. Part of the comedy is the way in which Deloris and the Mother Superior, initially poles apart, move towards one another and meet half-way. Deloris starts off as a secular-minded young woman who finds the nuns dull and stuffy; the Mother Superior, an elderly traditionalist Catholic, played by Smith with an upper-class British accent, disapproves of what she sees as the younger woman's immoral lifestyle. By the end of the film, however, she has come to appreciate both Deloris's dedication to her music and her courage in standing up to the moral evil represented by Vince. Deloris, in her turn, has come to appreciate the spiritual values which the nuns represent.The film gave rise to a sequel, ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" from the following year; it is a long time since I last saw it, but from what I remember it was something of a disappointment. The original, however, is a witty and agreeable comedy, with two fine performances at its heart. 7/10",Sister Act
20,MovieAddict2016,Too routine to be enjoyable.,5,9 May 2005,"""Sister Act"" was a huge success when it came out. Harvey Keitel was at the top of his game in '92 - ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Bad Lieutenant"" and this had sparked his career up and Whoopi Goldberg was a couple years off her Academy Award-winning performance in ""Ghost."" So, I guess their names attracted the moviegoers. However the premise really is dull and has been used way too much -- a person on the run hides with the church. This happened a few years earlier in ""We're No Angels"" and again in ""Nuns on the Run."" ""Sister Act"" features Goldberg in the hapless role of the woman whose boyfriend (Keitel) tries to kill her because he's in the Mafia and what not.I found this quite boring and I already knew literally everything that was going to happen because it was so utterly clichéd and routine. Goldberg is OK but not as funny as she or the director thinks and Keitel is on cruise control.""Sister Act"" might have made a fuss in '92 but by today's standards (and, I suspect, even back then) it's a waste of space. The fact that they immediately cashed in with a sequel only one year later is worse than most of the sequel syndromes Hollywood is suffering from today -- at least ""xXx2"" came out more than one year after the original!",Sister Act
21,OllieSuave-007,Great Whoopi Goldberg Comedy!,10,9 November 2013,"This is a great comedy starring Whoopi Goldberg as Reno lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier who witnesses a homicide committed by her lover. As a result, a cop hides her in a traditional convent, where she has to pose as nun Sister Mary Clarence.Goldberg delivered in her role as a nun trying to fit in with the others, providing drama and comic relief in a serious setting. Her witnessing the crime and having to hide in the convent just adds on to her troubles of being a struggling singer, providing a solid plot line. And, the subplot about the nuns' tone-death choir in their endangered convent is interwoven in the story very well, giving intrigue and suspense to the fast-paced movie.Maggie Smith gave a very eloquent and commanding performance as Mother Superior; my favorite line of hers is when she said to Sister Mary Clarence, ""God has put you here, take the hint."" And, Kathy Najimy as cheerful Sister Mary Patrick, Wendy Makkena as mellow Sister Mary Robert and Mary Wickes witty as Sister Mary Lazarus each gave charming performances, helping Sister Mary Clarence adjust to life in the convent.I enjoyed how Goldberg's characters establishes her new purpose in life as she helps the Choir become better singers and help spread new life in the church, trying to save it from being closed. This leads on to an exciting climax and a rescue mission by the nuns.Overall, this is one of my favorite movies and all comedy lovers should catch this film.Grade A",Sister Act
22,sddavis63,Great Cast; Fun Movie; Excellent Music,8,27 June 2002,"What's not to like about this fun movie? Whoopi Goldberg is great as Delores Van Cartier, a second rate singer who performs at the Reno Casino owned by her married mobster boyfriend. After witnessing him commit a murder, she agrees to testify against him and the police protect her by putting her into a convent, where she ends up becoming the choir director, revitalizing the church with her own version of gospel music, and eventually leading the choir in a performance for the Pope.The cast - beginning with Goldberg - is great. I especially enjoyed Wendy Makkena as the painfully shy Sister Mary Robert and Kathy Najimy as the outrageously outgoing Sister Mary Patrick.It's a bit of a stretch in places. A church is not going to be revitalized just because it starts using different music, and Lt. Souther (Bill Nunn) makes some strange decisions. After insisting that the convent is the perfect place for her because ""I'm the only one who knows you're here,"" he visits her (could easily have been followed), he phones her (line could have been tapped), he has invoices for the police payments to the convent hand delivered to his desk even when he's not there. Not the most brilliant cop in the world, but overall this is a fun movie. I've enjoyed it many times, and probably will enjoy it many times more.8/10.",Sister Act
23,ElMaruecan82,Nun can be fun ...,7,23 January 2013,"With their long black dresses, white veils, fully covered bodies, vows of humility, silence and last but not least, chastity, nuns crystallize every single element that stand against our usual enjoyment of female screen characters. Go figure why there is a fistful of movies involving nuns and when they do, either they have a troubled past, or it's for pure comedic purposes  and don't get me started on films that exploit nuns to arouse other types of reactions, this doesn't belong to a family film's review (wink, wink). Anyway, since nuns became the epitome of ""uncoolness"", it was about time a film did justice to them and made us laugh not at them, for once, but WITH them, and that's the merit of ""Sister Act"", one of the most acclaimed comedies of the 90's, starring Whoopi Goldberg, probably in her most defining, if not iconic, role. Yet, as original as it is, the premise of the film that drained the first spectators, far exceeds its reputation. Indeed, for a production labeled as a comedy, ""Sister Act"" features an unusual dryness on gags and funny lines  at least once you get used to the whole comedy of situation resulted from the presence of Deloris Van Cartier, a loudmouth Reno lounge singer, girlfriend of a Mafia boss, in a Roman Catholic convent. Yet ""Sister Act"" possesses a strange power, for some reason, it's quite impossible to dislike it, I don't know where it's coming from, but I can say with no doubt that ""Sister Act"" is touched by a sort of divine grace. I could say that the film's success and merit owed a lot to Whoopi Goldberg's sparkling performance, not just funny but warm, sweet and caring. But she doesn't carry the film alone; there are two nuns, no three (well, make them four) that follow her in the gentlest and sweetest way. The quiet and meek Mary Robert, the happy and funny- looking Mary Patrick and an scene-stealing Mary Wickles, as the elderly Mary Lazarus, who is to ""Sister Act"" what Joe Vitterelli was to ""Analyse This"". And as (literally) the straight person of this joyful comedy, granted she doesn't have the most adorable mug of the bunch, Maggie Smith plays the Mother Superior, who welcomes Whoopi Goldberg in her community and invites her to find a meaning to her life during her temporary exile in nunnery. ""Sister Act"" is the kind of comedy that makes you genuinely smile through the characters' interactions and the whole positive feeling they convey, but I could say the same thing about ""Wayne's World"", a film made me laugh more. ""Sister Act"" was as successful, but comically speaking, the direction had a sort of annoying straightforward way to get to its point. All right, we don't care much about the whole crime subplot that forced Deloris to hide, but when you involve an actor of Keitel's caliber, you can make an effort. For instance, there's a very interesting connection between Whoopi Goldberg and Bill Nunn, as the cop who suggests she goes into witness protection program and puts her in the convent. He takes all the precautions in order to keep the place secret but if I told you, how the secret was revealed, you would cry in disbelief. It's not even my intent to be critical regarding the plot, any comedy can get away with that kind of criticism, but the relative absence of gags couldn't put my thoughts elsewhere. The film is full of smile-inducing moments, but I couldn't help but noticing some great opportunities for funnier situations, sadly missed. What's left at the end: a wonderful, performance from Whoopi Goldberg, great interactions with Maggie Smith, a gallery of unforgettable characters  and music. Is that enough? In fact, it is. If it's not the comedy of the year, it touches the heart through the simple power of music, the only gift Deloris could give. In fact, it's like ""Sister Act"" inhabits the spirit of its own plot, the power of music to redeem the vilest soul, and to forgive the lousiest direction, to give a sort of meaning. Yes, they sing badly in the beginning, and it's only a matter of time before they reveal their talent, but we don't care, it's the first film with nuns singing, swinging, and if only for that ""Sister Act"" deserves some praise, especially since the songs carry this religious aura that made them irresistible for any heart, whether it has faith or not. So, the real star of the film is music and its endearing power, as for the little clichés, they would become so blatant in the pointless sequel it inspired, that they're almost imperceptible in the first film. And my first memory of ""Sister Act"" takes me back to the 1990's, a night I couldn't resist to the climactic finale when they were all singing ""I Will Follow Him"" in front of a prestigious guest. At that moment, the film got me, and whenever I saw it on TV, I couldn't wait for the lousy crime plot to end, so I could feel the song penetrating my soul. Well, the crime plot wasn't that bad, it featured a nice twist on the 'villainous monologue' to allow the criminal to be arrested before killing Deloris, but well, with a bunch of nuns in the den of sins and perversions, they could have done better.So, let's face it, the holy Trinity of the film, no blasphemy intended is Whoopi, the nuns and the Music, the Music as the Holy Spirit that improve the way to communicate our deepest and most intimate convictions: something, we call Faith.",Sister Act
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Sister, can you spare a dime?",5,1 April 2020,"'Sister Act (1992)' is absolutely fine. I mean, really, it's fine. That's kind of the problem, though. It's utterly unmemorable. It doesn't do anything badly - in fact, it's competently constructed in every aspect - but it doesn't do anything particularly well, either. It's also so predictable that you could probably turn it off at any point and still have a good idea how the rest of the story is going to play out. Of course, it has moments that work better than others; the segments in which our hero helps to train a choir stand out as the picture's best, for example. However, as a whole, the piece is kind of generic and bland. It's not bad by any means, just mediocre. 5/10",Sister Act
25,ericstevenson,It's an act alright,8,19 June 2018,"Whoopi Goldberg seems like one of the nicest actresses out there. I realize that, looking back, she really did make a lot of bad movie decisions. It's hard to forgive someone for being in ""An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn!"". I admit that this wasn't really that funny, but it's still an enjoyable movie. This is one of those movies I remember seeing back when they rented out movies in stores. The basic plot is that Whoopi disguises herself a nun as part of the Witness Protection Program after seeing his boyfriend kill someone.Nowadays, we have so many awful religious movies. I guess this one wasn't that much about faith. It was more about learning to fit in and making new friends. It helps that the music is really good. Everyone truly looks like they're having a good time with this movie. At 100 minutes, it seems like it's just the perfect length too. I wish she'd star in more movies. ***",Sister Act

27,ironhorse_iv,Sister Act is a blessing in disguise. I kinda like this movie,6,8 June 2015,"This movie is highly underrated! It's a sin that a lot of people haven't heard of it. It should be appreciated, more! This divine comedy was really funny and very uplifting. Directed by Emile Ardolino, Sister Act tells the story of a Reno lounge singer, Delores Wilson AKA Delores Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) who has been put under protective custody in a San Francisco church convent, due to being a witness to a murder, committed by mobster/ex-boyfriend, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel). While, in hiding, living under the name, ""Sister Mary Clarence"". She has a hard time, fitting in, with the strict rule set of the Church. It wasn't until, she was force to help the struggling church choir to make some needed improvements that she sees the errors of her sinful ways; while also showing the church, that a little fun and freedom, isn't so bad. Without spoiling the movie, too movie, I have to say, the movie features some really good musical arrangements by song writer, Marc Shaiman. I like how, he was able to change old church hymns and classic R&B hits, into something new, by mixing them. A normal rendition like 'My Guy' by Mary Wells, transform into a cool faux-gospel number, when the movie substitutes ""My Guy"" with ""My God"". Another great example is making the boring, Salve Regina gospel into a rock & roll-infused version of the song. It was perfect and so hip. My favorite song has to be 'I will follow him', the Little Peggy March cover. It really match, with the tone of the film, so well. This movie showed that worship can honestly, be awesome! All churches should do this. My only complaint is that the movie church choir didn't sing enough songs- it takes 30 minutes into the film, until Dolores finally get to teach the church choir, and a few minutes, more, until they start to sing. That sub-plot is the bread and butter, for this movie and seeing it, lag, behind, is a bit disappointing. I really didn't like the pacing for this film. The movie should had focus on the singing, a lot, more. I also hate misused of certain Mo-Town hits. Songs like ""(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave"" are introduce in the beginning in the film like the other songs, but this is the only classic R&B song that doesn't get the gospel treatment, later on. So it makes me, wonder, why the song was even there in the first place. I have a feeling, that the song did have a church choir version, but it was delete from the film. Another thing, I really didn't like, is the Animal House style, end credits. The movie's end credit kinda ruin the film's message. It shows that Delores didn't change much. As much as the ending, hurts the writing. I'm surprise, how well-done the script was. As production commenced, the script was rewritten by a half dozen screenwriters, including famous names, like Carrie Fisher, Robert Harling, and others, helping the product. Some people believe it was written, too well. Most of these critics claim that most of the story was stolen from books such as ""The Harlem Street Nun,"" an autobiography and 'A Nun in the Closet'. Despite that, I love the fish out of water conflict between old school traditional ways being challenge by new school approach. I love the clever funny jokes like the Blue Brothers cameo. None of the jokes, seem too blasphemous or offensive to the faithful. For the most part, it makes you want to rejoice along with the rest of the choir, and their enthusiasm feels very infectious. It's a lot of fun and makes you feel good in the process. I got the habit of laughing. However, the whole nun to rescue, third act was a bit over the top. I will have nun of that. When the script was brought up to Disney, they wanted actress Bette Midler for the main role. However, Midler turned down the role, fearing that her fans would not want to see her play a nun. While, I agree that real life singer and comedian, Bette Midler would make a great Delores. I have to say, the film's replacement, Whoopi Goldberg wasn't that bad. It's arguably Whoopi Goldberg's best role ever, besides 1990's Ghost. Still, there were some jarring issues about her performance. I really couldn't buy into her being a beautiful lounge singer. While, she did indeed could sing in real life. She doesn't have the musical presence that Midler has. The movie doesn't really showcase, Goldberg's singing ability that well. The whole music sequence, she did in the beginning, was kinda rushed, and felt more, like a comedy act, than a music act. Her verbal sparring with Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) was her strong suit. I love the exchange, between them. Remind me, so much of 1940 film ""Brother Orchid"". Maggie Smith manages to inject a great deal of much needed depth into her thinly written character. The other characters in the film, are somewhat one-dimensional stereotypes, but they work. I love the joy that Kathy Najimy's is able to bring as the perpetually optimistic Sister Mary Patrick. She just shines with her sunny disposition. Wendy Makkena as the shy Mary Roberts who finds her voice is amazing to watch as well. She is so cute. Mary Wickes also puts in a good appearance as the stern Sister Mary Lazarus. She gets a lot of great one liners, and her timing is spot on. Even the villains weren't that bad. Harvey Keitel is passable, but his part feels inconsequential when compared to the others. Overall: While, the movie is a bit predictable, and often full of musical clichés. It does have some charm. Bless you movie. Bless you. The film was followed by a 1993 sequel, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. Check it out, as well, if you want to.",Sister Act

30,sol-,Get Thee to a Nunnery,6,4 August 2017,"Placed in witness protection after accidentally seeing her mobster boyfriend commit a heinous murder, a small-time Reno singer has trouble adjusting to her new identity as a nun in this Whoopi Goldberg comedy. There are some groan-inducing fish-out-of-water moments early on, such as Goldberg struggling to make it through grace, however, the film improves as she begins to embrace the convent life, finding a new passion in life when placed in charge of the convent's second-rate choir. Indeed, the film's best scenes involve the nuns singing religiously themed variations on popular rock tunes, including a clever rendition of the Mary Wells song 'My Guy'. It even reaches the point where the success of the choir is so interesting that the thugs tracking down Goldberg feel like a distraction when they suddenly reappear towards the end. The film is also let down by some simple stereotype supporting characters, with only Maggie Smith really standing out. Smith is actually funny than Goldberg, given all the best lines (""People want to kill you. Everyone who has met you I imagine.""), however, she is ultimately merely a supporting player. Those interested in a comedy where Goldberg steals every scene she is in may be better served by 'Ghost', but this is a decent little film with even a solid message or two about believing everyone has the capacity for change.",Sister Act

Goldberg hits the ball out of the park in this movie. She's warm, funny and very likeable. The music is also very strong. ""Sister Act"" always hits the spot. I plan on putting it back into my regular rotation. Honorable mention: Maggie Smith.",Sister Act
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Whoopi and some catchy music make ""Sister Act"" memorable enough",6,18 June 2010,"When you watch a film like ""Sister Act"" you have to wonder how it's possible Whoopi Goldberg has more different awards (Oscar, Tony, daytime Emmy) than most actors. Quite simply, Goldberg always seems to find warm and genial moments. Although her transformation from the frantic, angry and loud Deloris to that of the inspiring nun Sister Mary Clarence is far from gradual, the metamorphosis is profound and along withs some fun music, keeps ""Sister Act"" from being a tremendous waste.Deloris is a doo-wop singer playing the mistress to a mob boss (Harvey Keitel) when she witnesses a murder and her man tries to whack her. After going to the police, she's shipped from Reno to San Francisco as part of witness protection. The police lieutenant decides a convent would be the safest place for her to hide, so she becomes a ""nun"" at St. Catherine's where her heretical ways begin to rub off on the other nuns much to the dismay of mother superior (Maggie Smith).Now, as Sister Mary Clarence, she helps (and with surprising speed) turn around the choir and turn them into gospel singers. Unfortunately, this premise is not nurtured nearly as carefully as it ought to be by screenwriter Joseph Howard, which might explain why his only two film credits are this film and its sequel. The atonal choir magically sings with a few quick tips, she becomes choir director without much ado and none of the sisters resist the gospel/doo-wop flair, they just start singing one of the hymns that way out of nowhere. The music is catch and fun and clever, but the potential is wasted. ""Sister Act"" is a well-known movie, but think of what it could've been with so more care.The mob element is a joke. If only it stayed out of the story for a longer period of time and let the plot focus on the church just a bit longer and Sister Mary Clarence's radical new changes. Making ""Sister Act"" a movie musical instead of having three choir performances total in the run time would've made a world of difference. Those few songs alone are enough to convince you you're enjoying yourself. Without them, ""Sister Act"" would become a scatter- brained cross-up between religion and the mob and could rank among the most ridiculous films ever made.In reflection, it's amazing how crucial the Whoopi element is to this movie. She becomes one of the more likable mother hen figures after she finally drops the mean and sassy comedian act. There are a handful of decent nun jokes, but the human factor that Whoopi adds in the second half keeps the film alive. The way Sisters Mary Patrick and Mary Robert gravitate toward her is one of the few organic components of the movie.Despite barely giving itself time to cook, ""Sister Act"" stays memorable through the music and through Whoopi.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Sister Act

Sister Act is a 1992 comedy musical starring Whoppi Goldberg,Maggie Smith,Kathy Najimy and Harvey Kietel.Whoppi Goldberg plays Dolores a nightclub singer who witnesses a murder thanks to her mob boyfriend (played by Harvey Kietel)causing her to go into the witness protection programme. From there she goes undercover as a nun and hides out in a convent, under the guise of St Mary Clarence and the convent is ran by Maggie Smith(Downton Abbey,Harry Potter franchise). At first Smith doesn't take a shine to Goldberg but since the choir isn't doing that great, Goldberg decides to take matters into her own hands and decides to make the choir sing better by being their conductor. Will the choir improve with their singing? And will Dolores ex boyfriend track her down.Bottom line this was a great film. I watched it so many times as a kid and it was funny. I always liked Whoppi Goldberg as she is a very funny actress.Also starring in this movie is Kathy Najmmi from Hocus Pocas and that hilarious flick Rat Race.Check it out and see what you think of it.",Sister Act

She plays Deloris Van Cartier, an Las Vegas singer who has witnessed a mob murder gets protection in one place she most dreads: a convent. That's where she went to school in her youth, and cause quite a racket there. She goes in as a nun and seems to have trouble fitting in. Seeing it's so dead there, she gets with the other sisters to lighten it up a bit. She explains to the mother superior why people don't come to church. When she does that, more people started coming to the church because Sister Mary Clarence(Goldberg) made it happen. When the mobsters started to close in on her, it's up to everyone in the convent to lend a hand. I liked the part where she was praying, and the other goons decides to the same. She suddenly hit them in the jewels. Miracles do happen, even in ""sin city"". The scenes are great, I liked the part where Kathy Najimy's character showed off a little too much in dancing, but the rest of the crew just played along with her knowing they were laughing with her and not at her.

Goldberg has boldly gone where no nun has gone before.As Deloris van Cartier,a Reno night club singer who witnesses what used to be called a gangland slaying and is hidden by police in a convent,she is transformed into Sister Mary Clarence,contrary,opinionated and loud - very loud.She is a problem to her ex - boss/lover(Mr H.Kietel not really extending himself)who wants her rubbed out,to the police who want her as a witness and to the Reverend Mother(Miss M.Smith - relatively restrained) who doesn't want her at all. Miss Smith's solution is to put her in charge of the choir - if a motley collection of nuns singing in more different keys than you could shake a stick at can be referred to as such. Whilst ""Sister Act"" falls a little short of ""The Usual Suspects"" in the Surprise Endings Stakes it is a very funny movie with Miss Goldberg at full tilt throughout.There are a lot of obvious nun jokes and they all get an airing,but in between the bursts of hysteria there are some felicitous moments.....(""Now they were NUNS.""says one of the older Sisters about her mentors in the good old days).

42,nycritic,Nun on the Run,8,13 November 2005,"Referencing two movies about people on the run from gangsters, NUNS ON THE RUN and most notable SOME LIKE IT HOT, this time SISTER ACT flips the genders and makes its central character a lounge singer named Delores vanCartier who has an apparent knack for getting herself into some pretty heavy situations. As seen in the first reel, she's one of those girls whom we know somewhere along the line they will wind up in the wrong side of the tracks. In the next shot, our predictions are made true when we see her performing for peanuts in a Reno lounge act doing covers for old Motown songs. What she doesn't realize is that she will sing those same songs, but in a totally different, more religious context.This is the setup that Emile Ardolino in one of his final films brings to the screen, and it's one that is genuine entertainment if you don't want too much analysis of a cinematic nature. Even though the story is more or less a retread and has the look and the feel of a thousand movies we've seen before, there is an honesty in the performances and the handling of the material even when at times it can be seen as a vehicle for Whoopi Goldberg. Her introduction to the sisters is a total hoot, and much of Maggie's Smith's best lines and facial expressions conveying her inability to handle this kind of situation are found here as well as Kathy Najimy's ability to steal scenes as the perpetually optimistic Sister Mary Robert. The script allows for these characters to also grow and not just be foils to Goldberg: Ruth McKenna literally finds her voice and Kathy Najimy just shines. Even Maggie Smith's Mother Superior, with her cool, icy exterior, shows that she's also human and not just a walking religious image.A surprise hit when it was released in 1992, SISTER ACT spawned a much less successful sequel, SISTER ACT: BACK IN THE HABIT, which proved that if it isn't broken, why fix it.

43,raulfaust,Break The Ice,8,29 December 2013,"""Sister Act"" is a movie that I vaguely remember seeing some random scenes when I was much younger, and all I knew before it started is that there would be a church's choir. One thing that I may congratulate is the basic premise of the movie: a crime witness hiding in a traditional convent. I don't know why, but when I saw the sheriff sending her there, I kept thinking how genius these filmmakers were; that was such an original and creative plot-- hey, maybe that's why I thought that! Sometimes the whole thing looks a little formulaic and predictable, but the storyline is so charming and involving that you can easily forget about those flaws. Maggie Smith is so good at playing the Mother Superior as Whoopi is at the playing the nuts singer, showing how professional they are in their work. Another good point about this movie is that it doesn't sell an idea whether religions are right or wrong; it just shows how some religions CAN change-- if they want to-- without losing their main objective, which depends on each one. Some believe in love and peace, whilst others believe in ""war against the enemies"", but they all have their goals-- at least, in theory. Furthermore, the movie still delivers some beautiful scenes with the nuns singing in the choir, which ended up being unintentionally?) emotional-- why mother surely would cry throughout. It's just a shame it has just a score of 6.0 on IMDb, considering it's one of the best comedies made in the nineties! Update: I just found out the convent hiding thing has been used in past movies, even before this one, so it's not totally original as I thought it was.",Sister Act

You don't have to be a fan of these kind of films to love this movie. Most movies I'm into are horror films but I love Sister Act so that shows how good this movie is if it can win me over like that. Brilliant music, very fine acting and a delight to watch. This is one of the best family comedies I have seen and is a good example of how good and magical films are in the 90's. The cast is brilliant; the hilarious Kathy Najimy stars as the bouncy, always-cheerful Sister Mary Patrick; Wendy Makkena as the awfully shy Sister Mary Robert; Mary Wickes as the spunky, wise-cracking Sister Mary Lazarus, and of course, the legendary Maggie Smith as the ever-stern, yet caring, Reverend Mother. And these aren't the only colorful characters; every nun has their own special personality. As for the plot, in my opinion it's very original and interesting. I have to admit it did slow down a couple of times, but for the most part it was convincing and, to me, very well-written.Overall, this movie is one the entire family can enjoy and watch over and over again.

So how did Whoopi Goldberg (?!) get to be the star of this film?! Hollywood once again shows that it doesn't care, and that it assumes we don't either. And since this film was a box-office hit, maybe they're right.Since Goldberg is a good comic actress, and there are some funny lines and bits in the film, it's not a total waste. Still, it's so wholly unbelievable, it doesn't even make good fantasy.By the way, if you raised a Roman Catholic and you thought this a great film, you better get to confession right away, because this film insults, not just the Church, but its essential doctrines left and right.

As you might expect, she has difficulty fitting in, though the choir presents an opportunity for redemption.While the story may be light and fluffy, the acting talent elevates the movie above most comedies. Whoopi Goldberg was fresh off her Oscar win for ""Ghost"" and she was ideally suited to the role of the sassy Deloris.

The supporting players didn't disappoint either, with the likes of Harvey Keitel, Bill Nunn & Kathy Najimy joining lesser known (but no less memorable) Mary Wickes & Wendy Makkena.In terms of production values, the movie is more than satisfactory. Emile Ardolino's unobtrusive direction supports the comedy and also allows the music to be showcased. Focusing mainly on 60's girl group music, the soundtrack has some memorable moments and interpretations.While the plot may simply be too frivolous for some, ""Sister Act"" is an enjoyable popcorn movie with several memorable performances and songs.

49,rivertam26,One of my favorites,9,30 March 2020,"This is one of my go to movies when I'm feeling down. I remember seeing it in theaters when I was a kid and I just couldn't stop laughing. The movie isn't fantastically directed but Whoopi Goldberg owns the show with a fabulous cast of supporting players which include a hilarious Kathy Najimy (Hocus Pocus), an amazing Maggie Smith (Dowton Abbey), Wendy Makkena, Mary Wickes and a slimy but sexy Harvey Keitel (Bad Lieutenant). Goldberg starts off the film as a headliner of a 60s style girl group at a casino. She's secretly dating the casinos mob boss and she accidentally witnesses a murder. Suddenly shes on the run and than is put into a nunnery to keep her hidden until her court date. It's a bunch of fun mishaps that leads her to the choir and some truly outrageous musical numbers. It may be familiar but it's fun and heartwarming. One of my all time favorites.Budget: $31m

51,one9eighty,Perhaps I don't have a heart - not a fan,5,12 February 2020,"Whoopie Goldberg is club singer in a casino, working for Harvey Keitel who, as well as the casino owner, is also doubling up as a drug lord. She quits her job, quits the casino, and quits Keitel when she witnesses wrong doing. On the run she ends up in a nunnery surrounded by god worshiping sisters of the cloth that dubiously welcome her. She begins to find herself and slowly begins to change who she thinks she is. This comedy/action adventure is a 'fish out of water' film, sandwiched between action sequences. It's not roll around on the floor laughing kind of comedy, but at the time it was released it was entertaining enough. This was released in a time when the 90's were awash with similar styles of themes, albeit with different themes and plots. Sister Act isn't going to many peoples go-to film for annual hilarity, but if there is nothing else on TV then it's passable for an hour. Knowing the plot, you can probably guess what kind of things happen; it's a very predictable film which doesn't delivery anything new. 5 out of 10.",Sister Act
52,Mister-6,Nun better....,9,14 October 1999,"TIDBIT - Bette Midler was the original choice for the lead in ""Sister Act"".That may have been cute (a Jewish nun?) but in choosing Whoopi, ""Sister Act"" gives itself a shot in the arm with an incomparable comic talent and insures every scene with Deloris/Mary Clarence is a highlight unto itself. 
After witnessing a Mob hit courtesy of her boyfriend (Keitel), casino lounge singer Whoopi hightails it to her local police where a helpful cop (Nunn) puts her in the Witness Protection Program and before you can say ""holy, holy, holy"", sends her to the last place in the world anyone would think of finding a second-rate lounge singer. Once the church, nuns and choir music with a Motown beat are all introduced, things pick up steadily.  All the nuns are funny (especially Najimy as the eternally sunny Sister Mary Patrick) and there are so many good scenes to be had thereafter (the bar scene, the first choir practice, the blossoming of Sister Mary Robert (Makkenna), etc.), that you can't help but smile, even if you're tired of nuns as a springboard for comedy.  And there's something about the music: the gospel-tinged soul songs like ""My God"", ""I Will Follow Him"" and such lift your spirits and are infectious in their own right.  The last scene in the movie is quite moving, truth be told, and lets you in on a secret... God moves in mysterious ways.Amen.Nine stars.  These ""Sister""s rock!",Sister Act

54,rebeljenn,entertaining,4,18 June 2006,"'Sister Act' is the story of a singer who hides as a nun to avoid problems when she witnesses an attack. The film is an entertaining comedy about her struggling to fit in with the other nuns because she is very much a woman of the world and has had a lot of experiences. However, she soon finds her place in her strength of singing. The film can be enjoyed by a wide audience. I saw it when I was in my early to mid teens, and I thought that it was funny, but I think that the film can also be enjoyed by adults; some of the humour is probably geared more to adults. Expect to laugh a lot when watching this film, but do not see this film if you are easily offended or if you are super-religious.",Sister Act
55,Imdbidia,It grasps me every time,7,5 January 2017,"I have watched this movie many many times for many years, and it has still the freshness it has when I first watched it.Certainly, the movie is not original, is predictable with archetypal characters and story. Yet, it does not matter, because it has something that make one forget that we know how the movie is going to end: good performances, fun, action, a good message, and very likable characters. And what about the chorus! I wish that Whoppie did more acting; she is always the soul of the party in any movie, like here. She is perfect as the naughty dangerous good-hearted not-so-silly not-so-bad Deloris. But all the other actors are terrific in their respective roles. I have a soft spot for Kathy Najimy in this film, she is just hilarious.The movie has a good message: it shows a belief in the goodness of any person, no matter first appearances, no matter the past, no matter the wrong detours in life. We are all dark horses, in a way, wanting to become white Andalusian ones. Some people are bad because of the circumstances and companies they keep, but one can always be redeemed and be a better person and have a positive impact on other people.The movie has the halo of the Christmas movies of the 50s, even though this is not a Christmas movie.Sister Act is one of the very few movies that I watch on TV from start to finish any time is on air.

56,asda-man,Can't sing enough praise,10,29 August 2011,"""Sister Act"" is a highly underrated film, to me it's a classic and should be more appreciated. It's got everything a good comedy needs, Whoopi Goldberg and nuns. It's incredibly funny, well-acted and also has a fantastic beat. This a film I could watch again and again, I must've seen it about 12 times now and it doesn't get any more boring than the last.Whoopi Goldberg is really fun as Delores Van Cartier who's on the run from her mob boyfriend, and so has hide-out in a convent and so becomes a temporary nun, Sister Mary-Clarence. From here on we're treated to incredibly funny sequences about poor Delores absolutely hating her time as a nun. However she's then asked to teach the nun's choir (who are really awful, in a hilarious way) and gives them a modern-day twist to the disapproval of the stern Mother Superior, played brilliantly by Dame Maggie Smith who seems to have great fun in her role. However, the choir attracts hundreds of locals, making the church a packed-out showroom.""Sister Act"" is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Whoopi Goldberg is absolutely hilarious like she was in ""Ghost"" and it's also brilliantly written with such a sharp and friendly wit that's sure not to offend anyone, which is a rarity in comedies we see nowadays. Also the plump one from ""Hocus Pocus"" is on another funny turn as the big friendly nun. She lights up the screen whenever she's on and t's wonderful to see.Never dull, always fun with a toe-tapping beat. My only complaint is that they didn't sing enough songs! They're so much fun and you really get into them. It's also great to see such humorously written characters. Each nun is individually funny which is great to see. If you haven't seen ""Sister Act"" yet then you're missing out big time. It's smart, fresh and funny and I can't sing enough praise for this gloriously uplifting film! Best moment: When Delores strokes a dog",Sister Act
57,bbewnylorac,Great entertainment,8,19 August 2017,"Sure, Sister Act is a bit silly and won't win any awards, but I really enjoyed it because it's fun, and its heart is in the right place. What elevates it is the musical numbers. Whoopi Goldberg (Sister Mary Clarence) shines as the sleazy Vegas lounge singer who finds herself rebooting a woeful church choir. She's been sent to the church's convent to be a nun under witness protection, after witnessing a mafia shooting in a nightclub. The casting is excellent - including the strict mother superior, played by Dame Maggie Smith, and a gaggle of very eccentric nuns led by the wonderful Mary Wickes and Kathy Najimy. The Goldberg role was going to be played by Bette Midler, but I think Goldberg is even better in this role - more streetwise and convincing is being a fish out of water. Goldberg injects a manic desperation to her very jaded floozy character, who, it turns out, does have a heart after all. But back to the music. The combination of Motown and revved up church songs works beautifully. Much of the movie's comedy comes from Goldberg's frustrating journey in trying to teach the unruly nuns to sing in tune. When the choir finally gets its act together, it's quite thrilling, and the choreography and cinematography of their performances is perfectly executed. Goldberg's character does go on a journey by finding her talent for directing the choir, and by helping the nuns start to step outside to minister to the local community. In some ways, Sister Act is like an old fashioned Hollywood movie. It is heavy on dialogue in indoor settings, and goes for pithy set-ups and one liners. It's a little corny. It's not that believable but it's just so enjoyable. It will lift your spirits and make you feel good. Which, to me, is a worthwhile achievement for any film.",Sister Act
58,acedj,Before Whoopi lost her mind,9,16 July 2020,"This is the story of Deloris Wilson who grows up to be a Reno lounge singer and takes on the last name Van Cartier, played by Whoopi. She is dating the married casino owner named Vince and played with a suitable amount of menace by Harvey Keitel. After Deloris decides to leave both Vince and the casino to seek her fortunes elsewhere she overhears him order the killing of a man. Deloris is placed in protective custody by a cop named Eddie and played by Bill Nun.She ends up staying in a convent, much to the chagrin of the mother superior, under the guise of being a nun, Marie Clarence. It swiftly becomes evident that Deloris cannot conform to the life of a nun and is put to work to occupy her time. She ends up running the choir and turns them into a sensation. The mother does not agree with Deloris's choices with the music arrangements, but everyone else is thrilled with the new sound of the choir and it even helps bring more people to the church.On the day that the Pope is set to visit and see the new choir it comes out that Vince has learned of Deloris's hideaway. His thugs capture her and the nuns launch a plan to save her.This is a total feel good movie and all the parts are played excellently. The musical numbers are both fun to watch and hear. I invite you to go back and visit or revisit this film and forget the fact that Whoopi is now psych.",Sister Act
59,DavidSim240183,A divine comedy.,8,16 November 2004,"Whoopi Goldberg is one of my favourite comediennes, and always strikes me as the female equivalent of Eddie Murphy. She can really make a part her own, from a charlatan psychic in Ghost, to her role in Sister Act.Whoopi plays Delores Van Cartier, a lounge singer from Las Vegas. A very unsuccessful one too, something that she knows all too well. Her Mobster boyfriend Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel) kills one of his cronies, and Delores has the bad luck of being a witness. Forced to go on the run, the police put her in the last place Vince would ever think to look for her before she can testify against him. A convent!Now assuming the identity of a nun (Sister Mary Clarence), the only one who knows Delores' true identity is the Mother Superior (Maggie Smith in a terrific role). Needless to say, they don't hit it off. Delores is miserable, and the Mother Superior considers her brash presence a disruption to the convent.However, Delores manages to have quite an impact on the rest of the convent, especially the choir. She makes friends with the terminally cheerful Sister Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy) and the mousy Sister Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena).Delores manages to turn the choir from a tone deaf group into a bunch of swinging sisters! Opening the doors of the church to the public, the convent becomes a big hit, much to the disapproval of the Mother Superior, who prefers the traditional ways. The new-found popularity of the convent also exposes Delores to Vince, putting her in danger.At first glance, Sister Act seems a little clichéd. There are a lot of stereotyped characters. Delores as the unconventional newcomer who shakes up the establishment, the Mother Superior who is adverse to change, Sister Mary Robert as the shy nun who finds confidence when she discovers she has a wonderful singing voice and so on.Because it has a great cast, the film rises above most clichés. Whoopi is great to watch when teaching the nuns to sing My God instead of My Guy. Her verbal sparring with Maggie Smith is good too. Maggie Smith manages to inject a great deal of much needed depth into her thinly written character. Her concerns about the sisters' naiveté in the outside world are not altogether wrong.Kathy Najimy is wonderfully funny as the nun with a sunny disposition. She gets a lot of memorable lines, especially my personal favourite one:""I guess I've always been upbeat, optimistic, perky. My mother used to say that girl is pure sunshine. She'll either grow up to be a nun, or a stewardess. Coffee?""Wendy Makkena is great as Sister Mary Robert. She's actually a surprisingly sexy screen presence. So sweet and innocent, but as her confidence builds an edge creeps into her character and she becomes almost irresistible. Her happiness is very infectious. She makes a good trio with Whoopi and Kathy Najimy, and she's always a joy to watch in the choir. Although it's not her belting out those numbers, I still get a feeling of well-being whenever I watch those scenes.Mary Wickes also puts in a good appearance as the stern Sister Mary Lazarus. She gets a lot of great one liners, and her timing is spot on. She manages to establish a fine rapport with any of the other characters without robbing them of their screen time. Overall, Sister Act has a fine ensemble cast.Harvey Keitel is adequate, but his part feels inconsequential when compared to the others. He takes centre stage towards the end, and that damages the finale of the film a little. It becomes more daft towards the climax with the convent scouring Las Vegas for Delores, but fortunately recovers when they give a concert for the Pope.The best parts of the film are the nun's musical numbers, because it doesn't feel in any way blasphemous. It makes you want to rejoice along with the rest of the choir, and their enthusiasm feels very infectious. Overall, I found Sister Act to be a lot of fun and makes you feel good in the process. Pity Sister Act 2 didn't make you feel the same way.",Sister Act

That's terrific! And the tiptop actress has some great moments with Maggie Smith and the other nuns. While you could dismiss this as a quote-unquote ""chick flick,"" it's better if you don't.

63,random_avenger,Sister Act,6,20 September 2010,"After almost 20 years, the 1992 music-filled hit comedy still works fine. Whoopi Goldberg plays Deloris van Cartier, a lounge singer with a shady gangster boyfriend Vince (Harvey Keitel). After she accidentally witnesses his involvement in a murder, she flees and is placed in protective custody in a San Francisco nun convent to wait for Vince's trial. Bored with the nuns' quiet way of life, she ends up joining the convent's lousy choir and helps the Sisters find their suppressed joy of life again, also boosting the church's popularity among the public as a side effect. The fame is not solely a good thing though, as Vince and his goons are still very much keen on eliminating Deloris.Much of the comedy stems from Goldberg's charisma and the initial incompatibility of her flamboyant antics with the usual humble life in the convent. Despite living under the strict control of the Reverend Mother (Maggie Smith), the nuns have their joyous side hidden under their habits: I especially enjoyed the performances of Kathy Najimy as the bubbly Sister Mary Patrick and the adorable Wendy Makkena as the young and insecure postulant Mary Robert. Later on the film turns more action-packed after the Sisters travel to Reno, Dakota to help out the kidnapped Deloris a.k.a. Sister Mary Clarence; while I prefer the earlier, more down-to-earth scenes at the convent, the bumbling stays mostly under control and doesn't distract too much from the main appeal, that is the singing nuns.The best parts of the movie are the catchy pop songs that Deloris teaches to the inept choir, such as ""(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave"", ""My Guy"" and ""Shout"". The montage set to C+C Music Factory's ""Just a Touch of Love (Everyday)"" is also a highlight among the scenes picturing the mutual development of the nuns and Deloris who learns to accept a calmer, more spiritual attitude to life during her time with the Sisters. Fortunately the movie doesn't overdo the Christian message though and contents itself with a more general theme of love and forgiveness. At the end of the day, the songs combined with the energetic performances and lovable characters provide a pleasant movie suitable for most ages – nothing completely awesome, but not every movie needs to be.",Sister Act
64,nicolechan916,Great acting and script with an OK storyline,7,20 November 2015,"Whoopi Goldberg is hilarious, and her acting is great in this. She usually plays characters who have sass, and she is able to deliver her lines amazingly. She is also able to express her character's emotions really well which makes it fun and engaging for the audience. Najimy and Makkena too, add some comedic effect to the narrative, and their expressions are pretty funny.Another thing I was impressed with is the singing. At services, the choir sings, and I am not sure if the actresses are actually the ones singing, but I really like Mary Robert's voice (OK, apparently Mary Robert's voice has been credited to Andrea Robinson). That makes sense, as it was pretty surprising to hear that singing voice come out of her. It was great lip-singing though!The story itself isn't so interesting, and serves as more of a fun movie. It does seem that the film mocks the lives of nuns and the convent in general, as Goldberg's character routinely ridicules their rules and way of living. In addition, Mother Superior is made out to be strict and the other nuns as being ignorant and innocent. Plus, in the end they are pushed outside their usual norms, which just feels like the film is making fun of them.Overall a pretty hilarious film, with great acting and an OK storyline.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Sister Act

67,thomvic,It's one of those movies that make you laugh over and over.,8,13 November 2010,"This was one of the films I loved when I was a kid. The weird thing was is that the subject matters dealt in this movie weren't as understood back then. It dealt with a lot of things - adultery, the lack of faith in people in religion, where does one find their calling in life etc.Whoopi Goldberg is terrific as Delores who witnesses a crime committed by her mobster ringleader boyfriend and is forced to hide as a nun in a convent until they can put him on trial. You get to witness her struggle to try to abide by custom rules but at the same time can't help who she is. While this is noticed by the strict and head nun Reverend Mother (Maggie Smith), the other nuns take a liking to her when she becomes leader of the choir and turns the choir into a phenomenal success by the church and the public.What makes Sister Act appealing are the central nuns who become important to Delores. For example, Sister Mary Roberts who seems timid like a mouse has a terrific talent to sing and it is Delores who brings it out of her. But what is really good to see is that Delores, though at first wanting to get out of the convent which she describes as a nightmare, slowly begins to understand the nuns and the importance of their roles in the Church and how they are all one big family.The songs in the film are memorable as well. I think the third act sort of becomes a bit silly but still nevertheless fun with the whole thing going to Reno. But in the end you see a woman who didn't know what to do with her life and eventually finds it due to this experience.It's just a comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously and really lightens your mood up when you watch it.",Sister Act

Apart from the self-satisfied ""My God"", the musical numbers are fun and exhilarating. The cast is great - Whoopi Goldberg goes at her role with gusto, Maggie Smith is efficient as the Mother Superior and I loved Mary Wickes as the crotchety Sister Mary Lazarus. Production values are excellent and the script also has its moments, with Maggie Smith getting the best lines.What sinks it all is the total implausibility of the plot. It would be uplifting to think that a few old nuns jazzing up their choir would save a church and its neighborhood from oblivion, but I just didn't buy it  in fact, the movie didn't really bother trying to sell it. The first disaffected teenagers have their curiosity aroused by a church piano playing more loudly than usual and come in before the first song  ""Hail, Holy Queen""  is over? Puh-lease!It's worth taking a look at this on TV, but don't bother with the DVD.Rating: 6/10",Sister Act

She winds up leading a nuns' choir turning them into a first rate upbeat choral group. In this film, she delivers an inspiring, heart-warming performance proving she can both act and sing! Maggie Smith is her outstanding self as Mother Superior at the financially-strapped inner city convent.Veteran actress Mary Wickes brings her own wise-cracking, grumpy brand of comedy to one of her last roles as the former choir director Sister Mary Lazarus.Kathy Najimy brings good spirit and cheer and a voice to match in her role as Sister Mary Patrick.Young sister Mary Robert played by Wendy Makkena is simply delightful. Her portrayal of faith, optimism and innocence is uplifting. Her voice soars.In all, a wonderful family film that touches the heart and warms the soul.

71,n-mo,Walks the line...,5,23 August 2009,"An acquaintance at a Gregorian Chant seminar I attended recently remarked at lunch one day that the ""new Mass was well-adapted to African-style music."" He could have been a bit more general: the vulgar (no value judgment intended) forms of the Novus Ordo Mass are indeed well-suited for folk music, simply for the fact of being vernacular. Irish folk music would work just as well. This observation of course illustrates more a failure of the Novus Ordo liturgy--it condescends rather than inspires--than a thought about the ""place"" of folk forms (there should be none) in Christian liturgical traditions.These major reservations aside, I found Sister Act a delight. Whoopi Goldberg is perfect as former Catholic schoolgirl turned lounge singer Delores Wilson ""van Cartier"" forced to hide out in a small urban convent and adopt the identity of a nun, Sr. Mary Clarence. She is humorously mortified (""These people don't even have sex!"" she protests to the cop who helps stash her) and at terrible pains to adjust. Gradually, however, she comes to rediscover her childhood religion and develops a passion for helping to improve the convent. The overarching plot is simply an excuse for throwing a worldly woman into this situation.Personally, I liked the Reverend Mother. I feel she was not quite given her due. Her Father Superior could scarcely be called sympathetic to her pious plight--and she was on every level correct to point out that a convent of nuns is a place ""to commune and to pray."" (Part of the problem is that the film confounds ""nun"" with ""religious sister,"" both lexically and conceptually: the former are cloistered to a degree that is fairly strict while the latter may still own property and generally perform services for the Church.) On the other hand it was rather difficult for her to attempt to preserve the old traditions when everyone else wanted ""renewal."" ""I am a relic,"" she explains to ""Sister Mary Clarence,"" but her observations of the world are quite astute and Delores understands full well that this woman has saved her--body and soul--through sternness and charity.It's not a very deep film but it'll keep you entertained for a little bit.

74,tml_pohlak_13,"Oh, Maria!",10,29 January 2011,"I am the movie lover in my family. Books and movies are my great passions. I love both. That's why, whenever we have a family movie night, I usually end up getting the task of finding the right movie to watch. This is a considerably difficult process. I have to keep in mind a little sister who hates violence of any sort, a younger brother who loves superheroes, a father who enjoys Arnold Schwarzenegger action rampages, and a mother who enjoy romantic movies.I finally decided on ""Sister Act"" as the movie for tonight. I remembered watching it vaguely as a child, and loving the concept of singing and dancing nuns. All this time later, this very fun film entertained all of us when we sat down to watch.First of all, Whoopi Goldberg is a nun. If that isn't funny already, I don't know what is. Goldberg plays Deloris, a lounge singer who witnesses a mob killing courtesy of her boyfriend (Harvey Keitel). She goes on the run when he tries to have her killed. Long story short (too late), she winds up in a convent which is presided over by Maggie Smith, a stern yet not entirely unsympathetic nun. Deloris, now Sister Mary Clarence, livens things up around the convent, and becomes the choir director, turning an awful group of singers into an excellent choir. (Perhaps too quickly. It might have been fun to see them struggle a bit longer.) The premise is quite funny, and it's a real delight to have the nuns singing and dancing in some really inspired routines. The songs themselves are actually excellent, and this movie probably has my favourite version of ""Hail Holy Queen"" ever. It starts with a very traditional rendition of the song, and then morphs into something very different.The real stars in this movie are the nuns. They are all cast so well, particularly those in the choir. They all seem so sweet, friendly, and innocent, and it's riotously funny when they start singing upbeat renditions of church music.There's plenty of really good stuff in here. The religious jokes work really well, the singing nuns are a riot, and Goldberg has tremendous fun throughout the movie, along with a few other nuns. I have only one complaint. The direction is bad. It's often extremely clumsy or amateurish, and the movie's crime subplot is horribly executed. The movie is still extremely entertaining and funny, mainly due to the actors.So was this movie Oscar-worthy? Hell no. Pardon the pun. But it did what it was supposed to do: it entertained us all tremendously and was tons of fun to watch. I wouldn't hesitate to watch it again. Or twice more. Maybe even more times. The pure fun of it all is why I award this movie the 10 stars I do. It was a delight.",Sister Act

Kathy Najimy as Mary Patrick.",Sister Act
76,xsophietaylorx,Harmless Fun,7,7 October 2014,Sister Act really is just some harmless fun it's a funny film with a purpose I believe of acceptance it gives a different fun like spin off on the nun life style which is nice to watch! At the end of day who doesn't like a tiny bit of Whoopi. Goldberg really doe steal the show mainly because she is the main character and just has the most spice about her she brings this new look to the nuns and it's brilliant fun to witness how it all turns out. People are giving this film bad reviews but maybe it isn't everyone's cup of tea? I think it is just nice entertainment a light comedy with nothing too thought provoking something to sleep on to light your mood. At the end of the day overall the movie is sweet it's got strangely catchy songs on it that make you want to just dance along to the holy tunes!,Sister Act

78,shrine-2,Nunsense,4,22 January 2000,"Cuddly situation-comedy notions about religious life do not for hardy laughter make.  ""Sister Act"" ended amidst a string of conflicts and hard feelings, and the finished product telegraphs it.  The humor is lame; the idea ill-advised; the execution of it mechanical; and the acting forgettable.  Even the great Maggie Smith is crushed by the nun-sense.   Emile Ardolino died after making ""Sister Act.""  If I didn't already know why, I'd have figured it was work-related.  The movie looks like it was hastily put together, and desperation leaks through the cracks in the plot.  I'd have questioned the gangster's choice in mistresses, if I hadn't been told that Ted Danson suffers the same proclivity.  Isis Carmen Jones as young Deloris Cartier has a beautiful smirk.  She beams for that split second, and ""Sister Act"" is never the same after it.",Sister Act
79,Extraordinary_Machine,'Sister Act' has all the story it needs when it has Whoopi Goldberg in the lead...,7,22 April 2005,"Sister Act Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is a lounge singer at a successful Reno casino, and is also the mistress of its manager, Vince LaRocca (a lazy Harvey Keitel), a drugs baron. Feeling unloved, she finally decides to quit her job at the casino and split up with Vince when he gives her his wife's old fur coat as a present. But then Deloris accidentally walks in on Vince dispatching one of his snitch employees, and literally has to make a run for her life. Taking refuge with the police, she discovers that she is required to testify in court when Vince is charged for his dirty deeds. But until then, the police arrange for her to hide out at a nunnery in Chicago, overseen by the Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). As Deloris reluctantly adapts to her new lifestyle as Sister Mary Clarence, she strikes up friendships with the unsuspecting nuns at the monastery, and even finds a way to put her singing skills to good use. But wherever she goes, Vince is never far behind The above plot synopsis is likely to imply to the unknowing that 'Sister Act' is a ""woman in jeopardy"" thriller, when actually it's the complete opposite. The creators of the film seem to have designed a worthy fish-out-of-water comedy, and then simply used the bookends of the film as window dressing. It's all the story you need, though, when you have Whoopi Goldberg in the lead.I've always had a preferment to Goldberg's shockingly underused skills as a dramatic actress, but her funny act can make virtually any film enjoyable. This is one of them. However, this being a family film, the climax is slightly underwhelming, and seems to be trying to be funny that actually letting off tension. But 'Sister Act' is a decent comedy regardless.~ 7/10 ~",Sister Act
80,schmimic,Whoopi Goldberg delivers a few laughs in this amusing little movie about a murder witness who gets hidden in a convent.,8,23 April 2005,"Starring: Whoopi Goldberg, Maggie Smith, Harvey Keitel The nineties were an interesting time for movies to be made. This is hardly a spectacular film, but it is certainly amusing, and there are far worse things you can waste your time on. Like cable.The plot of the movie is fairly basic. Delores VanCartier (Goldberg) is a lounge singer with a married lover who happens to be a drug dealer and other crime related stuff. Delores decides that she's going to leave Vince (Keitel), but when she goes to give him back the jacket he gave her and say goodbye, she happens to walk in right as Vince is getting his goons to shoot his less than loyal limo driver. Oddly enough, Delores runs like the dickens, basically straight to the police station.Apparently it will take about two months for a trial date, so until that time, one of the officers hides Delores in a place that Vince would never look for her. A convent. Delores, an off colour black woman with a racy past, ends up pretending to be a nun. The Reverend Mother of the convent (Smith) is slightly less than thrilled at the prospect of having Delores stay with them, but the police do make a substantial donation to compensate them for their kindness.After a long period of not fitting in anywhere in the convent, the Reverend Mother finally decides to put Delores in the choir. Delores brings her musical talent to the table, and the once atrocious choir at the convent starts to get a little bit better. Then a lot better. Eventually they are ready to sing in mass, and when they do sing, the rest of the nuns just look back and forth at each other as if they can't believe their ears. You can almost hear the thoughts streaming through their minds: ""THIS can NOT be the same choir!"" But rather than just sing traditional hymns, Delores jazzes things up a little bit and puts some twists into a few old favorites. This doesn't exactly thrill the Reverend Mother, but since it does bring people from the streets into the mass services, she can hardly object.The convent gains popularity, the crowds start pouring in, and the once backwards convent starts to right itself, thanks to Delores. However, since there is a leak in the police station, Vince eventually finds out where Delores is hiding and goes to find her.The rest of the movie plays out in a fairly standard manner, but it still highly amusing. Like I said before, not an Academy Award winning flick, but a good way to kill an hour and a half without having to think too hard.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth a look)",Sister Act
81,matt_tawesson-1,Funny nun movie!!!,10,5 August 2006,"1992's Sister Act stars Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Najimy, Maggie Smith, Mary Wickes, and Harvey Keitel. Whoopi plays Deloris Van Cartier, who is a lounge singer in Reno. Vince (Keitel) is Deloris's boyfriend involved in a mob. When Deloris witnesses her boyfriend killing an employer, she bolts away to the police to report the crime. Lt. Eddie Souther (played by Bill Nunn) decides to put Deloris in the Witness Protection Program, by having her hide out as a nun in the convent, until the time comes for her to testify against her boyfriend. While at the convent with her new ""temporary identity"", she doesn't seem to like the idea of being there, but, after a while, she makes quite a difference to the other sisters in the convent. After being caught by the Mother Superior (played by Maggie Smith, a wonderful actress) when returning from a visit to a bar down the street, Mary Clarence (Deloris's new identity) is ordered to be in the not so melodious choir. Only later, she turns the choir from a bunch of out of order singing voices to a very harmonious and beautiful sound of singing voices, and gets them grooving on the piano in church!! There is a bunch of laughs throughout this film. After a while, her boyfriend discovers her hiding place and tracks her down, at which time Lt. Souther meets up to her and tries to get her out...when the sisters are about to rehearse their singing for the Pope himself for the following Sunday!! Vince and his evil partners in crime catch up to her, she gets away from them (check out her method to get away from the two guys), and they get arrested a short time later. After that, the Sunday service goes as planned, and when the sisters get done with singing (with Mary Clarence conducting), they get a standing ovation from everyone in the audience including the Pope!!

While at the convent she becomes the new director of the choir. This movie is great, it has a lot of laughs as well as a lot of great music. This is a great movie for people of all ages. This is a film that both children and adults can appreciate and love.

83,Clothes-Off,Another Crowd-Pleaser from director Ardolino.,7,28 September 2007,"Why is it that mediocre (at best) comedies starring the likes of Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell consistently get a pass on this site, while female-driven comedies are expected to totally dazzle or receive a rating barely above ""passable,"" if that?! While I wouldn't say this was on par with stellar 1990's comedies like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" or ""Flirting With Disaster,"" this movie does stand up to repeated viewing thanks to the winning combination of Whoopi Goldberg's likable persona and the top notch timing and skill of her supporting cast (with Mary Wickes playing a crankier version of the Sister she played twenty-six years earlier in ""The Trouble With Angels"").With those elements in place, director Emile (""Dirty Dancing"") Ardolino once again (like he did with ""Chances Are"") takes a light script and kicks it into overdrive simply by letting his cast do what they do best--play off each other. By the time the other sisters rally behind our heroine in her predicament, we're already on board and can enjoy the ride from there.If this had been a Farrelly Brothers comedy with, say, Adam Sandler or Any Given Wayans Brother hiding out in a rectory with some urban priests, I highly doubt it would have even been watchable--let alone nearly as enjoyable (and in some parts hilarious)--as the result here. For once, moviegoers ""got it"" and made this film the box office hit it deserved to be. Now if only they'd log on and give it a more suitable rating here!",Sister Act

I could understand far more of what was going on this time round (the story is follows Deloris Van Cartier - hilariously played by Whoopi Goldberg - who is forced to go into hiding for a few months after witnessing her boyfriend commit murder. This is all fine and dandy, until you discover that her place of hiding and secret identity would be to become a nun).This really is all round family fun. The singing (once Deloris has trained them up a bit) is actually quite beautiful at times, the acting is infallible, and the story a classic. Brilliant all round, and thoroughly deserves those 5 stars.",Sister Act

I like how she has them start out with normal church like singing then gets the one old nun who plays the piano to start up the music for the singing that pulls people into that church. I also like how those other nuns risk their lives by going into Reno after those men who took Whoopi back with them and they are all there to help her because of how she helped get their church back to being a good place again.

And I'm not even a christian. Okay, so the plot is not too credible. And neither are the characters. So the story is predictable. So what? This does what a feel-good movie is supposed to do: it makes you feel good. It makes you believe that everything will turn out fine, that true friendship conquers all and that we'll all end up as rejoicing seraphim. Of course, it also has two of my favourite actresses: Whoopi Goldberg and Maggie Smith, on opposite sides of the table. Whatever they touch turns to gold. Or at least, gold-plated. This film is just a lot of fun, no higher aspirations, no deeper meaning. Just an enjoyable afternoon, which will leave little of its story-line in your head, but most of its songs.

While the next ten minutes are relatively slow, and seem to borderline on a drama, it quickly sets the stage for a hilarious comedy suitable for all.Whoopi Goldberg may shine the brightest in this film, but Maggie Smith, Mary Wickes, Kathy Najimy, Harvey Keitel, and others deliver great performances as well.",Sister Act

She makes a lot of changes in the church, and all problems are solved and she becomes happy in the ending. The story is so simple. But, for me, It doesn't seem to be simple. The reason I think are the place she hides and some songs in the movie. She becomes a nun temporarily and spend the time in the church with other sisters. A black woman who worked at the club in the town have relationship with pure blooded sisters who are living only inside the church. That makes a little differences between this movie and other normal movie. In addition, we cannot talk about this movie without its music. A quire improves their singing because of a woman appearance, and the songs in this movie have important rules. Sisters become emotional and exciting when they're singing. Many beautiful and exciting songs shows sisters changes inside them very well. Musical elements also make this movie interesting.",Sister Act
95,stormintk,One of the Best Comedies of the Early 1990's!,8,15 August 2002,"*** Possible Spoilers ***""Sister Act"" is one of the funniest and best made films of the early 1990's. Starring Whoopi Goldberg as Delores Van Cartier, (a lounge singer working in a Reno, Nevada casino) the film begins with a flashback showing a young and irreverent Delores in a Catholic parochial school being reprimanded by a nun after giving the names of the Beatles for the names of the apostles. The nun warns Delores that she won't amount to much if she maintains her poor attitude.Returning to the present, we see the hapless Delores and her two back-up singers performing before a mostly empty audience in a Reno casino. Unhappy with her career and her married boyfriend, Vince LaRocca (played by Harvey Keitel), Delores decides to leave, but Vince appeases her by giving her a mink coat. When Delores discovers that the coat actually belongs to his wife, she tromps over to Vince's office, where she unwittingly sees Vince shoot one of his employees. Sadly, Delores' unfortunate appearance did not go unnoticed as Vince orders his henchmen to get Delores. She bolts out of Vince's office and into the casino where she manages to escape and flees to the police.Now knowing that her exboyfriend Vince is a gangster, police lieutenant Eddie Souther (played by Bill Nunn), tells Delores that she must enter the witness protection program to be safe until she can testify against Vince. Eddie takes Delores to San Francisco so that she can assume her new identity as a nun in a convent.After Eddie leaves, the very unhappy Delores cannot hide her horror of being a nun and Mother Superior (played by Maggie Smith) is not thrilled with the situation either. You can't help but laugh while watching Mother Superior's attempts to find a suitable place for Delores (now known as Sister Mary Clarence) within the convent or Delores' disgust with ""looking like a penguin,"" as she puts it. Meanwhile, two of the convent's nuns, Sister Mary Patrick (played by Kathy Najimy) and Sister Mary Robert (played by Wendy Makkena) become endeared with Sister Mary Clarence.Mother Superior finally decides to have Sister Mary Clarence join the convent's inharmonic choir, which has been under the tutelage of Sister Mary Lazurus, who was played by Mary Wickes. This wasn't the first time that Mary Wickes portrayed a nun: she also portrayed Sister Clarissa in the films ""The Trouble with Angels"" in 1966 and its sequel ""Where Angels Go Trouble Follows"" in 1968.Will Delores find a way to survive life in the convent and bring harmony to the choir? Will Mother Superior be able to keep her sanity in tact? Will Vince find where Delores is hiding? To answer these questions, sit back, watch this film and be prepared to laugh!",Sister Act

It's family friendly and a decent story about a woman (Whoopi) on the run from the mob with some of their stolen money or something. Anyway she hides out in a nunnery and poses as a nun even though she's a night club singer. She's a real fish out of water but ends up learning a lot from the real nuns, helps them change for the better as well with her fun singing and dancing (which ends up so beloved by the community the Pope comes to see their choir perform), and helps the community get safer and cleaner.

98,Melanie82-1,Goldberg Gold,9,10 September 2009,"I have no idea how long since I first watched this movie. Even though I generally lean towards drama and true crime rather than comedy, I fell in love with Sister Act and Whoopi Goldberg. Like her character, Deloris, I also enjoyed music from the 60s and enjoyed the opening act. When she was talked into hiding out at the convent, the action slowed down a little, though certain parts were funny, such as when she, and Sisters Mary Patrick and Mary Robert entered a bar. However, the action took off when she became head of the choir and introduced a bit of deep shoulder action to the nuns. Out of respect for those who still have not seen this movie, I won't say more about the contents. The DVD, which I bought in a set with the sequel Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, it played beautifully with no pausing as sometimes happens. It was very easy to remove the disk from its holder and replace after viewing the disk. I enjoyed the brief look at how the movie was made in the special features, but unfortunately forget what it consisted of. I did feel it was worth watching before watching the movie. Whether you buy just Sister Act, or as a set with the sequel, it should tickle your funny bone.",Sister Act

It was the first time I drove from anywhere to my favorite coffee shop without having a cigarette on the way! I was too busy telling my best friend how I wanted to start a children's choir (like the one I was in as a child) and teaching them uplifting songs like those in Sister Act! Whoopi Goldberg (who has the same birthday as I, November 13) is excellent as she makes lemonade out of the lemons that life has dealt her. I believe she sang her own parts, which were wonderful! Although Wendy Makkena didn't sing her own parts, she was inspiring. I watch Sister Act whenever I need spiritual uplifting. I also like Sister Act II. because it has an uplifting quality, all of its' own (the high school students are facing the usual teenage battles; doing what's right vs. doing what's popular). I can quote both movies (almost) line for line, and I always get up to sing and dance with every musical scene. Every actor/actress was perfect for their part. Whoopi, who was obviously the focal point of the show, never upstaged the others, but instead let their lights shine, respectively. WAY TO GO!!!!!!!",Sister Act
100,dean-r-collins,The Whoopster at her best!,6,10 December 2010,"Emile Ardolino is no longer active in directing but he did on HEAVEN of a job on the simply divine comedy. I'm not an avid fan of Whoopi, but this is one of her finest things I've ever seen of her. Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi) is great. The movie has a good cast to boot, Maggie Smith is probably the most promising actress in the world of Whoopi's divine charade.The story follows Doloris Van Cartier, the vivacious Las Vegas singer who finds herself down in dumps. Songtress Cartier must put up with ant- size audiences at the old Casinos of Vegas, while juggling affairs with her boyfriend (National Treasure's Harvey Keitel), who turns turns out to be a low-down no-good gangster when Doloris witnesses him having his men gun down this other dude. He doesn't like this witnessing, so he plans to have Doloris ""wasted"". But she's already got the draft and is wisely on the run. The police (Bill Nunn, his last name is sheer coincidence) have her safe but not for long, so they hide in all places that remains pure from gangster hands--- need I say more? Yes, a Nun's convent. Once there, strict the reverend mother (played by the ingenious Dame Maggie Smith) insists that if she must hide, she must also adopted their sacred ways also. Now stripped of her flashy suits, Whoopi adorns a nun's habit and alias Sister Mary Clarence, so now she's thinking she isn't shown such divine mercy... or is she? She soon befriends a rag-tag group of religious sisters, Kathy Najimy as the extremely plucky Sister Mary Patrick, Wendy Makkena as the meek and wonderful Sister Mary Robert and Mary Wickes as the gruff Sister Mary Lazarus whom she teaches them and the choir to break beyond a reclusive barrier to a roof raising praise for God.The acting is pretty good. Whoopi role is very convincing and developed, a little goofy sometimes (but this is a comedy), but still very Whoopi- ish, her expression are so great; I can't believe she can sing, she's really good. The very pale Maggie Smith is of course great, but I felt this was very peculiar role for her, it almost unexpected, but her knife-like strictness as Mother Superior is very very good. One can tell she's determined to a practice nun's traditional lifestyle, you can see that she's absolutely thinks the monotonous repetitive old way will honor God, but when Whoopi's new way truly does. Air Bud is the only movie I'm familiar with Wendy Makkena, she's extremely shrewd yet very grand in here as Sister Roberts, her character is very captivating; her blossoming secretive personality is interesting to watch, but the writers of the film kind left me kinda disappointed in her outcome other than the fact that she turned out to be a rather angelic singer (though I heard that wasn't Makkena's real voice). Kathy Najimy almost steals the whole show, she's unrealistically bubbly and, dare I say adorable; she literally scene everyone's attention in all her scenes (p.s. if that is her voice... amazing). Mary Wickes is very gruff and almost at first unlikable, she also a little scary as a nun. Bill Nunn is very sweet in this movie, you kinda see a love interest between his character and Whoopi's.Every set, except the church, was little odd. The Casino was barely noticeable as the camera didn't do lot of pan and scanning (whatever that means). The Church's location was very odd and out-of-place, the tramps around it were too, but the 90's kids were very unneeded (I guess the location was needed for the nun's to improve it and the kids' role meant that Whoopi's new praise to God appealed to them). The Church's set was very grand and regal, a place of shiny wooden surfaces and all that grand stuff to make it sacred (it was probably a real church they used).The music is all instant classics, it has THAT touch to it. Whoopi's beginning numbers were fabulous, they were just so... so peachy and rhythmic! The Nuns' improved choir was literally heavenly the most being the ""Regina"" one, when Whoopi has the Nuns grooving. The entire soundtrack is really good, a collection of R&B/Soul hits, ""Just a Touch of Love"" is quite hypnotic.One scene that very weird was when Bill Nunn punches this office double- agent, that scene kinda deviated from the main plot. The pope being involved in the story was little awkward, too. The film's climax is very good, I love how Keitel's goonies can't get the guts to rid of Whoopi, and she's comically calm and even forgiving to Keitel as if her old life was no longer important now that she's adopted nun-hood and he tediously bops her on the head, uneased by her behavior. Near the end there was a moment when Keital looked like he could turn the gun on Mother Superior- --heaven forbid! But good thing he didn't ;) The ending number is great but I think not as good as the ""Regina"" number, Whoopi is the greatest in that scene.Overall this movie is underrated, Whoopi probably needed to win an award for her performance! There is a little cussing, but other than that it's great. The plot is goofy, but is a lot of fun. The story both has greatness of R&B/Soul and old traditional.

This movie is terrific, but not because of the acting or directing...what this movie does is demonstrate the possibility of positive change. If you allow yourself to suspend disbelief about certain aspects of the plot, you'll discover that you can relate to and understand the struggles the sisters go through. They are universal--every human being has been in some dysfunctional, stuck or dying organization. Everybody knows what it feels like, and everybody wishes that they could do something about it. I think every member of every church, synagogue, mosque, house of worship, civic organization, school, committee, and/or organization of any kind should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie.

Air Bud is the only movie I'm familiar with Wendy Makkena, she's extremely shrewd yet very grand in here as Sister Roberts, her character is very captivating; her blossoming secretive personality is interesting to watch, but the writers of the film kind left me kinda disappointed in her outcome other than the fact that she turned out to be a rather angelic singer (though I heard that wasn't Makkena's real voice). Kathy Najimy almost steals the whole show, she's unrealistically bubbly and, dare I say adorable; she literally scene everyone's attention in all her scenes (p.s. if that is her voice... amazing). Mary Wickes is very gruff and almost at first unlikable, she also a little scary as a nun. Bill Nunn (I still can't believe his name) is very sweet in this movie, you kinda see a love interest between his character and Whoopi's.Every set, except the church, was little odd. The Casino was barely noticeable as the camera didn't do lot of pan and scanning (whatever that means). The Church's location was very odd and out-of-place, the tramps around it were too, but the 90's kids were very unneeded (I guess the location was needed for the nun's to improve it and the kids' role meant that Whoopi's new praise to God appealed to them). The Church's set was very grand and regal, a place of shiny wooden surfaces and all that grand stuff to make it sacred (it was probably a real church they used).The music is all instant classics, it has THAT touch to it. Whoopi's beginning numbers were fabulous, they were just so... so peachy and rhythmic! The Nuns' improved choir was literally heavenly the most being the ""Regina"" one, when Whoopi has the Nuns grooving. The entire soundtrack is really good, a collection of R&B/Soul hits, ""Just a Touch of Love"" is quite hypnotic.One scene that very weird was when Bill nun punches this office double-agent, that scene kinda deviated from the main plot. The pope being involved in the story was little awkward, too. The film's climax is very good, I love how Keitel's goonies can't get the guts to rid of Whoopi, and she's comically calm and even forgiving to Keitel as if her old life was no longer important now that she's adopted nun-hood and he tediously bops her on the head, uneased by her behavior. Near the end there was a moment when Keital looked like he could turn the gun on Mother Superior---heaven forbid! But good thing he didn't ;) The ending number is great but I think not as good as the ""Regina"" number, Whoopi is the greatest in that scene.Overall this movie is underrated, Whoopi probably needed to win an award for her performance! There is a little cussing, but other than that it's great. The plot is goofy, but is a lot of fun. The story both has greatness of R&B/Soul and old traditional. If you like Whoopi see this movie, but if you like good movies in general see it!",Sister Act
103,jafonte01,"It's Nun-thing Special; and Yet, it Counts its Blessings",6,23 February 2014,"Sister Act is a salient example of the late 80's/early 90's comedy. The film has slipshod camera direction, even more haphazard acting (most notably, Bill Dunn as Lt. Eddie Souther), and the quintessential freeze frame ending.As an EGOT recipient, Whoopi Goldberg shines in this venue. Right from the beginning, she hits the right notes at the right times, inevitably revitalizing the moribund convent. After that, she sings some more. And then, she sings some more. Singing and dancing took up about 10% of the entire film. Viewers who enjoy a more musical-styled film will enjoy Sister Act (to which it is no surprise it spawned Sister Act, the Musical).Sister Act is by no means ""immaculate"" or revolutionary. In fact, it is quite banal. From the very first scene, with the Nun spewing overt exposition: ""Oh Whoopi. You are a rascal. I do not know what to do with you. You will NEVER fit in a conservative setting *wink*."" I knew what I was in for as soon as those opening lines were spoken.Aside from Sister Act's trite character, it is one of the most financially successful comedies of the 1990's - netting over $200 million. Whoopi must've done something right. My guess is that she makes her signature ""Whoopi face"" that acts as a mixture of a gorilla's face and Kennan Thompson.And when she does make that Whoopi face, what comes out is a sequel, an EGOT, and a huge paycheck.",Sister Act
104,bethelagcy,This one stands up under multiple viewings ...,10,19 March 2006,"In addition to being one of Whoopi's very best films, this one passes the acid test of being a film that can be enjoyed more than once. A clever plot line that never quite goes ""over the top"" is coupled with great performances ... and not only from the film's stars. Kathy Najimy and Joe Maher are both very fine, and Maggie Smith and Mary Wickes stand out. The music sequences are especially well done and the cinematography,editing and costuming departments truly excel. The folks responsible for this film understood the principle that good comedy escalates, never relying on the ""one gag after another"" technique. This film is in the home video collections of many viewers ... and deservedly so.",Sister Act
105,localsixeight,Nuns on the Run- Fun Movie,8,4 October 2008,"Ah, Sister Act I am one of those new age types, you know, the kind of people who believe in laughter being the best medicine. So the other weekend I was sick, suddenly and unbearably. I could barely drag myself to the couch, where buried under tens of billions of blankets I shivered and pushed play on my remote. I had put Sister Act in because it's feel good, familiar and funny. I also have a crush on Kathy Najimy (the Voice of Mrs. Peggy Hill from TV's King of the Hill). Anyway, I drank fluids, watched sister act, laughed, cried just a little, and felt much better in no time.So I recommend this movie. It's sort of a cookie cutter tale, identity shift results in personal growth for the main character- but having mobsters/goons, nuns, the witness protection program and the pope- spices it up a bit. And the music, some horrible, some beautiful, it's worth a listen, especially when Whoopi Goldberg turns the crappy choir (that probably used to repel church goers) into a modern and harmonized group (that brings new life to the church).In a way this is a very time period specific kind of movie- which I always enjoy. I can't imagine it taking place at any other time than the late 80's/early 90's (1992). The generic music that fills the background from time to time is very 21 Jump Street? Something Of Coarse Kathy Najimy is wonderful in this film, as is Whoopi, and Maggie Smith- pre Hogwarts! How cool is that?",Sister Act

This show offers an escape of epic, foot-tapping proportions. And it is one of the few shows I've seen where all the leads are female, they are no one's ""love objects"" and you know, that was fun! Also as frequent visitors to SF, it mostly got parts of SF right, though I think it was a bit more like NYC in places.The clergy get a bad well ""rap""--and in this movie, you get to see the rap a bit ! (Sorry for the bad pun) But you get to see the GOOD of clergy, their devotion to causes, their contributions to the community.Somehow it captures the best aspects of religious life--the sisterhood, the shared mission, the joy.As a Catholic who heard the traditional versions of songs, and now could hear the transformation of them, it was especially fun and a triumph.,",Sister Act

The kids make you squirm (even before they start to sing) and the actresses playing the nuns look awkward and self-conscious.I know this is a favourite for many, many people, and each to his or her own, but I suppose, when all is said and done, I am the wrong demographic for this type of thing.Ham and cheese often go together, and if you like your plate heaped high you will love it.",Sister Act

110,SalamancaChica,Funny and Heartwarming,9,14 August 2006,"This was a great role for Whoopi Goldberg. She was very funny as Sister Mary Clarence. This movie had a truly wonderful cast that I think helped make the movie a success. Mary Wickes, Kathy Najimy, and Wendy Makkena were fabulous supporting actresses and Maggie Smith as Mother Superior was a perfect fit. While this movie was definitely funny, the heartwarming elements also made it great. Some of my favorite scenes are certainly the choir performances, but also those in which the special bonds between the sisters are revealed.This film also has a stellar soundtrack, and I would highly recommend the sequel, ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"", to see the sisters in action again.",Sister Act
111,kimNON,Funny and happy movie,10,16 December 2015,"""Sister Act""(1992) is a comedy movie and made in the USA and became a big hit. The main actor is Whoopi Goldberg. She is a club singer. One day, she witnesses an incident of murder. She finds herself in a situation where she is pursued by gangs, so she is given refuge in an religious house. In that place, she has to behave as a sister. She can not stand living strict and boring life. She is appointed the conductor of a choir which is not good at singing. Through singing, she develops friendship with other sisters and the superior. I really enjoy this movie. The performance of the choir makes me happy. They not only sing strongly but also dance. I think I want to go to a convent every time if such a choir sing. I am impressed with the friendship between Deloris and other sisters. Through singing, Deloris change her personality. I think singing has special power.",Sister Act

Deloris is not sent to Chicago! Why would the policeman send her to a place so far away when there is a place close by to go to? I don't know where the last commentator got his/her info, because it is not what the policeman said. It is San Francisco, CA! It is close to Las Vegas,NV,in that it does not take very long to fly there from 'Vegas.' The church is known as 'Old' Saint Mary's Cathedral, its real name. Its address is 660 California Street, San Francisco, CA, 94108, phone: 415-288-3800. I know it is because I grew up in the San Francisco-Bay Area, lived there for most of my life. I had a cousin get married in that Catholic church, we all attended. I have passed it several times when I have visited San Francisco, aka 'The City.' I loved watching this movie because it is nice to see a familiar place in a Hollywood movie. It makes you feel at home! Smile!

It's been 13 years since this movie was released, and it is still hilarious...even though there must've been at least 6 screenwriters, this movie is still wittier than most comedies nowadays. Structurally, it moves at the right pace, and it's likely one of the best movies Paul Rudnick and Carrie Fisher didn't write! But certainly, thank God, for Scott Rudin and his taste and knack for getting movies like this made.Definitely, one of the most memorable movies of the 90s and one of the best comedies ever. And as an ensemble, one of the best cast movies ever--Maggie Smith was genius casting, Kathy Najimy, Wendy McKenna and other main characters couldn't have been better, and whatever confluence brought Whoopi Goldberg to this part instead of Bette Midler can only be deemed fate. It makes one wonder whether movies with all these corporate parents, bottom lines and marketing trickery nowadays will ever get back to a golden period of just being good.",Sister Act

Whoopie Goldberg does a terrific job as playing sister Mary Clarence, but i think what makes the movie is Wendy Makkenna in playing sister Mary Robert. She has a fantastic voice and is entertaining, i love the way in which at the beginning she's shy then through gaining confidence in her singing she turns into a diva although through sister act and sister act 2 she's timid and very light hearted and this is what makes me love her more! Also the way in which she is easy to watch and is very pretty, so i think. Wendy Makkenna (Mary Robert) makes me want to watch the movie over and over again.Vicky",Sister Act

However, on Sunday 13th March 2005 I noticed that Sister Act was on TV and because I wasn't doing a lot I decided to watch it and I'm glad I did because it was AWESOME... I thought that all the characters played off each other brilliantly, which made the film more enjoyable to watch.I believe that the best character is Sister Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena) because of the way she starts of shy and mousy but then gains confidant's through her AWESOME singing and blossoms into a more fun and upbeat character. I think that Mary Robert is very entertaining and easy to watch! I find myself watching the choir scenes over and over because Mary Robert's performances are just AWESOME! The combination of the characters, the music, the storyline and Mary Robert just make Sister Act an AWESOME smash hit comedy that should be seen at least once! 10/10",Sister Act
125,mcarta3,Excellent,9,14 May 2006,This has got to be my all time favourite film after the sequel to this film that being sister act 2 (back in the habit) there is not one second that goes by in this film that is not worth watching. Anybody who disagrees clearly has no taste in great uplifting movies because this is the pure unadulterated unrefined version of this kind of film. From the superb performance by Whoppi Goldberg as the most un-nun like version of a nun to each and every song you will not be disappointed by anything in this film. I personally own both the film (on VHS and DVD) and soundtrack to both films and they are probably my most sacred and valued possessions not in price but in 'I do not know what I would do without them' kind of way.,Sister Act
126,BluPct01,Comments and review,10,12 November 2005,I feel that this movie should be a classic someday. The music is outstanding. I love the way that Whoopie sings. She has a fantastic voice for the movie. I loved the Supremes and there sound.All of the actress are gifted. I could watch this movie and Sister Act 2 over and over again. They are pricless.I only wish they would have made more of them. These in my opinion are quality type of movies for the whole family.They have unlimited language and sex and violence. Theses are movie that could be shown in a church.The plot is simple but believable.This movie is timeless and priceless.It is one of Whoppie's finest movies. I mean she was good in Ghost. I really enjoy watching her in all of her movies. Whoopie is a real gifted actress that will or should keep on making movies.I would watch everyone.All I can say Whoopie deserves an Acadamy Award for her acting ability. She is always believable in any role she playes. Thank You,Sister Act
