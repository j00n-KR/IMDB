0,Prismark10,The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,4,1 December 2020,The Christmas Chronicles was an enjoyable festive romp thanks to the star power of Kurt Russell and owed a nod to Home Alone.The sequel is directed by Chris Columbus who made the first two Home Alone and Harry Potter movies. This owes a nod to Gremlins with mischievous elves.A malevolent elf Belsnickel gradually turned to human form for being too grinchy plans to take revenge on Santa. He wants to steal the pole star that powers Santa's village.Belsnickel sends Kate Pierce (Darby Camp) who was in the first film and future-step brother Jack who are on holiday in Cancun with their parents down a wormhole to the North Pole.Kate reunites with Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) and they go looking for the missing star. Jack and Mrs Claus (Goldie Hawn) tend to the injured reindeer Dasher and bring it back to health.This is a busy sequel but strangely empty and charmless. An overlong movie that takes a while to get going.It seems to be made to order with a wishlist of ingredients that goes to make a hit Christmas movie. In turn it has no soul.Just look at the Logan airport scene where all the planes are delayed and the passengers are grouchy. Santa lifts the Christmas spirit with a song and dance routine featuring Darlene Love. All of a sudden the crowds are cheering and the planes are suddenly on schedule. Lifting the Christmas spirit. That's straight out of Elf.,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
1,kosmasp,More Russell Santa,7,13 January 2021,"Is this movie predictable? Yes! Does it have more plot and logic holes in the script that you can count (and I'm assuming you can count well by the way)? You betcha! But can it also still be fun? Yes. The time thing alone is quite nonsensical and who the bad guy in this movie is, is also quite ... well not good! No pun intended obviously.All that aside, Kurt Russell and his wife (in the real world and in the movie) have as much fun as you can have making a movie and it really translates onto the screen. Which if you're not too cynical will warm your heart too. Of course watching it around the holidays is best, but you can watch it whenever to get into the ""Christmas spirit"" ... you don't even have to believe in it, to enjoy the movie. Just go with the flow and ... the song and dance at one point at least",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
2,classicsoncall,"""Santa will find a way to make it all work out!""",6,5 December 2020,"This is even more so a kids movie than the first one. That's not a bad thing, but as just about every review I've read for the movie here on IMDb has stated, it takes a back seat to the prior film. The story reunites Santa (Kurt Russell) with his young protagonist Kate Pierce (Darby Camp), but for some reason leaves her brother Teddy (Judah Lewis) on the sidelines for this adventure. Well, we know why the film makers did that but it just smacks of pushing an agenda. Fortunately, Kurt Russell is still in fine form as Santa Claus, with the movie delving a little into his back story starting out as St. Nicholas. I would have been disappointed if he didn't get an opportunity to sing in this one, although it would have taken a lot to top the ""Christmas Time Pretty Baby"" number from the first picture. ""The Spirit of Christmas"" tune didn't have the same punch here but on it's own was pretty good. This story had a villain by way of an elf who turned human when he broke the elves code hundreds of years ago. With the help of a wildcat named Jola and the scoundrel elf Speck, Belsnickel (Julian Dennison) wreaks some havoc before finally getting imbued with the Christmas spirit, courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn). When it was all over, he got his wish and turned back into an elf again, but to my mind, that had to be a dubious honor.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
3,jboothmillard,The Christmas Chronicles 2,3,7 January 2021,"The original film was very popular when it was released on Netflix, and it was almost no surprise that a sequel came the following year, and with the COVID-19 pandemic around, it was likely to have loads of people watching it, directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief). Basically, it has been two years since Kate Pierce (Darby Camp), who is now a cynical pre-teen unhappy to be spending Christmas in Cancún, Mexico with brother Teddy (Judah Lewis), her mother Claire (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) and her mother's new boyfriend Bob (Tyrese Gibson), and his son Jack (Jahzir Bruno). She wants to be back home where it is snowy and feels more Christmassy. She decides to run away and get a plane back to Boston, only for Jack to follow her onto a shuttle. But they are unexpectedly transported to the North Pole by the driver Belsnickel (Julian Dennison), a nasty Christmas elf-turned-human. Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) finds and saves them and brings them to his house with wife Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn). The Clauses give the kids a grand tour of their village and all it has to offer, including the toy making workshops, and a feast of healthy food disguised as delicious sugary Christmas treats. Mrs. Claus tells the kids the of Santa and his origins in Turkey, how he saved the elves from extinction, and received the Star of Bethlehem, a magical artifact that stops time in and provides power to Santa's Village. They realise Belsnickel is out to cause trouble and try to destroy the joyous season. The Clauses explain that they adopted Belsnickel, their busy Christmas duties meant they had less time for him, so he became naughty, causing him to be cursed into becoming a human, and he ran away. Belsnickel releases a vicious yule cat (like a tiger) named Jola into the reindeer pen, causing Dasher to be injured, and he releases a potion into the village causing the elves to go insane. Santa tries to confront Belsnickel, who manages to steal the Star of Bethlehem, but the struggle causes the magical star to be destroyed, causing the power to go out in the village. Santa and Kate leave to head for Turkey to get the forest elves led by Hakan (Malcolm McDowell) to build a new star. Jack leaves to find a cure for the elves, while Mrs. Claus looks after Dasher. Santa and Kate find the elves who build a casing for a new star and Santa captures the magic it needs. While flying back to the village, Belsnickel flying in a sleigh pulled by jackalotes (a hybrid of jackals and coyotes) catches up to them. During their mid-air fight, Belsnickel transports them back in time to Boston 1990 with a device he planted on Santa's sleigh. Jack finds the root and brings it back to Mrs. Claus. Kate tries to buy AAA batteries to power Belsnickel's time travel device but ends up being taken in by security having ""counterfeit"" money (notes marked 2020). While Kate escapes with the help of arrested kid Doug (Sunny Suljic), Santa gets the help of airport worker Grace (Darlene Love) to sing and get airport passengers feeling Christmas spirit to gain the magic he needs. The spirit magic created is high enough for the sleigh to fly, Kate gets the batteries, and she realises Doug is her late father younger. While Santa and Kate transport back to moments before Belsnickel transported them and recover the star. Mrs. Claus uses the root found by Jack to create a powder which is spread across the village, curing and restoring the elves. Mrs. Claus throws an explosive gingerbread cookie in between Santa and Belsnickel's sleighs before they can collide in a game of chicken. Dasher recovers and assists Santa in defeating Jola, and Kate is able to place the star back at the top of the tree it belongs, restoring power to the village. Santa gives Belsnickel the first toy they built together, they reconcile, and Belsnickel is transformed back into an elf. Santa flies Kate and Jack back to Cancún where they inform an excited Teddy about their adventure and Kate becomes more accepting of Bob. Also starring Patrick Gallagher as Security Guard, and Violet Columbus (Chris's daughter) as Cashier. Russell remains a likeable, freewheeling and modern Father Christmas, and gets a rock singing scene again, his long-time partner Hawn is fine, but New Zealander Dennison is unconvincing and annoying as the villain. The North Pole locations make for some marvellous things to see, and the special effects are good, unfortunately the story is not as engaging as in the previous, it is not all that funny, and there is almost no feel of magic and wonder, the younger audience watching may be entertained a little, a disappointing seasonal comedy adventure.

4,paul_haakonsen,"Good enough, for a sequel...",6,2 December 2020,"When I found out that they put out a part two of ""The Christmas Chronicles"", I must admit that I was rather looking forward to watching it as the 2018 movie was rather spectacular, and a much needed addition to the holiday movie genre.Alas, ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"", while it is entertaining and watchable, does suffer from being a sequel. This 2020 movie from writers Matt Lieberman, Chris Columbus and David Guggenheim just didn't have the same punch or adrenaline, nor the same wholesome family feel, that the 2018 movie had. Now, don't get me wrong here, because ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" is definitely an entertaining and enjoyable Christmas movie, no doubt about it. It just didn't stand out as being full up to scale with its predecessor.The storyline was good, although lacking the spark that drove the 2018 movie. What the storyline in ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" suffered from was that it was being a bit too generic and it seemed like director Chris Columbus was just playing it way too safe and settling on a formula that have already been used and used again in Christmas movies year after year.It should be said, though, that actor Kurt Russell is so well-cast for the role of Santa Claus for these movies. He has that special charisma and appearance that just makes it work so well, plus he is just outstanding in that role and costume. It was nice to see Goldie Hawn appear in the movie, though it was hard to remove focus from that stiff upper lip she has now. Actress Darby Camp and actor Jahzir Bruno, playing Kate and Jack respectively, also performed very well in the movie, clearly enjoying what they were doing in the movie. It was nice to hear the iconic voice of Malcolm McDowell make an appearance as well.""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" is definitely a watchable movie, albeit it is a sequel after all, for better or worse.My rating of ""The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two"" lands on a six out of ten stars. Well-worth sitting down to watch, especially if you have already seen the first movie, and if you have children at your side as well, because the movie appeals to viewers of all ages.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
5,blanche-2,"not as good as the first one, but still fun",8,15 February 2021,"It's a Christmas movie, not Citizen Kane.Granted, the first Christmas Chronicles was superior, but this one, with Kurt as Santa again and Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Santa, has plenty to recommend it - good performances and fun effects.If it's a little hokey, well, that's Christmas for you.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
6,CinemaSerf,Rudolph's lost his way a bit with this sequel.,6,10 December 2020,"The first film was an enjoyable series of daft escapades full of the Christmas spirit. This follow-up introduces additional characters including the quite engaging Jahzir Bruno (who is quite decent with a pump-action pop gun) as ""Jack""; ""Mrs. Claus"" (Goldie Hawn - who has a mean way of getting kids to eat their greens) and a rather annoying Julian Dennison as the rogue elf ""Belsnickel"" who is intent on taking over Santa's toy making world. I hate puppets in films, by and large and at times this reminded me of ""Gremlins"" (1984) with a few ""Ewoks"" thrown in for good measure, and the tempo is a little more sinister as some of these elves are a just a bit too scheming. Kurt Russell is still having a ball, though and his energy and mischievous spirit keeps the role alive. The last twenty minutes give a little more for the adults watching to get into (there's even a fun sleigh duel with a nod to ""Spartacus"" (1960)) but I found the other characterisations to be a bit twee, flat even and the plot has a rather more derivative inevitability about it. It's still fun to watch, just not a patch on the first one.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
7,Calicodreamin,Cute enough,6,25 November 2020,"A cute enough Christmas movie, love the dynamic of Hawn and Russell, it was everything! The acting was a bit cringe at times, but overall it was a fairly well developed storyline and some heartfelt moments.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
8,trashgang,perfect follow-up,7,4 January 2021,"Watched the first one last year and di watch this with the family on Christmas Day itself. Very entertaining and again with a bit of singing.Kurt Russel does wel as Father Christmas. Story is okay and funny now and then espescially with the trolls or elfs, call them what you want. Normally I'm not into all those Christmas flick, one happy family and peacufull world but none of that here. One adventure to save the town of Father Christmas.Yep, I liked it.

9,Lejink,Christmas Turkey,4,6 December 2020,"I really enjoyed the first Netflix-produced ""Christmas Chronicles"" film from 2018 and with my wife today having spent all afternoon on her labour of love, setting up our Christmas tree this year, I was certainly enthused about our watching together its sequel as the first of no doubt a few seasonal films we'll likely catch this month.Sorry to report then that the follow-up just wasn't anywhere near as good this time around. The main characters are pretty much the same although with newly added P.C. casting as the young white girl Kate from the previous film, again played by Darby Camp and even younger new black boy Jack, played by Jahzir Bruno, end up back at the North Pole with Santa and Mrs Claus, the real-life Mr and Mrs Kurt Russell, i.e. plus Goldie Hawn, this time very much a 50/50 partnership, so much so that even Santa's Village is rechristened Mrs Claus's Village. It turns out that Kate's dad has died and she grudges her mum finding new love with her handsome black boy-friend, father of Jack, as she still clings to the memory of her old dearly-departed dad.The wider picture this time is that Christmas is threatened this year by a rogue elf-turned-human, Belsnickel who finds a way to turn all the happy little elves into nasty Gremlins, almost fatally injure Dasher the reindeer and steal the Christmas Star too. So Santa teams up with Kate and Mrs Claus with Jack in separate adventures to literally save the (Christmas) day and of course resolve Kate's issues with her old man with a ""Back To The Future"" twist I saw coming way in advance.On the positive side the CGI depictions of the magical village, the elves and Santa's sleigh were again all rendered superbly, Kurt and Goldie (even with her pneumatic lips) are cute together as Mr and Mrs Claus but the story this time was just too obvious, with its blatant references to ""Home Alone"", ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and ""B.T.T.F."" as well as being cliched and lacking in depth. I also predicted to the second just when the big musical interlude would pop up but also felt that if you have the great Darlene Love in the cast, surely have her sing her Spector-produced classic ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"" and not some mediocre ""Spirit Of Christmas"" number instead. Oh, and if like me, you got bored with all the overdone SFX which overwhelm the story at the expense of plot or characterisation, you can amuse yourself by playing a game of ""Spot the Blatantly Obvious Product Placement"").Listen, it's approaching Christmas and I really should be feeling charitable at this time of the year but watching this, especially remembering the quality of the original, was like eagerly opening one of your presents on Christmas morning and finding it's just a pair of new socks.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Ho Ho No.,5,21 December 2020,"'The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two (2020)' is certainly worse than its predecessor, never quite capturing the feeling of a proper Christmas caper. To be honest, it doesn't really feel like a Christmas film at all, despite all the festive milieu inevitably associated with Santa and his elves. Speaking of elves, the furry little freaks are given a lot more screen-time here than they were in the first flick, running amok for a majority of the movie and mugging the camera for all it's worth. They're actually quite unsettling to see in a strange way; they're cringe-worthy and overbearing, with weird visual-designs and grating vocals. After a while, it starts to almost hurt when they appear. Of course, the elves aren't the only issue with the film. Firstly, it takes absolutely ages to get going; it's almost an hour before any real stakes are introduced. Secondly, the actual adventure feels oddly rushed and underwhelming. It doesn't feel cohesive and its relation to 'saving Christmas' actually seems pretty weak. Finally, the finale is so sugary that you can almost feel your blood sugar rising. I mean, I know it's a Christmas movie and there are supposed to be hokey lessons learned but, come on, saccharine doesn't even begin to describe the auto-tuned ending. Having said all that, the thing isn't a totally terrible time. It's bad, don't get me wrong, but it isn't boring. Occasionally, it's almost fun - and I do mean ""almost"" - to laugh at. It's trying to do the right thing, too. Its highlight is actually one of its newcomers: a polite and generally personable young lad who must learn to do things independently (and that he may not actually be allergic to lactose). It's a breath of fresh air every time he comes into play. That's not to say that the other actors aren't doing a good job, though; Russell and Hawn are doing exactly what they need to. Like I said, it's not a terrible experience. It actually tries to deal with some almost 'mature' themes. It's nowhere near as good as the first, but it seems to be skewing slightly younger anyway. Perhaps it will appeal solely to little kids, rather than entire families (though the grown-ups will still have to sit through it). 5/10.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
11,A_Different_Drummer,No X-Mas Spirit Whatsoever,5,30 November 2020,"While Hawn and Russell are clearly having a blast, the XMAS SCRIPT FROM HELL offers a really creepy elf (with what seems an Australian accent?) but no X-Mas spirit whatsoever.

16,lisafordeay,An enjoyable sequel to the 2018 film,7,29 November 2020,"The Christmas Chronicels Part 2 is the sequel to the 2018 movie from Netflix and it is directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone,Mrs Doubtfire). Starring real life couple Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell,the story is about Katie(Darby Camp) who is a cynic teen now,as her mom has moved on with a widow father(Tyrese Gibson from fast and furious) and his son Jack(Tyler Bruno from the witches remake). When a mysterious boy brings Katie and Jack back to the North Pole, they team up with Santa (Russell) and Mrs Clause(Hawn) to take down the mysterious boy who happens to be an elf who transformed into a human due to turning bad and he wants to take over the north pole.
Overall it's a good movie and if you liked the first one then do check this one out.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Kurt Russell gets back in the role of Santa like he never left, and Goldie Hawn brings a delight to Mrs Claus also. The story is very well told, and effects are beyond amazing. There are few little surprises along the way. But I'm telling you like enjoy the second ride.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
18,yusufpiskin,Judah Lewis; A wasted talent.,4,25 November 2020,"It's hard for me to determine if anyone would actually like this due to the insane change in energy from the first one. That's mainly courtesy of Kurt Russell and many of the things he does and lines he spouts in the film. But if you're able to make it at least until the kids make it to the North Pole, I'm sure you'll enjoy the remainder of the film. Russell still has consistent quality in his performance of Santa and bringing Goldie Hawn along for the ride was a nice addition, obviously having a lot of chemistry between the two on screen couple as they are a real life couple too.Something that was a bit frustrating was ""replacing"" Judah Lewis with Jahzir Bruno who seems to be trying a bit too hard. He is playing the kid of Lewis' and Darby Camp's mom's new boyfriend, Tyrese freakin' Gibson. Mainly we follow Darby Camp but considering the length of the film I would've liked to hop between another, more interesting, character. There's also a quite lengthy, and bonkers, scene where we go back in time to an airport that easily could've been cut. I completely get why it was included however in the end I question if it was even necessary.If you're a fan of 'The Office' you'll definitely be familiar with the villain of the film, Belsnickel, played by Julian Dennison who was in 'Deadpool 2'. He's an elf that was transformed into a human for being naughty and the visual effects for the elves still look horrible. Overall Dennison was okay, I didn't like a lot of the ""one-liners"" they gave him, and the bad lines as a whole is something that sadly carried over from the first one. And instead of producing this time, Chris Columbus directs his first movie since 2015's 'Pixels' which was so bad. I can't hold too much against him for that because he's made the first two 'Home Alone' movies and the first two Harry Potter movies which I criticize a lot less than most do. The story is much more contained due to the fact we spend the majority of the time at the North Pole. And the production design on the village was really good; it reminded me a bit of Hogsmeade. I don't see another one of these movies happening but who knows. As for this, if you can make it through the first roughly 20 minutes with no complaints, I'm sure you'll have a good time in the end.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
19,r96sk,"Close to being a good film, but just a little off unfortunately",6,7 December 2020,"A disappointment, all in all.I very much enjoyed the first film, but 'The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two' is a much weaker entry. Kurt Russell, though still enjoyable, isn't as entertaining as in the 2018 film. It is nice to see him reprise his role though, likewise with Darby Camp, Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Judah Lewis.New additions include Tyrese Gibson, Jahzir Bruno and Julian Dennison. I'm a fan of Tyrese from the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, but he is underused here; when he does feature, he's quite laidback. Bruno is alright, while Dennison is hit-and-miss; he has one or two good moments. Goldie Hawn, meanwhile, has an expanded role.The elves are as great as before, as are the special effects in general. I'd say they are probably more creative with this premise than they were with the 2018 production, but ultimately it doesn't come out as strongly - this one doesn't feel as Christmassy as its predessceor. Also, the musical number is a misfire.Close to being a good film, but just a little off unfortunately.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

21,aidanratesmovies,"Wanted to like it, but it was just too hard to watch",4,25 November 2020,"Although it does provide some nice Christmas colors and things to look at, the unneeded sequel to Netflix's somewhat decent original Christmas flick, is sadly nothing but a hollow film with corny dialogue, mediocre acting, and a convoluted story. I love Kurt Russell, i've been a fan of his work for years, so it saddens me to say that even he isn't enough to give this film the life it hoped for. He stars again as Santa Claus, bringing all he can to the table, but between the horrible dialogue and acting, not to mention the fact that this film is dragged out at least a half an hour more than it needs to be, it sadly just isn't an enjoyable film to watch. I didn't mind the original flick, I wasn't as impressed with it as many other people I know, but I at least found it entertaining and with some good little positive moments. This film however, as sequels usually do, decides to go for the bigger is better type scenario and make everything at least twice as sweet, making it an overly sugary film that is just to corny to bear at times. The acting, besides Russell, is honestly really bad. I don't necessarily have an idea who the worst actor is, but i'm sure in the scheme of things, Tyrese comes quite close (also, why the hell is he even in this movie?). The CGI is incredibly obvious throughout, and there are a few touching moments, but in the end, the film is just too much to of a burden to be worth it. To say the least, you're better off watching the original instead.

22,rannynm,"Heartwarming, Filled With Magic and A Daredevil Santa",10,6 December 2020,"I like The Christmas Chronicles 2 because it is a heartwarming film, full of magic and adventures which makes it so fun to watch. Santa Claus is not the typical Santa we are used to seeing in other movies. This Santa is a type of daredevil Santa.If you watched The Christmas Chronicles in 2018, you must know that Kate (Darby Camp) and her brother Teddy (Judah Lewis) are friends with Santa Claus, played by the one and only Kurt Russell. Kate's mom and her boyfriend Bob (Tyrese Gibson) take Kate, Teddy and Jack (Jahzir Bruno), Bob's son, to celebrate Christmas in Cancun, Mexico. Kate doesn't want to be there as she misses her dad who passed away two years ago. An evil kid named Belsnickel (Julian Dennison) wants to destroy Santa and uses Kate to get to the North Pole to do his dirty deed. Jack follows her so they both end up at the North Pole and that's when ALL the adventure begins!My favorite part is when Jack picks two of Mrs. Claus' special homemade cookies - confidence and bomb. When he needs confidence he forgets which one of the cookies is confidence and almost eats the cookie bomb. The graphics and digital effects are amazing. The reindeers and the cougar look real. The music is very appealing in every scene. The costumes are very seasonal. Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) gives this movie a special touch, which makes this film different from the first movie. Mrs. Claus creates Santa's Village and takes good care of it. The movie mentions how it should be called Mrs. Claus Village, which gives this character the importance she deserves because, in reality, she is the person behind Santa, supporting him, taking care of him and his business.The moral of this movie is to move on, be happy and let others be happy. Throughout the film we learn that Kate doesn't like her mom's new boyfriend and doesn't want Bob substituting for her dad. Santa shows her that family is everything and that they matter the most, so why not cherish that her mom is happy because she found love again in Bob? Kate needs to accept that her mom loves Bob and that doesn't mean she stops loving her dad. She needs to understand her mom deserves to be happy. Life continues; people need to move on.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults.

It's literally my 2 least favorite things from the first movie.Fighting for attention, is Darby Camp and Jahzir Bruno (the two should have been the focus of the movie), and Julian Dennison (Fire Fist, from ""Deadpool 2"") as Belsnickel.....a Christmas character I only know from ""The Office"", and it was not a great character.Honestly, it's like they watched the original and were pissed Kurt Russell was outshined by a child and they determined not to allow it to happen again.All the charm and child-like wonder that makes Christmas movies special is drowned in weird action sequences and a very grumpy Kiwi.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

25,kjproulx,Lacklustre in Comparison with the First,5,1 December 2020,"I feel like I've been making this argument a lot lately, but I'll say it one more time for the sake of this review. Christmas movies, especially when it comes to stories based around Santa Claus, seem to be very few and far between. Back in 2018 when The Christmas Chronicles hit Netflix, I found myself really enjoying the light tone and good-heartedness of the entire film from start to finish. For that reason alone I was looking forward to continuing the mythology that was explored. Well, The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two has now hit Netflix and while there are some very fun, family adventure to be had, it has definitely lost a bit of the magic that made the first one so enjoyable.As soon as this film began, I started rolling my eyes, wondering just how low it was going to sink after the first scene. Starting with a mysterious young man as it's very clear that his goal is to stop Santa and cancel Christmas, I found myself wondering why yet another holiday film was using a story like this. To the film's credit, there were multiple times where it proved me wrong and actually had a decent backstory for why certain things were happening, but it wasn't to the point that it changed my mind. I still found this film to be incredibly lacklustre in terms of storytelling. Where this film does soar, just like the first film, is in the wonderful casting of Kurt Russell as Santa.This time around, the kids from the first film are a little older and more mature as performers. I found that to be a breath of fresh air, especially when re-aqauiting themselves with Santa. With the addition of young Jahzir Bruno and a much more significant role for Goldie Hawn, there wasn't much to complain about in terms of the cast. Although, Tyrese Gibson plays a very small role here as a new father-figure type and I just didn't buy him as that character at all. I like him as an actor, but I don't think his performance fits this film. So as far as watching a likeable cast goes, The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two hits a home run for the most part, especially when looking at it as a holiday film that was dropped on Netflix.
Diving deeper into why this film didn't work all that well for me; I must admit that its predecessor had a very firm grasp on pace. The first film is nearly 15 minutes shorter than this one and has a much more meaningful story to tell. Sure, there are some very nice character moments and a little time travelling portion that put a little smile on my face, but it just wasn't enough throughout this nearly two-hour film to win me over. Another thing this film does is feel the need to repeat some of the best moments. The first film had a great, fun karaoke sequence that morphs into a flat-out musical number this time, which was fun, but the screenplay just felt like it took story beats from the first movie that worked and tried to inject a few new elements.In the end, I think what frustrated me the most about this sequel was the fact that the story of the first film was so enjoyable and I loved the world they put together, that this film really didn't do much with any of that. It instead took a very standard villain premise and ran with it. Although the first one didn't have me shouting to the rooftops that people desperately need to see it, I still had some mild expectations for this one and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little letdown. If you loved the first film, you'll probably find some enjoyment here, as I did, but it just didn't work as an overall standalone film or great sequel to me. So you can take that as a very, very loose recommendation from me if you've seen its predecessor. The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two is now streaming on Netflix.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Sure there are weak points in it but visually it's stunning and what's more it's actually very funny. If you are feeling in need of some Christmas fun then this is well worth watching.

Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn are terrifically cast and try hard to power through this sequel, but it's not enough to save it.

31,jamiedarlow-37510,'Christmas must prevail!!',7,28 February 2021,"A mental Christmas film 😂 Kurt Russell is back as Santa Clause (reason enough to watch!) and this time Kate Pierce (Darby Camp) now a teenager and struggling with home life, is unexpectedly transported to the North Pole when a mysterious enemy named Belsnickel (Julian Dennison) threatens to destroy Christmas forever. Director Chris Columbus (Harry Potter 1 + 2, Home Alone) steps up behind the camera after a producers role in the original movie a couple of years back and it definately feels more epic than the last. Not necessarily as much of a laid back and relaxed watch as the previous one which is it's only downfall but replaced with crazy cheese balls of Christmas joy and turns Santa very much into an action hero at times 😂 I laughed out loud more than once! The inclusion of Goldie Hawn as Mrs Clause is really cool and she brings a lot of the soul into the character interactions here. Not an essential but a pretty good one to stick on during the festive season.

38,Mivas_Greece,"Amazing effects, cute elves and Santa's village, but lacks the aunthenticity of the first film.",7,27 December 2020,"Christmas / family movie. The amazing Kurt Russell returns as Santa in another fantastic story for the whole family. The second film travels us with wonderful scenery, effects, etc. in the village of Santa Claus, with its cute little elves and very beautiful moments at the North Pole. It is probably the best film that has come out to date in this part. It also tells the story of Santa Claus from Asia Minor (indicating his Greek origin, but also advertising Greece in some spots), but also in an allegorical way shows us the importance and power of the Star of Bethlehem and how important it is for Christmas. Compared to the first, this film focuses more on children and in terms of script and direction it has some clichés such as that an evil ex-elf wants to destroy Christmas and it becomes a battle and a chase etc, while the big song of the film, although very beautiful and optimistic, is way below the unique song of the first film with the unique Kurt Russell in the role of jazzman Santa Claus. So it is a little below the first film, up to half a star, despite the abundant effects, as the first was more ""authentic"", more meaningful and enjoyable by everyone not just the kids. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful Christmas movie and like the first one, one of the best Christmas movies ever released and a shine of hope in recent years, where movies of this genre are now rare.6.5-7 / 10 by me, recommended to everyone, although not as authentic and fun as the first one.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
39,MickeyTheConstant,Better than the first,9,31 December 2020,I really enjoyed this. Much better than the first. Only annoying thing is the girl who is a bit of a brat and hard to root for.

40,skullhead739,Very average,5,30 December 2020,"This suffers the same poorly done sequal curse as most popular movies. The first film id give a 8/10 this is a strong 4.5/10. The story was insanely cheesy which i would usually love but it was way over done even for me. The kids characters don't seem like them at all. ""Santa"" aka the great kurt russel even his soul didn't add to the void of this film. And the very worst thing is Julian Dennison.. he is by far the worst villain I have seen this year and probably top 5 worst of all time. His acting was extremely poor and lacking all believability. He's cheesy, dull and the wrong part for this role.Now for the good. Kurt russel is awesome and does well at adding charisma and Christmas spirit although the writing, script and overall directing on his characters wasn't done the best as he is overly cheesy and dorky unlike the first one where he was still fairly badass. The kids are still decent but the writing again was poor. The film does a good job of giving Christmas feels and the elves are extremely adorable. Overall a fairly lackluster sequal to what was a decent film. I'd probably reccomend you'd skip this one, as I won't be watching it again in my lifetime.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

All the lame Christmas movies nowadays and this falls into the same list.Pressured due to the pandemic, mostly all special effects, probably entertained the very young generation (although they forgot to cut out some swearing) and ultimately lost the audience.

That being said this movie is still very Christmasy and you can truly tell Kurt loved coming back to this role, he enjoys being Santa and you can tell he loves Christmas and the fact mrs clause is played by his long time spouse is amazing. Definitely isn't a 10 like the first instalment but this is still better then any of the hallmark Christmas movies and probably 90% better then most other Christmas movies.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

But I wouldn't lose this despite them.
The whole family enjoyed this 2nd part as much or even more than the 1st.
Most of the negative reviews are one sentence reviews without explaining anything. Maybe in some part of the world they decided it is not meant for them and they had to attack a movie which is about family values at Christmas. Many attacked the cast as if Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn are new actors and they don't know how to act? Maybe the utopic family for them is not like that and maybe the CGI is not perfect to them. Well you know what? they can start the year going to psychiatrist to find their real problem.
This movie is perfect and I would gladly watch it again and again. Don't lose it!
I will suscribe to NETFLIX immediately to have every now and then a story from the Xmas Chronicles encyclopedia for as long as Kurt Russell wears his red clothes!",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
47,mbhgkmsgg,A little disappointed,5,30 November 2020,"What is it with Netflix and disappointing and unnecessary sequels? The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two is worse than its predecessor in pretty much every way. It's never as charming or fun, nor is it quite as heartwarming or enjoyable. However, it does manage to be entertaining almost throughout, which, I suppose, is all it really needs to do.Whenever I watch movies like this, I try to take them a little less seriously. After all, what's the point of criticising a film like The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two? It's meant as a bit of cheer and fun for the whole family. Kids will undoubtedly like this, and I think that most adults will have a fun time as well. And if it weren't for the fact that this movie had a more enjoyable prequel, I probably would have liked it more. I suppose that what I'm really complaining about is just my own disappointment.The first part of this saga was better than I ever dared to imagine. It was cheesy and charming, and it made me smile and laugh on multiple occasions. Unfortunately, it feels like all those things are toned down in this one. There are way fewer laughs and heartwarming moments. Something that ends up being quite problematic for this type of film. The lack of these qualities seems to replaced with a far more ambitious story. I have zero doubt that most kids will find this story more than entertaining enough. However, watching it as an adult, I can't help but feel that the sacrifices made for the story weren't worth it. It's also abundantly clear that the story is aimed at younger audiences. With references to Instagram and drones and gaming, it's doesn't take a lot to see who the target audience is.This brings me to what was perhaps my biggest problem with The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two. The need to modernize everything. I have a quite strong dislike for these unnecessary references to things that are thought to be cool. Especially when the references add nothing to the story. And even more so, when they feel forced. There are a few moments early on in this film that matched this description. Luckily, once the story gets going, this need to make everything feel up to date is forgotten. I mean, it's a movie about Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, and Christmas. That should be enough on its own right?At the end of the day, though, this movie manages to be entertaining and fun enough to make it enjoyable for the whole family. Kurt Russel is still the driving force in this film and a hoot as Santa Claus. While The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two isn't as good as its predecessor, it still does its job of creating Christmas cheer and providing you with a fun time.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
48,jamericanbeauty,Christmas Chronicles II: Origins,1,23 December 2020,"The first Christmas Chronicles had charm and humor and a fractured family, at its core, that found its way back to togetherness and the Christmas spirit via a magical adventure with a colorful Santa Claus, played to perfection by Kurt Russell. I loved his eccentric elves! It wasn't just some meaningless, sugary movie. It dealt with loss, acceptance, selflessness and faith/hope/belief. Christmas Chronicles 2 has none of the above. No depth. No fun. No chemistry between the returning or new cast. Even the always charismatic Tyrese seemed off. The kids don't talk like real kids, as they serve up misplaced talking points. Santa Claus gets a shallow backstory, which really serves as a lazy backstory for the villain. The actor playing the villain ruined Deadpool 2 for me, and he was equally bad here. He's one-dimensional and can't act. As for the Northpole, Mrs. Klaus is the brains behind the operation, we're told and retold. If I took a shot every time ""Mrs. Claus"" was mentioned, I'd have a nice buzz going. 40 minutes into the movie, I called it quits.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

The first felt magical and captivating as the interactions with human life, really hit home about the belief required for Christmas.
This film was way over the top with the CGI, the plot was shocking, and the part of Belsnickel was played terribly.The kid can certainly play the part of a pissed off arsonist on Deapool 2 easily, a disgruntled elf however........no, just no.Please just watch number 1 again as this film will ruin your Xmas movie night.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
50,traceytak,Total letdown!,2,30 November 2020,"Christmas chronicles original movie was good, relevant as it was set in normal settings (mostly). Number 2 wasn't a family movie, but completely aimed at very young children. Kurt Russell is a brilliant Santa, hence the 2 points. But Goldie is just wooden in this and constantly talking like a teacher does to kindergarten children. The villain has a strange accent that simply doesn't make him natural for the part. It's definitely not a film for all ages like the original was and it's a shame as the original was very good. Note to Kurt, sometimes you have to tell the wife NO! get your own movie, don't tailgate on my successes",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
51,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,Loved it!!!,8,27 November 2020,"Let me get this out of the way now - Kurt Russell is still super HOT.*ahem* OK!I absolutely love this series. Admittedly, when I watched part one a couple of years ago I was super excited to see a Christmas movie reimagined for modern times and done so well. Watching part 2 was almost just as exciting. I'm thrilled that they expanded the series a bit and we got to enjoy Goldie more this time around. I'm also glad that they had the same kids (plus the cute new addition) because it bothers me when sequels ditch the original actors.The Christmas Chronicles (1 and 2) is truly a fun, heartwarming movie that you can snuggle up on the couch and watch every single holiday season. Yes, it is a bit cheesy but that is what Christmas movies are all about.

52,mmuggi,Why a second outing..,4,24 December 2020,"All Chris Columbus wants for Christmas is mayhem. He may not fully admit it, insulating his destructive impulses with protective layers of plastic sentiment, but from his screenplay for the first Gremlins to his direction of the first two Home Alone movies, he clearly yearns to inflict pain in between mandatory expressions of holiday cheer . He wants that here too, with his CGI goblins going crazy in elfbane. No - it's not explained what elfbane is or why they go crazy - and yes, the movie is pure CGI hell. It lacks the charm of the first film, Tyrese Gibson (despite his very small role) does not work, the North Pole is not properly despicted, and then they have to drop to break the 4th Wall - it has not been cool since House of Cards.

Even when an actor only had 3 or 4 scenes they're still stiff, awkward and poor.
I'm not sure who did the casting, but they didn't do a good job of finding really good actors.The story is also weak and predictable at every beat. At the mid point the main young actress meets a random boy, you can guess who the young boy is even before she meets him.The cginin parts is very good, but others it's very very poor for a 2020 movie. The ending of the movie is almost spoiled due to the poorly crafted CGI.Nevertheless... Kids won't notice all of that.

56,ty-jensen,Fine like the original.,5,26 November 2020,"The Christmas Chronicles movies are fine, they're entertaining but forgettable. Yes, the original is better but that's not saying much really.The acting is good mainly Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, they have good chemistry since they're a real life couple and I enjoyed Overboard which I seen twice. I knew from common sense Judah Lewis would barely be in it but I still wasn't pleased. Some may feel the black kid overacted.The script was paper thin, I think it was quickly written. The villain's backstory was rushed but I wasn't expecting a good villain anyway. The time travel subplot was entertaining but forced.The humor is fine, it's lackluster. This movie is a little cheesier than the original mainly emotion wise. The elves has more screen time so there's more slapstick. This movie is more concerned with being whimsical than funny.Overall, Christmas Chronicles 2 is just okay like the original. I figured it would be weaker than the original.

And when that wraps you realize you may not have completely wasted your time, it picks up quickly from there. Okay, the ""Oh Christmas Tree"" finale may have been a tad too long.I was mildly curious why the older brother Teddy character had only twelve lines in this movie compared to his coming-of-age epiphanies in the first, but whatever, the sister and her future step brother here carried all the kid stuff. I couldn't figure out why Malcolm McDowell was getting screen credit, I figure he must be an elf.I dunno - Harry Potter meets Gremlins during Christmas break? ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is still my favorite Chris Columbus film, always a pleasure to watch Kirk Russell & Goldie Hawn make acting look easy, and the young actor from New Zealand is great.

58,actaction,Feeling gone; glitz ad-nausea,3,26 November 2020,"I rewatched the first film right after finishing this, because I had forgotten what I even liked to begin with that was missing here... turns out it was a lot. Firstly, the main character is gone, Teddy (Judah Lewis)... but he's the lucky one because those who are present are all only half-there. There's no family thread, except one that gets sloppily bookended to the beginning and end with the care of a 90's sitcom (essentially a Full House subplot quality, teen girl temper tantrum). The first film they were dealing with a recent death, a cynical world, the son slipping into a realistic life of crime. Where do we start out here? On vacation??? Yes, their first world problem is that Kate (Darby Camp) is upset her mom is dating an awesome guy. I say problem, but this isn't really dealt with as she immediately gets away from the entire cast of her family to have a separate adventure hanging out with Santa (Kurt Russell) and wife (Goldie Hawn) in a bland mess of cliches that only a very young child will like (it does have bright colors flashing).The rest of the film is a sloppy CGI romp through the North Pole, feeling much like the mess of Santa Clause 2 & 3, super villain and all. We're told the title Christmas Chronicles is no longer their video camera footage (as video camera films are no longer popular) but a series of novels (no doubt to establish a possible franchise and bunch of sequels). The film isn't set in a realistic nowadays world, but 100% in a fantasy, so essentially a totally different type a film and NOT a continuation of the first film. This would be like Christmas Vacation being set entirely in Clark Griswald's sex dream and acting like it's a sequel. It makes no sense. The elves are more like Gremlins (thank you Chris Columbus, just make Gremlins 3 already) than the edgy but sweet creatures from the first, with a goofy drug Elf-bane explanation of why they are snarling.A bland villain pulls the plot along screaming all the way, instead of the protagonists (which should lead it). Their only motivation is to stop the bad guy, whose motivation is to stop the good guy. That's it. Spy vs spy. That's the movie. Absent are the bystander characters that made the first film fun, the cops, the waitress at the restaurant, the guy who stole the car first, the people in jail. We don't get any characters to really see their transformation due to their seeing Santa is real, ya know the magic of the first film. Santa is still cool, but without his sarcastic edge, snappy lines. In short, the fun is totally gone. It's got 10x the effects and none of the heart or story-building that made the original worth watching over and over. Terrible. Absolutely inexcusable.

62,d_carlotaj,CC2: Specifically Written For Small Children,10,29 November 2020,"""Christmas Chronicles 2,"" (2020). Starring Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn. Directed by Chris Columbus. The little heroes, Kate and Jack, are played by Darby Camp and Jahzir Bruno. Jahzir was a natural. His performance was least contrived and a sure bet to delight the young viewers. Although the first Chronicles appealed to a wider audience, this film is particularly suited to the point of view of a much younger viewer. The most notable difference from CC1 is the attention to detail in the creation of a fantasy world. There are so many homages to children's classics: E.T., Star Wars, the Grinch, even Diego from Ice Age, a feminist's statement for the egos of little girls, and many more. I enjoyed trying to spot them. The other characters, Mrs. Claus and Santa, embraced their characters with relish (that's my homage to Grease). Goldie's midas touch was perfect as only she can do. Kurt's Santa hit all the right notes. Unlike Whoville, Santa's Workshop was pretty well dominated by CGI. But how else could the Aurora Borealis come to life? The kids are going to love this! I did.

First 45 minutes seem pointless and many people would skip the movie then & there.
I didn't expect a laugh riot but an exciting one at least like the first.
But this movie fails on all fronts",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
67,sandlot1992,a Really Good Decent Sequel,6,11 December 2020,"If you like the first Movie, then you'll enjoy the sequel that's really good in everyone's book! Director Chris Columbus is a job well down after directing previous movies like Adventures in Babysitting, Home Alone 1 & 2, Mrs. Doubtfire and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Goldie Hawn delivers as Mrs. Claus since she did appeared in the first movie as the end and Kurt reprising his role as Santa Claus as well. the story was okay despite Katie now a 13 year girl on a family vacation with her older brother, along with there mom and her new boyfriend, a new character for the film name Belsnickel who's the villain of this movie since he once was a elf and turned human after doing naughty tricks compared to something like in the Care Bears like from ""the Care Bears Movie 2: a new generation"" and there's even a sub-plot in which Santa Claus and Katie Pierce end up traveling back in time to Christmas eve 1990 in which Katie's deceased Father Doug was a young boy in which Kate meets is like something from a scene in Back to the Future, plus Malcolm McDowell who plays as magical elf Hakan is marvelous. if you like any good sequel to a christmas like Home Alone 2: Lost in New York and the 2 Santa Claus movies with Tim Allen, check this out even if you have kids will truly enjoy it along with the first movie.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

It turns out this sequel is almost as good as the first one but just in different ways. Although it was literally ""all over the place"", I have to say I like it. The airport scene was everything. In my honest opinion, Christmas Chronicles has culminated into something really magical! Did anyone have tears as I did lol?

71,monsterhunt-94296,Simple family film,6,31 May 2021,"I watched The Christmas Chronicles 2 with my family. I'm just taking this at face value here, it's a family Christmas movie that is just meant to entertain and teach some very simple messages to small children. The film has some moments that drag on for too long, some dialogue that's very cliched, and characters talking out loud to themselves is annoying, but other than that there wasn't anything that made this film unbearable for me. It kept me entertained although I did almost fall asleep, but it had some simple messages about family I guess that are very common and nothing new. It has some CGI that doesn't look the best but it also has some CGI that looks pretty good. It serves its purpose well enough, I watched this without seeing the first one and had no problems keeping up, but overall just a simple family Christmas flick. 6/10.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Was it the same person who decided that to count as a film something has to be 2 hours long? This would have been so much better if it had been half the length. There are so many superfluous scenes and nonsensical happenings it just ruins it. Found it mostly boring and lacking the charm of the original.2 stars for Kurt Russell, who is a brilliant Santa.

78,trafalgardeathsurgeonoflaw,Isn't as good as the first,5,6 December 2020,"The magic wasn't there like the first one.First off, the widowed parents booked a trip to spend together with their underaged children then ditches them, leaving them unattended, at the resort in another country! What parent does that!? That is neglectful at best. If they wanted to spend time with each other, they could have left the kids at home where they know their way around.The one thing I don't get: why the heck are two widowed parents leaving their underaged children unattended while they go to the ruins alone for a full day!? It's way worse than the first one in the sense the first one didn't have the parents neglect their children by leaving them alone in a completely different country! I mean at least in the first movie, the mom was working and the kids were homeSecond, Teddy made the first movie memorable. The character development of Teddy in the first movie made it magical. Then this movie ditches him and portrays him as ""I'm going to ditch you guys and talk to girls"" and that was it.The character development in this story was poor to say the least. The bad guy didn't have much going for him in the regards of why he actually turned evil or ""cursed"". Kate was annoying. She turned into a snobby teenager and didn't have any character development besides meeting her father when he was a kid then magically became better to everyone. Yes it was the whole ""saying goodbye to dad"" thing but really how she acted was not ok from the beginning and Santa treated it as ""well she's a true believer"" and didn't even talk about how bad her attitude was towards her mom's boyfriend or his kid. It was wrong. The boy didn't have much going for him, he was the scaredy cat boy that instantly became the hero that didn't worry about anything with little to no effort. The ""courage"" cookie wasn't really needed because that was too much of a cliche used in every form of media.The scene with Doug was too cliche too. If Doug could see a ""true believer"" because his family is full of them, then why did it take his daughter so long in the first movie to realize she was a ""true believer""? And how could he just tell from a sad looking girl that she was a true believer? It just was too predictable and forced in a way.The singing scene was ok for the first minute but then dragged on too long and no one questioned it, not Kate or Doug or anyone elseThe elves got annoying. fast. Unlike the first movie, this one was like 99.5% elves and even in the first one the elves were cute but annoying but this movie... was mostly annoyingI did appreciate the attention to detail though, like how the TV stations were in elvish and things like that.The movie's story was good, but there was just a disconnect from the first movie's magic. Most sequels have that issue and I really hope they take into consideration the positive feedback and the negative feedback (not hate) people are giving them if they ever plan to make a third movie. Make the magical development of the first movie instead of fancy effects. That's what made the first one so magical.Though an elf trying to destroy Christmas was something I never seen before, so originality is on their side, but just not the magic or wholesomeness from the first movie.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Santa was a bad ass as he pretty much knew EVERYTHING. This one is like a send up to the first. No character development, poor use of talent, none of the magic as Santa is now just a regular person fighting for his home. Sadly, even the chrisma of Goldie and Kurt and Darby cant help.I have to say the one good scene is in the airport, not the singing, but it is the only one in the film.

It includes a great Santa/Elvis song in the middle and one of the best Santas in a long time (Kurt Russel). They story was fun, the characters interesting.This movie is a bad movie and it's only saving grace is that Russel reprises his roll as Santa. The premise of someone trying to steal Christmas from Santa is just boring and overdone, or done much better in other movies. This movie is on par with ""Santa Clause 3"", which had more or less the same plot. Even the musical number in the middle of the movie was a flop. Watch it, your kids might like it, but it is a poor companion to the original.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

He barely had to redeem himself in the end and it was like nothing happened, all was forgiven.Then it felt like a mix if Gremlins and Back to the Future concepts tossed in. So strange.

Everything was schlock, copycatting every bad guy known to family film, poor acting (outside of Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn and that darling Darby Camp). The other characters were beyond cliche'. They dripped with ho-hum and Judah Lewis had no role at all.The schlocky dance routine took the movie to an entire new low, as did the ""bad guy kid"" who offered nothing to the script or screen. Sorry, but this was the worst writing I've seen in years.Too much CGI, Mrs. Claus has to perform witchcraft to heal a reindeer and her elves, yet the Clauses can twitch their finger across their nose and make anything else happen.

We are at 1hr:32min with 23 min remaining and I don't think this is going to get finished.They introduced wayyy to many new elements, concepts and stories for the viewer to be able to follow.

My kids loved it and I'd probably let them watch it again, but this one was psychotic. Why is the bad guy even named Belsnickel if he's just a normal looking human/elf? And why does he speak English with a kiwi accent when all the other elves just speak Elvish?
I get it that the real Belsnickel would have been super creepy and not family friendly. I'm just so confused that they used that name.
That aside, while the movie was obviously centered around Christmas and Santa lore, I forgot a few times that it was a Christmas movie or had anything to do with the first movie. It was just strange. And don't get me started on that musical number.

117,RageQuitLeigh,There's a lot to enjoy...,7,24 December 2020,"This is a reasonable sequel to the Christmas chronicles which was the best Christmas movie for some years. That being said this sequel isn't a patch on the first instalment.For me it's feels more like a kids movie with a Christmas theme rather than a Christmas movie that has kids in it. I feel there is definitely a distinction between the two. Elf, home alone and loads of the classics are great Christmas movies not just kids movies.That being said there is a lot to enjoy. Kurt Russell is excellent again (although less standout moments than the first movie) this time joined by Goldie Hawn as Mrs Claus. The cgi is for me whilst looks a bit silly character wise is seamless with the real sets and characters, very impressive in my opinion. Also the story whilst not being the most clever or original constantly lightly pulls on your heartstrings which provides a enjoyable watch.Worth a watch, has the Christmas spirit you want and better than the average Christmas attempts, but most likely falls short of getting into many Christmas rotations going forward.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

119,Sir Gerry,This is what you get when...,6,16 December 2020,"Your writers and producer (Netflix) care more about the social justice message than a good story. This has nothing to do with the first one, which had adventure, comedy and a strong message about believing, and tradition. In this one the predictable plot about and elf gone rogue is supposed to be the center of the story, but also the cliched rebel teen girl, and the cowardly kid that finds the inner courage he always had. It is very hard to balance all plot points so the movie tumbles as a result. Then add on top that Santa's village should be renamed Mrs Santa's village, all the deers are now female (with male horns, mind you, maybe they are trans) and the little actor representing the black community is terrible and you'll see why the bad reviews. Oh, and don't justify it with ""it's a kid's movie"" because kids are intelligent, and we adults are really tired of forced social justice message, we just want a good Christmas movie that isn't about romance.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

This time around it was just painful. The story is boring, the acting is really bad, the fat evil elf was cringey. I don't have anything nice to say about this stinky movie, save for the fact that I really like Kurt Russell and it was nice to see Goldie sharing the screen with him again.

Santa's encounters in our world with people who don't believe in him were comical, the two siblings struggling to find common ground and come to grips with the tragedy in their lives... it was a great story.
This one goes the route of introducing a villain. A bland villain with no real motivation. Most of the story takes place in a CGI North Pole. The sibling connection is gone as the older brother is swapped out for a new kid with no back story or personality to engage us.

However, I think with this specific movie the whole idea of a sequel here in my opinion is to "" CELEBRATE THE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS "" and that's exactly what this movie does. It was never about which is better, CC1 or CC2, its about each having their own story and bringing in some trouble while saving the Christmas Spirit! So the real problem here is anyone claiming one of these movies was enough or rated either of these movies poorly is clearly just a "" GRINCH "" if they didn't enjoy it so they should go back to their house on the hill buried in the mountains.

142,matrixuk-51283,The woke agenda invades Christmas,1,25 December 2020,"This movie is nothing more than a collection of scenes ripped off from successful movies all wrapped up in an awful woke agenda and tied with a big bow of forced inclusion.
Probably the most cringing scene was the conversation between Santa, Mrs Claus, and the 2 children regarding Santa's village.
Santa states he found the location, the Elves built everything and that Mrs Claus decorated a few of the shops.
Suddenly the forced inclusion children ask ""If Mrs Claus decorated shops why isn't is called Mrs Claus' Village?"" and from then on it's referred to as just that.
Since the Elves built everything why isn't it known as the Elves Christmas village?
Santa has turned in to a moron that can't think for himself because he's a man!
Thinking of watching this on Christmas day then don't.
Watch something good like Arthur Christmas, Elf, or Santa Claus the movie instead.

Other than that it was all very boring the acting was dry with no emotion and the creativity of the plot was too much to handle in the end none of the characters were likeable and it just felt like a dead end to a film that had potential to be a great sequel.

They wanted him to appear more ""suburban soccer dad"" when his whole career was the laid back guy, ""round the way"" dude. His acting was super reserved and felt terrible... doesn't mean he's a bad actor, I just felt this role could have been better for someone liiiiiiiike...

155,ajp2012,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible unless your 5 years old.",3,26 November 2020,"So I watched the first Christmas Chronicles a few weeks ago and I actually really enjoyed it. It was a decent film with the original Santa Clause Movie (Tim Allen) vibes, so naturally I was looking forward to the sequel.
How WRONG could I be. The only plus sides to this, is the fact Goldie Hawn plays a larger part than the first.
So where do I even begin to describe this mess? Firstly I feel that they expanded the target audience to include 3 year olds and pre school children. This becomes a massive problem when things become ridiculously stupid within the movie and people with half a brain don't really see the entertainment value or logic. The acting is also debatable right from the start. The young boy, I don't feel was ready to start acting in a big film role and the girls was questionable too in some parts. Who ever decided on a sequel completely rushed the job, and who ever gave the script the OK should be sacked. The cgi was also 5/10 at best. The plot was nothing unseen before, but the execution was absolutely shocking.
I literally don't want to spend any more time writing, as I've just wasted 2 hours already.
They could have done SO MUCH BETTER.

178,chapelgrovefilms,"Not terrible, but disappointing.",5,17 December 2020,"I LOVED the first ""Christmas Chronicles"". And despite what some others say, everyone in the cast did a really good job with this one. Kurt and Goldie are always great. Darby Camp is a gem! Production values were excellent.For me, the problem was the story. It completely lost the feel of the first movie. I know, I know -- ""It wasn't supposed to BE the first movie!"" I get it. But when you watch a sequel, you do it because you loved the elements that made the original what it was. You want that feeling again. And that feeling is nowhere to be found in this one, sad to say.This one just went way too dark for me. I don't care there was an interracial couple. It never occurred to me to be bothered by that. But the first movie had a sense of the believable to it. Most of it took place in my world, not Santa's. I connected with it. It resonated. It had adventure, humor and wonder. A sense of amazement. But it was amazement at something amazing that had entered into our common little world.This movie takes that away. It takes us into an imaginary world, which is amazing for the characters, but not so much for us. I want to see how Santa negotiates the world I live in -- not how people negotiate the world Santa lives in.Fierce giants cats attacking people and reindeer? Elves going insane and attacking each other and everyone else? An evil enemy bent on Santa's destruction? There was nothing like any of that in the original movie, only people who didn't believe in Santa.Tell a new story. That's fine. But do it with the feel and texture of the first story you told.

Kurt and Goldie were fantastic. It makes you realise what talented actors Kurt and Goldie are, as they blew everyone else out of the water, including Tyrese Gibson who either really didn't want to be there and pretty much read his lines or is actually a really bad actor when you take him away from his comfort zone, as well as Julian Dennison who was the worst bad guy I've ever seen in a film. His acting was awful. The middle of the film song was good fun as Kurt got to sing with the legendary Darlene Love.Topped off with a few laughably forced indentity politics lines to hack away at the great original film, this is the sort of film you stream on Christmas Day while the whole family are over and you're not really paying much attention to what's on tele, but you want something seasonal on your TV to look at.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

201,juzzyshop,Had the potential to be amazing.....but just missed the mark,6,26 December 2020,"The Christmas Chronicles was always going to be hard to follow and I can see where the team behind this sequel wanted to go with it but I just feel it hits the right notes on some fronts and misfires on others.The main positive continues to be Kurt Russell as Santa and his chemistry with Darby Camp as Katie, you can see they love working together, they tried to expand on this by bringing in new characters that just didn't hit right if you were watching.I feel the elves are great in the first one, they're fun, have a touch of mischief about them and of course they're cute, and I keep asking myself ""I know you're there"" but still felt their absence in the entire film.The whole movie felt more like a kids Christmas movie with a very different message than the first one and this caused confusion as it seemed to go back and forth a few times, so it missed with the overall theme.Many other points introduced in this film feel rushed or like a good idea at the time but they have to rush it to a conclusion or forget about it, which leaves the audience wondering what the heck is going on.It's watchable, a fun Christmas film for all the family but don't expect it to be as memorable as the first.Like most Netflix Originals I really need them to get their storytelling in place and stop looking at stats if they're to make the move into the next league of movie-making.So many originals seems to have so much promise but are let down by poor story telling or setup....then again if their secretive raw data says otherwise maybe it's a theme we all need to accept.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

209,ctg-imdb,Just OK,4,11 December 2020,"Not nearly as good as the first. A sequel wasn't required. Not sure why Netflix thought there needed to be one.This movie seemed rushed and carried over a lot of the same elements from the first movie: struggling to drive the sleigh, time limit where Christmas cheer runs out, and a song and dance routine by Santa.The interaction between the mom and the new boyfriend seemed forced but I'm sure it was put in place to cater to the woke mob. Also, what happened to Teddy? He just subjugated to the first and last 10 minutes of the movie, that's it.The first movie stands apart by itself.

213,b_um_p,Lacking everything that made the original so magical,1,22 December 2020,"The original Christmas Chronicles was a lovely, unsuspected surprise. In it, Santa was portrayed as a mysterious, mischievous elf focused on a mission of great importance. Kurt Russell played Santa with an impish glow in his eyes that let you know Santa was always in control, even as he pretended not to be for the benefit of his underage sidekicks.
Gone is that magical confidence and mystery, now replaced by the standard Hollywood caricature of white suburban, clueless, failed father figure.More egregious is the nearly complete elimination of the wonderful relationship between siblings Kate and Teddy which mended so beautifully in the first film. Teddy disappears for most of this sequel's runtime to make way for Jack, the annoying, nagging, soon-to-be stepbrother whose main character arc seems to be about conquering... I dunno, Hypochondria? Fear of heights? Or perhaps just self autonomy in general? Not that it matters, his character is handled so poorly he becomes irrelevant to what little story we're given.Most irritating is the addition of Julian Dennison as a morbidly obese elf /estranged son archetype determined to destroy Santa's North Pole operation in order to... make daddy notice him and rule Christmas from his own stronghold at the South Pole.
Dennison is a curious case. A quick search through IMDB doesn't reveal nepotism or any other explanation as to why he he is allowed to appear in front of a camera. He clearly doesn't belong. His earnest, saccharin line deliveries are unintentionally hilarious. Woefully miscast in Deadpool's sequel, here Dennison's appearance is bordering on offensive. Seriously casting agents, what are you doing?Clearly a sequel COULD have been written that made good use of these new diversity-fueled casting choices. Sadly no attempt was made. The makers of this film seem to believe their inclusion should be enough.
The twinkle in Kurt Russel's eye is gone. Now his eyes seem to be apologizing for this abysmally depressing failure of a holiday film.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

225,tklagesse67,"It's OK, but definitely not like the first one.",4,30 November 2020,"Kurt, again, nails it as Santa, but it's not enough to save the movie from itself. Great tech effects throughout. Unfortunately, that doesn't compensate for a really bad storyline, and VERY bad acting. Tyrese Gibson as Bob was WAY out of his element from his Fast and Furious days, and it was painful to watch. The elves were great to see again, but weren't as fun as last time.In the original CC, Teddy and Kate were the main characters. This time, Kate goes it alone with her potentially future step-brother, not even including Teddy on the adventure.I struggled to stay awake at times, and you might, too. I am not going to beat up the movie with a One-Star review. Four stars for Kurt doing his best to carry the movie, along with the special effects, and the fact we see Mrs. Clause (Goldie Hawn) as one of the main characters this time.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Everything else comes second, like it being interesting and engaging... So mix a fat kid (fat acceptance), a black fiance (BLM), a powerful woman- santa's wife- and make the man - santa- look clumsy and ignorant (feminism - they said like 10 times people should call the north pole Ms Santa's village ??!?) and you have it..This plague which destroys good cinema is here to stay..",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
231,misterbeapjr,Kids will probably enjoy it,5,8 December 2020,"This film had a lot of potential to be great. The story itself was really cool with a villain that is almost constantly being developed throughout, with the inclusion of a lot of Christmas mythology, and with just enough changes to the characters to make them feel like they've grown. It ultimately falls short with poor acting, poor writing, and mediocre editing.They hired an experienced cast that have all given great performances in the past and then chose to only use mediocre takes in the film. Julian Dennison succesfully portrays his character as mischievous prankster that wants to get back at the north pole for betraying him. Unfortunately, in any important story moments he just kind of comes across as a whiny kid that got no attention.Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn give good performances, but are limited by the writing. Sometimes the film will just cut away before the resolution to an important conversation. Usually Mrs. Claus has to act like she's in a commercial for Christmas. I think the writers knew the target audience was kids so they didn't feel the need to make the script good.There are a few instances where the film just cuts to one kid at a time and gets a reaction from both of them. This really destroys the pacing and comes across as the director trying to sell us whatever the characters talking about like in a toy commercial. That said, it probably works wonders on kids.If you are a kid, you'll probably love it because its exciting, understandable, and relatable. If you are an adult, the bad parts will probably stick out like a pumpkin under a pine tree, but you'll still find it to be funny and entertaining most of the time.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

235,kingolympus,An unnecessary sequel.,1,2 March 2021,This movie was just flat out AWFUL. The CGI makes it look like an early 2000's movie and the plot is stupid.

236,mayrwyn,"It's Fine, Sorta",4,27 November 2020,"The first movie was fantastic. For some reason they chose to remove all of the things that made the first one so good, and do...this. Santa and Mrs Claus were entertaining, but this felt like it was santized of the reality that made the first flick so good.And I'm sorry, but the repetitive ""Mrs Claus"" got really top level irritating. She refers to Santa as ""Nick"" - his NAME, as a wife would - but she apparently has no name? Just ""Mrs Claus"", over and over. Did they ever say her name? Did they bother to give her one? If they did, it was so brief it was easily missed and completely overwhelmed by the ""Mrs Claus"" thing. This is subjective, of course, but it was really grating by the end.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

239,nate-33790,"The #2 you get when producers say ""I can write and direct, too""",3,30 November 2020,"When I saw that Chris Columbus, the producer of the first Christmas Chronicles, decided to take the director's chair for this huge, steaming pile of #2, it explained everything. I can just imagine him saying, ""The first one was so successful, probably because I'm so awesome. Clearly I can give the world an amazing #2. How hard can writing and directing be, anyway? Let me just sit down and push this #2 out in 20 minutes.""The only reason I give it even three stars is because Kurt Russell does an amazing job as Santa yet again. Also the production value is pretty good for a Netflix film, which I guess is to be expected when a producer decides (demands?) to also write and direct.Before I continue, let me first admit I fell asleep for the middle half of this. It was that good. Now let me also say, I am confident I didn't miss anything substantive.Now to the nitty-gritty:The plot: contrived and nonsensical. Why do so many Christmas movies have to ""save Christmas"" at such an absurd scale? The first film was fun because the kids got to help ""save"" Christmas, though Santa was never really in trouble and was working instead to save the kids. This also could've been a story of redemption, but instead it was just an opportunity to shoot scenes from ""Gremlins 3: Attack on Mrs. Claus's Village."" No, and just ... no. And these were just the problems with the plot I was awake for.The acting: cringeworthy to straight-up awful, with the exception of Kurt Russell. Darby Camp is as meh as she was in the first. Many of us were excited to see Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus. I think we all assumed she'd be great as a foil to Santa. Columbus must've assumed she'd be great also, and therefore gave her absolutely no direction. Was he afraid to l challenge Goldie to actually act instead of reading her lines from a cue card in a disinterested, monotone voice? For the ""villain"", did Columbus simply tell Julian Dennison to pretend he was still Firefist in Deadpool 2? Was it Columbus's vision for everyone to be one dimensional and uninteresting?Production values: beautiful yet incongruous. Beautiful sets in pretty good CGI do not a worthwhile film make. Most of the fun of the first one was that it was set in the streets of Chicago. Everyone can relate to that. This one seems to need to invent more nonsensical folklore about the North Pole just to prove that it can be done in CGI. No thanks. Nothing about this production pulled me into the story.The wrap-up: my whole family enjoyed the first one enough that we were excited for this one. In fact the first one is on our annual list. Chris Columbus's hubris sent this #2 down the toilet and we cannot forget it's stench quickly enough.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

But it disappointed, turning into a very cheesy kids adventure with a pushover Santa, unlike the more confident character from the first one.Don't get me wrong I really enjoy Kurt Russell films and it had nothing to do with his acting.The main antagonist was poorly written and poorly acted, and the story line left you wanting.Part Two lost the momentum of the first film, which is a big shame.The first one is a Christmas classic but can't recommend this film.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

277,Dustyd425,Terrible sequel,1,16 December 2020,"Although it is far from my favorite Christmas movie, I actually enjoyed the 1st one quit a bit. Alot of funny moments and the plot/story was pretty good... This new part 2 is terrible! Terrible acting (I've seen extremely low budget movie with way better acting) , terrible very pointless plot, the ""villan"" is a terrible actor and tries way too hard to be a bad guy its almost cringe worthy tbh ( he ruins the entire movie, even outside of the fact the plot is very shallow and lack luster) . Me and my wife both really enjoyed the first one and were excited to watch the 2nd one the next night and both struggled to make it all the way thru. Our 3 year old and 6 year old boys both love the 2nd one but I honestly find it unwatchable, and won't ever make a point to watch it again! Truly find it hard to believe this was approved for production, it's almost like someone was forced to put a part 2 out on a moments notice. I don't recommend this movie at all, the first one is decent but I would skip part 2",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

279,hannekefolbert,Actionmovie for kids,5,18 December 2020,"First of all: huge disappointment. The first CC was much better and gave me a Christmas feeling. This one however was more like a bad actionmovie for kids with a Christmas theme.. No christmasspirit at all in my opinion. What family is on a vacation together where the parents leave the kids alone? Teddy is leaving with his girlfriend to go snorkeling, the parents are leaving for Tulum for a night and leave the young kids at a kidsclub (wth?!). Especially when the first CC was all about spending Christmas together as a family, be happy and beloved. Mrs. Claus is happy to finally see real kids and wants to keep them as long as possible in the village, how selfish was that? Oh and the little boy, Jack, acts really annoying in my opinion.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

286,gzsfreak,Crash and Burn,3,28 November 2020,"After watching the original, a couple years ago, I was pretty anxious to sit down with my wife and kids to watch this one. It was so disappointing. It felt like it was pushing for more of a younger viewing audience, but at the same time it had a very dark feel, including a very strange and out of place witchcraft moment. There were some extremely corny scenes, terrible acting, and a Santa sing scene that was so cheesy that my nachos were jealous.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
287,nightsinmoria,Wow,1,25 December 2020,"Painful. What happened?!? First movie was charming and fun. But i barely made it through this one. I wanted to shut it off after 5 minutes, but kept thinking it must get better, but it just got worse.Yeah and the fat kid who ruined Deadpool 2 ruins this one too.This is 2020's way of kicking us in the nards just before leaving as if we needed a reminder of just how awful a year this was.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
288,julieellen-85026,Just go with it - Enjoy a different view of Santa Traditions.,7,25 December 2020,Clunky at times: but it has its moments. And watching Kurt Russell as Santa again is worth any lapses in plot. In CC3 please let him do another Elvis song.,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

What does this teach kids, they can nearly almost end Dasher life, and ruin Christmas, and behave like badly, and then get what they want? I was hoping the elf human wouldn't get what he wanted after he nearly ruined Christmas! I get that I'm looking way to into this considering I'm 19, and have no children, but my gosh was this terrible. It was anxiety inducing.

301,aasbp,Not what I expected.,6,2 December 2020,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the first movie I was slightly disappointed with the latest film. While I love Kurt Russel as Santa, the performance from Julian Dennison as Belsnickel was pretty awful. Terrible casting and a completely unbelievable performance left me cringing every time he spoke. The role was definitely miscast and the movie suffered as a result. Beyond that I enjoyed the plot and found it light hearted and entertaining. It will be on my list of movies to watch each Christmas.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

I understand this was made in 2020 so big crowds and gatherings wouldn't be plausible. But this movie should've been held till 2021. The first was far more better with just the main focus of the adventure with small side interactions that lead to the conclusion. This movie sprinkles random messages and lessons within seconds, a janky villain that doesn't fit the movie all that much and a story that just felt crammed in with no build. There's many flaws but they're not worth going over;",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Kurt Russell is the perfect Santa Claus & his upbeat, cheery portrayal just embodies the Christmas Spirit & everything I would imagine Santa to be!
From the heart warming story line to those moments that leave you laughing... this movie had it all! If you are looking for a Christmas movie this year, be sure to watch these two Christmas Chronicles because they are just the most incredible mix of family, Christmas & being thankful!
I know these movies will be ones we watch every year with our little girl & one day I'm sire she will continue the tradition!The only thing I would say was a let down... the special affects. Yule Cat just didnt look realistic enough. I understand not wanting to make him look scarishly real but he was just too animated as were the reindeer. Easy to look past with such an amazing movie though!",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
307,fsvqzjk,A fun sequel,9,26 November 2020,I really enjoyed the first movie and my daughter loves it. We were excited to see the sequel and thoroughly enjoyed it. I missed Teddy being a big part but he's older now. I appreciated the message that growing up and forgetting your belief in Santa is as it should be.I thought the Back to the Future nod was a very special scene. The extra backstory of Santa and the North Pole was delightful. This was great holiday fun!,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

I hope they create a third film . Just the escape we need in these challenging times. Thank you!!,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
317,glampfam,Actually painful to watch,1,29 November 2020,"I was so excited to watch this with my daughter because the first one was really cute.. except the troll elves ruined both movies, in our opinion. But the first one still had the feel good vibes of a Christmas movie.. this thing was just a jumbled mess of poor acting and scattered plot lines. I actually fell asleep throughout parts.
I watch a lot of poorly acted cheesy Christmas movies on the hallmark channel and even the worst ones were mikes better than this waste of time. So so disappointed. A fine example of choosing to make money over making a quality movie. Bah Humbug",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Overall just boring and even more disappointing than the first.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
322,d_horsley,Possibly the worst Christmas film ever,1,5 December 2020,"This is so bad I doubt it will ever become 'so bad it's good '. From less than 5 minutes in it was obvious this was a desperate rush job. The script was appalling, drawing from every Hallmark moralising trope. The story made no sense and rewrote the origin story of Santa only getting the Turkey part right. The new characters, omg could they have found actors less wooden. At some points it felt they were reading the script as if it were the first time they'd seen it. Falling asleep midway means you miss nothing but the end is just torture.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

325,syplex,They made a movie from the worst parts of #1,1,7 December 2020,"So the first movie was pretty decent but had one annoying flaw: terrible CGI troll-elves. But the movie was good enough in story, characters, and acting that you put up with them. The ""elves"" were like having to eat the veggies with your meal before you could have dessert as a kid. Distracting, but in the end you're satisfied and get to enjoy some delicious tollhouse cookies.
Well for this sequel some expert moviemaker thought, ""You know what? We need to serve up a steaming plate of all veggies for the next movie. Veggies with a side of veggies and veggie for dessert!"" Imagine you hate veggies. That's what this movie is like.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
326,robertmuneton-04258,Sequel that ruins the first movie,3,9 December 2020,"I saw both movies back to back and the only reason i went stright into the second one despite being so late at night was because i enjoyed the first one so much. DON'T watch the sequel. Awful follow up to a great first movie.Everyone apart from Kurt Russell and the original girl was terrible. Goldie Hawn looked like an animated corpse who could barely move her mouth. Judah Lewis who gave a great blanace in the first movie was almost completely missing, and the scenes he did have came across as a stepford boy who'd be more at home in the Brady Bunch.And yes, they shoehorned diversty in there with a crowbar and the little kid was as annoying as anikin in phantom mence. I'm only giving 3 stars because at least Kurt Russell stayed true to his character and i guess Kate Pierce while bland did too.If you loved the first, don't watch this",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

I'm so glad we didn't pick it for our annual Christmas day family movie by the fire... seeing it belongs in said fire.Aside the massive oversaturation and abundance of CG, the little acting left was lifeless. I remember old Nick/Disney live action shows that had better acting/script.The story in general was just too predictable and, well, modern. Typical villain with angry personal issues trying to steal Christmas... wait, that sounds familiar... Anyway, very poor acting with him, severe lack of emotion.
Same with the kids, it all just felt so fake.I'm keeping this very brief for obvious reasons, but this movie was plagued by 2020's ""trending social issues"" and trying to be as inclusive as possible. Modern political issues are best kept out of warm hearted family movies.All in all, a one snd done movie, if you make it through the whole thing. Home Alone and Chronicles 1 are still the champ of traditional family Christmas movies in this house.

337,Deucezeros187,Awful sequel,4,9 November 2021,"I really wanted to enjoy this film I really did but, i thought some of the acting was pretty cheesy, the idea of Christmas being stopped by a naughty elf was lazy, I didn't believe Tyrone Gibson's character as a father figure (casting was wrong I thought). There was no warmth like the first film. The song at the airport was a poor effort, no where near as good as the first film. It lacked a proper heart warming Christmas story. Maybe it could have been Santa helping another family rather than the same kid from the first film, maybe from another country. I'm sure a lot of people with thoroughly enjoy this. But for me it needed more. Kurt Russell does a great job of being Santa again and Goldie Hawn likewise for Mrs Clause, it's just a shame the other cast members were a let down. Also the Bethlehem star part was a nice touch and felt magical.

It seems like there is no addiotional drama needed in their lives.In the Christmas Chronicles Part Two, it is nice to see Chris Columbus directing this one. It is hard for me to pick which is better, part one or two, but they are equally fun. My family has enjoyed both, so thank you! As for the performances, the actors are all great. The story on this sequel is great, and you can tell that Kurt Russell put his time into developing the back story with Chris Columbus. I am even reading that Kurt was so involved that even helped with some of the writing!They (Kurt and Goldie) are both great actors that I have enjoyed with all of their films over the years. It is really nice to see Goldie acting more, she is great. Kurt is fantastic in everything that he does. They never seem to disappoint, bravo on all of your hard work! I love these two together, always!",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
342,steven5watson,Poor sibling to the original,4,10 December 2020,How to ruin a movie! Firstly use a talentless actor that already ruined deadpool 2! Secondly just re-hash some of the best bits of the first movie but ham them up! This could have been fantastic. But poor directing and writing have really ruined it!,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
343,noahgekiere,Not good and weird plot,3,28 November 2020,"Plot is boring and predictable, acting is bad. First movie is much better than the 2nd.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
344,spice1184,I dont understand the bad reviews,9,27 November 2020,I really enjoyed this movie of course its not as good as the original nothing ever is but it was quite enjoyable makes me wish I could vacation in the north pole.,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
345,denisesandiford,The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two.,10,25 November 2020,"Everyone has a right to there opinion 👍👍👍 I really liked it the only problem was Judah Lewis wasn't in the movie much (agree very disappointing), 👍👍👍was really glad Goldie Hawn had a much bigger role to play in the movie!!! & Kurt Russell is still fantastic as Santa Claus!!! Darby Camp is fantastic to!!! 👏👏👏 great special effects!!! (CGI) will still recommend people who liked the first movie to still watch it!! 🤗🤗🤗 👏👏👏",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
346,desperootss,Nothing in common with first opus...,2,27 November 2020,"If you enjoyed the rhythm, jokes and overall excellent delivery of TCC, well, get ready to be disappointed.
The feel and rhythm are simply gone.
Instead, a ridiculous and laborious story (yes, even for a Xmas flick) that never make sense, and never bring an once of satisfaction.
Heavy special effects makes it close to Trolls sometimes...
The singing scene in the airport would be great for a tv ad.
Huge fail, and beloved Kurt Russel cannot save the movie.
2 out of 10.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
347,tigrea01,Less Humans and More Elves!!!,8,21 December 2020,"Less reality, less humans and more elves which I enjoyed! This year has been difficult and to watch something like this to get a break has been nice. Encouraging imagination, adventure, escape and creativity along with the Christmas spirit was excellent! I loved how Kurt Russell's real life love Goldie Hawn was in it too :)",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
348,vonkink77,Let the kids be the judge!,8,29 November 2020,"It's really not that bad. All Xmas movies are cheesy because that's the point. I watched this with my 2 kids & they were glued to it. There was silence for 2 hours. Bliss! If you're an adult trying to be different & edgy giving this a low score, take your head for a wobble & lighten up. We all need cheering up this year!",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
349,taniabird,Chauvinist and disappointing,5,24 December 2020,"I loved the first Christmas Chronicles for its glow, cheesy clues and feel good fun. Part two was not only disappointing but in some cases offensive. Kurt Russell is still a santa heartthrob and the cast are great, but the plot is so out of touch with the woke generation Im surprised it was allowed to be made... Girls need to learn to be good and be lovely/loving, but boys need to be brave and heroic and fight in battles with toy guns? Feels like this film sponsored by the military!-Get em young! Christmas is apparently all about mass producing presents (and fighting brave battles) rather than the focusing on the Christmas values which are scattered in coarsely for good measure. And why does the 10yr old boy get to drive the slay while 13yr old girl sits in the back again? Playing the race diversity card doesn't do enough for equality when it's so still full of chauvinism.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

352,mr-tt76,Why?,4,27 November 2020,"The first one, super Great. This one, had nothing to do with Christmas.
What did they think about when dey wrote the screen play? It's like Home Alone 1-2, Super Great, then along came home alone 3... Are u kidding me. One should think they learn something over The history of movie making,but not so mutch Apparently .",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
353,stevenlantz,New script please!!!,1,26 November 2020,"Dennison and Brun, y'all ruined a perfectly good series. Let me just say Christmas In whatever coastal area was just not believable for Christmas. The lines from the first to end just did not make any sense. ""My nose is my best feature""? Like what why ? and I just don't state the obvious movie was just unbearable...",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
354,john-cairns1,Great Christmas fun in 2020,9,6 December 2020,"Surprised to read all the negative reviews for this film, my four year old loved it! We've now watched it 3 or4 times already, great film and really gets you in the mood christmas. Is it's as good as something like home alone? Well to me no but to my daughter yes, she hates home alone and says it's far too scary. This however is great fun for the whole family, don't try and compare it the memories you had watching Christmas films when you were younger, this is film for kids of today🎄",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
355,ad-41,Yule wish you hadn't,1,21 December 2020,I have to give it to Kurt Russell; he sells this turd like it's a sack full of Christmas toys. Unfortunately even his talent and energy are overwhelmed by a script that feels like a spitballing early draft and a cast that either isn't good or isn't interested. It was great to see Goldie Hawn in something new but there were moments when she seemed appropriately hesitant to be seen in this gingerbread house of painful mediocrity.,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

Decent enough story, heartwarming ending etc..Incredible how they could ruin it in an instance with this garbage.
Turned it off after an hour as couldn't take any more.
Hour of my life completely wasted.
Shame I can't get a refund",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
366,gogoladzetedo,Disappointment,4,26 December 2020,"After the high quality of the first part if the movie, this one's a complete disaster. Even for a childrens movie there were so many plot holes and exaggerated twists.. but my favorite was the dumb historical inaccuracy, calling an elf from 3 century AD in modern Turkey a Turkish name (hakan) - there was no turkey nor a turkish names there that time.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

368,ejb1234,Great Christmas movie,10,27 November 2020,"The negative reviews crack me up. Do you really think Kurt Russell is dressing up and acting as Santa for adults? This is clearly a kids movie and my kids LOVED it. They loved it so much they all agreed it is now their favorite Christmas movie. It's the right amount of magic, cheesiness and Christmas spirit to make it an instant classic!",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

370,claudia_atena,A new level of bad,1,25 November 2020,"I don't even know where to start! The acting is really bad, the kids are highly annoying and the whole setting doesn't even have that Christmasy feel. The plot is also very very bad. It just doesn't have that vibe. I rather watch Home alone for the 20th time than putting up with this junk. I did like the first one so I had high hopes. Needless to say we switched off 1 hr into it!",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
371,ultimateone-33853,Worst Christmas Film,1,1 December 2020,"This has to be the worst Christmas film ever looks so fake the kids are annoying the little elves don't match the film so computerised doesn't have no Christmas feel to it, give me Disney's Santa Clause any day could watch that over an over! This film is so bad wouldn't bother looking mind you the first one is rubbish too.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
372,topmu-94413,Blasphemy and ignorance,2,25 December 2020,"The first film was great and had a meaning. This one is full of lies and blasphemy. It is also very annoying that through this kind of films mixed couples, divorced parents, and blasphemy is shown as a normal thing. Through this film they also considered diversity and inclusion but there is no Asians as main characters. Plus, Jack (black boy) and Belsnickels (latino teen) are horrible actors.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

374,jasonwenig,Written and Directed by Rian Johnson... seems like,1,12 December 2020,"Remember when Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars after the setup from the first movie... well that's pretty much what happens in this movie. Its poorly written, instead of Christmas Spirit being the focus, there is now a villian for some reason. I'm not sure why they had to revisit the same children... really the movie could have been with new children... I'm not sure what makes this one family out of the billions out there so special but whatever. Essentially the movie has no heart. The first movie is a classic, the second movie killed the franchise.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

377,cdepamphili,If you liked the first one... don't waste your time,1,28 November 2020,I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the first one. I couldn't wait to see the 2nd one when I heard it came out. It was absolutely painful to watch from the very first minute. I would give it a -3 if I could.

383,coleyali,Worst sequel ever,1,24 December 2020,"Awful. Talk about making the legend of Santa Claus not believable. This movie is just wrong. It's very dark, scary for young kids (<10), it's confusing, filled with terrible acting, an awful 'musical' scene, and it goes on forever. The first one was an instant classic.

386,wilfraby,Different Film To CC 1,6,1 December 2020,I think this was ultimately aimed at a different audience from the Christmas Chronicles - it feels like much more of a kids movie than a whole family movie like the first Christmas Chronicles.,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

We loved it - it made us get up and dance and kept all the kids attention from start to finish. Full of fun, adventure and Christmas spirit. Perfect!
They can't wait to watch it again tomorrow...!",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
389,livvyhamel,Better than the first one!,10,26 November 2020,I don't know why this is getting such poor reviews. I absolutely loved this movie. It filled me with Christmas spirit and transported me back to what it feels like to fully believe in Santa. Someone complained about there not being enough of the family in the storyline but I loved the addition of the new family members and a cameo back to Kates father. Very uplifting. I anticipate I'll be adding this to my holiday movie rounds each year!,The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

391,sunstoneltd,Lost its sparkle,3,4 December 2020,"Re-watched the first with my family last night and loved it. A brilliantly entertaining Christmas film. Possibly the best Christmas film we've seen together.So....Watched No2 this evening and boy is it weak and full of scenes and cliches weve seen a billion times before. After an hour my children we horrified thats theres another hour left. Thats not happened before during a film. Its bland and echos too many sequences weve seen too often before.Its got all the same ingredients as the first but lacks all the magic. What a shame, a real shame.The first is a fabulous Christmas movie. No2 is just a Christmas movie.Im actually quite gutted tbh.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two

That and I just finished watching it and don't have the mental capacity left to try to condense it down. Give this one a wide berth. In fact do yourself a favor and re-watch the first one. Don't get me wrong, Kurt and Goldie are fine (look like they're having fun with it), but there are just way too many campy moments in the dialogue.The story needed major overhauling and a drastic reduction in the amount of CGI. More CGI does not equal better!There aren't enough thumbs to turn down on this one.",The Christmas Chronicles - Part Two
