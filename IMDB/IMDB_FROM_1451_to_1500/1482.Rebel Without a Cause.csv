0,MartinHafer,He shot puppies!,9,6 June 2010,"Like many teen movies of the age, most of the disaffected teens in the film are old enough to start thinking about social security! Dean is 24 and a few of the tough thugs are clearly about 25-30! You just have to ignore this, as this was the norm for juvenile delinquent films of the 50s. Plus, at least Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo were teenagers! While the opening scene involving James Dean was pretty famous, the part of the film that struck me in the first few minutes of the film was not Dean but when Mineo was being interviewed by the Police. Apparently, for kicks, he'd been out shooting puppies!!! Wow...now that's pretty cold and this small scene, for me, overshadowed Dean's performance in the police station--though Dean was good as the angry, hurt teen. Puppies...that boy was crazy! And, in fact, I found Mineo's character the most interesting throughout the film--with a strong gay subtext (it sure seems to be there in spades).As far as Dean's anger and rebelliousness, it soon becomes obvious in the police station that his parents were much of the problem. While it's often too easy to blame parents (and very typical for psychologists of this time), in this case this is at least a large part of the problem. The parents don't agree about anything--there is a nosy grandmother who needs to butt out and the father (Jim Backus) seems much more concerned with making excuses and being his son's pal than being a parent. And, in many ways, the parents seem to be in denial as the police send him home. And, in many ways, the film seems like a great example of the Oedipal Complex in a modern American family.A weird part of the film is Natalie Wood and the very, very disturbed relationship with her father (William Hopper). While not explicitly stated, it sure seemed as if there was sexual tension boiling within her Dad. He pushes her away and is nasty with her as a result of these unacceptable impulses! Pretty sick stuff! And, speaking of sick stuff, Backus' problems seem far deeper than trying to be his son's friend. He is a walking caricature of a castrated man--with a mother who dominates him and a wife and son who don't respect him. The image of seeing Backus running around the house wearing a very frilly women's apron sure drove that point home! With both Backus and Hopper, it sure seemed as if the writers had consulted with some Freudian psychoanalysts!! Later in the film, I halfway expected to see everyone sitting around eating hot dogs.The rest of the film is the usual stuff you might expect to see in any rebellious teenagers film but with a few exceptions. The biggest difference is that most of the films in this genre were ultra-cheap films made with horrible production values. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is a larger budget film made by Warner Brothers--not some two-bit studio. In addition, there are many great moments that stick in your mind that you just would never find in a typical film of this type--such as the crazy scene where Dean and the gang leader play Chicken on the edge of a cliff, Sal Mineo's pink frilly bedroom, the knife fight, the confrontation at the old house and observatory, etcetera. This is a very well-made and entertaining film from start to finish and clearly the best in the glutted genre (boy, did they make a LOT of these sort of movies). Excellent acting and direction throughout.",Rebel Without a Cause
1,TheLittleSongbird,Still a powerful film 59 years later,9,15 August 2014,"Not just a powerful film but also a very, very good one where it is very easy to see why it's considered a classic. It is a well-made film with the observatory shot at the end deserving a big mention and it is wonderfully directed by Nicholas Ray in terms of technical control and his ability in how to make the characters and their relationships compelling. Leonard Rosenman's music captures the 50s beautifully- just like the film's atmosphere does- as well, while the dialogue is thoughtful, treats the subject matter sympathetically without over-idealising and still packs a punch. Some have had that they consider how the characters act and speak outdated, not to me, for the time it was very ahead of its time(Jim's actions and what he said wouldn't dared to be have done and said before then, and the depiction of the parents was different to before too) and I still related to the characters' actions and the way they spoke. The story explores the theme of a teenager alienated by family and society struggling to fit in, and(at least personally) no other film has explored this theme and issue as powerfully and movingly- certainly not as realistically either- as Rebel Without a Cause, and in a way where you identify every step of the way with the characters and what they say and act. And despite what you may think the issue is very much relevant now, as well as important and something a lot of people still feel strongly about, speaking from personal experience in secondary school. The characters are the sort that are easy to relate to and that you can see yourselves in them, Jim Stark is somewhat of an icon now and unsurprisingly, and the film is beautifully played. Aside from the film's subject matter Rebel Without a Cause is remembered most for the performance of James Dean, and there is good reason for that because it is a superb performance and very heartfelt, makes one very sad of how such a promising young talent have their life and career cut short and tragically. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both give great supporting turns that are among their best, she charming and compassionate and he bringing an equally troubled character to affecting life. Everybody acquits themselves very well though. It is a shame that the ending is a cop-out and wraps things up too easily, but Rebel Without a Cause is otherwise a must see for particularly James Dean's performance and as a textbook example as to how to make a film with the teenager-struggling-to-fit-in theme. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Rebel Without a Cause
2,bkoganbing,A Tale Of Three Misfits,9,16 April 2008,"In his three film trilogy James Dean worked with three of the best directors around, George Stevens in Giant, Elia Kazan in East of Eden, and Nicholas Ray for Rebel Without A Cause. The first two films came from the inspiration of two of the best American writers of the last century, Edna Ferber and John Steinbeck. But in Rebel Without A Cause the inspiration was director Nicholas Ray himself who wrote was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Story for the screen.The Fifties was certainly the era for those rebel type films, but Rebel Without A Cause is unique because it deals with these bored upper middle class kids. It's as different a film as The Wild One with Marlon Brando and those working class biker types or the urban school kids of The Blackboard Jungle as you can get. The problems of this crowd just don't seem as serious as those in the other two films.But because of the quality performances of James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo you do sort of feel for these kids. Dean is a misfit like he was in East of Eden, in fact his parents have just moved because of trouble he'd gotten into in his previous school. Unlike in East of Eden where Dean had this almost godlike father in Raymond Massey who he felt he couldn't measure up to, in Rebel Without A Cause he's dealing with Jim Backus who's an ineffectual henpecked sort with Ann Doran and her mother, Virginia Brissac. Dean himself was raised by an aunt and uncle in Indiana so he could identify with both Cal Trask and Jim Stark. Come to think of it you could include Jett Rink in there as well.Natalie Wood also has father problems, William Hopper who just doesn't know how to deal with the fact that 'daddy's little girl' is blossoming into womanhood. Her mother, Rochelle Hudson, is one of those who looks like she's suffering a permanent headache and has abandoned the family ship to dear old dad. It's more an absence of mother and Hopper trying to do both roles which he just can't handle.But Dean and Wood have parents. Sal Mineo is being raised by the maid in his very wealthy home. He's got all the material things, but he's a rather geeky kid who just doesn't fit in. He's also experiencing latent homosexuality in an age where that was the worst thing on the planet to be and no visible gay community to tell you it wasn't. By the way Marietta Canty as the maid is outstanding in this film, she's miles away from the maid roles of Louise Beavers and Hattie McDaniel.So these three find each other and find a gang of kids who race their expensive automobiles against each other for speed and against each other for daring in the famous 'chicken run' scene. When the gang leader Corey Allen is killed racing against Dean, he becomes a kind of martyr to them and trouble brews for our three misfits. Both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo were nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor. Wood lost to Jo Van Fleet from that other James Dean classic East of Eden and Mineo lost to Jack Lemmon in Mr. Roberts. As for Dean he was up that year posthumously for East of Eden.It wasn't only James Dean's tragic death that made him a legend. He was getting acclaim for his performance in East of Eden when he was killed on September 30, 1955. His stunning impact came after his death as fans were mesmerized by the promise of things to come in Rebel Without A Cause which came out about four weeks later and with Giant which Dean had just wrapped shooting on. This dead actor had film fans talking everywhere right up to the Oscars of 1957 ceremony where he was nominated for 1956's Giant. If ever a player left the scene with fans begging for more it was James Dean.Seen today over 50 years later Rebel Without A Cause still remains the ultimate film in teen angst. I think it's destined to be so for generations to come.",Rebel Without a Cause
3,SnoopyStyle,James Dean classic,8,27 July 2014,Jim Stark (James Dean) is the new kid who is often in trouble. He is arrested for drunkenness and finds Judy (Natalie Wood) at the police station. She is distraught over his father disapproval. His well mannered parents don't understand him. The gang from school picks on him. Plato (Sal Mineo) tries to help but Buzz calls him chicken. Also watch out for Dennis Hopper as one of the gang. Then he is challenged to a chickie run.It's the start of the disenfranchised youth genre. Others may have done it earlier but nobody did it quite like James Dean. He's definitely overacting but that's why it's so iconic. There are some timeless qualities but also things that are unique to the era. It can feel a little dated but it doesn't feel irrelevant. There is only one reason why this is a movie classic rather than old campy cheese. It's that James Dean commits fully. His acting is delivering a deeper truth.,Rebel Without a Cause
4,Hitchcoc,"""A Coat They Borrowed from James Dean""",9,4 October 2001,"James Dean oozes with charisma. He was the hoodlum, the lost soul, everyone in my generation wanted to be, yet not be. The film is a somewhat dated but still profound portrayal of what it is like to try to live up to a perceived being. As Dean's character, Jim, tries all he can do to maintain who he is (which is basically anti-social), he exposes a tender side. The bad guys won't leave him alone and threaten his honor. As he wades through his family's ineffectual existence and unwillingness to see how troubled he is, he becomes more and more distance and introspective. Sal Mineo (Plato) comes into the picture. He is an outcast, too, but his is based on an internalized violence--that doesn't show through. Natalie Wood is the bad girl who departs from her connections to embrace the duo and make it a trio.All are good people, who, through circumstances, cannot be what they desire. The showing off, the chicken race, the line ""you gotta do something"" typifies a subculture that still exists today, be it in another incarnation. For a brief moment they try to have fun and imagine a different world--but a misunderstanding leads to death and further despair. I will always wonder what a career James Dean would have had, given more years to perfect his craft.",Rebel Without a Cause
5,Horst_In_Translation,Movie without remorse,6,1 August 2019,"""Rebel Without a Cause"" is an American movie from 1955, so this one will soon have its 65th anniversary. The director is Nicholas Ray and he also came up with the original story that 2 other writers then turned into the final script. For Ray this is definitely the most known film of his career, also because it brought him his only Oscar nomination. The two other Oscar nominations for this movie here went to the supporting players. I will get to that later. Overall, it runs for 110 minutes approximately and it is a bit unusual that this is actually a color movie. But it was probably the right choice all in all because it works better this way in my opinion than a black-and-white film. The protagonist's red jacket is still a symbol today for his wild spirit compared to the rather insignificant clothes (color-wise) that the other people, especially guys, are wearing. Also pay attention especially to the framework created by the jacket in this very first scene when he offers it to Plato and that is the first moment when we see all three on the screen, and in the end again when he offers it to Plato and that time he accepts it showing the bond and friendship created by this point. And yes the rebel element is crucial here as you can read in the title. Those were the days when Marlon Brando also had his big breakthrough as a brute in several well-received movies and James Dean does not have to hide behind this big name for sure, even if he was probably usually not as violent as Brando was in his works. Or at least not in this one here.So I mentioned Dean already. Most film buffs know of course about his tragic fate that kept him from becoming an all-time great when he entered that speeding car. Definitely highly ironic looking at the cliff scene here and how one character loses his life there. The other two key players in this film next to Dean are Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo and for the former you can make an argument she is lead too I guess, edgy turn in terms of category. Anyway, what I wanted to say is that they both also had tragic fates, even if they lived a lot longer than Dean: Wood with the mysterious drowning where we will never know 100% if it was really just an accident and Mineo dying in a homicide. As for their turns here, I quite liked Wood, of course I did with how stunning she is as I am a straight male. As for Mineo I was not really won over I must say sadly. He shines a bit very early on and also at the very end when tragedy ensues, but I don't think it was Oscar nomination worthy. Opinions may differ here.I think this was the third time or so that I watched this movie, but the first time on the big screen and while I enjoyed the watch I would not necessarily say that the theater experience really makes this one a better watch. Or maybe it had to do with some of the audience members really stupidly laughing constantly. Come on, even if there is here and there a slightly funny moment, like when Dean's character stands up verbally to his grandmother and a few others too. The staged castle buying discussion between Dean and Wood was kinda cute. I still felt the film struggled a bit story-wise, so I am pretty surprised this is the one non-acting category where this was nominated for an Oscar. There are more than a few weak moments. The trio of crooks is the best example. Why they kept trolling Dean's dad, himself and Mineo? The idea that he could tell them to the police was not a good enough explanation. Maybe taking revenge for what happened to the buddy up there at the cliffs could have been a better one I don't know. Or Mineo's transformation towards the end was also too exaggerated. Sure he was once again scared of being left alone, but they were only away for so briefly honestly and it's tough to blame Wood and Dean that he was attacked by the crooks that very moment. But yes, Mineo's character here is clearly unstable emotionally, so maybe it's better not to try to explain it through reason. At least that is something the killed puppy explanation was good for early on if there was something.In general, it is a film about solitude. Wood's character is the only one with friends early on, but she also cannot present herself to them the way she really is. Dean's character constantly struggles from his family moving when conflict arises and does not manage to make friends this way and Mineo is a loner desperately looking for people to like him after his family, especially his father, left him behind. It hurts him a lot, even if he would not admit as we find out in the scene when he lies about where his dad really is trying to convince the other two he only left him because he died. And there is also this moment when Mineo calls Dean his best friend and speaks about the nicknames he likes, which is clearly another lie as we find out when Wood calls him Jamie. Honestly that did not fit at all. He just wants to appear sociable I guess. This ""best friend"" moment was actually pretty sad because he just knew him for a day or so, but it is also a moment that shows you who is stupid in the audience and who is smart because the dumb ones also laughed in my showing.Okay, overall the film I think did get a bit weaker in the second half as there were a handful disappointing moments. They really built up nicely how angry and disappointed Dean was at his dad because he never stood up to his wife, Dean's mother, because Dean's character himself was so completely different in here. Not even really an alpha male, but definitely somebody who rarely gives a rat's ass. And when at the end the father shushes down his wife, that came out of nowhere honestly and did neither feel realistic nor entertaining with how she accepted it with a smile. So yes there were weaknesses and I am not sure the classic status for this film is somewhat justified, but nonetheless overall the good is definitely more frequent, especially as I may be a bit too harsh on this film because it is a much better watch for first viewing than for second or third when the surprise element has vanished pretty much (e.g. During the cliff scene).Also pay attention to how young Oscar nominees Wood and Mineo are in here, talk about rising child/teen actors back in the day. Mineo definitely looked this young, but Wood, who was only one year older, looked much older I thought, so there was definitely surprise from my side when she mentions her age on one occasion. I guess the idea was that Dean, in his early 20s, played a character also much younger than he was himself while the other two played characters their ages basically. By the way, Wood won a Newcomer Golden Globe for her performance. Good for her, even if I would still say Dean was the MVP here, not only because of the screen time he had. He had literally almost no weak moments and Wood and Mineo struggled sometimes occasionally, even if it was rather the script and the dialogues included therein than their shortcomings. But all three of them bring their very own approach to the rebel idea in the title: This one does not only refer to Dean's character, even if he is at the center of it all. Wood's frustration about no longer getting the love she wants from her dad and Mineo messing things up because he is not getting love from anybody are right up there on the rebel scale. That would be all then, I think this film is definitely worth seeing. Thumbs up!",Rebel Without a Cause
6,mark.waltz,Rebels you truly care about.,10,11 June 2019,"Blame it on the cocktail hour. Or blame it on parents that aren't around. Or loneliness. Or just growing up and knowing your place. whatever the reasons are for James Dean, Natalie Wood and sal Mineo, they are three youngsters you truly care about what happens to. Even kids in middle-class families can become rebels because their parents just aren't there for them the way they are. In Dean's case, he's got a henpecked father with a mother and paternal grandmother who obviously despise each other and they seem to be more interested in creating drama amongst each other than paying attention to their trouble teenage son as he moves into on L.A. area High School. in woods case, she has a father she adores and a mother she despises. For Mineo, his single mother is always away so he has basically been raised by the black housekeeper who treats him as if he is her own flesh and blood. that's the recipe for trouble as these three teenagers lives intertwine in a tragic story that is truly the greatest troubled teen movie of all time.The teenagers of this era, the mid-1950's, are now old enough to be great-grandparents of teenagers today. What has changed other than technology? The answer: probably not much. It is obvious from the moment that Mineo's sensitive Plato needs Dean's Jim that he's looking for something a lot stronger than friendship. An older brother? A protector? or perhaps something that was barely even discussed let alone presented in the movies in the mid-1950's. but Dean somehow manages to break down the wall of woods initial standoffishness, as she is in the A-list rebel group and has no time for newcomers. as a romance develops between Dean and Wood, Mineo tags along like a lost puppy, initially resentful of Wood's intrusion into his new relationship, irregardless of what it was meant to be.The performances of the three actors are so heartbreakingly real that's if you do not know the outcome, you are biting your nails in anticipation. Wood, an actress who sometimes fails to deliver the goods (and won a record number of Razzie Awards), gets everything right here and the acting with her eyes is extremely powerful as her vulnerabilities are slowly revealed. Mineo is one of those tender kids trying to play tough out of a desperate need for protection, and Dean, obviously suffering from some sort of arrested development, is more than happy to play protector. Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams stand out among the other young actors who are involved in the confusing world of these teens.As for the adults, Jim Backus will completely make you forget that he was ever Thurston Howell III and Mr. Magoo, playing a man beaten down by the women in his life who only knows how to be a pal kill his son and not a father. sometimes, there are just not enough spots in the Oscar race, and while Mineo landed the nomination, Backus certainly was deserving of one as well. Ann Doran as his hard-nosed wife and Virginia Brissac as his mother are appropriately matriarchal and demanding, difficult characters for a husband to deal with let alone a son. Edward Platt adds a bit of adult understanding as the police officer who how do I completely understand Dean situation, and Marietta Canty is very touching as Mineo's guardian. Rochelle Hudson and William Hopper add more complications as Wood's parents. But nothing will ever beat the sight of Bacchus in a frilly apron trying to communicate with his son.The beautiful Warner color mixes look almost as if it was filmed in 3D, and the photography and sound along with the music score makes ths even more emotionally gripping. the build-up to an intense drag race will have you biting your nails as well and the conclusion at an abandoned mansion near the Griffith observatory will have you glued to the screen. I watched this as a follow-up to ironically probably the worst teen movie ever made, ""Teenage Crime Wave"", made the same year and also featuring a Griffith observatory conclusion, ""Rebel"" having had a key scene there earlier. Watching the two movies together, you can see what is right and what is wrong in making these types of films and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" continues to work on every single level 65 years later.",Rebel Without a Cause
7,kosmasp,Could have been friends,9,4 July 2020,"The ""chicken"" scene is probably the one that is most known, but the ending here ... at least as powerful. And don't worry, I won't spoil it, otherwise I'd have said so beforehand. But back to the car scene and if you don't know the game, it is about racing in cars. Now there is variations to this - one sees two cars driving full speed into each other ... the first one to swerve away, is the chicken. And no one wants to be called a chicken. The version here is, two cars driving towards a cliff - first one to stop or jumping out of the car, is the chicken. Recipe for disaster you say? You may be right.And that is only the beginning (early on that is), there's also family troubles, hurt people, missunderstood teens, rage and wrong accusations. Especially the later one of these will drive the movie. Wrong perceptions also lead to a certain character going off ... his mind. No pun intended. Considering what could be shown on screen and how much was controlled (you know, not to spoil the youth with ""bad images"" and ideas) by censorship, it is almost a wonder how good this works and how rebellious it still is. If East of Eden introduced James Dean and sort of laid the ground to how the public perceived him - this cemented it. True or not, people will most likely remember him (especially of the way he died) as a rebel ... with or without cause",Rebel Without a Cause
8,classicsoncall,"""I'm just the age when nothing fits.""",8,22 July 2012,"I've seen this film a number of times now and I can't tell you how irritated I get with the character of Frank Stark (Jim Backus), the father of the film's hero portrayed by James Dean. When he appears in that apron, totally emasculated, I want to reach into the film and grab him by the lapels of his jacket and shake some sense into him. Apparently Jimbo wanted to do the same in that scene when he knocked the father out of his chair and begged him to be a man. ""She eats him up alive and he takes it!"" is the way Jim describes the relationship between his parents, and you begin to understand why he's the confused and alienated suburban youth of the Fifties, not because he's from a poor or racial family, but because there's no one he can connect with on any meaningful level.As good as the film is, I find I have some of the same reservations mentioned by other reviewers. I know the template for movies, and even TV shows of the Fifties, was to use older actors to play the part of teenagers, but the disparity here is overdone except in the case of Sal Mineo's Plato. I look around at teenagers of today, and I don't think they could have handled themselves with the likes of Buzz, Crunch and Moose hanging around. Funny, but I don't recall handles like that when I was a kid growing up in the Fifties, but I do remember a 'Slats', so I guess they were around.There's also the odd non-reaction when Buzz goes over the cliff during the chickie-run. Is it my imagination, or did no one express any horror over the event? Personally, this would have caused a big time freak out with any group I ever hung around with but it didn't cause that much of a sensation here. That didn't seem very believable to the extent that it failed to tie into the desperation that many of the teens in the picture seemed to be feeling.I like James Dean and like many others, I wish he hadn't died at such an early age. Imagine the output he could have produced based solely on the three memorable films he made his acting mark in. One of the original trailers for ""Rebel Without a Cause"" describes it as 'Entertainment of Unforgettable Emotional Impact'. Generally I find that to be pretty accurate as it deals with teenage angst that prevailed in the era of the late Fifties/early Sixties. Things are certainly different today with a lot more distractions vying for young people's attention, but the need for understanding, love and friendship are timeless qualities that are brought home with this film, with a message that still has universal appeal.",Rebel Without a Cause
9,gavin6942,The Film That's Synonymous With James Dean,7,12 July 2010,"What is really interesting, at least to me, is that James Dean more or less only had three roles in his life, in the 1950s. The lesser-known ""Giant"" and ""East of Eden"", and this film. So, basically, even though today -- sixty years later -- everyone has heard of James Dean, it is from one movie that most have probably not seen.But, what this could be saying is that ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is a very influential film, permeating culture all the way up until now. And I'm not surprised by this. The gang violence and alcoholism, presented in the middle of the mythically perfect 1950s, really makes an impact.I watched this film because of Dennis Hopper, not James Dean, but if that is your primary motivation, I wouldn't bother. It is a good film and should be seen, but Hopper's character is very minor and I do not recall if he even has one line of dialogue.",Rebel Without a Cause
10,lee_eisenberg,"""You're tearing me apart!""",6,17 July 2005,"""Rebel Without a Cause"" seems kind of dated nowadays. The idea of some teenager living for the sole purpose of making trouble has been repeated so many times that we lose track. So, we have to accept ""RWAC"" for what it is. James Dean plays Jim Stark, who refuses to obey any authority figure, and gets into all sorts of trouble. Natalie Wood plays his girlfriend Judy, who's slightly (or more than slightly) rougher than most of the characters that Natalie Wood played.Obviously, Dean has since become the paradigm of the rebel, to the extent that Fonzie has a poster of him, while Natalie Wood continued her career. Granted, we know that when we turn on the movie. What really catches our eyes nowadays is the presence of certain people in the movie. Dennis Hopper plays one of the gang members, Jim Backus plays Dean's father, and Edward Platt (the ""Get Smart"" chief) plays a cop. The things that we see in life.",Rebel Without a Cause
11,jboothmillard,Rebel without a Cause,8,24 May 2010,"The phrase ""live fast, die young"" was coined on behalf of the leading actor of this film, and I was most looking forward to seeing him in this 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die recommended film. Basically seventeen year old Jim Stark (BAFTA nominated James Dean) has moved to Los Angeles and is enrolling at Dawson High School, and he has a habit for getting into trouble, he and his family have moved before. The film opens with Jim arrested for public drunkenness, and he is allowed to open up to the questioning officer while waiting for his father Frank (Jim Backus), his mother Carol (Ann Doran) and his Grandmother (Virginia Brissac). He is let go, and we next see him attending school, where he meets new friend John 'Plato' Crawford (Oscar nominated Sal Mineo) and Judy (Oscar nominated Natalie Wood). But he also meets the tough ones who see him as the new threat and outsider, led by Buzz Gunderson (Corey Allen), with his gang members, including Goon (young Dennis Hopper in his first big screen role). After getting in a serious switchblade fight with Buzz, Jim agrees with Buzz to participate in a ""chickie run"", where the first person to jump out of a speeding car before going over a cliff is the coward. Buzz loses this ""battle"", and his girlfriend Judy believes that someone grassed to the police when they start searching for her, Jim and Plato. It all comes to a head with Plato getting really agitated with a gun, he winds up shutting himself in the Griffith Observatory, and when he does come out, he is gunned down for refusing to drop the gun, and all Jim can do is introduce Judy to his family. Also starring William Hopper as Judy's Father and Rochelle Hudson as Judy's Mother. The phrase ""live fast, die young"" was coined on Dean's behalf, other actors with this title include River Phoenix and Heath Ledger, people speculate whether they, Dean especially, would be as popular as they are with more films, I think it is likely they would. It is also really ironic that we see Dean speeding in a car in the film, and that is exactly how he died at just twenty-four, oh, and his car parts have been locked away as they are believed to be cursed, killing many other victims. Anyway, Dean is brilliant as the troubled teen, the supporting cast are all great too, and there are some really memorable moments in what is quite clearly a classic (teen) drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. James Dean was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, he was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 59 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",Rebel Without a Cause
12,ccthemovieman-1,"A Good ""Cause"" To Not Like The Film",2,8 December 2005,"It's always interesting to watch James Dean act. I mean, the man WAS good, not just some teen heart-throb.....but most of the characters in this film were just plain annoying to make the film enjoyable.Dean and Natalie Wood's parents were either way too wimpy or nasty. While Dean's character was okay, the other kids in the film, led by Wood, were obnoxious and horrible people. Sal Mineo's role was kind of strange in that, even though he was the same age as Dean, he was the little brother here who idolizes Dean. It didn't quite fit.In the end, watching two hours of stupid parents and unlikable juvenile delinquents is not my idea of fun and entertainment and ""cause"" enough never to watch this overrated teen angst mess again.",Rebel Without a Cause

James Dean's most important screen appearance in the second of his three movies , following ¨East of Eden¨ and his final was ¨Giant¨. Director Ray touches upon his favorite theme: two lovers searching for a quiet place to live in peace that also used in former picture titled ""Lovers of the Night (1945)"", one of his few totally controlled pieces of work . Awesome support cast formed by newcomers who would have an acceptable and uneven career as Dennis Hooper , Corey Allen , Nick Adams and special mention to Sal Mineo as lone and feeble Plato . Ray, screenwriter Stewart Stern, costar James Dean, and Sal Mineo himself all intended for Mineo's character Plato to be subtly but definitely understood as gay , although the Production Code was still very much in force and forbade any mention of homosexuality, all worked together to insert restrained references to Plato's homosexuality and attraction to Jim, including the pinup photo of Alan Ladd on Plato's locker door, Plato's adoring looks at Jim, his loaded talk with Jim in the old mansion, and even the name ""Plato,"" which is a reference to the Classical Greek philosopher ; for that mansion scene, Dean suggested to Mineo that Plato should ""look at me the way I look at Natalie."" Furthermore , the film packs a colorful and glimmer cinematography in Technicolor by Ernest Haller . Moving as well as thrilling musical score by Leonard Rosenman .The motion picture was very well directed by Nicholas Ray who researched L. A. gangs by riding around with them for several nights. In September of 1954, Ray wrote a treatment to ""The Blind Run,"" about three troubled adolescents who create a new family in each other. This would form the basis for this picture . After some re-writes, Ray started shopping for a lead actor. After a trip to the Strasberg Institute in New York proved fruitless, he learned that Elia Kazan had recently discovered a New York stage actor for his latest film, but he wasn't recommending him; even after Ray saw a rough cut of this actor's latest film he still wasn't sure. It was only when Ray met 24 year old James Dean at a party did he realize that this hot new talent would be perfect for the role of Jim Stark, a troubled youth whose world is unraveled in a 24-hour period. Ray and Dean formed a very close bond during filming, with Ray allowing Dean to improvise and even direct to his liking. The rest of the cast came together with the talents of two fifteen-year-old : Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo; as well as smaller roles, which Ray cast based on weeks of bizarre, improvised auditions as well as interviews with the actors. The three superb young stars carry this in-the-gut tale of teens . However , all three leads met with real-life tragic end , Dean dead by a car crash , Natalie by drowning and Mineo was killed . Filming was a wild ride, but it paid off; Mineo and Wood were both Oscar-nominated in the supporting acting categories, and Ray received his only Oscar nomination, for the screenplay. Ray and Dean planned to make more movies after this, but Dean's death would never make that possible, and at least they left movie audiences with one great film. Rating : two thumbs up , extraordinary , top-drawer material . Indispensable and essential watching this classic movie .",Rebel Without a Cause
14,moonspinner55,Dreamy-tragic teen angst...,6,27 May 2006,"Director Nicholas Ray's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" was an influential picture for young adults circa 1955, and it still looks good today, what with cigarette-smoking high school misfit James Dean sauntering through in a white tee-shirt and blue jeans, topped with an iconic red windbreaker. However, the picture itself is a melodramatic wallow, something more for moony-eyed 12 or 13-year-olds to embrace rather than audiences over 21. Dean's Jim Stark wrestles with an overwrought mother and a spineless father while trying to fit in with the kids at his new school in Los Angeles; in the popular clique, pretty Natalie Wood longs for a little danger in her life (she has parent-problems, too, including a father who disdains affection). Ray wades through the romantic boy-girl stuff, though he gets riveting moments from Dean, particularly in his scenes with jellyfish-dad Jim Backus. The j.d. Stuff (knife fights, chicken races, etc.) may have been fresh at the time but now seems rote, while Sal Mineo's character of a Stark-smitten juvenile with absentee folks is a writer's conceit (his gooey, over-the-top sincerity borders on caricature). Dean is the whole picture, really; was Ray, who also originated the story later adapted by Irving Shulman and written by Stewart Stern, really attuned to these directionless young people or just playing things by ear? There's so much movie-magazine gloss sticking to the film's surface, it's difficult to tell. Three Oscar nominations, including Best Motion Picture Story for Ray, and for Mineo and Wood in the supporting categories. **1/2 from ****",Rebel Without a Cause
15,Quinoa1984,"not my favorite Nick Ray film by far, but it's worth viewing as a ""essential"" from the 50s",7,4 December 2006,"I put quotations around the words ""essential"" in that one line because, really, I'm not totally sure what essential means really when it comes to seeing films from that decade. The general consensus- on which one might dub a film like Rebel Without a Cause overrated- is that this film is THE film on teenage angst and dislocation from the adults of the period, and that it's essential because of James Dean, or that it might be considered director Nicholas Ray's best film. For me though, ""essential"" is a very subjective term, and one person's essential being this film is another one's essential being Bigger Than Life or In a Lonely Place, films that get some notice in the film circles but not enough when placed against a film like the one here. It's the kind of picture I end up recommending, but not exactly under the terminology of how I would find it to be essential or not, because I don't really. It's not a sort of seminal, staggeringly entertaining and artistically satisfying work about being an outsider in the 50s like On the Waterfront or even one most people wouldn't think of like Ikiru. From a historical perspective, however, and for the significance of James Dean, it is worth a viewing, at least once, if you want to know at least what the industry leaned towards in the 50s.Now, on to the actual film- it's the story of Jim Stark, who is disaffected and with a sort of glow about him (if glow is the word, maybe just, um, malaise), and its more of a reflection on his parents (Jim Backus, who is actually quite good here, and Ann Doran as his mother) than on society as a whole. Not that society doesn't have a part in Jim's emotional downward spiral. He's a kid who ends up getting connected to violence ('Don't call me chicken' is coined famously, and maybe unintentionally amusingly, by Dean in this film), and all the while Dean plays him very calmly and coolly, with his big emotional bursts strong and piercing. But as I've yet to see his other two big cinematic roles in East of Eden or Giant, I can't compare one to the other or not. On its own, his turn today almost borders on being too melodramatic, even too stuck in the period (Brando, as mentioned before, had the 'normalcy of detachment and cool' down to a T unlike Dean here who is good if not great). He's followed along by compelling supporting work by Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood, as equally disaffected youth, but in different ways that end up clinging the three of them together.The story, as much as it tries to, isn't really as convincing as it tries to be, and unfortunately to me doesn't hold up like it should. The convincing bits are still there, and some scenes are revelatory into the little things about teenagers, like the trip inside the planetarium- no matter how tough they think they are or act or anything, they can still be amazed by some things, the unknown that is. And the fight that happens after-wards- along with the 'chickie' drag race at night that leads to a tragic turn of events- are classic Ray-directed moments. But the classically trained style of film-making by Ray, with the level of subversion still there under the surface of the immediate context, isn't as fulfilling when given to the story and characters and acting. Some characters are just outright silly or so one-dimensional that you can't believe someone like Dean's character would have to deal with them at all. Even an emotionally complex scene like the ""it's tearing me apart"" speech doesn't hit quite as hard as it might have in 1955. By the end of it all, I knew Rebel Without a Cause was worth viewing, but as an immediate masterwork of the Hollywood system? I'm not really sure on that, and certainly not if one's talking about essentials from the director. B+",Rebel Without a Cause

Plato (Sal Mineo) has a father who never sees him and a mother who's never around and has no friends and is gay (implied heavily). He falls in love with Jim and Jim becomes attracted to Judy...but it all leads to tragedy and death.Rightfully classic movie. It caught EXACTLY how it feels to be a teenager and treated its characters with sympathy. It spoke to a whole generation of kids and was a huge hit. Also it defined James Dean forever. He was already dead when this came out but that didn't stop him from becoming an idol to thousands of teenage boys who wanted to be just like him. Also it dared to have a gay character. Plato is (obviously) in love with Jim. It's never made explicit that he's gay (the Production Code wouldn't allow that in a movie back then) but it's pretty obvious through the looks Plato is constantly giving Jim. The acting is excellent across the board but Dean, Wood and Mineo are superb--especially Dean. When Dean yells out, ""You're tearing me apart!"" in one scene his anger and pain comes leaping off the screen. Also it's kind of fun to see Dennis Hopper so young. It is dated in terms of some dialogue and situations but I think any teenager can relate to the characters and their feelings. A must-see movie.",Rebel Without a Cause

22,Boba_Fett1138,Concerning everyday's youth.,8,6 July 2010,"The movie is about some of the typical struggles of teenagers. It was a mostly relevant and revolutionary picture back in the '50's but you can also definitely say its still being relevant to today's young audience. They struggle with their own identity, stuff at school, feeling like outcasts and misunderstood by your parents and everyone else. This movie has all this stuff in it, teenager at one point or another used to struggle with. It's set at a certain point in life when you have to decide who you want to be be and what you want to do with your life but without knowing the answers yourself to any of this. You have to explore and discover it on your own, the easy or the hard way.Of course the story and events get exaggerated and enlarged, in order to fit all of those themes into an under 2 hours movie. It's perhaps the biggest and only complaint of the movie that it doesn't always move natural and isn't the most realistic movie around, concerning the story and its themes. It's still mostly being a subtle movie though, so you don't have to be afraid of any melodramatic plot lines or performances of the actors.James Dean was an absolutely great actor, whose style was really that of his own and unlike anyone else's of that time. His acting was really confident and even somewhat cocky in a good way. He plays his character really well and not in a way you would normally expect to see in a movie like this. His performance alone already made this movie a classic. There are also some other great, young actors in this, such as Sal Mineo, Natalie Wood and Dennis Hopper with hair, in his first movie role.It's an original movie with its story and approach and it also got shot in full color, which does really give the movie some extra dimension. I'm not the biggest fan of the director Nicholas Ray but with this movie he simply did a great job. It's also definitely his best known- and most appreciated one. He did some stylish, symbolic and just plain good stuff for this movie.Not the perfect classic but a great classic nevertheless.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rebel Without a Cause
23,evanston_dad,A Deeply Disquieting Film About Juvenile Delinquency,9,2 August 2006,"Nicholas Ray creates another typically feverish dreamscape for this film about juvenile delinquency, and the effect is strongly disquieting.""Rebel Without a Cause"" suggests that the strain of teenage rebelliousness prevalent at the time of the picture's release (and glamorized in many films made specifically for the newly discovered teen audience) stemmed from more than everyday spoiled child angst. It distinguished between normal rebellious behavior that all children go through as part of the maturation process, and truly destructive behavior that suggests anti-social tendencies. And what's more, the film lays much of the blame for these troubled teens on their absentee parents and a culture that asks them to make concessions and conform before they've even had a chance to establish their own place in the world.James Dean was perfect casting in the lead. During his short career, he excelled at playing teens who were visibly uncomfortable in their own skins. He is given fine support by Sal Mineo, who plays a young gay man terrorized by the thought of his difference from the norm, who wants nothing more than to hide away from a world that punishes difference with ostracism or worse. Natalie Wood gives an overly-hysterical performance as another of the film's misfits. I've always thought Wood was one of the most beautiful actresses Hollywood ever produced, but I have to be honest and admit that her acting abilities left much to be desired.I don't know if ""Rebel Without a Cause"" was the first film to accuse one generation of being responsible for the ills of the next, but it certainly is the first one of any stature to do so as directly and bluntly as is done here. Of course, many years later we realize that Ray and his film were absolutely correct.Grade: A",Rebel Without a Cause

James Dean plays Jim Stark, a troubled teenager who always seems to on the wrong side of the law. His confusion and rebellion stems from a father who fails to stand up for himself, and an overbearing mother and grandmother. He eventually becomes the target of a school gang, which escalates into a knife fight. He is admired by a kid named Plato who fancies his ability to face these bullies. Eventually he is challenged to a race towards a cliff and whoever bailed first was considered a chicken. Stark survives but the gang leader plummets with his car to his death. This leaves Stark a marked individual with nowhere to turn. Powerfully written teen film directed with insight by Nicholas Ray who makes great use of an abandoned mansion where a riveting climax occurs. Dean embodies the role of a teenager plagued by wrong choices yet a desire for positive opportunity. Natalie Wood as Judy, the girlfriend of the deceased gangster, desires affection at home but is drawn to Stark. Sal Mineo as Plato has no parents and befriends Stark until he is faced with no other choice than to draw a gun. Jim Backus and Ann Doran play Stark's complicated parents.

25,HotToastyRag,Still relevant today,7,16 March 2020,"""You're tearing me apart!"" has become the go-to catchphrase when imitating James Dean and referencing his signature movie Rebel Without a Cause, and for good reason: this movie lifts the lid on the new post-war generation. The 1950s rebels annoyed the pants off of their parents for the simple reason that they had no reason to be so upset. They didn't have to fight in WWII, they weren't scared that a monster would destroy the world, and they had cushy suburban lives with beautiful houses, white picket fences, and golden retrievers. James Dean, Sal Mineo, and Natalie Wood personify that teenage angst in a movie that still stands the test of time. There's still an irritatingly large group of young people who have the world at their fingertips and still complain and get into trouble. James Dean's problem is that his dad, Jim Backus, lets his wife boss him around-really? The less problems we actually have, the more we create.Until teenagers learn that their problems are not the center of the universe-and believe me, I won't hold my breath for that great day-this 1955 drama will touch everyone with its powerful performances. Following decades of stylized acting, new actors wore their hearts on their sleeves. James Dean is so vulnerable, if you so much as breathe on him, he'll burst into tears. Natalie Wood is given her own tearful monologue; her feelings are hurt because her dad doesn't approve of her makeup style. Again, if you look at her funny, her permanently wobbly voice will break and her tears will flow.This is actually a pretty sad movie, since the young kids' pain is very real. No one wants to see children in pain or in tears. Rebel Without a Cause isn't a feel-good movie, especially because the leading actor didn't even live to attend the premiere. None of James Dean's three theatrical movies are feel-good movies, so it's always a good idea to have a comedy ready to cheer you up. Watching his immortal pout and uncontrollable heartbreak is sometimes too much to handle.",Rebel Without a Cause

27,Wuchakk,"Iconic mid-50's teen angst with James Dean, Natalie Wood & Sal Mineo",7,2 April 2017,"Released in 1955, ""Rebel without a Cause"" is a youth drama about a troubled teen, Jim Stark (James Dean), a new kid on the block in Los Angeles, where he meets other confused mid-50's youths, e.g. Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo). Corey Allen plays Jim's rival, Buzz, while Jim Backus & Ann Doran appear as Jim's parents. Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams are on hand as other juvenile delinquents.In real life the three protagonists would all die prematurely: Dean one month before the film was released (24 years-old), Natalie in 1981 (43 years old) and Mineo in 1976 (37 years-old). While Dean was 24 during filming, both Natalie and Mineo were actually teenagers, 17 and 16 respectively. This was particularly amazing for the former, as she comes across seasoned, although obviously youthful.The movie's iconic and seminal, but other teen angst movies predated it, like Brando's ""The Wild One,"" which debuted 20 months before ""Rebel."" Yet ""The Wild One"" is lame by comparison. While Brando is almost always great, ""Rebel"" is less eye-rolling than ""The Wild One"" and more dramatically engaging, not to mention psychologically interesting. A compelling knife fight pulls the viewer in early on, which culminates with the tragic ""chickie run"" sequence. Unfortunately, the movie is overly talky with too much filler; it could've been tightened up by cutting like 20-25 minutes.Writer/director Nicholas Ray interestingly never shows teachers or school faculty, which shows that they're negligible as influences for the confused youths. Notice how the astronomer at the Observatory drones on in a boring monotone. He bleakly insists that life on earth is meaningless in the grand scope of the universe, which ironically is meaningless to the teens, each of whom is the center of the universe, as far as they're concerned. Only their parents, peers and police hold sway in their worlds. The sole adult to really understand them is Officer Ray, clearly named after the writer/director.One presumptuous critic argued that Plato (Mineo) was a homosexual on the grounds that he ""caresses"" Jim's shoulder in the Observatory and later invites him to his house where they'd be alone, but Plato's interest in Jim is obviously simply hero worship as Plato looks for a worthy father figure to pattern his life, which Jim literally becomes in the charade with Judy at the deserted mansion (notice how Plato has no problem with Judy's presence). Basically, Plato is to Jim what Barney Rubble was to Fred Flintstone. The ""caress"" is merely a tap on the shoulder and the fact that it was misinterpreted by this critic informs you about his own dubious sexuality. Mineo's later confessed bisexuality is irrelevant to the topic.While Dean lacks the intense charisma of Brando, he's inimitable, enigmatic and somewhat interesting. His character, Jim, is surprisingly NOT one-dimensional. Too bad he died so young (breaking his neck in an auto accident).The picture runs 111 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & the surrounding areas (Burbank Studios, Santa Monica High School & Calabasas). ADDITIONAL WRITERS: Stewart Stern & Irving Shulman. ADDITIONAL CAST: Marietta Canty appears as Plato's loving black guardian while William Hopper & Rochelle Hudson are on hand as Judy's parents.GRADE: B+",Rebel Without a Cause
28,zetes,"Not perfect, but still extraordinary",9,17 July 2000,"I was quite impressed with _Rebel Without a Cause_. I expected it to be quite standard, having only gathered its reputation because of the tragedy surrounding James Deans' death. Fortunately, it stood up on its own quite well. Its superficial situations are somewhat dated, which was inevitable, but its themes remain potent after many decades.The major theme is the burgeoning relationship between adults and their teenage children. All three of the main characters are at different stages in this process. Jim (James Dean) is surprisingly at the earliest stage of this. His mother is pretty distanced and unresponsive already, but he still seems to communicate well with his father (Jim Backus, who is amazing. His character's relationship with his wife also provides an interesting view into 1950s gender politics; in one scene, Backus is wearing a cooking apron, which is very obviously meant for a woman). Judy (Natalie Wood, whom I didn't even recognize here) is almost completely rejected by her father, who feels that her affection is out of place in her teenage years. Worst of all is Plato, both of whose parents have left him alone in the world. He tries desperately to make Jim and Judy his parents (although from this vantage point in time, Plato seems resoundingly sexually attracted to Jim, and he sees Judy as a threat to their relationship. Although the writer/director has denied that forever, no human being can watch it nowadays without that thought constantly crossing their mind).The reason that I say this film is flawed lies in the actions of Plato near the end of the film. I felt his escalating insanity was kind of a cop-out. Instead of actually delving into Plato's true character and motives by having intelligent and realistic dialogue and actions, he is just made to go batty, wherein he spouts off his thoughts as if he were some eight year old or man-child. Plato may have been sycophantic throughout the film, but he was anything but a moron. His actions provide an easy way for the director/writer to answer all questions about his character, and then to facilitate an ending which is tragic, but more than a little contrived.Despite what I feel is a cop-out ending, _Rebel Without a Cause remains a thoroughly powerful film.

32,JamesHitchcock,A Classic; the Best-ever Film about Adolescence,10,15 August 2004,"Contains spoilersFilms about juvenile delinquency were not new in 1955, but earlier films on the subject, such as 'Angels with Dirty Faces' from the late thirties, and even others from the same period, such as 'Blackboard Jungle' which also came out in 1955, had tended to locate the problem among the urban poor of the slums. 'Rebel Without a Cause' is different in that it focuses on delinquency among the teenagers of an affluent middle-class community.The film starts with a teenage boy named Jim Stark being arrested by the police for being drunk and disorderly and taken to the police station. His parents have recently moved to the area, and he is depressed because his parents move house frequently and he finds it difficult to make new friends. The school which he attends is dominated by a culture of swaggering masculine bravado and aggression. A premium is placed on displays of physical courage and on proving one's worth by fighting; the worst insult in this society is 'chicken'. Boys are expected to fit in with the prevailing ethos in order to gain the respect of their peers and to stand a chance of getting a girlfriend. Although Jim longs for friendship and acceptance, he is also skeptical of this ethos, which makes him something of an outsider. He quarrels with Buzz, the leader of the 'in-crowd', who accuses him of being a 'chicken'. Jim feels forced to prove his courage against Buzz, first in a knife-fight, and then in a 'Chickie Run', a ritualised test of nerve which involves driving stolen cars as close as possible to the edge of a cliff before jumping out. During the latter Buzz is killed when he is unable to escape from his car in time; it is Jim's feelings of guilt arising from this incident, and the desire of Buzz's friends for revenge, which provoke the film's tragic climax. Although much of the comment about this film has concentrated on the charismatic figure of Dean, the film is not just about Jim. It has at its heart a triangular relationship between Jim and two other teenagers, Judy and Plato, all of whom can be seen as a rebels- 'without a cause' in the sense that they are not motivated by any political or social ideal, but also 'with a cause' in the sense that there is a reason why they act as they do. Nevertheless, in each case the cause of their revolt is subtly different. Each has been brought up in a different way. Jim's parents are kindly and liberal, but are too indulgent. His father, in particular, is well-meaning but weak, unable to provide his son with intelligent advice or with a role-model of manliness. Plato (whose real name is John, but who prefers to be called by his nickname, which suggests his intellectual nature) is a strange, lonely boy. Our first view of him is at the police station, where he has been arrested for shooting some puppies. We do not learn any more about this incident, but what we hear is enough to suggest that Plato is emotionally disturbed. Plato's parents are separated; he never sees his father and his mother is frequently absent, leaving him to be brought up by an elderly maidservant. The shy, bookish Plato makes no attempt to fit in with the other students, who look down on him, but he sees Jim as a fellow-outsider and befriends him. I felt that there were hints that Plato is sexually attracted to Jim and jealous of his growing friendship with Judy, but in the moral climate of the fifties these hints could not be fully developed. (If my theory is correct, Plato's nickname may also have ironic overtones, Plato being the philosopher who advocated sexless 'platonic' love between males).Whereas Jim's parents are over-liberal and Plato's absent, Judy's are cold and authoritarian. Unlike the boys, she starts off as a member of the 'in-crowd', as she is Buzz's girlfriend, but after Buzz's death a romance develops between Jim and herself. The main theme of the film is the choice between the desire to conform to accepted values and the desire to rebel by finding one's own individual ones, a choice that seems particularly acute in one's teenage years. The film suggests that this choice is more complex than might be thought. Although the students are rebellious in the sense that they scorn the more peaceful values of adult life, they are also deeply conformist in the sense that they will tolerate no deviation from their own values. Jim, Judy and Plato can be seen as rebels against not only the older generation but also against the values of their contemporaries. Even Buzz, as much as Jim or Plato, can be seen as a victim of the students' system of values. A more attractive side to his character is shown in the scenes before the fateful 'chickie run' where he and Jim discover a respect, even a liking for one another; certainly, neither wishes any harm to befall the other, but for reasons of honour neither feels able to withdraw from their ritual duel.Throughout the film there is an atmosphere of heightened emotion- it has not one, but two, emotional climaxes, the 'chickie run' and the final scene where Jim, Judy and Plato are hiding in the planetarium from Buzz's friends and from the police. It is a film that needs fine acting, both to convey this emotional atmosphere and to do justice to its ambitious theme. Fortunately, all three leads are equal to the task. Sal Mineo as Plato and Natalie Wood as Judy are both good, but James Dean is better than good, making the anguished figure of Jim come vividly alive. Although Dean was twenty-four at the time, several years older than the supposed age of his character, he was brilliant at portraying a tormented adolescent. It is strange that he did not receive a 'Best Actor' Oscar nomination. He was, of course, nominated for his role in 'East of Eden'. (Is there a rule which prevents the same actor from being nominated twice in one year?) Some of the supporting cast are also excellent, particularly Jim Backus as Jim's weak but well-meaning father, and Corey Allen, who resists the temptation to play Buzz simply as an arrogant hooligan. 'Rebel Without a Cause' is, in my view, one of the best films of the fifties and probably the best-ever film about adolescence and 'coming of age'. I am surprised it has not made your top 250 films and that it was not nominated for 'Best Picture'. 10/10.",Rebel Without a Cause

James Dean gives the performance of a life time and truly broke everyone's heart with his untimely death. I can see why he was so loved now. I felt deep down though that this was a wrongly titled film. Because Jim, despite rebelling against the system, wasn't really a bad kid. He actually was a great one, he just needed someone to listen to him.One of the most heart breaking scenes in that movie for me was after the tragic drag race, Jim tries to tell his parents what happened, you'll have to watch the movie to understand. But he wants to do the right thing and his parents are telling him one thing and another, but refuse to listen on what had happened to him. I felt his pain when you feel like everyone wants to make you better, but no one understands what's wrong and won't listen to you.This is a fantastic movie that I feel should be on the top 250. It was one of the most influential movies that sparked a whole new generation and future as well on troubled youth.

34,blanbrn,"Classic coming of age film with trouble, love, and wanting acceptance.",9,23 June 2020,"1955's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is for sure a drama classic as the film is a spotlight teenage type film in which the central characters come of age and learn and grow. And it's typical with young characters things like going against the grain and doing things like drinking alcohol and fighting is all found in this film classic. The story is sweet and simple as it involves Jim Stark(the wonderful and right fit James Dean) who's in town and he wants to be apart of the social society of teens at school, however the journey is a struggle from dealing with his parents to knife fighting which goes all the way to car racing and having a tragedy that kills someone over a cliff. Costar Sal Mineo gives a good performance as John another troubled teen just trying to fit in. The wild card of it all is Judy(Natalie Wood) who's alone in her little world only to be taken under the spell of the mystery of one James Dean. The picture I guess one could call anti establishment as many teens would rally against power and authority however Dean would long be a cult symbol status of cool and go against the grain which impacted pop culture. Overall this film is one to watch for it's fun little vices of teen angst yet underneath it all it's a take on love and acceptance.",Rebel Without a Cause
35,sddavis63,"Dated, But Still With A Relevance",7,13 March 2015,"I suppose that it goes without saying that any movie about teenagers in the 1950's is going to be dated by now. The world has changed, society has changed, culture has changed. So, without any doubt, there are going to be aspects of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" that seem to have little relevance to modern society, and I suppose a few things that might even seem quaint, if I could use that word. But, on the other hand, you could also say that teenagers are teenagers - in any generation. They have trouble fitting into the ways of their parents, they establish their own social norms and their own cliques, and pity the teenager who doesn't quite fit into the ""in"" group. We hear a lot about that today. Kids who are ignored, pushed aside, bullied, tormented - often with tragic results for them and for others. And it's always been that way. There are always kids who just have trouble being part of the group. This movie points out that it was happening in the 1950's just as much as it happens today.""Rebel Without A Cause"" is probably best known today as the only film in which James Dean - who died in a car accident about a month before it was released - received top billing. Dean's performance was excellent. As Jim Stark, he plays a teen with a troubled home life, and who's contemptuous of his father (Jim Backus) - a classic example of what would at one time have been called a hen-pecked husband, under the control of both his wife and his mother, who don't get along with each other. From his first appearance in the opening scenes (being picked up for drunkenness) we know that trouble is going to follow him. An outcast at the new high school he attends, he bonds with fellow outcast Plato (Sal Mineo). What follows is a series of tragic events as Jim and Plato struggle (but largely fail) to gain the acceptance of their peers.In addition to Dean and Mineo, Natalie Wood starred in this as Judy, a sort-of romantic interest to Jim who's troubled in her own way by a less than satisfactory home life, and a very distant relationship with her father.Yes, it's dated. And most of what happens (the two primary tragic events notwithstanding) seems pretty tame by the standards of what we hear about today. But the last part of the movie, in which Plato gets a gun and essentially goes insane, has a certain resonance even 50 years later. (7/10)",Rebel Without a Cause

A family that they've never had or have ever been a part of. Just having moved into town Jim is a bit nervous in that tomorrow would be his first day in school and wants to make an good impression on his fellow high school students. Jim didn't realize at the time but the next 36 or so hours he'd make an impression that everyone that he comes in contact with, at school and out as well as the movie audience, will never forget for the rest of their lives. In the case of Buzz ,Corey Allen,his involvement with Jim would be his last day on earth.Released just under a month (October 27, 1955) after James Dean's tragic death at the young and tender age of 24 in a car crash on September 30, 1955 the Nicholas Ray directed film ""Rebel Without a Cause"" impact on the youth of America, as well as the movie going public all over world, was like that of an 100 plus megaton hydrogen bomb. The movie exploded with such a wallop and left such an impact that it's effects has influenced movies about troubled youths has not let up at all for the last fifty or so years. Jims first day in school isn't exactly as smooth as he hoped it would be. Right off the bat he get's the school's bullies on his back by trying to get friendly with Judy, who turns out to be his neighbor, as he offers her a ride. At Dawson High School Jim mistakenly steps on the school's emblem, a no no, which infuriates a number of students. Going to the Griffeth Observatory with his fellow students for a lecture on the Universe Jim's clumsy attempt at humor, making sounds like a cow at the star sign of Turus, get's the same group of bullies so mad at him that they wait outside the auditorium just to pick a fight with Jim. At first trying to avoid trouble when Buzz, the leader of the gang of bullies, flatten his car tire Jim is then forced into a knife fight with him who he reluctantly, but decisively, beats. Jim who was trying to make an impression and friends at school only got the Buzz gang to attack him with Plato, who's picked on by every bully in Dawson High School, being the only friend he makes. Only because he's the only one who treats Plato with any kindness or understanding. Being challenged to go on a ""chicken run"" Jim, who never heard of it, tells Buzz that's all he does. Later that night it's the experienced Buzz, not the first timer Jim, who ends up dead at the bottom of the dangerous Millertown Bluff where the ""Chicken Run"" was held. An hysterical and heart-broken Judy seeks Jim out for understanding and someone to hold on to, as well as him being a replacement for her now dead boyfriend Buzz. It's then that Buzz's fellow gang members feel that Jim's going to go to the police to report what happened and implicate them. Jim does intend to go to the cops but to tell them that he was the other person involved in the ""chicken run"". Not getting any support from his parents Mr & Mrs Stark, Jim Backus & Ann Doran, in the situation that he finds himself in Jim together with Judy and Plato hide out at a deserted mansion in the Hollywood Hills that was the friendless Plato's secret hideaway. It's at the mansion that Plato starts to feel that he's been deserted by his new family Jim & Judy when he's momently left alone by them and a number of the late Buzz's gang, who were looking for Jim to keep him from telling on them, attack him. It's then that Plato ends up shooting and wounding one of them Crunch, Frank Mazzola. With the local police now out looking to arrest Plato for shooting Crunch he runs into the Griffith Observertory with Jim and Judy running the police roadblock and dragnet to try to talk Plato into giving himself up before he ends up getting shot and killed.One of the best youth movie of all times ""Rebel without a Cause"" breaks away from to usual family stereotype in the movies and TV and shows real people with real emotions that shocked moviegoers back then and even now, over 50 years later. Watching it you realize how ahead of it's time it really was. None of the teenagers had any father figure, or in the case of Plato no father at all, in the movie so it wasn't surprising at all that Jim Judy and Plato bonded so well with each other because of that very fact. Tremendous and moving musical score as the movie builds itself up for it's unforgettable and at the same time sad ending. With dawn breaking out over the Hollywood Hills a new day had dawn for those in the movie that survived the violence of the night before. With that knowledge the future for them was starting to look a lot brighter despite the very depressing and sad ending.",Rebel Without a Cause
37,Lejink,Rebel yell!,7,17 June 2009,"I came to this landmark movie not having seen it before and not very long after seeing and frankly not caring for James Dean's performance in ""Giant"". The fact of the matter though is that the film here is more Nicholas Ray's than Dean's and with the star's energies focused by a sympathetic director into an altogether more congenial role than Jett Rink in ""Giant"", consequently my enjoyment of the movie soared.It would have been all too easy for the likes of Ray to dumb down his talent and vision in adapting to a film aimed fore-square at the burgeoning teen market but it's to his credit that he fully engages with subject and character and delivers a well-rounded end-product which to these eyes and ears crosses the generation gap better than the fictional protagonists manage here.That said the story does take some time to heat up and I found many of the scenes and situations in the first half somewhat unnatural and forced, with acting occasionally to match. Dean initially seems too old for his part especially in relation to the gang of juvenile delinquents who bedevil him but as the movie progresses to its long denouement at the abandoned mansion and planetarium, he comes into his own, showing convincing shades of expression winningly mixed with quirkiness (the humorous ""drown them like puppies"" remark a la Mr Magoo, Jim Backus' alter ego, for example). I still occasionally found fault in his performance particularly when called on to show distress, much preferring the subtlety, calmness and depth he shows especially in his scenes with the hero-worshipping young Sal Mineo and nascent girl-friend Natalie Wood as his confederates. Both of the latter are excellent in admittedly lesser roles and as has been said many times before it's very sad that the lives of all three leads were curtailed suddenly, long before their time.This youthful triangle at the epicentre of the film wholly dominates your attention and sometimes happily distracts scrutiny away from the less than menacing teenage gang who eventually seek out Jim, Judy and Plato and also the threesome's dysfunctional families too (the latter straight out of ""Happy Days""!). The language employed by the youngsters could for me have been a little more contemporary with a bit more slang usage at the expense of an occasional speechifying tendency but in the dead quiet of the planetarium at the conclusion, Ray shows his mastery of control as the final tragedy is played out in near-darkness with his actors at last speaking quieter, shorter and altogether more telling lines.There's many a film with an exaggerated reputation in terms of its historical context and ""Rebel Without A Cause"", its lustre propelled into the limelight by Dean's demise and his being latched onto by the young rock'n'roll generation as a symbol of rebellious youth, has a bigger cross to bear than most. Watching it now, well over 50 years on, I can definitely say however that I ""got it"" and while aspects of the film were hackneyed in the first place and have dated even more down the years, this is still a bold contemporary melodrama, worthy of its place in American cinema (some would say wider) history.",Rebel Without a Cause
38,ElMaruecan82,Youth's driving furor leading to an existentialistic dead-end ...,8,28 March 2012,"""Rebel Without a Cause"", this title alone evokes the immediate image of James Dean as Jim Stark, in his iconic red leather jacket, Natalie Wood raising her arms to give the signal of one of the most heart-pounding deadly games ever featured on-screen, and the sad angel-face of Plato, Sal Mineo, in a role with a powerful ambiguity still, the movie is and will be forever associated with James Dean, and its key word : rebellion.Rebellion what a vague word, meaning everything and nothing in the same time. A rebellion implies an oppressive system to rebel against, and the construction of a social conscience from that oppression. But in ""Rebel Without a Cause"", there's no oppression other than a sort of peer pressure that makes everyone question his or her status in society. The film features three central characters played by actors who're not here anymore to provide any insights, but from what we know, they all have Family models' issues. Jim is explicit about his, his father lacks the authority that could have guided him to be a real man. In a moment that flirts with ridiculousness, his father wears an apron so laughable that I waited for Jim to take it off. Jim is his own guide because his old man can't. Jim can't count on his parents, Judy can't have the love she wants from her father, as for Plato, he doesn't have parents anymore.The race incident will provide more insights about Jim's existential problems. The unforgettable moment of the film where Buzz (Corey Allen) goes over the cliff is even sadder because it's pointless. Buzz was the most likely guy to befriend Jim, but he had to play his tough-guy part. Why? ""Why do we have to do this?' asks Jim, Buzz' reply echoes Marlon Brando's iconic answer to the ""What are you rebelling against?"" in ""The Wild One"". Jim and his friends belong to a generation that was too young to fight in the War, that didn't have any standard for bravery and courage. One decade before, people fought and proved their value, all these kids in ""Rebel"" are the expression of anger toward a society that can't teach them proper values and is almost careless about them. One underrated scene highlights this aspect; I'm talking of the interesting moment in the planetarium when a very dark view on the end of the Earth is exposed to the kids, as if they needed more pessimism.""The Earth will not be missed"", no one will, and everything is centered on the present. How many times Jim hears that he'll forget about this or that in ten years, as if it mattered, and the resonance is even more tragic considering Dean's fate. This is what the heart-breaking argument with the parents concluding with Jim asking his father to ""stand up for him"" is the highlight of the film. Jim knows that he can't lie to himself and need to prove his real value. ""Chicken"" is the worst insult one could take for a generation that grew up under the shadow of the Greatest Generation, and as Stark says, it's all about honor, about proving something. It's interesting that the breakdown with his parents could have worked as a climactic scene, the part where he almost strangles his father is incredibly modern in its violence and really made my heart pound. But then oddly, the film takes another direction and focus on Plato's character. This is not to diminish the importance of his character, but Stark is such a bigger-than-life antihero that Plato's problem seemed to belong to another film and kind of added too much dramatic weight on a plot that was already captivating. Not to mention the romance with Natalie Wood that seemed a bit too forced for a film with such intelligence. I really enjoyed ""Rebel Without a Cause"" but the last act of the film didn't add much to whatever was shown before stood for. So to really appreciate the relevance and modernity of ""Rebel Without a Cause"", the first act is enough, and the confrontations between Jim Stark and his parents are more powerful than any other with the gang.Take his spontaneous cry in the commissariat: ""You're tearing me apart"", shouted on his parents' incredulous faces. James Dean embodies something that no other movies could express, but that's not to say that the film succeeded in that, it's like the spirit of the film has been secretly kept by James Dean, and he played the role with an appealing immaturity that made his character, with his nasal voice, his mannerisms, and unforgettable look, one of the most defining of American Cinema. James Dean died one month before the film's release taking with him the secret beneath the character, and contributing to forge a real legend. As an alibi, I guess that maybe the iconic status of the film undermined any attempt to rationalize the message behind. And that's probably the 'deliberate' flaw of Nicholas Ray's film, it reminded me of Dennis Hopper's ""Easy Rider"", and as a fitting coincidence, Hopper played in both of them. Both movies are great in their own way but we never know the underlined messages behind some scenes or the powerful statements it tries to communicate, yet it's totally impossible to deny their cultural significance, iconic status and impacts on audiences (the film was one of the first to be admitted in the National Film Registry in 1990). Maybe that's the secret of their appeal, they don't try to have a message but to show a slice of youth's life in a certain era, and convey the malaise endured by the most underestimated demographic category. The title itself sounds as a recognition of the movie's own limits, there is no cause then no point, but there is a rebellion.",Rebel Without a Cause
39,gbill-74877,"1950's cool, still cool today.",8,29 November 2016,"James Dean was killed in a car accident at the age of 24 just a month before 'Rebel Without a Cause' was released, and that tragedy, along with his electric performance of teenage angst in the film, would seal his legend. There are several iconic scenes early on that show his ability – imitating the siren at the police station after being picked up for public drunkenness, yelling ""you're tearing me apart!"" as his parents argue, and a scene with Natalie Wood, who rebuffs him initially, mocking him by saying ""I bet you're a real gentleman"", and him responding ""I love you too"". He is the new kid at their school, the outsider, the misfit, whose parents don't understand him.The film taps into this sense of teenage isolation, and there is clearly a plea to be listened to, loved, and understood. It also taps into a feeling of existentialism, of meaninglessness on a larger scale, with an outstanding scene in the planetarium where Dean's class listen to the lecturer say ""to the infinite reaches of space, the problems of man seem trivial and naive indeed. And man, existing alone, seems himself an episode of little consequence."" Wood looks up into the projection of the stars, while Dean frowns as if Camus himself. As the film plays out, we see Wood has problems with her parents too – her dad, apparently uncomfortable with her budding sexuality, slaps her across the face for giving him a kiss as she would have when smaller. Their other friend, a repressed gay character played by Sal Mineo, has parents who are absent entirely, with devastating results. Dean is provoked into a knife fight at one point, and then into a frightening game of 'Chickie Run', with drivers meant to jump out of their cars speeding towards the edge of a cliff at the last minute. It's an idiotic game, but that's what young people do sometimes, idiotic things, and a classic line has Dean asking 'Why do we do this?', and the other boy, played by Corey Allen, responding, ""You've gotta do something, don't you?""In the aftermath of Allen's character dying, the film spirals in ways which seem a bit exaggerated. It's still well worth watching for its themes and actors, Wood, Mineo, and most of all Dean, who is like a young Brando, full of screen presence, full of promise. He's great in scenes of angst, but also in those with spontaneous banter and play. 1950's cool, still cool today.",Rebel Without a Cause

What really cemented its representation of rebellious teens was the death of its star, James Dean, in a car accident.Actually, RWAC is the story of three teens, all misunderstood, all with feelings of alienation. Like all teenagers, they seek to define their places in society, but they struggle--in part due to bad parenting or lack of parenting.In Jim's household, there is a power struggle between the mother and the grandmother. Jim's father--played by Jim Backus--is a shell-shocked victim of their warfare. Jim sees him as an emasculated fool. He longs for his father to stand up for...anything. He seeks respect.Judy--played by Natalie Wood--is a young girl who seeks to be unacceptable to authority figures as a means to gain acceptance by ""the crowd"". Her father rejects her attempts at intimacy due to his warped views of appropriateness. She seeks love.Plato--played by Sal Mineo--basically lives with the family maid. His mother is always away, making it clear that he is of little consequence to her. He seeks stability.The story tells how the lives of these three intersect in a police station, and they rapidly and awkwardly become a family of sorts, hoping to cope with the world through their caring for each other. In the process, they gain respect and love.In the aftermath of the atomic bomb, mankind was asking questions about the stability of the world and, indeed, the entire universe. In this setting, the insecurities of children trying to define themselves and their roles in society was rightfully seen as a volatile fuse. And when self-esteem is undermined by the family unit, the results are dangerously unpredictable.RWAC is beautifully filmed. Its main attraction is the wonderful acting of James Dean. He is the center of the film and his performance never flags. The director must have reveled in the dailies, discovering that his film was becoming so much more than he might have hoped through Dean's brilliance and his dedication to the role.",Rebel Without a Cause
44,ironhorse_iv,"What!? You haven't saw this motion picture, yet! Are you trying to tear me apart!? Go see it! 'Rebel without a Cause' is a great coming to age film, even with its many faults!",7,22 June 2018,"Loosely adopted from psychiatrist Robert M. Lindner's 1944 book, 'Rebel without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath', only by title & directed by Nicolas Ray, the film tells the story of an unsettled, lost, young teen named Jim Stark (James Dean), trying to find his place in the world, along with other alienated youths, after a night of heavy partying; only to find himself, being misled into tragic unfortunate consequences. Without spoiling the film, too much, this colorful wide-screen 1955's Cinemascope feature is probably best remembered for being the movie that made James Dean into a 1950's pop-culture icon. It opened at the Astor Theatre in New York on October 29th, 1955, about a month after Dean's untimely death due to a car wreck to great audience applause and wonderful critical reviews. It received accolades for the performance of Dean and the young stars who appeared. The film also received three Academy Awards nominations (Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Story). Despite being unsuccessful in winning any of those awards, the movie did deserve the praise. 'Rebel without a Cause' was indeed way ahead of its time in its attempt in portraying the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations. However, it wasn't the first film to explore these issues. The idea that angst teen drama is an invention of the 1950s-part of the Western emergence of youth culture after the Second World War is understatement, and not accurate. Nevertheless, I can understand, why some film buff historians, retrospective, say the 1950s was the beginning. It was the era that Hollywood really did exploit this new demographic for ticket sales, but in truth, there has always been movies focus on the wild side of the adolescent demographic, since there has been films; even in the strict heyday of the Production Code. Most of the important types and tropes for teen film like conflict between independence and dependence, rebellion and conformity, maturity and immaturity; emerged in American cinema between 1910 and 1930, with rare films like 1923's 'Flaming Youth', 1933's 'Wild Boys on the Road', and 1937's 'Dead End' to name some. They all help show the dark side of the intermediate stage between childhood and adulthood, so well; while eroticized the rebel archetype. However, 'Rebel without a Cause' stood out more, because how complex & harsh, the existentialism subject matter was. There is no better example than that, then the class field trip scene at the Griffith Observatory; where the teens are faced with the hard truth, about the malaise feelings of living in a world without much purpose. Seeing the metaphor, of how tiny, life is, on Earth, compare to the unfathomable vastness of cosmos at the planetarium really does weight people down. It's no wonder, why some people found this movie, to be, bit too depressing to watch. I don't blame them. It's probably, not the best message to give to children. Most films, would probably use this scene, as tools to send a uplifting moral, to let the youth know, whatever positive things, they do, does matters. Yet, for this movie's sakes, it's work well to create conflict. It's here, where the movie, really does picks up. We get, why the disconnect teens acts the way, they does; even if some of their so-call reasons to rebel are ludicrous & somewhat dated like the protagonist. The idea that men need to beat up female; in order to show them, who's the boss, is a product of the time, where macho masculinity was all-time high. Nobody would bat an eye, these days about Jim's father, Frank (Jim Backus) so-called lack of masculinity. Every man cooks and cleans, today. It's not abnormal. Still, I love the film frame his father's milquetoast attitude and failure to stand up to his overbearing shrewish wife, Carol (Ann Doran), with him, looking much smaller & meek. A good example of this, is the stairway, where Jim is caught, between his constantly bickering parents about reporting a crime. Surprisingly, much of the movie's subplots, involving the three teens getting in trouble are Ray's attempt to come to term with his own failure as a husband & father; while also, confronting the sexual confusion, he had, at the time, that led to the abuse of his 13 year old son by his then-wife, actress, Gloria Graham. That's why homosexual was portray as a mental illness, much in the same vain with incest, sadist & psychopath in this movie. The idea that having such traits are bad & needs to be eradicate off, the planet, in order for more stable heterosexual relationships to blossom & fatherhood to champion, was his way to cope with the problem. Regardless, it is now view as an awful cruel way to end a movie. Not only, because the force love story between highly unlikeable & annoying undeveloped, Judy (Natalie Wood) & over-sensitive, kindhearted boy; Jim, seem kinda rushed, so soon after her ex's Buzz Gunderson (Corey Allen) death, but also, due to the jarring nature, it has create, involving John ""Plato"" Crawford (Sal Mineo) acting like their son. It's was too much stuff to handle; being cram in. Despite that, the movie was still cut, even more to pieces & banned in certain countries, out of fear, that it would incite violence. Thank goodness, the film's original US version was not. It was deemed ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant"" enough, to be added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry. It was well deserve, regardless of the messy third act. The movie was still, very well-made. So, don't be a chicken! Put on your red windbreaker and race to go see this movie!

45,kenjha,Teenage Wasteland,8,4 September 2009,"This film about teen angst became an anthem for a generation. Ray infuses the film with raw energy and elicits notable performances. Of the three actors (Brando and Clift being the others) who popularized Method acting in the 1950s, Dean's acting now looks the most mannered (Cary Grant described Dean's acting as ""God-awful""). However, Dean's goofiness is well suited to the role of a frustrated teenager and social unfit, making this the iconic performance of his brief career. The three stars of the film would all die young. Dean was dead at 24 by the time this film was released while Mineo would be stabbed in his 30's and Wood would drown in her 40's.",Rebel Without a Cause
46,sol-,My brief review of the film,9,18 April 2005,"A brutally honest and well-filmed study of dysfunctionality and learning to deal with aggression, the film is earnestly acted, in particular by James Dean and Jim Backus. The dialogue is surprisingly smart and the stereotypes of society are perfectly portrayed and characterised, yet the script is rather weak in the final scenes. However, I found the film to be always captivating, and it raises some interesting issues, like the disturbed being able to help the even more disturbed. When released, it was a precedential film, and I think that it still would hold a large degree of potency for most, even if not all, viewers today.",Rebel Without a Cause
47,Thanos_Alfie,James Dean...,7,18 June 2020,"""Rebel Without a Cause"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a young man arriving in a new city where he meets new friends, creating new bonds and some new enemies. His life is changed very much and he has to be more responsible for his actions.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but interesting plot with many in tense scenes. The direction which was made by Nicholas Ray was simply exceptional and I believe he reached the potential of each actor in his cast. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that James Dean who played as Jim Stark made one of his best interpretations and he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sal Mineo's who played as John 'Plato' Crawford and Natalie Wood's who played as Judy and they were both very good. Finally, I have to say that I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because through this movie you will understand why James Dean is considered as one of the best actors of all time.",Rebel Without a Cause
48,Dr_Coulardeau,Nothing has changed since 1955,10,25 March 2012,"In this film James Dean is quite convincing as an actor and his part is perfect. A difficult part in that trinity of J, Jim (for James), Judy and John, in one letter Jesus three times and one of the three will have to be sacrificed, crucified in a way, falling right upon a random police bullet when unarmed.Just such a concentrate of the film shows how ridiculous the world was in 1955. The war was over and the horror of before, during and after was so bleak that the whole world was stoned into full paralytic dullness by the holocaust, the genocide, the fifty million victims and the huge destruction of goods and infrastructures but also of morals and ethics and plain human decency. No surprise that John had Plato as a middle name. The philosophy we could have then was nothing but the good thinking of an elite in a society where 80% of the people were slaves, like in Athens.In a world like that what is left for the young? The question is actually slightly premature in a way since these high school teenagers in the early 1950s had experienced the war. They had the horror of the end of that war and they had nothing to thrill them into believing there was some kind of future worth living. No allusion is done to it but there is nothing but the Cold War to enthuse these young people. With that kind of perspective there is not much any one can do to motivate them. We can even wonder if the world exists for these young people in this film.The parents are dead war heroes, or plain absent. They can also be neurotic and paranoid survivors who want to do things differently and well and do not see that either they run away from what these young people want, or they just ignore what they want, or they just leave them to their own means and to die playing some chicken dare over a cliff. The world is unable to provide these young people with the two things they want: love and a cause they could commit their lives to.And they will get none.The school system will go on harping on stars and constellations and will not see that some bullies are imposing their norms to everyone and that those these bullies decide to victimize will have to survive the death of their bullying challengers or die. What a beautiful perspective. Death in both cases. And they do nothing about it, the teachers and the guidance counsellors, and it is still going on. The pedagogical masters who are in fact monstrous monstrosities are just ignoring their very mission which is to build in all the young people they are entrusted with an idealistic vision of the future that makes them ready to work with everyone as equals and to respect everyone else in all their parameters and personalities. The school system has drastically been failing since 1945.The police is not better since they can only brandish weapons and shoot first. Nothing has changed there either since 1945. They do not wait for the presumed criminal to start shooting or to really prove he is dangerous for himself or for others. They neutralize him for life by inflicting him death first and wondering afterwards. In the particular case of this film the police officer who shot the boy did not get any order from his commanding officers, in fact it was the reverse, and he was under no menace from an unloaded gun and the other young man had actually said so but it must have gotten lost in translation from plain English to police speak.Young people want to invest their tremendous energy in some cause, but they have none worth even blinking half an eye. Young people want to love everyone and find love in everyone, and not that kind of churchlike love but all the shades of love you can imagine, fatherly, motherly, friendly, brotherly, sisterly and even plain childlike and adult love. That's a lot and I can tell you that has not change since Auschwitz: love is the last thing anyone will provide the people around them on a daily basis, and if anyone tried to do that he or she would at once be classified perverse, paedophilic, peevish, petulant, in one word depraved, though in fact that someone is only trying to give what they want and need to deprived people.But deprivation is the basic goods of this society.Is there any hope? For the dead chap certainly not though he is going with the coat of one who was his friend and he knew it more or less. For the young man who gave his coat he found a girl friend but will that be enough of a cause to satisfy his rebellious needs? He also finally found some understanding on the side of his father and especially of his mother. Will she be able to remain that open or will she go back to her frigid paranoia and escapism? For the girl Judy she lost a boyfriend down the cliff who was a bully and she got a new one who was the bully's plaything. Did she win anything? And how long will she be able to go on with her subservient attitude: waiting for and finding the man she wants to submit to? Without a cause and without a commitment to that cause, there is no hope on this earth and in this society. A film that still speaks to us even if it has aged technically.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Rebel Without a Cause

53,funkyfry,An original and classic film,10,8 January 2007,"One of director Nick Ray's best works, including a powerful performance from the iconic James Dean -- this is one for the ages. Ray plies his usual technique of layering different character's relationships, compiling a group of what you might call ""love triangles"" -- family units and the artificial family unit made up by Jim (Dean), Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo).I have a feeling this film can be looked at in many different ways. It has historical significance because it is one of Dean's only performances and because it was the film that more than any other inspired the huge wave of ""Juvenile Delinquent"" films that were produced throughout the 1950s. But I think the film has plenty of quality to stand on its own aside from its historical significance. The performances of the 3 principals are outstanding, including Wood's who I usually do not like. I've never seen Mineo better, or in a more interesting role. Dean is just blistering with erotic negativity, from the infamous early scenes in the courthouse (""you're tearing me apart!"") to his half-hearted attempts to win the friendship of the local clique and his eventual half-hearted attempt to defeat their leader in a ""chicken run"". The character performances are all very well done as well, with Corey Allen's as his romantic rival and chicken run opponent and Jim Backus' turn as his emasculated father being the standouts. Ray's direction was never better, with plenty of visual clues along the way to tell us about the characters' identity and their transformations. For example, in one early scene in the cop station, Ray manipulates his actors and camera so that we have all 3 principals in one film frame, separated by glass partitions, telling the audience that these 3 will be our principal characters but also emphasizing that at this point they do not know each other. The direction in the ""chicken run"" scene is some of the best you will ever see anywhere on film, with Ray letting us into the interior of the participants' cars and then giving us a shot from a distance of the lights coming on, then we get that famous exhilarating shot of Wood standing between the cars and waving, her dress and shirt flying in the cars' tailwind.The film is literally packed with classic directorial touches like this.

54,strong-122-478885,"Tsk. Tsk. All Those Troubled Teens Of Yesterday, Today, & Tomorrow",6,10 June 2014,"Well, folks - If you don't know this already, Rebel Without a Cause (RWAC, for short) was the very movie that (back in the mid-1950s) spoke precisely the right lingo to millions of angry, alienated and defiant teens all across this here continent. It told them exactly what they wanted to hear.As well, RWAC catapulted its bright, new star, James Dean, right into Hollywood-idol heaven where he would instantly become the most emulated and worshipped actor (by the teens) of his day. (Within the same year of this film's release, Dean, at 24, would be dead, but not forgotten)Casually dressed in red (jacket), white (t-shirt) & blue (jeans), Dean (like an American flag of sorts) stood tall in this film as the very essence of ""cool"". And, thus, in the starry eyes of the teens who adored him, he was transformed into a revered icon through their undying devotion.As a teen flick, RWAC certainly posed many pertinent questions, but rarely did it answer any of them, satisfactorily. I mean, this film didn't help at all to resolve the growing concern of delinquency which was rearing its ugly head amongst the American youth.But RWAC did make it clear that a problem such as hooliganism was a two-sided coin where full blame for its existence could neither be laid solely on the confused parents' indifference, nor on their bored children's defiance.All-in-all - RWAC, with its timely message, was well-structured story-telling that literally screamed out at the top of its lungs - ""Money can't buy me love!"" *Trivia note* - If James Dean were alive today he'd be 83 years old.",Rebel Without a Cause
55,ackstasis,"""You're tearing me apart!""",8,12 February 2008,"When it comes to 1950s cinema, few films are more iconic than Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause (1955),' which was one of the first to actively explore the themes of juvenile delinquency and the decay of American youth, and the widening rift between adolescents and their parents. The screenplay by Stewart Stern and Irving Shulman, from a story by the director, derived its title from an actual 1944 publication, ""Rebel Without A Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath,"" but bares little other resemblance to this book. Of the three feature films for which James Dean is remembered, it is this one with which he is most closely associated, his tragic death in a motor accident on September 30 1955 somewhat validating his reputation as a ""rebel without a cause,"" ensuring his enduring legacy as an American cultural icon {though undoubtedly denying the cinema-going public of a lifetime of brilliant performances}. In 1956, Ray's film received three Oscar nominations, including acting nods for co-stars Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo {Dean received the first of his two posthumous Best Actor nominations, but for Elia Kazan's 'East of Eden (1955)' rather than this film}.Jim Stark (Dean) is a rebellious seventeen-year-old, whose tendency to get into trouble with the police forces his family to move neighbourhoods often. He is one of three adolescents in the film whose degrading relationship with their parents  to varying degrees, as I'll explain  attempts to demonstrate and explain the widening rift between generations. Jim finds himself able to talk to his father (Jim Backus), but can next coax a straight answer out of him. Frank Stark is a meek, submissive husband  shown in one scene dressed in a woman's apron to highlight his lack of household authority  and Jim finds it difficult to respect him. Judy (Natalie Wood) can hardly interact with her father (William Hopper), as he resents her approaching maturity and labels her a ""dirty tramp"" for dressing up and using lipstick. As for the troubled Plato (Sal Mineo), his parents have more or less deserted him, and he is left in the care of an African-American maid who isn't able to control his disturbed personality. By the end of the film, Plato has become the story's ""sacrificial lamb,"" his tragic shooting death the inevitable culmination of the neglect of his parents.Had a lesser director held the reins during the film's production, it would have been easy for 'Rebel Without a Cause' to erode in quality with the passing of time. A picture dealing with then-contemporary issues such as juvenile delinquency {today a considerably more complex and troubling subject} might now appear dated, but it holds up surprisingly well, both as a societal caution and as artistic entertainment. The first ten minutes do, indeed, feel something like a public service announcement, but the narrative falls into a comfortable rhythm as we come to know and sympathise with the major characters. Likewise, some outdated elements now seem exaggerated and a little silly {the consequences of the ""chickie-run"" didn't need to be quite so drastic  and Judy completely forgot the death of her boyfriend within hours}, but all is forgiven in view of James Dean's memorable, incredibly heartfelt performance. His anguished cry of ""you're tearing me apart!"" betrays the confusion and torment suffered by many youths stranded in a household that they can't understand, and whose shortcomings they blame on themselves  Jim's mother (Ann Doran), notably, uses her son's actions as a scapegoat for the failing of her marriage.",Rebel Without a Cause
56,dee.reid,"""Rebel Without a Cause""",10,28 February 2012,"Although it's been a while (several years, in fact) since I last saw ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" I do remember it as being one of the finest movies I've ever seen, and one of the overall best films of the 20th century and one of the best films ever made. It is arguably the greatest movie ever made about juvenile delinquency and alienated youth (and pretty much every problem facing American youths everywhere). But first and foremost, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is most famous for cementing the legendary status of its star, tragic lead actor and Hollywood icon James Dean, who died in a car accident just one month prior to the film's release in 1955. His portrayal of the extremely troubled young man Jim Stark and the trouble he finds himself getting into once he moves to a new town and joins a gang, made him an icon and a living stand-in for all the troubled youths everywhere, as well as sparking over half a century of debate over what is causing youths to misbehave so violently sometimes and what can be done to fix it. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" offers no easy solutions, but I feel that it is simply a true-life portrait of one young man's troubled existence; I don't think this movie was made to offer solutions, but instead I think we're meant to understand Jim Stark's dilemmas, amongst those of the other characters in the film. Director Nicholas Ray's film may or may not be cursed (as some legends have it), since all three of the film's primary stars have met tragic, premature deaths: as stated earlier, James Dean died in a car accident one month before the film's release; actress Natalie Wood was involved in a mysterious drowning accident in 1981; and Sal Mineo was murdered in 1976.

58,Chris_Docker,Enduring icon,9,20 December 2006,"Rebelliousness. Testosterone. Driving force.In the cool light of day, knowing where the anger comes from and what it is directed at often saps the charisma around such things. It lets us explain it away. When there is no such reason, no cause, it acquires an almost godlike status, beyond logic and argument. This is the film that launched the icon that was James Dean. His name now litters countless songs as the immortal symbol of teenage angst, a figure of non-aggressive but charged masculinity almost without equal. The film title, taken from a psychologist's collection of juvenile case studies, captures the imagination even before we see the movie.Jim Stark (James Dean) meets the sweet, unloved Judy (Natalie Wood) - the girl destined to be his sweetheart - when they are pulled into a police station at the start of the film. Through no fault of her own, she has been mistaken for a streetwalker. Jim is just 'plain drunk'. Also in the police station is an emotionally disturbed youngster called John, or 'Plato'. Plato's anger and aggression can take a more violent turn, but he also a victim of circumstances whose parents care nothing for him.The teenage cry of, ""You don't understand me!!"" could not be portrayed more meaningfully right from scene one.Judy's boyfriend, Buzz, is the leader of the gang and taunts her new friend. Jim is torn between always trying to avoid trouble but never wanting to be seen as 'chicken'. Buzz manipulates him into a flick-knife fight, which acts as prelude for the even more dangerous 'chicken run' challenge - racing stolen cars towards a cliff edge and jumping out at the last minute.Rebel Without A Cause continues the themes of teenage alienation with great dexterity and insight. Plato befriends Jim and Judy, eager for companionship. He guides them through a derelict Gothic mansion. Here, and in the nearby planetarium, the stories of love, friendship and violence reach a dramatic and tragic climax.The strengths of Rebel Without A Cause that set it apart from the multitude of inferior copies are numerous. (Teenage rebellion films multiplied exponentially in the years immediately following its release.) In terms of substance, it both follows expert psychological profiling and distinguished Method Acting. Stylistically, it is a showpiece of evocative cinematography.Cinemascope was still quite new and is used here to remarkable effect. In the police station, Jim, Judy and Plato (who don't know each other at this stage) are sectioned across three discrete pockets of the set. We can see each third portraying the distinct individuals with their own story lines. Later, before the first real kiss, the wide screen is used effectively at closer quarters in a head-and-shoulders shot. Here, Jim lies on his back and we see him side-on, motionless but inviting, as Judy exchanges sweet nothings with him, gradually edging closer. The length of the screen continues in our imagination - we feel their bodies should be entwined. This build up to the first kiss is maybe one of the most tantalising in screen history. We can visualise it long before it happens.Colour coding is an important stylistic touch. Look out for the symbolic values of Jim's jacket, Judy's lipstick, and various colour schemes that appear throughout the film. The uneasy background score effectively underlines the themes of psychological turmoil.The film also has a serious note that raises it above its apparent teen-flick status. The idea that teenage rebelliousness or delinquency cannot just be blamed on social deprivation and is not just bred in the slums was quite innovative. (The youngsters in the film are from fairly affluent backgrounds.) It also gave expression to a non-conformist persona that teenagers could identify readily with, the antithesis of adult 'apparent perfection'. It laid bare the generation gap and helped to force people to acknowledge and deal with it. Characterisations are full enough to explore hidden themes of homosexuality and incest. Cameos include the young Dennis Hopper and, towards the end of the film, director Nicholas Ray.Unlike many examples of cinema from an earlier generation, Rebel Without A Cause is dynamic edge-of-the-seat viewing many years on. James Dean is reported as saying, ""Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today."" Sadly he never lived to see the release of the film, but the dreams he created seem to live on.",Rebel Without a Cause

60,Lechuguilla,Indelible James Dean,9,5 September 2009,"With short, slicked-back hair, blue eyes and thick red lips, and dressed in a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and bright red jacket, James Dean creates a lasting visual impression as youthful Jim Stark, the prototype high school outsider, alone and troubled. Dean's on-screen persona, together with his vivid, intense performance, overwhelms all other elements in this film about 1950s teenage confusion and angst.Newly arrived in town, Jim Stark finds himself trapped in a typically hostile high school, and confronted by an in-crowd of leather-jacketed hoods with names like ""Buzz"", ""Crunch"", and ""Goon"". They challenge Jim's honor by calling him ""chicken"". What to do? Jim asks his weak, mealy-mouthed father (well played by Jim Backus). But his father is no help. Indeed, the film conveys a grim view of adults: self-indulgent, weak, insensitive, unobservant, and inept.Then there's ""Plato"" (Sal Mineo), the high school kid who has always been alone, with no apparent father or mother. In Jim Stark, Plato has finally found a friend. Eventually, another student joins Jim and Plato. Judy (Natalie Wood) changes her caddy behavior toward Jim after an event changes her life. But it's still a hostile world, and the bond that these three young people form, as substitute family, is fleeting, en route to a poignant ending.The film's characters and thematic tone are representative of a Cold War era in America when the threat of nuclear annihilation hovered over everyone and everything like the sword of Damocles. And thus, the story's astronomy motif amplifies a sense of loneliness, insignificance, isolation, and helplessness, so characteristic of the 1950s.There are things about this film I do not care for. The compressed widescreen projection in ""CinemaScope"" is annoying. The music, which varies from jazz to rhythm and blues to nondescript noise, is too loud and too manipulative. And there's something vaguely contradictory about a macho James Dean in the role of Jim Stark, whom bullies pick on.But none of these irritations can diminish the thematic depth of the story. Nor can they diminish the overpowering presence of James Dean, the actor, the perfect Hollywood symbol of youthful ""cool"", whom actors subsequently looked to as a model of acting excellence and cinematic charisma.",Rebel Without a Cause

62,jimbo-53-186511,Many of the themes contained in Rebel Without A Cause make it just as important now as it was more than 60 years ago,8,26 July 2016,"Jim Stark (James Dean) is a rebellious teenager who gets into trouble regularly forcing his parents to keep moving from town to town. Jim strikes up a friendship with fellow troubled teens Plato Crawford (Sal Mineo) and Judy (Natalie Wood). What follows is Jim's struggle to gain acceptance whilst he simultaneously starts to understand the value of love and true friendship.Rebel Without A Cause is quite an easy film to become involved with simply because it is so easy to relate to; many of us have probably been at an emotional crossroads in our lives whereby we're not really sure which path to take in life? This is essentially what the crux of the story is here, but for those that pay attention there is quite a lot to be taken away from this film....Jim is portrayed as the ultimate rebel but rather than just getting bogged down in exploring that side of his character the film essentially opens up Jim's world and shows us why he may have chosen to behave in the manner that he does? His parents are both very different; mother is strict and highly-strung and used to getting her own way whereas his father appears to be caring and full of good intentions, but he's a bit of a wet blanket and isn't a particularly assertive person. To me these things probably contributed towards Jim's own social problems; I got the impression that he couldn't talk to his mother due to her stubborn unyielding nature and couldn't talk to his father because he sugar-coats everything. For these reasons I saw Jim as a flawed person rather than a bad person and Jim's rebellion was probably a coping mechanism and its mentioned early in the film that he had no real friends in the past and never had anyone to focus his attention on. His friendship with Plato and Judy for me is possibly what brought about his change in attitude later in the film. Given the subject matter this kind of material could easily come across as being preachy and heavy-handed, but it isn't either of these things. Sure it gives you 'food for thought' and there's enough offered in the narrative for you to come to your own conclusions, but it does all this without being forceful which is excellent.Despite appearing to be different in the early stages of the film I also believe that Judy and Jim are perhaps more similar than we may think; both come from fairly prosperous families, but both teenagers don't get along with their parents and choose to rebel (the only real difference is that Judy rebels by getting in with a 'bad crowd' whereas Jim tended to go on solo 'self-destructive' rampages). Both Jim and Judy are interesting characters and the scenes involving both teenagers and their families prove to offer some interesting insights.The third main protagonist is Plato (Sal Mineo) who, like Judy and Jim, lacked direction in life, but unlike Jim and Judy he seemed more like a lost soul and a bit lonely (him following Jim around like a lost puppy was both endearing and a little bit creepy). I suspect that his unstable upbringing meant that he had few close connections in life and it's possible that, in Jim, he saw everything that he wanted to be and saw some security in him as well as seeing him as a strong role model. All 3 of these characters are strong characters and are able to carry the film well between them, but a minor criticism I have with Sal Mineo's character is that he wasn't particularly used well in the first half of the film (he kind of just follows Jim around), but in the second half of the film he is used much better and the 3 way chemistry between Dean, Wood and Mineo is superb.The performances from all involved were excellent (with a young Dennis Hopper somewhere in the film, but I couldn't tell you which one of the rebels was him), but predictably this was definitely a vehicle for the young stars of the day and the likes of Dean, Wood and Mineo are superb throughout.Rebel Without A Cause is a two-fold story which is part coming-of-age teen drama and in part a social critique on how parenting methods can impact on children.

But his personality is such that within a twenty-four-hour period he makes friends with Plato (Sal Mineo) and Judy (Natalie Wood), two misunderstood teenagers completely different from each other and himself...Every tempestuous young boy who considers himself friendless, confused, and aimless, can easily identify with Jim... For the youth of the middle 1950's, Dean's screen image was a symbol of loneliness, anger, and frustration...Jim's appealing characteristics are his sincerity, his warmth toward Judy, his concern for his friend Plato (whom no one else likes) his protectiveness, his shyness, his bravery, his good looks, his tender way of kissing, and his desperate need to be loved...Jim is a troubled new student in a high school in Los Angeles, who is not only willing to reveal that he loves his father, but also has the capacity to cry - which he does often... His one bad characteristic is his violent nature, but at least his fury is not directed at Judy or his friend Plato... He meets these two in jail, where he has been taken on a drunk and disorderly charge...Jim and Julie have an immediate connection, and Plato warns them against Julie's boyfriend, Buzz... Buzz and his gang slash the tires of Jim's cars and a fight ensues... The boys decide to settle their differences by having a 'chicken run.' Each will drive a stolen car toward the brink of a cliff, and the first to jump before the automobile lunges over will be a coward...In the 1950s, the two basic ways that youth could rebel seemed to be through acts of violence and delinquency and through gathering into groups and being directed by a group leader... Richard Brooks' ""Blackboard Jungle"" vividly described that situation...As teenagers we liked being called 'rebels.' At that age we weren't out to destroy the 'system,' but like Jim we wanted the 'system' to become more sensitive to our needs, to apologize for being careless, and to make us part of the existing order...At that age we recognized Jim's failure to communicate with his parents, and the way he mumbled when he thought no one was listening and started his sentences over, louder and clearer... He was our ideal... Everything he said was so right, so clever, so cool...When the unfriendly Judy calls him a YoYo and runs off to join her friends, he says softly, ""I love you, too."" When the now friendly Judy asks him why he kissed her on the forehead, he says simply: ""I felt like it."" When Buzz asks him if he knows what a ""chickie run"" is, he fibs, ""That's all I ever do."" When Plato asks him if he can keep his jacket, Jim exclaims, ""Well, what do you think?""At that age Nicholas Ray's teenagers were hopelessly confused, seeking advice and getting no answers... Their confusion was symbolized by Plato's mismatched socks... Jim, Judy, and Plato pretend to be a family unit based on a mutual trust and understanding, the only structure which can combat the cosmic emptiness of 'man alone.''Rebel Without a Cause' is the first film to suggest that juvenile violence is not necessarily bred in the poor neighborhoods... It is the disenchanted cry of youth, neglected by their parents, and alienated from the adult world...Judy sobs that her father stops kissing her when she was sixteen, and causes her pain when he labels her a 'dirty tramp.' Plato is lost and in despair because his absent, divorced parents have left him completely in the care of a black housekeeper... During questioning, he asserts: ""Nobody can help me.""In watching 'Rebel Without a Cause,' we can see the desperate father-son relationship, the need to be loved and understood as an individual... That is why 'Rebel Without a Cause' is the best of the alienated-youth films of the period, and the most emotional of films...Dean's death in an automobile accident in 1955 was a crippling blow to one of the most characteristic elements of fifties cinema...",Rebel Without a Cause

66,JoeKarlosi,Rebel Without a Cause (1955) ****,10,10 September 2004,"This was a tough film for me to evaluate. Because while it was completely enjoyable, nicely shot and well acted, I just couldn't relate to teenage angst as a middle-aged adult anymore. Ultimately, I had to give it a complete four star rating though -- because I think this movie is very powerful and successfully captures the stress of that teen confusion and anger. It holds up well for today's times too, and is probably best appreciated by young people who are coming of age, rather than those of us who've already been there.As I've said, I found it difficult to relate to these silly teenagers even from when I was a kid. Believe me, I wasn't exactly what you'd call a model teen all of the time myself ... I did some irresponsible things too ... but I was always my own person and never felt the need to ""fit in"" with the crowd. So it's hard for me to feel sorry for: a dopey girl who goes around with the class bully and switches jerks like she changes socks; dumb boys who get into knife fights and are stupid enough to risk their lives playing ""chicken"" or get drunk or run around brandishing guns just because they've had a non-traditional childhood (I myself was a child of divorce and never needed a bottle or a pistol). Plenty of times I felt like yelling to the screen, ""serves ya right!"" But the thing is -- considering the real types of kids portrayed here, the movie does capture their turmoil perfectly. Enough so that even an old grouchy adult like me can still want to slap them while watching my television. Now, THAT'S realism! This was my first James Dean flick, and he lived up to all the legendary hoopla I've heard about over the years. He's very effective as the troubled youth trying to sort out his many mental problems. But for me, the best performance came from young Sal Mineo, as the confused boy without a dad who tends to look up to Dean as the father figure or big brother he never had - or maybe even more, as I felt a possible aura of homosexual attraction to James mixed in as well. The film is strikingly photographed in beautiful color, and some shots are strong standouts (one of my favorites was the chicken race where two cars zoom past Natalie Wood who stands between them).So for me, this was more a film to admire objectively than one which I related to personally. I'm positive I've had similar issues with my parents while growing up myself; but perhaps it's just been too many decades gone by to hit home for me at this time in my life. Youth is wasted on the young indeed. **** out of ****",Rebel Without a Cause
67,slokes,"""...An Episode Of Little Significance""",8,10 August 2012,"It's tempting to want to dismiss ""Rebel Without A Cause"" just for the role it plays in James Dean's suffocating iconography, but to do so is to miss out on a great performance in a very good film.Dean is Jim Stark, a troubled but by-no-means troublemaking teen who finds himself in a new town already off to a bad start. The gang at Dawson High doesn't appreciate his fancy wardrobe or his humor. The gang's leader, Buzz (Corey Allen) deflates a tire on Jim's car with a switchblade as Buzz's girlfriend Judy (Natalie Wood) eggs him on. Jim wants no trouble, but as his tagalong pal Plato (Sal Mineo) tries to warn him, it's no use.""It's hard to make friends with these guys,"" Plato says.""I don't want to make friends,"" Jim answers, looking cool but sounding uncertain.The only lead role Dean ever played that didn't get him an Oscar nomination, only because he was competing against himself in ""East Of Eden,"" Jim in ""Rebel"" is who people think of when they think of Dean. Properly, too; he's riveting and believable here, playing a tough part with casual bemusement and a sensitivity to the moment that one gets only rarely from more seasoned screen performers.One oddity about ""Rebel"" is its place in the pantheon of juvenile delinquent films. It doesn't play like one. How unusual is it to see a movie where a youth openly resents his parents for not being firmer with him, and walks away from a fight? There are episodes of violence and danger, but how many other films feature knife-fights where the principals agree to stop before someone gets hurt?""Rebel's"" strongest scene takes place at the Griffith Observatory, where a wizened lecturer tells these young people they live in a cosmos marked only by ""the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise."" Poor Plato is so overcome by existential dread that he cowers under the seats, to be coaxed up by Jim in a moment that crystallizes their friendship. It's a movie about kids finding their way in an institution, but also about people struggling to shape themselves in a larger world that shows no signs of caring.In that way, and in others, too, ""Rebel"" rises above the standards of its day. There are some serious script problems. Irving Schulman and Stewart Stern get too stuck on the dime-store Freud of their time; that kids' emotional problems can be pegged on distant parents. A police detective played by Edward Platt dispenses wisdom with disconcerting ease: I groan when Jim confesses after one such analysis ""I bet you see right through me, don't you?"" Poor Natalie has to deliver lines like ""Yes...no...I don't know,"" while Dean's most famous line, ""You're tearing me apart,"" is something better seen than heard.But even amid such clunky moments, the acting is good. Wood shifts believably from Daddy's cloying little girl to angry gang moll (""Are you always at ringside?"" Jim teases her at one early moment), while Mineo raises the bar in his every scene with his unaffected need for love and attention. Dean delivers a powerful central performance, combining recognizable Brando-esque mannerisms with some off-beat line readings worthy of Robert Mitchum. You have to wonder what the future would have held for him if he only wore a seat belt.Nicholas Ray does a powerhouse job as director balancing the need for domestic realism with fluid pacing and an operatic quality aided by garishly effective WarnerColor and a killer Leonard Rosenman score. It's a quintessential 1950s movie, like others here say. The supporting players are dialed in, from a surprisingly conflicted Allen to Jim Backus's desperately ingratiating father to Jim. One reason Dean gives such a great performance is because, for so much of the film, he has Backus' flustered pop to play off of.Making a point that life matters even if no one cares, ""Rebel"" stands as a lasting achievement as well as a memorial to one (as the movie would argue, of many) who died too young.",Rebel Without a Cause
68,ShootingShark,Classic Fifties Youth Drama Starring The Immortal James Dean,6,25 May 2010,"Jim Stark has problems. He doesn't get on with his folks. He's in trouble with the law. He's just moved to a new town and doesn't know anybody. Worst of all, he has the hots for the girl next door. What's he gotta do to be a stand up guy ?James Dean is a hard man to critique. On one hand he may be one of the greatest actors of all time, with iconographic good looks and a smouldering style that influenced a whole generation of movie stars and tough guys. On the other, he only made three movies, at least one of which is kinda dull and he plays a very similar part in all of them. This is his best film and best performance I think, and the imagery of him in his red jacket and jeans, tooling around town in a 1949 Mercury Coupe is pretty unforgettable. He's just Mr Cool, ain't no doubt about it. And although the film personifies the fifties juvenile delinquent era (along with the less wholesome The Cool And The Crazy), its themes and drama are still as potent as ever today. For me, it's a movie all about fathers and failing relationships with their children. Jim wishes his Dad had more resolve, Judy's Dad is too embarrassed to talk to her about her developing sexuality, and Plato simply wants to have a Dad who loves him. The only adult who attempts to understand the kids is Ray the cop. Jim is hotheaded enough to get into trouble whenever someone calls him a chicken, but also mature enough to realise that kind of macho lifestyle isn't really worth a damn. But when he asks his Dad about it he never gets a straight answer. This would make a good strange double bill with Alien, which in a weird way is all about mothers and motherhood. The film is thoughtful and honest about families and the social pressures of youth, and the cast are all very good. Wood (who was only seventeen) is the classic girl next door, and Mineo (sixteen) as the deeply troubled Plato, in many ways steals the movie from Dean with his edgy, homoerotic, little boy lost performance. The well-known sequence where the three of them hide out in the big abandoned house is lyrical and haunting, not least because all three talented actors subsequently met with violent deaths at much too young an age; Dean was already dead before the movie opened. Featuring a nice loud score by Leonard Rosenman and sharp photography throughout by Ernest Haller (despite Dean trying to jump out of the frame all the time). Ray was a talented and socially conscious director who, along with contemporaries like Sam Fuller and Don Siegel, made a lot of good films in the fifties and sixties (check out In A Lonely Place and Johnny Guitar). Written by Stewart Stern and Irving Shulman, from an original story by Ray. Although Rebel was preceded by a few youth-gone-wild pictures (The Wild One, The Blackboard Jungle), it's pretty much the model for every teen angst film since, from To Sir, With Love to The Breakfast Club to Heathers. At the time it was quite the phenomenon and the passing decades have done nothing to detract from its dramatic impact.",Rebel Without a Cause
69,Movie-ManDan,"""You're Tearing Me Apart!!""",9,20 February 2015,"Rebel Without A Cause is James Dean's most iconic role. His red windbreaker from this has become a Hollywood trademark. Despite this being his best role, it was the only movie he did were he did not win (or was nominated for) an Oscar. He may have only done three movies (this, Giant, East of Eden) but still.I consider James Dean to be the Buddy Holly of film. Buddy Holly was big for two and a half years before his death and has since become an immortal figure in pop culture. James Dean is parallel to him, except Dean did three movies all released in 1955. James Dean is one of the best known members of the Actors Studio training under Lee Strasberg who revolutionized method acting. Method acting is one of the best acting techniques to use, and good thing Dean used it for his three films. Dean's performance as frustrated teenager, Jim Stark, is so raw and natural. There's nothing artificial with Dean.Dean plays high school a kid who has constantly moved from town to town with his parents. He is confused, out of control, and frustrated. He gets himself involved with the wrong people and wins a deadly car racing bet against them. He goes in hiding with two other frustrated teens (Wood, Minero) where they grow close and learn about themselves. This lat bit with them in hiding is dragged out and uninteresting. That is why I'm not giving a perfect score. Everything before hand was fresh, exciting, well-acted, then it just falls. Luckily, it does not ruin the whole picture.3.5/4",Rebel Without a Cause

Nonetheless James Dean imprints himself on viewers from the word go with movement and facial expression, which seem way ahead of his time. Capable of selling even the most corny lines with some pizazz it is no wonder why the actor gained such cult status given his measly amount of film credits. The beginning of the movie seems also infinitely better scripted and acted by the whole crew, while Jim's and Ray's first encounter is absolutely riveting stuff. Nonetheless the mood of the movie quickly dissipates into cardboard characterisation, implausibilities (pronouncing love after several hours of a relationship) and idiosyncrasies, which make it hard for you to really accept the movie as groundbreaking or meaningful. In the end it feels well-meant, but badly written.The whole Plato character (Sal Mineo) - a rich kid, who hardly has contact with either parents, incessantly feels as if poorly portrayed and scripted. Given he is key to the drama of the final third of the movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"" fails to keep up the tone set out in the first act. The whole rebellion thing is covered by a very thin layer of build-up, making it an initially well-thought out concept, but one that fails to make a sale.

As with all of the era's juvenile delinquent pictures, it has not aged especially well, but succeeds at depicting an impotent malaise creeping through the social structure, and does more with suggestions and undertones than the film's more explicit brands of melodrama intended to ignite the screen. The young actors do respectable work, and although his mannerisms are more clearly indebted to Marlon Brando here than in any of his other performances, Dean's shifty, internally expressive traits were never better suited for a role than here.

73,tomsview,Tragic trio,8,7 October 2016,"Over the decades we have seen emotionally disturbed youths in drama after drama in film and on TV, but this has to be the daddy of them all.The three main characters Jim (James Dean), Judy (Natalie wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo) feel like outsiders. Alienated not only from their parents but also from their teenage peers. What a trio. Those of us who were around when this film was released have followed their careers until the end – a sad one in each case.All three were beautiful; the camera simply ate them up. Natalie and Sal seemed the most natural while James Dean was coming from a whole different place. Would anyone get away with a performance like that these days? In some scenes, as he looks up from under hooded brows, it seems as though his hair is too heavy for his head. He's so intense and tortured it's as though Hamlet and Richard the III were rolled into one. He exited the world far too early, but he left an impression; his image is imbedded forever in this iconic movie.Director Nicholas Ray got into the heads of the three young stars. It was almost too much. He was older (44). All the subtext in the relationship between Jim, Judy and Plato grew from Ray's influence. Dean was the eldest at 24, but Natalie Wood was barely 17, and Ray was having an affair with her – unbelievable. Mineo was only 16. Heavy stuff for these guys and it shows on the screen. The other characters seem superficial alongside the force field of this tragic trio. Books are still being written about them and the movie. In a recent biography, ""Sal"", author Michael Gregg Michaud reveals the intensity of the drama in front of, and behind the camera.Despite its place in cinema history, it dated quickly. The 60's would be the decade of youth in revolt like never before. Of the two surviving stars, Natalie Wood would move on and grow. What she brought to her performance as Judy reached full flower a few years later in her stunning performance as Deanie in ""Splendour in the Grass"", but she was never typecast and always luminous.Mineo on the other hand could never really shake off Plato, the perennial juvenile delinquent. He was as typecast by this film as Anthony Perkins was by ""Psycho"".

74,wisewebwoman,Just so far ahead of its time....,9,7 December 2004,"This film bears watching once every 5 years or so. It is astonishing on many levels, not least of which is the exploration of the underbelly of the happy suburban post-war years in middle class America.Yes, we all rave about the beautiful and sadly short lived life of James Dean who died before this movie opened. To die also in a manner highlit in this movie - he was co-incidentally a promo for it. Fast driving and fast cars. Poor James.What I enjoy most though in all of it is the afore-mentioned exploration of hitherto fairly underdeveloped film themes in the America of the fifties. For one, there is the underlying homosexual element to the Sal Mineo character and his obsession with James. And here James is allowed to indulge and return this love, not overtly, but it is there, the tolerance and acknowledgment of it.The character of Judy, played by Natalie Wood is also of tremendous interest. Here there is an incestuous component in her relationship to her father. It seems to me that the father is terrified of his attraction to his gorgeous daughter and keeps pushing her away to the degree that at one point he slaps her as she tries to kiss him. She escapes from home at every chance seeking male attention from wherever she can get it.James' parents are a little overblown and too quickly resolved at the end. But the appearance of an ""emasculated"" Jim Backus (he wears an apron in case we don't quite get it!) is a sight for sore eyes.

75,sme_no_densetsu,"""You're tearing me apart!""",8,30 May 2009,"Like any film that strives to be current, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" has inevitably become dated since its release over fifty years ago. Therefore, you have to make allowances for this and take it in the context of its time. Those willing to do so will recognize the film as a substantial offering, especially for a film about young people.Certain aspects of the plot may be dated but the emotions are timeless. Each of the teens is looking for something different from their parents. Jim is hounded by the question of what it takes to be a man but gets no help from his hen-pecked father. Judy justifiably feels unloved due to her father's suddenly frigid demeanor. Plato, meanwhile, doesn't even have his parents around at all, therefore he feels lonely and abandoned. These problems (and a multitude of others) haven't vanished in the time since this film was released.The direction by Nicholas Ray brings this story to life and shows some interesting touches along the way. The opening credits with Jim drunkenly messing around with a toy monkey is just one memorable scene. The 'chickie run' scene is perhaps the film's most memorable set-piece.The movie also benefits from a legendary performance from James Dean, who didn't even live long enough to see the film hit theatres. His performance here is angst-ridden and filled with nuance. Perhaps his best scene is the one in which he confronts his parents when he returns from the chicken run. Puzzlingly, though, he never got an Oscar nomination while both Mineo & Wood did. Mineo was certainly deserving but to me Wood's performance was nothing particularly special. Also notable was Jim Backus who turned in a fine performance as Jim's father.The film contains a wealth of deeper meaning and, depending on who you ask, possibly some taboo-defying sexual undertones. After seeing the film a few times I'm no longer so sure about the supposed homosexual subtext of Jim & Plato's friendship; that may be more of a by-product of their respective issues stemming from missing or ineffective father figures. Judy's relationship to her father is also not without sexual undertones but, again, this may be a by-product of the issue at hand; that is, her father's lack of overt affection as she blossoms into maturity. Regardless of whether or not any of this was the intent of the film-makers they were nevertheless daring to present such provocative material while the production code was still in effect.All in all, a fine film that is deservedly lauded as a classic decades later.

76,frankde-jong,A monumental document of its time,7,31 May 2021,"""Rebel without a cause"" is an influential film. It is the James Dean movie (one of the few) in which the character he plays is perhaps most in line with his real personality. James Dean was, together with Marlon Brando and Elvis Presley, the icon who represented the teenagers of the 50's. A generation who felt misunderstood, although objectively they had no reason to complain in the welfare state that was arising in the aftermath of World War II. In other words they were rebels without a cause.If we dispense with the historical context, it must be said that technically speaking ""Rebels without a cause"" has its flaws. In one scene the tire of the car of Jim Stark (James Dean) gets punctured, the next moment he is riding in it without any problem. When the boyfriend of Judy (Natalie Wood) dies, her emotional recovery is unbelievably fast.""Rebels without a cause"" is about the interaction of teenagers among each other and about the interaction of teenagers with their parents. The interaction among each other has great similarities with ""Westside story"" (1961, Robert Wise). Admittedly there are no two gangs of different nationality, but just one gang whose leader becomes nervous when there is a new kid on the block. All the other elements (jealousy about a girl, a deadly incident, a hunt for the presumed perpetrator) are however there in a slightly different order.When it comes to the interaction with the parents ""Rebel without a cause"" is a totally different story. In ""Westside story"" adults are almost completely absent. In ""Rebel without a cause"" they are essential. In ""East of Eden"" (1955, Elia Kazan) the James Dean character had a father that was too strict. In ""Rebel without a cause"" on the other hand the father of Jim Stark is much too accommodating, leaving Jim without a role model. In one scene the father is ridiculed wearing a monstrous kitchen apron.At different points the film hints at (but not explicitly states) the discomfort the 50's had with sexuality. See the uneasiness the father of Judy has with her kisses now that she is not a little girl anymore. See also the character of Plato by whom modern audiences would have no trouble discovering a homoerotic attraction to Jim Stark. Acoording to Roger Ebert the film ""Rebel without a cause"" is just as confused as its main character Jim Stark. He is probably right.",Rebel Without a Cause

How teens are so desperate to fit in with each other, and how quickly one reacts when they don't fit in with each other (Watch what Natalie Wood does after the race and what Sal Mineo does when Dean and Wood leaves him for a second), There's also the motif of fitting in with parents as well. Some are confused as to how to parent a child, others don't want to parent anymore (without them realizing it, but the children do), and others have abandoned them. Many different layers start appearing.

Might seem hokey today, but in 1955 teenagers who had problems to deal with hadn't occupied much screen time up until here.In Rebel, Dean is the personification of the estranged teenager. Having problems adjusting, gaining friends and respect issues with his doormat father, Dean exploded to a generation of young filmgoers who immediately identified with him and his situation. While actually just playing himself to some extent, Dean is incredibly forceful in his performance. Tough, mean and humble with an earnestness which feels all to real, it's not hard to see why he became the legend he did. Whether or not Dean would have maintained his immortal status (probably not) had he lived longer, his Jim Stark remains the ultimate teen figure in movie history. As for the film itself, it's very powerful. Depicting a reality many people hadn't realized existed, the film had a point then that's still valid today. All performances are good, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo excellent as Dean's girlfriend and buddy and Nicholas Ray's direction is on the mark. Quite the eye candy this movie is.

82,The_Movie_Cat,"""Ah, ha ha ha, drown them like puppies - ha!""",7,19 August 2000,"If only for giving a 100% accurate, pitch-perfect impersonation of Mr.Magoo should James Dean go down in history. That's the highlight of his performance in this film, one of the most overrated of all cinema.In 1955 Dean became less a Rebel Without A Cause, more a Ham Without A Reason. Laying down some of the most painful overacting ever captured on celluloid, Dean, 24, and looking 35, plays a juvenile delinquent. Badly. (Though it's worth noting how many of Dean's affected mannerisms seem to have been absorbed into Brad Pitt's performances). His family include a creepy, apron wearing father (Jim Backus, the real voice of Magoo) who claims that during his schooldays he ""couldn't swallow until recess""(!) and a hen-pecking mother.Dean is likeable, however, despite his performance, proving he's more icon than actor. The film's storyline is also engaging, and daring. It takes in themes of knife fights, clifftop car crashes and homosexuality, a rarity for cinema of the age. Six years before Dirk Bogarde was to play an openly gay character in ""Victim"", Sal Mineo appears as Plato. Despite his claims that he looks upon Dean as a father figure, his constant loving gazes, radio requests and his near-attempt to kiss the older man in the Planetarium show that the character had sexual feelings for Dean without it being directly spelt out. This does have odd consequences, however; the film's makers seemingly implying that homosexuality is some form of psychological disease or social dysfunction. Plato is turning gay without a father to guide him; Dean is turning into a hoodlum because his father is too effeminate to guide him.What really fascinates is that the character (called Jim Stark, incidentally, though it's really always Dean) is essentially likeable, and decent. His naive, almost childlike need to be liked, and understood, is quite endearing. Look at the scene where two youths - watching Zodiac signs at a Planetarium - impersonate Cancer the Crab. Amused, Dean joins in with Taurus the Bull - only to look genuinely hurt when his efforts are met with derision.In fairness, most of the faults of this film aren't Dean's as such. The forced, melodramatic style is something the whole cast indulge in, and is symptomatic of the time that it was made. Dean's arguments with his parents are like amateur dramatics night, a skewiff camera angle adding little of the required tension, while Natalie Wood as Judy is similarly cringe inducing. Dean shares two on-screen kisses with her, the first of which is so chaste and old-fashioned I thought he'd fallen asleep.Some of the dialogue is lame - ""I got my car, you wanna go with me?"" ""I go with the kids""/""You know, I bet you're a real yo-yo"" - but most of the time it is reasonably well observed, and certainly above average. It might not have the best actors in the world, but its star's undeniable charisma anchors this film to moments of scant psychology that make this an interesting, and ultimately rewarding, experience.",Rebel Without a Cause
83,gab-14712,A Very Early Look Inside The Teenager's Mind!,9,30 April 2020,"1955's Rebel Without a Cause is a remarkably interesting movie. This movie has received plenty of hype due to James Dean's ultra-cool image. The movie has more than its looks going for it. It is a story that any teenager can relate to. The story of the rebellious child. We have all been there and done that. This is one of the earliest films to accurately portray what teenagers go through during this phase in life. Sure, life may have been different in 1955 than 2005, but I understand the thoughts and actions portrayed on screen.The characterization is what makes this film stand the test of time. Director Nicholas Ray and screenwriter Stewart Stern understand their characters very well, and so did the actors. The main character, Jim appears tough on the outside and fits the ""cool"" image from the 1950's. But in his interior, he has an exceptionally soft heart. There is violent and lonely Plato. All he needs and wants is a friend in his life. Finally, there is Judy. Judy hangs with the cool kids because all she wants to do is fit in, no matter her personality. To those who attended school at any point in time, doesn't these traits sound familiar? As a 21st century schoolkid, they certainly do. So, the themes here are timeless. The film received mixed reviews back in the day because society believed that ""juvenile delinquency"" was rampant. This movie suggests, in a positive way, that therapy could be helpful for kids and parents may not always be there the way they should for their kid (and I am not talking about abuse, but perhaps lack of communication).The film does have some tragedy to its name. James Dean was going to be a huge star. He previously starred in East of Eden and his 1956 film was Giant. These three films were the only films he made. About a month prior to this film's release, Dean was in a very unfortunate car accident that cost him his life. It was a tragedy for the young star, but it gave his posthumous film more publicity. People think about that accident when they think about this film it seems. Dean was an extraordinarily talented actor and he proves it here depicting teenage angst in an accurate way.Jim Stark (James Dean) is a troubled teenager. He recently moved to a new town with his weak father, Frank (Jim Backus) and his overbearing mother, Carol (Ann Doran) because of his troubles. It looks like they would continue when he is picked up in the street for drunkenness. At his new school, he meets a group of people including his new enemy, Buzz. Buzz dares him to a game of chicken which results in stolen cars and loss of life. Along with his new friend, Plato (Sal Mineo) and his new romantic interest, Judy (Natalie Wood), they must avoid the police and the goons who believe they would tattle to the police.I thought all the performances were good, especially for James Dean. It was tragic he lost his life at such a young age because he had a big career ahead of him. He really captured how tough youth can be...especially when lost. In the police station, after his parents were called in and they started arguing, Dean finally broke down with that big quote, ""I can't take it anymore."" That performance tortured my poor soul. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo did very well in their respective roles. When it came to the personalities of their characters, they were spot on. Credit is due to the actors playing the parents. It was hard to watch Jim Backus portray the father, but it shows that not all fathers are strong, hard-willed men as seen in most films. There were also some sexual thoughts in the air. Judy kissed her father on the lips, so I thought that was something interesting, and once again a realistic thought.Nicholas Ray did an extraordinary job directing Rebel Without a Cause. People back in the day shrugged the movie off, but he actually made his characters extremely relatable. His style choices also paid off including the color of Jim's jacket. While not the most perfect movie (outdated lines of dialogue), I was hooked because of these relatable characters and their chemistry. Filmed in Cinemascope, the film has a sleek, ""cool"" look to it. Its one of the early movies to study the mind of these teenagers.My Grade: A-",Rebel Without a Cause

Sal Mineo is straining at the leash with his love for James Dean. Equally James Dean is doing all he can to avoid showing his affection for Sal. Feel a bit sorry for Natalie Wood as it is quite obvious that she is totally out of it, a mere ornament, and she knows it. But of course in the 1950's when this picture was made anything openly gay was worse than treason. Only have to do some internet research to discover that in real life both Sal and James were gays and the body language of them both in this film is further proof of it. Sal is far prettier than anyone else in the picture! This film is not bad though dated and somewhat nonsensical especially as apart from Sal who looks the part of a 16 year old the other main players look and behave far too old for the mid teenagers they are meant to be portraying. 5/10",Rebel Without a Cause

87,jem132,My pick for Nick Ray's best film,10,21 December 2008,"This film resonated with me hugely as a young teenager, so I was wondering how I would find it a few years on. While I'm hardly over the hill yet (hello, the big 2-0!), I have grown up, faced and overcome a few of life's issues. The good news is ""Rebel"" hasn't dated one bit. It's a stunning masterpiece from Nicholas Ray-- maybe his best film? From the simple yet brilliantly constructed opening sequence that seamlessly introduces and connects the fate of the three central protagonists, Ray never misses a beat. Ray deals with some really interesting, universal themes here. It's not just a film for angsty teens, it's for everyone. It deals with loneliness, the family unit, challenged masculinity (the ineffectual father who wears the apron)and suggests deep underlying problems in the picture-perfect 50's household (Ray would explore this further in ""Bigger Than Life""). Ultimately it's the realization that parents don't hold all the answers that makes the film so poignant to me. We are all just human beings.No-one used 'Scope better than Nicholas Ray, and his compositions show the possibilities of space and framing. James Dean's heightened emotionalism, acting with his hands and contortions of his body, is mesmerising. Some may call Natalie Wood's first scene exaggerated and over-acted, but she gives a perfect portrayal of a how a teenage girl dramatises everything. And it is important to her.The film has never been more relevant- we are very much looking for sincerity in this new ""Atomic age!"".",Rebel Without a Cause
88,FilmOtaku,A classic drama that isn't just teen angst,7,26 July 2003,"It's so hard to review classic films like Rebel Without a Cause because there isn't anything new that I can say about it that will effectively contribute to my predecessor's observations, and I don't want to insult anyone's intelligence by attempting to do so.Having said that, I viewed Rebel Without a Cause a couple of days ago for what was probably the 20th time and I came away with an interesting perspective.  In film school, I took a class called `Film of the Fifties', and our final thesis was a comparison of two of the films we had viewed during the semester.  After a lot of thought and a lot of coffee, I finally decided to wax philosophic for sixty pages double spaced on the similarities between Rebel Without a Cause and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  The more I got into it, the more I found to compare:  isolationism, conformity, you name it, I found it.  I watched Rebel Without a Cause about 10 times to get quotes, themes, nuances, etc.Eleven years later I'm thirty and sitting down to watch it again as background noise while I do some work, and I find myself riveted again because I suddenly had a different perspective.  When I was 19, I was all about the teen angst angle and essentially discounted Dean's parents as ineffective and just plain wrong in their handling of their son.  While I still agree with that perspective, I also noticed things I didn't when I was basically an inexperienced adolescent.  Most notably, I was struck by the relationship between the mother and her mother in law.  Every attempt she made to `mother' her son, she was shot down and criticized by this woman  a plot point that apparently skipped right past me, probably because I hadn't dealt with that yet.  (Not having been married yet, I still haven't experienced an `evil mother in law' but I've had my share of interesting encounters with various boyfriends' mothers, and it is challenging.  I saw this struggle in the mother, and suddenly she wasn't such an unsympathetic character anymore.  The same can be said about the father, who is still extremely ineffectual, but admittedly has enough character development to explain some of his conduct.  These are only two examples out of several that I noticed, but it made me realize that there are probably a lot of films that I should watch again to see how my perspective may or may not change.  Granted, this sometimes can turn around and bite you in the ass  case in point, I dragged my father (and probably mother and other relatives) to see the film `Xanadu' about 5 times when I was about 9 years old.  A couple of years ago I picked up the VHS at a local library book sale and watched it again and was promptly horrified, so I guess I will stick to films that have *some* merit before I decide to revisit them.--Shelly",Rebel Without a Cause

THE NAKED CITY, BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, MARTY, EAST OF EDEN, etc.). Stewart Stern's coy script may seem a little dated now, but the drama still resonates with modern audiences, and there's a wealth of surprising subplots and subtexts, including Natalie Wood's impressive turn as an immature teenager who feels rejected by her father (William Hopper) because he refuses to indulge the kind of affections he lavished on her as a child, and Sal Mineo as the brittle interloper who keeps a picture of Alan Ladd in his school locker and develops an obvious crush on the dazzling new boy, played by Dean. A formidable young talent, Dean's signature red jacket affords him a visual prominence over his fellow actors, and he gauges the emotional honesty of each sequence with uncanny precision. Director Ray uses the scope frame in a wholly expressive manner, dividing his characters across the length and breadth of the panoramic screen and tilting the image at crucial dramatic moments.

This proves to be a futile hope as things slide from bad to worse one fateful night.Despite the sometimes over-the-top script and acting, there is something very special about James Dean on screen. However three films are not enough to judge him as an actor. Two of which are basically the same part.Acting wise he was very Brando-lite, but more than that he had the vulnerable look and the fashion haircut. Not tall - barely 5'6 - but well proportioned and without an once of fat. A fashion trend-setter. The red jacket he wears here is worth several times his salary for making the film.Sadly Dean's role as the world's ""first teenager"" is rather spoilt by the fact that he is - in fact - 24. Not even a particularly young looking 24 at that! Strangely co-star Natalie Wood (Judy Hopper) is closer to the real age of her teenage character and yet - side by side - they look of a similar age. Her ""middle aged"" bomb-proof hairstyle making her look older than her years.Best acting is actually Sal Mineo (Plato) as the homosexual hanger-on and social misfit, fresh from a psychiatrist's couch.

93,elvircorhodzic,"""I don't know what to do anymore. Except maybe die.""",9,3 December 2016,"REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is a violent and disturbing melodrama. The main protagonists are lonely teenagers from the middle class who can not adapt to social norms. They express, in various ways, their frustrations through irresponsible and anti-social behavior. This is one of the first films, which are faced with issues relating to juvenile delinquency, the generation gap (the relationship between parents and children) and rebellious nature. In this film, children are neglected by their parents and guardians, which leads to a different understanding of certain moral values. Young people are left on their own and with a dose of a strange sarcasm create their own world. This is not just a fight against the system and prejudices, but the fight against the myth of the perfect son or daughter. Roughly speaking, this movie shows juvenile dissatisfaction faced with the bourgeois family mentality. The revolt, which arises from the above, leading to the tragic denouement, but through its protagonists mature and go through the raw life experience.I'm thrilled with the violent atmosphere in the film, which has different effects on the protagonists. Characterization is very good. It is subtle and emotionally strong. For this reason, in particular scenes we see the disgusting, melancholic and poignant details at the same time. There are some excruciating flashes of accuracy and truth in this film.James Dean as Jim Stark is lonely and alienated. He is a mixed-up rebel because his father lacks decisiveness and strength and he expressed dissatisfaction during the conflict in which he is forced to participate. Mentally maladjusted protagonist, who comes into conflict with the environment. His parents constantly running away from responsibility. Slicked hair, cynical laughter and a dreamy look. This is Jim Stark. The young Rebel who embodies all the fears and ideals of an average teenager.Natalie Wood as Judy is wild and sadistic, prone to run with surly juveniles because her worrisome father stopped ""kissing"" her. Maybe this is a veiled hint of the Electra complex. The girl next door can indeed be a fiery delinquent. Ms. Wood had a rebellious beauty.Sal Mineo as John ""Plato"" Crawford is the most complex character. He is a thoroughly lost and hero-searching lad because his parents have left him. The boy who was alone in his thoughts and constantly inventing stories to get close to people. His crime is symbolic.This trio at one point creates a playful, warm and caring family version.

All I can say about what Nicholas Ray achieved in this film that he created a dystopian parallel world where all teenagers are completely devastated because of their dysfunctional families. But you can almost completely relate to all the characters, and that's because Ray used the stereotypical forms to make how his teenager characters look on the surface. For instance, you can see how they bully each other in the most typical way, and that's why when you will reach the end of the first act, you might think that some things and some small details haven't aged well in this movie, while it's not exactly the case. In fact, when you finish watching this movie you may think that it's actually ahead of its time!The major three characters have motivations that were, and still, unprecedented. Above that, they are three-dimensional characters, and fully fleshed-out that can be studied. Of course, Stewart Stern's screenplay is one of the main reasons for bringing these characters to life. He gave them some incredible lines that should be described as jaw-dropping, to say the least! Because my jaw literally dropped every time Jim Stark try to interact with his father, not to mention a couple other times. have kept repeating: THIS IS GENIUS! The adult characters are intentionally dull to serve the movie's plot, but that doesn't mean that the actors who portray them should give a dull performances. I really found almost every actor/actress' acting who play the dad or mom is very poor and monotonous, despite how great their characters are written. Also, the editing in this movie could be the worst editing I've ever seen in film. The jump-cuts between one scene to another are unbelievably terrible. You have to see it to believe how bad is it!Rebel Without a Cause will never age because it doesn't present the '50s juvenile attitude per se, but instead it shows us how the juvenile would behave if their parents' issues have a great, and more dangerous effect on them.(8.5/10)",Rebel Without a Cause
95,davidcarniglia,"""Why Do We Do This?""",10,31 March 2021,"More than a prescient movie about teen angst, Rebel Without A Cause pretty much takes a look at the human condition. James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo are more or less thrown together as misfits who seem to understand each other. On the other hand, the antagonists, Buzz (Corey Allen) and his buddies, aren't so different from them. In fact, Judy (Wood) begins the movie as Buzz's girlfriend.After the planetarium visit, the simulated apocalypse of the universe begins to play out on among the outcasts of the teen world. Since the universe can't take of itself, what's the point of pretending that existence has rules or meaning? So, there's the completely pointless knife fight. Buzz and Jim (Dean) aren't even fighting over Judy. Among many ironies, Jim and Buzz drop all the posing, and automatically earn each other's respect--by agreeing to the daredevil 'chicken' race. How desperately do we want to give Buzz just a few more seconds to untangle himself from the door handle, so that he too can escape from the car? Nevermind that somebody has stolen two cars and wrecked them in a macho contest. At that point when the cars go off the cliff, there's no good or bad guys--it's just us.In a way, the lack of order in this view of society is shown by the general weakness and/or falseness of authority. Among the parents and police officers, only Detective Frenick (Edward Platt) and Plato's care-provider seem to know how to talk to the young people with care and respect. The only personal touch from Plato's parents is a check. Since Jim has alienated Buzz's friends by his complicity in that guy's death (ironically, again, as it was Buzz who insisted on the 'chicken' race), the exuberant prelude to the race has become a deadly game once again.The decrepit mansion scenes are bizarre. There's the ersatz game of Jim, Judy, and Plato playing family; this is harmless, goofy stuff. But the goons are closing in on them. Plato turns the tables by resorting to murder; again, one hopes for a more mundane outcome. Why can't the two sets of misfits just rage at each other drink some beer and eke out some redemption? The actual ending has fate throw another wrench into the works; Plato, aping Jim with his loud red jacket, can't navigate his way out of the planetarium without getting shot.Whatever sense of teen innocence the movie allows starts eroding right after the school field trip to the planetarium. Very quickly we tumble from the Buzz/Jim rivalry to Buzz dying, to Plato killing and being killed. For once, it's a relief to have a wish-fulfilling final scene, as Jim's dad (Jim Backus) gets smart and says all the right things. Except for some momentary glimpses of joy, however, Rebel Without A Cause is made of unrelenting darkness.The frantic pacing seems to give little chance for reflection. Indeed, we start off at a low point; with all the 'good guys' at the police station, their unhelpful parents stirring the pot. Despite the depth of feeling among Jim, Judy, and Plato, there's not much romance: no dances, dates, football games. We go from one peek at high school to knife fights, daredevil racing, and shootouts.This is as much a crime drama and psychological thriller as it is social commentary. What's amazing is that Rebel Without A Cause succeeds on every level. Completely engrossing; very well-made.",Rebel Without a Cause

Dean, who's second-last film role this would be, seems very casual about his role and smoothly slides through the film yet giving a very solid performance.  Overall, the acting in this film was quite uncommonly good for the genre, and several of the ""kids"" in the popular-kid gang later grew into successful actors.  It's kinda amazing seeing a young Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams in pretty quick supporting roles.  Neither of them has much in the way of dialog, but their presence alone kept me awake.The story on a whole still seems pretty pertinent today, though I wasn't fooled for a minute into thinking these 20-30 year old were High School students.  The scenario of a new kid not fitting in at his new school is something most of us have had to deal with at one point or another, but Dean's journey in this film seems particularly rough.  The first day at school, not only does he get cut up in a knife fight, but accidentally kills another kid he gets in a car rivalry with.About the only thing that severely dates this film is the dialog and the situations.  Modern audiences have trouble swallowing lines like a guy telling another guy ""I really like you"" out of no where.  Back then audiences were not quite as likely to equate such behaivior with homosexuality.  A lot of the lines muttered by Sal Mineo's character are downright embarrassing to hear as he tells two complete strangers that they are like the family he never had.  The relationships all move way too quickly for one to take seriously, and hence the film seems more hokey and not as realistic.

But I just notice that I never see Rebel Without a Cause or any of James Dean's movies and this is my first movie I've seen him in and a great one to start on.Now James Dean at the time was a rising star with the couple of movies that he was in, everybody sawed a bright future in him and even I sawed that while watching this movie, but sadly James Dean died in a vehicle accident back in 1955 meaning that this and the movie Giant was his last role. Before seeing the movie I've heard nothing but amazing things about James Dean of how he could have been the next Marlon Brando and now his known as a icon to actors out there and how every actor said out loud that they wanted to be like him. Now after seeing the movie the only thing I can say is oh my god this was a true tragically that this guy is dead I mean gone too soon because his acting in this movie is some of the best I've seen since Marlon Brando. What makes it more tragic is that he could have been in more movie roles that was even more amazing or just off the walls brilliant, now thinking about that makes me kind of sad. I can't wait to watch his other movies but for now rest in peace James you were one of a guy.The directing from Nicholas Ray was truly brilliant and this is the first film I've seen from this Nicholas and just like what I said about James Dean, I can't wait to check out Nicholas Ray other movies because he directed the hell out of this movie and effort was shown pretty well. The chemistry between Dean's character and everyone else (Besides the bullies) I bough into just be the first word of ""Hi"" because the writing may come off cheesy and a bit dated but let's not forget this is set and filmed in the 50's so yeah you can't really fault the movie for that, it's like criticizing a 1920's for being too black and white. But anywhere I thought the writing was pretty cute at times and I won't I repeated some of the lines in my head.For problems with the movie I don't really have any to be honest. The acting, the directing and the character's was so good that I watch the movie trying to find problems but couldn't find any may be it's because it's James Dean, I don't know about that guy but these something about him that I have a bit of man crush on him, nothing sexual here it's just a thing called bromance.Overall Rebel Without a Cause is a true 50's classic movie with excellent performances and great directing by Nicholas Ray.",Rebel Without a Cause
100,moviemanMA,Don't call me chicken...,10,17 December 2005,"The teenage years are a confusing time for anyone. You start to act different, think different, and realize that you are growing up and there is nothing you can do about it. For Jim Stark this is more than he can handle.Nicholas Ray's classic Rebel Without a Cause is a look into the life of Jim Stark (James Dean) and his attempt to try and figure out what he wants to do with his life. Should he try to become an adult or should he enjoy what little time he has left and cut loose?The movie opens with Jim after he has had a few too many drinks. After being taken to the police station his parents are brought in to help find out what he did and why he did it. His parents (Jim Backus and Ann Doran) are torn over what to do with him. The father is understanding but the mother wants him to learn his lesson and make sure it does not happen again. Their fighting is ""tearing him apart!"".Also at the station is Judy (Natalie Wood) and John ""Plato"" Crawford (Sal Mineo). Jim offers his coat to Plato but he refuses. It was just a kind gesture, but given Plato's emotional state, it is a justified response.The next day is Jim's first day at his new school. He leaves the house in a good mood, telling his parents how this might be it for him. After meeting Judy, who appears to be unfazed by the incident she had in the police station, Jim is off to school where he learns of a field trip for that afternoon to the planetarium.It is hear where he encounters Buzz, the leader of the ""cool"" crowd. After slashing Jim's tires, it's ""examination time"", or a little knife fight. No jabbing, just sticking. Jim almost loses it but keeps his cool. Buzz challenges Jim to a ""chicee race"" at the bluffs. Jim accepts having no idea what that is.The events that follow are like a wild goose chase for Jim and his new friends. They go everywhere from the bluffs, to an abandoned mansion, and the planetarium. It's a wonderfully written script using great dialogue between Jim and his parents. The camera work is also a magnificent display, using great angles and unique shots. Ray had the perfect vision of what he wanted his film to look like.Color is often used to showcase significance or symbolize a certain aspect of the film. Jim's red jacket, Judy's red coat in the beginning, and Buzz and all his cronies where black leather coats.Dean's performance is remarkable. It is a shame he was only featured in 3 films, none the less, he is one of America's icons. He symbolizes what every guy wants to be. He is not the only good performer. Backus gives a tremendous performance as the father, the understanding, somewhat lenient parent of Jim Stark. Wood and Mineo both received Oscar nominations and both were well deserved.As mentioned earlier, these are the most confusing years for a teenager. One scene that says it perfectly is after the knife incident when Jim comes home. He walks up the stairs to find what appears to be his mother in an apron cleaning up. It turns out to be his father cleaning up the food he spilled for his wife who is a little under the weather. They both laugh and Jim tells him to leave the food so she can see it. The father doesn't understand and Jim just keeps telling him to. He gets flustered and walks away. He stutters and just can't give a straight answer to his father. This is a perfect comparison to much of Jim's life. He does something but cannot explain it.Rebel Without a Cause is a classic from the 1950's. A movie that to this day is a perfect example of how each new generation is as rebellious as the one before it.",Rebel Without a Cause

It perfectly embodies every element of being a teenager. The angst, confusion and feeling of complete alienation from everyone. You feel lost and angry, and not even your friends and family can help you. It really is just the epitome of an adolescence film. It takes every element of the time period in one's life and combines them so seamlessly. Watching it, I felt like I was seeing my own life instead of a fictionalized one. Everything about it is so authentic and palpable. The performances are just indescribable. Dean is the embodiment of every teenager, filled with pain and confusion. His facial expressions and body movements easily display every emotion searing through his mind, and the mind of every rebellious teenager at that point in their life. I don't think I've ever seen an actor become more absorbed in their role. You forget that you are watching somebody act. It might be the greatest performance I've ever seen. Natalie Wood is incredible. She is absolutely gorgeous and the chemistry between her and Dean is unlike anything brought to film. Never before has their been a couple so adorable or meant for each other. They are two halves of one whole and this romance is brought to the screen flawlessly. Sal Pineo is also sensational, displaying the third form of teenage angst; the nerdy, secluded boy who's always picked on. I was incredibly surprised by how brilliant this film is.",Rebel Without a Cause
103,mdm-11,"James Dean Cult-Classic about ""misunderstood"" teens in 1950s",9,23 May 2005,"Brilliant cast of well-known Hollywood icons in hard-hitting treatment of story that focuses on the hopelessness exhibited by many middle-class teenagers who were too young to recall the pains of WWII, but saw daily reminders of the threat of ""the bomb"", as well as inequities around them.James Dean stands out as the troubled kid whose parents keep ""moving"" to escape their community's effects of their son's strange behavior. Equally great are the performances of Natalie Wood as a ""wanna-be-bad-girl"" who is hurt by her parents' implications that she is a ""tramp""; and the child-like Sal Mineo, who lives in a mansion with a maid, but feels the pains of neglect from never-present parents.The trio first meet at a police station, where they all see a well-meaning officer who is genuinely interested in getting these troubled kids back on the right track rather than throwing the book at them. He does seem to reach James Dean, who seeks help after getting into more trouble.The relationship between the James Dean character and that of Sal Mineo is somewhat elusive. At times a more than friendly association is suggested, then the appearance of Natalie Wood makes it look like an odd threesome. 1950s America was definitely unprepared for any ""spelling out"" of suggested terms, so for nearly 50 years now anyone's guess as to what was going on here is as good as the next.The supporting cast include Jim Backus as James Dean's well-to-do yet wimpish and henpecked father as well as a young Dennis Hopper as a member of a greaser gang. The parade of big name stars in itself is eye-candy of the highest caliber! References to scientific findings are still awe-inspiring today. Showing young college students' reactions to film footage during a lecture shows that humans can't fully grasp the insignificance of earthly life compared to the vastness of the universe. Carefully watch the final scene as the end credits are shown, when this ""point"" is driven home.Rebel Without A Cause is one of the great classics with a sociological impact that has seldom been reached by any film, and likely never surpassed. This film is a ceaseless source of discussions. I recommend this film also for high school History, Sociology or Language Arts classes.",Rebel Without a Cause
104,dvc5159,"""I don't want trouble, now"".",7,20 September 2008,"Very recently, you may have heard headlines about actors which have died too early to fully flourish their careers. Actors such as Brad Renfro, Judith Barsi, the immortal Bruce Lee and the soon to be immortal Heath Ledger, who before kicking the bucket mesmerized us with one of the best on-screen villainous performances of all time, The Joker in The Dark Knight. But they will only be compared to, the first great and tragic young icon, James Dean, the young man whose title of the film I'm reviewing as you read stunningly personifies him.Dean, having starred in only three films in his career, died in a car accident. He death involved what he was embodied as; a fast life and fast cars. Yet, in this movie, he delivers a tour-de-force of acting that I have yet to see in most of today's youth actors. In this film he gives his standalone performance, one that was and will continue to be imitated or inspire other actors trying to act as a troubled youth. This film captures the adolescent cry for help, and it is done with brilliant and poignant direction.Here Dean plays Jim Stark, a rebellious young man whose attitude is presumably the cause of his parents moving from town to town. Finally, in the suburbs of Los Angeles, he makes new friends, and some enemies as well. The film is made in the '50s, a time where World War II still lingers on everyone's minds and the ongoing threat of nuclear war, which terrified citizens young and old alike. However the young, whom the adults are not paying enough attention to due to the current state of events, suffer, and eventually become involved in gangs, fights and violence. This shows the desperate cry for help by these teenagers, and even today the film still delivers the powerful and pessimistic message it has to say. Dean gives a crackling and reflective performance as Stark, here he's a psychologically scarred teenager with a circus for a family and a penchant for getting mixed with the wrong kind of people. Along the way, he befriends a mentally unstable homosexual, Plato (who is convincingly played by Sal Mineo), and falls in love with Judy, played superbly by a dazzling Natalie Wood at her peak. Make no mistake, this is classic Hollywood at its best, and most probably, at its most controversial at the time.The story and screenplay is well-written and thoughtful, though I must say, there are some flaws in the characterization department, though those are merely minor distractions from the film's true greatness. The direction is unflinching and bold by master Nicholas Ray, and the cinematography is beautiful, especially with some scenes involving the ""Chicken Race"" and the planetarium. Whoever thought of filming the movie in CinemaScope should deserve kudos, because it really gives the film a sweeping and grand beauty to it. It really sets the mood for the film.In short, although it has its downs, it's still a masterpiece, a film that should be watched and embodied by every adolescent in every generation, as this is a film that is ahead of its time by leaps and bounds. It should stick to the AFI's Top 100 list, and should enter the IMDb top 250, if there are others who truly embody this genuinely bold drama.Overall quality: 9.611/10Delton",Rebel Without a Cause

106,XxEthanHuntxX,Ung Rebell - 86,8,8 August 2020,"Before the modern generation's endlessly exciting film for confused and insecure youths, came the milestone that will forever influenced how young people were portrayed in movies. The emotional storms, the naivety, the insecurity, the anger that results in violence, the frustration over the incomprehensible parents - everything is there in ""Rebel without a Cause"". And it would come to set the standard for an entire genre - and with one of film history's justifiable mythical, finest stars in the lead role.Much of the film's strength - and success - lies, of course, in its charismatic protagonist and star James Dean, a legend of the golden age in cinema. He fits the role of Jim Stark perfectly, a worried teenager who moves to a new city with his overprotective parents.However, the film sometimes falters and the majority is in the script. It's a rather clichéd story and both inexplicable and exaggerated in places, with car races, and how the outsider wins the leader's girl's heart, in a rather unlikely love story. But ""Rebel without a Cause"" also has some timeless scenes and despite these negative things, the fact that it captures the destructive behaviour in young people is fantastic to see in such early days of film history.",Rebel Without a Cause
107,jcbutthead86,One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made With A Brilliant Performance From James Dean.,10,6 February 2013,"Rebel Without A Cause is simply a classic and not only one of the greatest teen films ever made,but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films.Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager.Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic ""chickie run"" all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today. The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is wonderful. James Dean is simply excellent and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is brilliant and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest and has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is amazing as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well.Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray.Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score.In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Rebel Without a Cause

109,eabakkum,Are the characters mentally sick?,6,6 August 2010,"I guess it is impossible to write an objective review about this film. James Dean is an icon, whose name is generally mentioned in one breath together with Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and (surprisingly) Humphrey Bogart. They all dominated in emotionally trend-setting movies. In addition they reflected their professional work in their private lives, that made them lamentable victims of the show business. I was born just after the production of ""Rebel without a cause"", but the influence of this film was still palpable during my childhood. It may even have been the inspiration for this other giant film about youths, ""Saturday night fever"". However, there is something uncanny in RwaC, that seems absent in SNF. It may be that SNF plays in a social environment, where one expects the natural fostering of aberrations in the development of half-growns. The SNF kids are ignorant and, although they are portrayed as essentially good, can hardly escape from violence and brutality. On the other hand, the kids in the story of RwaC stem from wealthy families, and have no material worries and little intellectual wants. The violence in these surroundings seems abnormal and leaves little room for sympathy. There is no excuse when two characters get into a wild knife fight outside the planetarium. It is absurd when a school kid carries a gun to protect himself against class mates. And it is bizarre when a kid tries to strangle his father, only because the poor man reflects upon an answer to his sons question. The metaphor is clear, namely the search for personal autonomy and the wearisome separation from parental control. However, the metaphor is so extreme that it ruins the credibility of the narrative. RwaC contains lots of hidden hints - supposing that I don't see ghosts. It is probably designed as a film with many layers, for as many different kinds of viewers. However the aim to touch and take along the viewer emotionally is shipwrecked by the monstrous behavior of the main characters. The viewer eventually concludes that the characters must be mentally sick and insane, and this naturally excludes any feelings of identification or empathy. One could speculate that this lack of balance mirrors the spirit of the time, when the people were alienated while trying to cope with the aftermath of the Second World War and the violence of the McCarthy politics. Summarizing: this film is part of me but not my cup of tea.",Rebel Without a Cause

Unluckily, they will came after him as he knows the other guys of the city. Confused, without knowing what to do after the death of a friend, and with a more confused parent that does not solve his problems (spectacular acting of Frank Bachus); his situation become more desperate as he can only trust in his new friends, Platón (a bit crazy boy that has been ""abandoned"" by his parents, who only give him money) and Judy (that argues continuously with her parents). But things are not going to be better, as the problems of no-communicating will happen things to end in a tragic and sad ending. All the actors are very, very good (two nominations) in a very good direction which makes one of the best films ever, whom time does not pass, as it is as actual as it was.

How he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his illustrious role as Jim Stark, the world may never know. This is a performance of a lifetime, that broke the conventional grounds of acting, raising the possibilities of how far an actor/actress can go when pushing the boundaries of forming an extensively animated, buoyant character. Dude made his depiction into a cinematically historical paragon.Rebel Without a Cause is the ultimate, fictional, high school story about the all-time worst, most heartless, most spoiled, and without a doubt, most demented teenaged rag-tags ever to walk the planet.

And yeah, you can argue 95% of all the characters are complete s***heads, but sometimes you need corrupt characters in order to create an exceptional movie. Even if its the inflated, over the edge type of corrupt characters. And yes, the romance sub-plot towards the finale is quite cringe-endusing. This is one of those movies that are just so predominantly iconic, that it's remarkably effortless to look past the flaws.

115,quaseprovisorio,"very poignant, provocative and engagic picture.",8,18 July 2020,"There's something very deep and interesting about how nicholas ray sees his own country. the main characters i've seen on his films usually have one thing in common: they're people that don't measure with all societal rules. being a young crook facing trial (on knock on any door), a rude detective with anger management problems (on dangerous ground) a schoolteacher with a nervous breakdown (bigger than life). here we have small criminal youth. ""problematic"" young people. ""problematic"" people.people that failed the system. and they want to be heard even if they won't talk. his characters always have that layer of ""america"" where they feel they have failed the dream. this is actually an original story written by ray that then was adapted to the screen. And what this movie is: well, depicts a small town and his middle/high class youth. yeah, only rich kids can afford cars. a new guy comes to town and he defies others. after that wee see this rich younk kids falling into the ""disgrace"" of not knowing what their lives are, and creating kind of a void in order to feel alive.ray here speaks for the children of a certain america: the america where people seemed to ""won"" - like in ""bigger than life"" for example. this is the youth of the rich. while their parents are struggling to ""make the dream alive"", their kids aren't heard. problems seem as a carpet you can put under the bed and that's it. a lot of characters here have more than one layer because at the end of the day they're lonely people who even while in group don't seem to know how to connect with each other.what is james dean? two things: first the emobodiement of that people. he's the flesh representation of that teenage angst. he personifies all the pain and impotence, and nihilism somehow of a youth that doesn't know their place. but then he's also a character in a journey of becoming an adult. because in a way this story is about that: responsabilities turn to you. even if you look at the other side.now i do think the script could have been a bit better crafted, mainly on its pace. the dialogues in general are very good and explanatory while not being boringly expositive. all the other actors besides dean are very good. the final minutes are very suspenseful and intensive - ray knows very well how to create the atmosphere. there's a bit of suspension of disbelief here and there...but doesn't ruin the experience.just don't expect a totally build movie structure. this here is about the dialogue, those characters and their journey, and an america that doesn't want to look at them. James Dean makes them look. besides having the whole importance for being probably his most iconic film, is a very worth watch and makes me question how 50's middle high class of united states was.

116,xan-the-crawford-fan,It was okay,5,3 September 2021,"James Dean was not a very good actor. We probably would not remember him, or Marilyn Monroe, if neither of them had died young. Unlike actors like Rudolph Valentino, Carole Lombard, and Jean Harlow, who also died young, Marilyn and Jimmy didn't have more to give- they had bled their typecasting to the bone. And James Dean only made three movies!For some reason, because James Dean only made three movies, all of them are considered classics. I turned off Giant after an hour, I haven't seen East Of Eden (and don't want to), and this one was merely okay.Best part was probably the usage of color and the teeny-bopper outfits. James Dean was handsome, yes, but waaaay too old-looking to play a high-school student. And he was not a good enough actor to pull it off. Natalie Wood was okay, closer to high school age (and appearance) than James Dean. At least she wasn't cast in a musical this time. Sal Mineo looked about twelve, on the flip side of James Dean looking like a grown man. Standing next to Dean, he looked like his son.The story was crappy and clichéd, the dialogue was hokey, James Dean mumbled all his lines so I couldn't hear most kf them anyway. It's entertaining, but not much more. Definitely NOT a classic teen movie, although now I know where they got the planetarium scene from La La Land.A late-career psycho-biddy Bette Davis movie is a more relatable teen flick than RWAC, but RWAC is a good popcorn flick.

The extras are informative, including different shots of scenes never utilized in the final film. I'd seen parts of the film over the years but I was surprised at how much I hadn't seen, but also how great these actors were. I feel starved with that fodder Hollywood throws at us now but this movie shows the art of acting at it's best. I came away with a better appreciation of Dean and of Sal Mineo. Natalie Wood is a girl you love to hate at the beginning of the film but in the end she's won you over and just simply love her.

Why all the boy needs to straighten him out is a nice girlfriend like Natalie Wood. Its hard to imagine the impact of this dated and predictable melodrama now, but this is where the teenager got invented, despite the fact that all the adults here, including the screenwriter, clearly had no idea what the Generation Gap was all about.

However, in the fifties, this must have been quite an important movie.James Dean, the teenage role-model of the fifties, plays the leading character in the movie and does that pretty well. Natalie Wood is beautiful to watch, but in the movie she has a bit of an unreal character. She forgets the death of her boyfriend in maybe 0ne hour, which even in them days is very fast. The ending is also a bit of an anticlimax, but all in all it is not a bad movie. I especially like the role of Jim Backus, Dean's dad in the movie.

Beautifully acted by James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo who would have to do it all so differently if this film was to be re-made in 2004.   The parents were played by Ann Doran and Jim Backus in roles so different from what they did before and after.

This movie is a total mess.The initial scenes in the police station should've warned me. What kind of police department would let off a guy who'd killed puppies for no reason? Shouldn't there be some kind of rehabilitation for this kid? But, I have a habit of finishing a movie once i start it. And usually I get rewarded for my patience by movies that are slow to develop. Movies that are such gems that I shudder to even think that I could've missed these just because I gave up too soon. However, once in a while, this habit becomes a curse and I'm left wondering as to why I stuck with the bad movie for so long? And why I didn't see all the signs?!For starters, even though the movie is an account of just 24 hours, nonetheless, you witness people falling in & out of love within this short period of time. The movie portrays teenagers as reckless, promiscuous, stupid and dangerous to everyone around them. They are shown being aggressive to each other, to a cop and even to their own parents! In my opinion, it is a very scary & lopsided view, and totally insulting to teenagers living in any era.Not recommended for anyone!",Rebel Without a Cause

I enjoyed it...... at first. But, I noticed something, this movie is the story of angst, abuse and horrible people.

Which is most certainly too bad, since he gives an excellent performance. His training at The Actor's Studio most certainly provided him with the chops to deliver a very emotional and nuanced performance.Natalie Wood co-stars as a girl who gets off on violence. You can see the sheer joy in her face as Dean and another boy face off in a knife fight. And, she's thrilled to be the flag girl at a near-suicidal death race. And so, when she sees that Dean has engaged in violence himself, she immediately latches on to him.Nicholas Ray was always an interesting director. And, he wrote the story for this too. He directed what I consider the best-overall story about Jesus, ""King of Kings."" And so, here he does very well too.The story takes many interesting turns as it works its way to its ending.

126,movieman-200,Rebel Still Visceral and Moody After All These Years,8,12 June 2005,"Nicholas Ray's ""Rebel Without A Cause"" (1955) is probably the film most closely associated with James Dean's iconic persona as the volatile, yet soulful teenager with a chip on his shoulder. Dean is Jim Stark  a young man who's hen-pecked by an overbearing mother (Ann Doran) and compromised in his reference of adult masculinity by a weak father figure (Jim Backus). Though it is suggested that Jim's relocation to a new school is the result of his wild run in with the law, the film begins on a night of drunken debauchery.While awaiting his family in the police station, Jim eyes fast girl, Judy (Natalie Wood), but takes an invested interest in a young man in whom he sees varying shades of his former self  the self-destructive, Plato (Sal Mineo). Judy's association with greaser, Buzz (Corey Allen) ensures a volatile conflict between Buzz and Jim; and there are two. The first is a fight with switch blades outside the famed planetarium near Los Angeles. But, as this early attempt at asserting who's the leader of the pack is thwarted by police intervention, Buzz and Jim settle on another venue at another time; the justly celebrated game of chicken that has both men racing their automobiles towards a dangerous cliff. Given Dean's untimely death at the hands of the wheel, this sequence has particularly ominous significance for today's viewer. But in the film, at the last minute, good sense prevails and Jim bails out of his car. Buzz's sleeve gets caught on the door handle. He sails over the cliff and dies in a fiery explosion. From this point on, Jim spirals into an emotional whirlpool. He's distracted from total self destruction by Judy's kind and understanding way, their growing romantic affection for one another, and, Plato's looming and dangerous disdain for authority. Of course, you just know this is going to end badly.Like most sensationalist melodrama of the 1950s, ""Rebel"" is dated by today's standards. Its grasp on sexual politics and what it means to be a man, in a society that asks for conformity rather than self assertion, is an ominous precursor to the folly of wayward youth that was later embodied in such films as Blackboard Jungle and West Side Story. What the film does offer from the contemporary perspective, is a time capsule of 50s sensibilities that oddly enough, continue to resonate with teenagers and twenty-something's to this very day. This 2 disc edition of ""Rebel"" is a welcomed treat. Though the original single disc had a very nice looking transfer  this newly minted DVD appears to have more subtle nuances in color fidelity, and, with the added treat of owing considerably less to film grain. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Blacks are solid and velvety deep. Whites are generally clean. Though there are some examples of fading between dissolves these are inherent shortcomings in all early Cinemascope productions and not the flaw of DVD mastering. The audio is a remix of the original magnetic six track that accompanied ""Rebel's"" roadshow engagement. It's remarkably bold and sonically stirring. Extras include a new documentary on the making of the film, as well as the original featurettes that were featured on the single disc, plus a James Dean bio that is very much a collector's item",Rebel Without a Cause
127,joelgodinho,You are tearing me apart!!,9,9 February 2021,"Rebel Without a Cause a 1955 film directed by Nicholas Ray and starring James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo.
I recently watched all of the three films that starred James Dean as a major character and while I liked all 3 I think this one easily stands out.
In terms of acting the film is full of great performances, the biggest of them being, obviously, James Dean who gives the greatest performance in his career (and one of the most memourable in cinema history), and I think that it's this film the main reason his entire style has become iconic, I also really like Sal Mineo, Natalie Wood and Corey Allen.
I think the story is great and just like in ""East Of Eden"" I think there is some interesting camera work as well like in some scenes.

I think all of us have heard of this movie, especially because of James Deans fame after his early death. And with the title, it sound kinda corny. Far from it, this is one of the best 50's movies I've seen taking on many sociological questions about teen environments. I don't even know why the title is ""Rebel without a cause"", the cause is shown quite clearly. I don't think I've ever before seen such an old film depicting a dysfunctional family, sure compared to today it's not too bad, it it is still very well told. James Deans character Jim Stark is one of the most complex and enigmatic, yet still easy to understand and identify with character I've ever seen. From the very opening sequence his performance is great, and his character well portrayed. Of course this film has more than a dysfunctional family, but there are so many teen related problems in it I think I'd rather just say; ""watch the movie"". If you like drama, teen film, are interesting in sociology, psychology, or just plain like films, I highly recommend this film. I give it a 9/10.",Rebel Without a Cause
129,chucknorrisfacts,Still good but definitely dated!,10,5 June 2010,"Director Nicholas Ray presents us with his vision of life as 1950s angst-ridden adolescents in ""Rebel Without a Cause"". With 2010 marking the fifty-fifth anniversary of the film, I felt compelled to write a review as objective as possible without any nostalgic bias as so many reviews for this film are written.I think most of this film's enduring legacy are based upon three things. One, its catchy title. Two, it was one of only three films ever made starring the late James Dean, who died tragically on September 30, 1955, just weeks before the film was to be released in theaters. Lastly, it provides the most iconic image of Dean, clad in his red windbreaker, white crew neck T-shirt and jeans.As far as the actual content of the film is concerned, it hasn't aged very well. Of course, maybe that is to be expected for a decades old social commentary. Even still, it's hard to imagine this wasn't viewed as melodramatic even at the time.James Dean turns in a good performance as Jim Stark, but is it the stuff of acting legend? The jury's still out on that one as far as I'm concerned. Personally, I think he did a good job but is it an untouchable performance? I don't think so. However, I will give credit where credit is due and say that at the time he was better than many of his contemporaries.It is interesting to note that Marlon Brando was originally considered for the lead role, but being seven years older than Dean was thought ""too old"" for the part, and in all honesty, he would've been.""Rebel"" is the kind of movie you should check out if for no other reason than to be able to say you've seen it. Just keep in mind how old the film is, and try not to laugh during the ""chickie run"" when ""Buzz"" Gunderson (Corey Allen) goes over the side of the cliff and perishes in one of the cheesiest fiery explosions I've ever seen.",Rebel Without a Cause
130,jbartelone,"It's Good, But Not The Great Film That Has Been Believed",6,17 June 2010,"I have heard about Rebel Without a Cause for years. It was a cult classic that withstood the test of time and spoke to past and future generations about troubled youth. I also remember how James Dean was such an icon in pop culture, and I loved Blackboard Jungle, which came out about the same time, so I was hoping for a similar classic in Rebel Without a Cause. I prepared myself to be blown away.Unfortunately, all I saw was a slightly above average movie that was not so much about rebellion but a failure between teens and parents to communicate. In Rebel Without a Case, each of the main protagonists has pain in his/her own family life, ranging from an abusive father,(the parent of Natalie Wood) a young teen (Sal Mineo) with no parents being raised by a housekeeper, and another teen who lives with an over-protective mother, and a hen-pecked apathetic father. (James Dean's parents.) The story involves Jim Stark (Dean) trying to fit in at school. A very difficult task as his family has constantly been moving from state to state because Jim can't seem to stay out of trouble. He quickly (almost too quickly) befriends several students at the school and also makes several enemies, all in a very short period of time.Jim quickly becomes provoked into a knife fight by another group leader while on a class field trip to a planetarium. He retains his cool for the most part, but is goaded into another dare by some bad apples to participate in a car race known as the ""Chickie Run."" Each member of the group dares to risk death by speeding his car up to a cliff, stopping as close to the cliff as possible by jumping out. Whoever jumps last is ""Chicken."" The rival member ""Buzz"" gets his jacket caught in the car door and can not jump out as the car topples over the cliff and Buzz is killed. The rest of the movie involves Jim and his friends debating if they should go to the police, as well as the fears and repercussions faced by Buzz's friends who are out looking for Jim because they believe he is responsible for Buzz's death.No one can talk to the parents so the group hides in an old abandoned mansion. Jim befriends, Plato, in an excellent performance by Sal Mineo who has a troubled past of his own. He was picked up by the police shooting puppies. (Thankfully not shown.) However, there is a certain empathy and sensitivity about Plato that makes him more empathetic as the movie goes on. Each of Jim's friends see the seriousness, lack of communication, and disconnection that their friends have with each one of their parents.There are some good moments of suspense, but Jim's parents especially Mr. Stark, payed by Jim Backus (Thurston Howell III from Gilligan's Island) display no solid acting qualities at all. It's almost like they were picked off the street, given a script to read for a week and just go through the motions. James Dean had the macho and charisma of a leading man actor who died in a horrible car accident before this movie was released. However, I think his Hollywood looks at the time were better than his acting. The talented Natalie Wood, as Dean's love interest has no time to develop because she jumps into his arms for support too fast. This quick timing renders their relationship to be unrealistic. Sal Mineo does the best acting job of the trio who shows the most believable actions and reactions to the movie's events and how they affect both his friends and him.The problem is that Rebel Without a Cause has an interesting premise, but a muddied superficial story that needs better character development for the viewer to empathize with these troubled teens. Instead of being blown away by what this movie was supposed to represent, I got, at best, a strong breeze.Rebel Without a Cause is a good movie for a one-time viewing. But for all-time classic repeated viewing status, it's just not there. Blackboard Jungle blows this movie away.",Rebel Without a Cause

I didn't get one.  True, the film does retain some emotional power and Dean's performance is brilliant at times, but time has not been good to ""Rebel"".  It is, at times, almost hard to watch.  Its anti-parent, ""you-don't understand"" theme is dated.  When you really think about it, Plato (played by Sal Mineo) becomes the central character and the film strays from Dean's plight with authority and growing up. He tries to ""save"" Plato, and you find yourself not caring about what happens to each character.I guess you have to say it is essential viewing, considering its status as an all-time classic and being one of only 3 films Dean made before his tragic death.  One viewing would be enough.",Rebel Without a Cause

The ending felt like a cop out though. And I thought from the moment at the observatory, every scene in the story started to move everything forward, the advancing KILLER SHARK in screen writing. Which is good. It also becomes startlingly obvious that Plato was sexually attracted to Jim Stark, although the director was said to deny to death. And he probably felt that Judy would get in the way of their relationship although he displayed no signs of it in the movie. Despite this, he also looks up to Jim and might have wanted Jim and Judy to be his family. Or even his parents.You want my jacket? Rebel Without a Cause. 9/10",Rebel Without a Cause

It does some things right, like successfully portraying an angsty teenage who isn't understood and making you care about him. That's the big thing that makes this movie good. Unfortunately it is dragged down a bit by some other things. Number one: the romance. It doesn't work, at least in my opinion. Their young and dumb, so I'm not complaining about their chemistry, which was fine, or rash decisions. I'm complaining about how this chick is just fine with hooking up with someone else maybe a day after her boyfriend died. I don't know, that just doesn't seem right to me. Number two: Plato. He was really annoying and irritating. He was fine up until the end where he completely lost it for no reason.

The petty fights, the bullying, revenge, the desire to do something unprecedented so as to be noticed in the crowd, the precociousness, the gradually dwindling bond with family members- all these are the facets one faces when a transition from an innocent adolescent to a late-teenager is made.Jim Stark doesn't share a very good relationship with his cantankerous mother and is more attached to his father, who supports him and deals with his mother's tantrums calmly. The quarrels between his mother and father make him feel insecure and he vents his pent up emotions by indulging in activities like breaking the parking lights or bashing his fellow students in the school. He gets into a fight with a gang in his new school and is challenged to a Drag race, to prove that he is a ""chicken"". The race ends with the death of the challenger and the other members of the gang hunt Jim. Jim falls in love with Judy and together they care for the troubled and insecure Plato.

But one group of people that I do have a desire to get in the head of are people who do not like this film.Some, including one of the greatest film critics of all times, Roger Ebert, believe that the film has not aged well. I do not believe this at all. It's more likely that they are the ones who have not aged well. The first time I watched this film, I was a teenager, and it hit me like a ton of bricks speeding on a car at a thousand miles an hour. It captured some deep truths about change and rebellion and insecurity and the teenage years that no film I have seen before or since have seen.Yes, it is long, and, yes, it is slow. So what? Were your teenage years fast and upbeat and electric every day? If you can't get through an 111 minute movie, you really need a lesson in patience. And, more pressingly, no scene is boring or extraneous.This is the point where people start to protest. But stay with me. No, there are not huge action pieces or excessively sharp dialogue or even a lot of big 'moments.' But it more than makes up for this with its atmosphere and acting. You want to stay in this movie world forever, you want to lay yourself out to it and let its waves rush against your innards. The restored version is stunning in black and white. You feel everything Dean- who is absolutely fantastic in this movie, by the way- and the rest of the cast feel.I'm sure there are a lot of people who think this too. But I imagine few of them like it as much as I do. This is higher on my favorites list than Saving Private Ryan or a number of other highly regarded films. Why? Because I feel connected to these characters like I have felt connected to very few others. Before the fifties, teenagers were never really taken seriously in film, and even when they were, rebellion was considered a no-no. There was never a movie to bring out their essence, the truest extents of their personality. And unfortunately, that has not changed too much. There are movies involving teenagers, who are recognized as being a fair part of the market, but they are too often shown as stereotypes, and even when they are not, their problems are not fully fleshed out.Eh. At least we have this film. To me, it has as many memorable scenes as any film despite not having any crowdpleasing sequences. And they all build up to the climax of the tragedy, which I will not spoil but will admit is quite jarring.

It's almost comical at times the way he overacts. The big screen magnifies every gesture, every word and he's performing like he's on a stage instead of 5 feet in front of a CinemaScope camera.Sadly, this was one of the movies of the mid 1950s era that helped popularize rebellious behavior during one of the nation's most prosperous periods.",Rebel Without a Cause

He has only played in three movies (I'm not counting in the small and trivial roles in some other movies) but he managed to be nominated twice for an Academy Award, both posthumous.I've seen two of his movies (Giant not yet). 'East of Eden' was wonderful, I loved it! That's probably why 'Rebel Without a Cause' was a bit of a disappointment: my expectations were rather high. The story was the most disappointing element of the movie. It was quite simple and flat.

Overall is 'Rebel Without a Cause' quite entertaining although I didn't completely fulfilled the hype. I think this movie is a little bit overrated.

138,commandercool88,Truly one of the greatest films ever made.,10,7 July 2008,"Another classic, another masterpiece. 'Rebel Without a Cause' was released 53 years ago in 1955, but this is one timeless story that hasn't aged one day, if not ahead of its time entirely. It is absolutely stunning, a powerful and moving ode to the terrors of growing up. Complete with innovative direction from Nicholas Ray, an intelligent and insightful script, and eye-popping performances, few films have kept me riveted the way 'Rebel Without a Cause' did.You may find it corny. You may find it clunky to today's standards. But a moment is never wasted in this masterful picture, and while situations may be different then they were when 'Rebel' was filmed, the struggles remain the same. To grow up and feel as though you don't belong, this is nothing new. Whether you grew up during the golden years of the 50s, or if you're still growing up now in the 21st century, life isn't as neat or simple as it is on 'Leave it to Beaver'. 'Rebel' understands this, and there are moments of real truth to be found.To conform or not to conform, that is the question. It is the central theme here, and what plagues Jim (James Dean) more than anything else. Growing up in a new neighborhood, Jim finds himself torn between being an individual or fitting in with the others, even when that means doing terribly dangerous things. It is such a decision that will affect the rest of your life, and to which there is no easy answer. 'Rebel' understands this better than any other film I can recall, and it's what makes it such a fascinating and realistic approach to those dreaded moments in life.It is impossible to discuss 'Rebel Without a Cause' without the legendary performance that would make James Dean an icon. Though he starred in only three films, his legacy lives on like few others ever will. His undeniable charm transcends film, and his fascinating but tragic life that was cut much too short has made him immortal. ""Dream as if you'll live forever; live as if you'll die today,"" he once said. He was an old soul, and a man wiser beyond his years. His performance here in 'Rebel' is, quite simply, flawless. Every word spoken with such passion and truth, his presence alone is incredibly powerful. He will leave you breathless.'Rebel Without a Cause' is the definition of true greatness. But it is difficult not to watch this and feel a great sadness come over you. James Dean. Natalie Wood. Sal Mineo. Three magnificent talents, gone much too soon. But the moments we do have with them will live on forever in the timeless tradition of cinema. Their presence lives on for future generations to discover and praise. ""Some people are just born with tragedy in their blood,"" goes a line from 'Donnie Darko'. But we must treasure the time we have with them. And 'Rebel Without a Cause' is one of the best movies I have ever seen.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Rebel Without a Cause
139,TheNabOwnzz,"Good enough as a kid/parents struggle flick, yet a bit too hasty overall",7,15 May 2018,"Quite possibly primarily seen as such an iconic film because of the unfortunate demise of James Dean a couple of months later in a tragic traffic accident, Rebel Without a Cause is hailed by many critics as the ultimate film about young people. However, while it is a good film, calling it a great one is a bit far fetched and just doesn't make much sense objectively speaking.The first hour of the film is very good as a character piece, with us showing the various lifes of the three main characters and their struggles with their parents ( Although Plato's story is lacking a bit ). It does a great job of accurately showing us how empty the young people's life are in this film when for example Buzz replies to Dean's characters question why they would do something like drive stolen cars over a cliff, to which he replies you got to do something, signifying the senselessness of their endeavors. However, the latter part of the film is significantly weaker due to the fact that the story seemed too hasty.The movie takes place on a single day which features James Dean's ( Jim Stark ) character on his first day of school after moving to a new area. All of the events that happen in this single day seem to be a bit overwhelming, and a lot of things simply happen too fast for the audience to truly become immersed in the circumstances, such as Natalie Wood's ( Judy ) character quickly changing love interests when her first one dies and Sal Mineo's ( Plato ) sudden psychopathic outburst when nearing the end. In fact, it could be argued Sal Mineo's character is really irrelevant to the film except for the final couple of minutes in which Nicholas Ray attempts to create some kind of emotional outburst from the audience, yet we are told in the opening sequence that he shot a couple of puppy's for no reason and really are not given any other reason whatsoever during the course of the film to care about him when he gets killed. One could sympathize with Judy due to her parents apparent lack of concern for her or Jim who is obviously more connected to his father while his father is being dominated by his mother, yet with Plato this is not really the case.Jim Stark is drunk in the openingsscene, but unfortunately Dean's acting seems like he was drunk the entire film with his kind of lazy line delivery, except for the scene in which he confronts his mother and father when his mother wants to move again, which features some great acting by Dean. Also Natalie Wood and Jim Backus as the pushover father of Jim are worthy of mention as some excellent acting performances, capturing the essence of their character perfectly.While the second half of the film is inferior to the first, the night time cinematography in particular stands out as a great piece of work, especially with the shots of the old mansion and the planetarium in the background. All this means Rebel Without a Cause succeeds as a character piece and at defining the senselessness and recklessness of youth in the 50s, yet is a bit less succesful in fully immersing you into the events that happen in the latter part of the film due to the fact that it happens far too quickly. Yet as an entertaining character piece it is still quite a good film.",Rebel Without a Cause
140,PeterJackson,Death of a great actor,7,26 August 2000,"I didn't think this film was a masterpiece. Its story is way too thin and familiar, though it certainly scores some points for the neat character studies of bored and alienated youngsters. Their struggle for self-esteem and honor is remarkably well drawn. But as I said, it's too predictable to make this a ""really good"" movie instead of ""just a good"" movie. However, what really raises the film above par is the acting of James Dean. Until now, I had only heard and read something about his (short) life, but this is the first time I saw him in a film. And I can only say: this (young) man had great potential and it's a shame that he didn't have the time to make more films. I can't say anything about the man James Dean, but I can say that we've lost a great actor far too soon.Oh, and as for the movie, I rated it 7/10.(thanks to Jimmy Dean)",Rebel Without a Cause

This isn't only an excellent, powerful, heart-breaking story about a young man whop tries hard not to be a rebel but just doesn't have the required help.  This is reality.  Plenty of kids acted the same way James Dean did in this movie and not because they wanted to be show-offs or tough-guys, but simply because it was the only way of living they could see.  Story aside, this movie contains without any doubt Dean's best performance as Jim Stark, the rebel the title talks about.

144,teejayniles2345,"If these were the ""good old days. . .""",10,14 July 2001,"My rating after watching it this evening: 10 ! I had videotaped this 1955 classic of American pop culture more than 10 years ago when we lived near WLS-TV, Chicago.  The station had edited and ""fitted"" it for a late-night time slot in the early 90's.  I may be wrong but I don't think any ""bleeps"" were made in the soundtrack which is so (!) different for 99.9% of the comparable films being made nowadays.  Some may think it is hopelessly dated but valid points must be made in its favor.  The latest cultural ""buzzword"" as to horrendous school violence has been bullying; the kids in this film are doing it and subjecting the vulnerable school misfits to it, then as now.  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE does not present a realistic scenario as to youth alienation in the few days that transpire in the movie's plot. However, the trio of sympathetic High School students are ""still"" walking the halls with different names, nicknames, and doctored ID cards.  Many people have a faulty stereotype that hot-rod cruising and vandalism were not tolerated or evidenced during the Eisenhower era in America;  this movie disproves that as well as the dictum that divorce broke up families only during the liberal '60's.  Materialistic parents still try to ""pay off"" their teenage offspring with money instead of straightforward integrity and ""quality"" time;  the role of the family is also being assailed in this movie way ahead of the feminist critique that followed the decade of the '50's. Post-war America didn't ""go to hell"" in a handbasket due to Boomers coming of age in 1962, I beg your pardon.  Society had come a bit unglued after the WW II veterans came home from Europe and Japan.  Our culture, as reflected in this 1955 classic, had become a pressure-cooker for troubled youth already in the ""good old"" I like ""Ike"" era.",Rebel Without a Cause

The fact that I was much younger than Jim didn't affect me - this movie reached me in a way II had never before experienced.It is the single most emotional film about teenagers or adolescents made in its era and it was more than a decade before anyone truly did a better job. And anyone who wants to throw this off on a pity-ticket because Dean died is a fool - it was just that much more effective BECAUSE he had died.

146,sdave7596,"Movie is very 50-ish in places, but still has relevance today",8,19 June 2010,"""Rebel Without a Cause"" released in 1955, caused a sensation at the time. The principle reason is James Dean -- without him, this could have easily been just another movie. After all, this film was not the first to tackle the subject of juvenile delinquency; but to teen-agers of that era, it probably seemed like it. Dean plays the character of Jim, a high-schooler who is clearly a misfit. We see him early on in the film drunk and staying out past curfew, and from that point on, he rules the film as the ultimate rebel. Natalie Wood plays Judy, a girl from a good family who seems to want to be a ""bad girl"" by hanging around hoodlums. Then there is Sal Mineo, playing the character of Plato, a boy who is abandoned by his wealthy mother and being raised by the housemaid. After much going on in the first part of the movie, including a drag race that goes horribly wrong (Judy's boyfriend is killed), the three principle characters find an odd sort of bond as outcasts at school and in their own families. The movie clearly sets up the rules: the young people versus the adults (i.e., the establishment, as the 1960's kids would call them). Adults are not to be trusted in these kids world. Jim can't relate to his father (Jim Backus in a solid performance) or his nagging mother. His mother has clearly emasculated his father; he seems to do most of the housework (unusual for the 1950's!) and is very indecisive. Judy seems to idolize her father, but he seems to coldly reject her now that she is a teen-ager. Much discussion has been made of the rather odd way Plato seems to almost worship Jim, without even really knowing him. Some suggest Plato was sexually attracted to Jim, which could be true, but keep in mind we are viewing the subject of homosexuality from today's standpoint versus the 1950's. The character of Plato was likely meant to look up to Jim as a very cool older brother type. This was a knock-out performance for James Dean, the one that really established him as the ultimate cool, aloof teen-ager; and raised his stature in Hollywood. Love Dean or hate him, and whether you like his rather strange style of acting, the man reeked of charisma and explodes on film. Natalie Wood is fine in her role, as is Sal Mineo. Some of the smaller parts of the hoodlums in the film (inculding a young Dennis Hopper) are a bit cartoonish, but overall a worthwhile film. Not without flaws, but still a decent movie.",Rebel Without a Cause

It is a preposterous and psychotic look at teenagers, and it's also a teen exploitation film of the 50's. I think THE BLOB had more meaning. Jim Backus in that kitchen apron was a hoot. He was the Father Knows Best about nothing character, totally hapless. It was the beginning of the destruction of the male/father image in TV and film in America. We had Archie Bunker and Al Bundy and many other impotent and stupid fathers to follow. The film is a bust; the acting is so bad. Sal Mineo is almost salivating over James Dean, and James Dean is really the psycho here. In today's world, he'd be locked up in a mental institution for what he says and does and how he acts. And by the way, he has just got to turn himself into the police. What a dolt. The leader of the pack says to Jimbo before they race, ""I like you."" Oh, Please!!! Poor Natalie Wood. I don't think she knew what to do or who to be. No direction.

But that were the good things I found. Other than that, the storyline was messy, the characters overreacted in scenes that they didn't need to and they didn't in scenes that they needed to and even the dialogue was mostly ridiculous.

It's really something. I always felt like I could identify with the protagonist, I don't know why. James Dean delivers the performance of a life time in this movie. He really becomes his character. Rebel Without a Cause is grim, it's honest, and it forces you to look at the kinds of things we normally like to forget about while watching a movie. It certainly dwells on themes that were routinely avoided back when it was made. It's about real people with real problems, and these are not criminals. They're regular young people from middle-class families. This movie is not sugar-coated; it's not pretty or polished. It's dirty and it's refreshing. It may not seem that controversial now, but the 50s were a time of happy family facades, and this film is one of the few of its kind that broke the rules and showed life how it really is.

154,Supachewy,A Classic High School Drama That is a Must See,7,23 September 2010,"The high school drama Rebel Without a Cause is directed by Nicholas Ray and stars James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo. The film takes place in a modern day small town and high school.The film starts out with a young man, Jim Stark (Dean), in a police station. He was brought in for being publicly intoxicated. Also in the police station is a young girl, Judy (Wood), who is telling a police officer about how her father hates her and all she is trying to do is try to make him like her. The third important character in the room is a young man, who likes to be called Plato (Mineo), who was brought in for killing some puppies. Jim Stark is new in town and he moves around often because he frequently gets into fights. On the first day of school he tries to make friends with Judy but Judy kind of ignores him for her group of tough guy friends. Jim tries to become friends with the tough guys but instead they decide to start picking on him and cause a fight. That is when Jim defends his honor...The screenplay for this film was quite unique, it is rare to see such a turn in a high school drama like the one in this film. I mean this in a very good way, I'm not saying that I did not like the turn. Each of the three main characters were quite interesting and detailed. Jim Stark was a cool, mysterious guy that I really wanted to understand, Judy was a girl who tried to be cool on the outside just to make her feel better about how her family life was quite terrible, and Plato was a twisted boy who just wanted love. It is not very often that there are such strong written characters in a high school drama today. A great script that lead to an iconic film.The direction for this film was good, not great. Ray was able to get some solid performances from his actors, actually iconic performances from his actors that make this film still talked about today. I just thought that a few of the shots he chose were quite strange. One in particular is when Jim is laying upside down and the camera is upside down and then the camera flips to right side up but when it shows a shot of Jim again he is still upside down. I thought the shot would have been quite good if he flipped over as well but because the fact that he didn't was strange for me. Towards the end of the film I think he did a real good job making it intense and building up the suspense. Ray is definitely an adequate director and this film is the highlight of his career.The acting for this film was very good all around. James Dean gave an iconic performance as the lead being extremely cool, suave, and mysterious all at once. He was the guy that guys wanted to be like and girls wanted to be with. Natalie Wood earned an Oscar nomination for her role which was well deserved. She played cool when she was out with the tough guys but when she was at home or the police station she was weak and vulnerable. Sal Mineo as well earned an Oscar nomination and was great as the mentally tormented boy who really just wanted to have parents that loved him. Iconic performances from the whole cast.Overall I give this film a 7/10 and I would recommend this to anyone who likes high school dramas, great characters, and an interesting plot.",Rebel Without a Cause

I was wondering if it was going to be something like 'American Graffiti', or maybe a little heavier.  Well, the first half of the movie, and really well into the third quarter or so, it had great potential, and was somewhat heavy. After that point it got soft.  Much of the things in the movie are good, specifically the relationship between Jim and his dad.  I enjoyed that, but I was not happy where that or the movie ended up.***SPOILERS***The movie fell apart, not quite, but almost immediately after the game of chicken.  Then begins continuity problems.  I am bothered by the fact that after someone drives over a cliff, in the same night, his girlfriend could not only be happy, but fall in love with someone else.  And not only her, but his whole gang doesn't even seem to mind, as they chase after Jim and try to beat him down.  This is in the span of only a few hours.  Thats horrible.  And they handled the problems of lonliness and family relationships all wrong.  Had they put this story in that hands of either a better director, or a better screen writer, perhaps it could have gone somewhere that would have elevated it to a great movie.  Instead it devolves into a dumb shoot 'em up style of thing, and Jim is pushed into the background.  Why spend time with a character if you push his problems into the background during the climactic part of the film?  I don't know!!!

To summon it up, it's a movie about teenage life, love and showing off, but it's also deeper than it seems. Dean's character, Jim Stark, thought at first that being strong meant showing off in front of people he didn't know and wanting to be accepted, but then understood that being strong means protecting your friends and family and not try to be someone you're not.It was a great movie with wonderful actors and Wood and Dean really fit well together, and it's ashame that he passed away without giving us more wonderful and great movies, just like Rebel Without A Cause.Aida",Rebel Without a Cause
157,friedlandea,"If this is what high school was like, I must have gone to high school on another planet.",5,19 April 2019,"OK. The movie is a classic. Everyone says so. I guess there are classics not everyone can appreciate. For me, this in one. I have the same reaction to it that I had to a novel everyone told me is a classic, ""Catcher in the Rye."" I was forced to read it in high school, and that is why it comes to mind. That book I actively hated. (I was never so pleased as when my daughter was forced to read it and she told me she hated it too.) ""Rebel Without a Cause"" just annoys me. It supposedly depicts the period - a little earlier, I admit, but not much - the time when I grew up and entered high school. I went to high school in NYC. Our high school was in Harlem, not the suburban milieu of ""Rebel's"" rebellious teens. But I had friends who went to high school in Queens and in the suburbs, out on the Island. High school then, and I suppose still today, was not always a calm place. There were bad kids. ""Juvenile delinquents"" we used to say. But never was any delinquency as delinquent as these high-schoolers' daily amusements. Knife fights over casual disagreement, guns, chains, murderous vendettas, maniacal, suicidal games with cars. And what stupid games! The dead Buzz was probably happy; he won the game, right? None of my friends had cars anyway. All this without the benefit even of organized gangs. Gangs, at least, appropriately use switchblades. Here it's just an average day, high school hijinks. Never happened. Maybe it did in southern California. I wouldn't know. It didn't happen in New York, and we were said to be the land of West Side Story. My high school was on the west side, 135th Street and Convent Avenue. It didn't happen there. I never saw it, never heard it, never read it in the papers. My suburb friends never saw it either. OK. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" isn't reality. It's Hollywood reality. That's not what it's billed to be. It's whole appeal, presumably, is that it rips aside the veneer, reveals the angst - I had plenty of angst in high school; it revolved around girls, or the lack thereof, not knife fights - the angst of modern American youth. How in blazes did I miss it all? Because it's nonsense. As Mark Twain once said about the characters of his least favorite author, there are real Indians and there are Fenimore-Cooper (ridiculously unreal) Indians. There are teenagers and there are Hollywood teenagers. (And where, where did they come up with Ed Platt's police captain/social worker who specializes in consoling troubled teens? He's about as believable as everything else.)OK again. Take it at that, a fanciful story of teenage angst. What angst? Who can care about Jim Stark's problems? They're ridiculous. So, Jim, your father is a bit henpecked? Live with it. Dad wears an apron when he does the cooking. Oh, my God. Guess Jim will have to wallow in angst. What else makes Jim the icon of alienated youth? Let's see. He doesn't fit in with the ""in"" crowd of juvenile delinquents. Who does? Relax. No. Jim will have to drive his car over a cliff. But wait. Maybe he will reconsider. No. He must accept the mortal challenge because ""it's a matter of honor."" Hilarious! No high school kid I ever knew - and I was around at the time - none of us ever talked like that, like Sir Lancelot when knighthood was in flower, like George Brent in ""Jezebel."" ""Affair of honor."" We would have split our sides laughing. That's it for Jim, as far as I can tell. Take him over a knee and spank him. Then there's Judy. I give up. What's her problem? Father thinks she's too old to hug. As for ""Plato,"" he's not angst-ridden. He's insane. I'm sorry, even Nicholas Ray can't rescue this material. Only one thing is outstanding in this movie, and that is Jim Backus. I like James Dean far better in ""Giant."" That whole movie is better.

PLENTY!     ""Rebel without a cause"" is still a timeless masterpiece. Kids of today can still relate to it's basic premise,  of youth misunderstood.. .of wanting to belong..  The clothes,  hair,  and times may have changed,  but the story of 3 teens,  bonding as the world around them seems to cave-in,  is just as potent today as it was in 1955. James Dean delivers a knock-out performance,  as Jim Stark.  It's his first day at a new high school. Only,  this time,  he wants to do things the right way: A troubled past,  his parents avoid problems by simply moving. On this day,  Jim truly wants things to be different for good. The night before wasn't great!. Arrested for public intoxication,  his parents,  perhaps the first glimpse of a ""dysfunctional"" family on screen,  hardly know how to handle the situation: Mom is overbearing,  self-centered and constantly ruling over anything his father has to say. His dad is a lilly-livered man with good intentions,  but Jim needs guidance. He begs for it,  in his rebellion. At the police station,  among the other teens in trouble,  is  Judy (played by the gorgeous,  Natalie Wood). Judy has similar problems with her parents. Her father actually slapped her for kissing him on the cheek! All Judy wants is to feel loved.                             Also at the jail,  is John ""Plato"",  played to perfection by Sal Mineo (Nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor). When we first meet Plato,  he is being questioned why he shot a bunch of puppies,  a horrifying way to introduce a character,  but somehow,  Mineo makes us care about Plato,  a rich kid with tons of problems: His dad disappeared,  and his mom is always away on trips,  leaving him to be cared for by the family maid. Plato is looking for somebody to be his friend,  or family. And by the end of 24 hours,  these 3 will make their own tightly knit little circle.  After a rough start in school,  Jim finds trouble during a field trip at ""Griffith Park Observatory"" with a bunch of rough kids,  including Judy,  who runs with the wrong crowd. Jim meets Plato at the Observatory,  who warns him not to ""monkey with"" them. But,  the kids are dead-set on causing Jim trouble,  and before we know it,  Buzz,  the leader of the gang,  forces Jim into a knife-fight.. Jim,  Judy,  and Plato form a kind of ""family"",(and it's obvious Plato has a crush on Jimmy,possiby the first gay teen in cinema history)  and end up hiding out at a deserted mansion near the Observatory,  as the gang searches for them,  as well as the police.

These 3 not only make you care for them, but you can almost ""feel"" their agony. ""Rebel"" is not just the tale of teens trying to fit-in. It is also about friendship.. it's about loyalty.. integrity, and the basic need to feel loved. That is what makes this movie so potent. That is why generation after generation have discovered, and embraced ""Rebel"". Times have changed, but human emotions haven't: We all long for human interaction, and companionship. And for 24 hours, at least, this family of 3 found it.  We should all be so lucky.",Rebel Without a Cause
162,ctrout,Jim Stark - The Ultimate Rebel,10,9 May 2005,"James Dean plays Jim Stark, a troubled teen who's come to a new town with his parents. These parents of his don't give him the love and respect he needs, and that's why he's so rebellious.In the new town, he discovers a girl (Natalie Wood) who gives Dean some of what he needs. He also finds a friend in a young boy played by Sal Mineo. Dean takes it upon himself to show Mineo the kind of friendship they both need.Rebel Without a Cause is somewhat of a psychological look at the concerns of a teenager and how they have needs and are growing people. They have growing minds and imaginations that can go wild. If their minds aren't tamed, they'll become rebellious like the ones in the movie. The film also takes a look at how parents seem to dislike their growing children and just try to let them handle themselves. Parents don't realize that all the teenagers need is a loving, caring relationship.Rebel Without a Cause is the poster for so many generations of teens today and years ago. It's as tough and gritty as it is thoughtful and the film will still pack a punch after all these years and for years to come.",Rebel Without a Cause
163,carljessieson,No,5,8 April 2015,"I was really excited about this one because of how iconic James Dean is and because I had never seen something with him in it before, and honestly, I was disappointed. I was really annoyed throughout the entire movie. I read a little bit more about the movie afterward and it enlightened me to the film's strengths that gave it ""classic"" status, which helped a little bit, but I can't ignore the fact that this was a really annoying movie.I don't usually pay too much attention to film titles, but this one truly says it all. Bunch of angry suburban kids causing mischief for no reason, essentially. I get that there was an element of emotional neglect from adults, which fueled their teenage debauchery, but it played out like a bunch of spoiled white kids messing everything up for everyone else because they didn't know how to deal with their problems. It's a real issue, this painful separation between generations, but this movie was so melodramatic about it. I hate to compare negatives (because a negative is a negative and that's that), but there are a multitude of other more important, more devastatingly horrible issues out there. I don't expect every movie to tackle an societal problem, I get that some movies are just fun, but if they wanted to make a drama about a problem, they should have picked something else. I just didn't care. I didn't feel bad for these kids.It was so dramatic, the story was weak, a vessel for the studio to make money off of Dean more than anything. That's like every Zac Efron movie. Not much substance, but with an exceptionally attractive male displaying both strength and sensitivity- it's a formula to make profit. That's why I'm surprised this is a classic. Seems like something a 1950s Teen Nick might put out for a quick buck or something. The story-telling was bizarre, also. They tried to do some kind of ""let's get this story started and fill in the blanks of his past later,"" which I've seen work many times, but it just didn't work here. I felt like I came into a movie halfway through, too many details merely implied, too many rapid jumps in story/relationships, just made it frustratingly mysterious for no reason. Pacing was so strange. Starts out ominous and tense, then after bad things happen, it gets light-hearted and silly.The only things I really enjoyed were the aesthetics, and I'm not sure how much credit they should get for that considering the ~aesthetics~ I enjoyed so much were just how things looked back then. I also did see the spark that has made James Dean so legendary despite his short career/life. His acting was over-the-top, in my opinion, at some points, but he really did have something about him that was fascinating.Such a bizarre film to me. By the time it was over I had more questions than I had answers and that is enormously frustrating. I really, really didn't like it but I'm so confused that I didn't enjoy such a widely beloved film so I might try to give it a viewing again but I highly doubt it.5/10 Bye love you",Rebel Without a Cause
164,lewis-51,An astoundingly fine movie,9,10 July 2009,"This is another one of those movies I knew I would eventually get around to seeing, but was in no hurry to do so. I figured I knew who James Dean was (having seen East of Eden a long time ago). I knew how he died. Yet another quasi- mythical actor persona. So I figured, OK a teenage coming-of-age movie with a dreamy-eyed actor version of Elvis. Ho hum.Wow, was I wrong. This is a really excellent movie, one of the top twenty or so I have ever seen. It is enormously more than just a teenage coming-of-age movie.It's understandable that all the reviews I have read of it here focus on the teenage aspect. After all, with three striking young stars, Dean, Wood, and Mineo, and a plot centered on teenagers and their parents, what else would you expect? And certainly there are many excellent pieces of dialog, plot, acting, and direction about teenagers, their angst, their self-serious self-involvement, their sexual awakenings, their striving to fit in, their parental difficulties. All of these things are really good. But there is more.The movie transcends that with its existential aspects. ""Who lives?"" asks Judy upon first meeting Jim. The planetarium show evokes the age old human questions, does anybody out there care? Is this all? The show at the planetarium emphasizes the death of the sun and the end of life on earth -- and who will care? Plato (love that name) is really scared, and Jim reaches out to him. When they are about to start the chicken race, Buzz and Jim have a conversation and Buzz says, ""we have to do something."" On one level, that's an evocation of teenage life, but on a deeper level it's an existential statement about all human beings. Teenagers are taken as a symbol for everyone.There is the wonderful symbol of putting a coat around someone. ""You are cold, I will warm you."" This is a recurrent theme, and a human answer to the existential dilemma.There are other symbols I love in this movie, like the recurring use of the color red, and the mismatched socks.I loved the secondary characters, especially the policeman, Jim's parents, his grandmother, and Judy's father (loved seeing William Hopper in a role away from Perry Mason). The opening ten minutes are really good. I loved the layout in the police station, and the sometimes understated interviews with the three main characters. The movie is full of wonderful little details, like Judy's compact in that opening sequence. A bit later we see that inside Plato's locker is a picture of Alan Ladd (so I've been told; I really didn't notice it that carefully). This movie was filmed right after the success of ""Shane"", in which Ladd starred as a powerful mentor or father figure. Plato desperately wanted such a person in his life.James Dean is really impressive. I've read Dean actually improvised several great little touches in the movie. Improvising was encouraged by the director, Ray. In the opening scene in the police station, he imitates a police siren. Later on when the three of them are exploring the abandoned mansion, as they approach the swimming pool they are discussing children. I forget exactly what he says, but Dean imitates Mr. Magoo (the cartoon character) and says something about kids. That's especially ironic, as Jim Backus was the voice of Mr. Magoo! Also, in the opening scene while the credits are rolling, he is playing with a mechanical monkey toy (and wrapping it in a blanket - there's that symbol again); this was improvisation. I've read that at first the plan was for that opening sequence to be much more violent, a sort of teenage gang war. I'm glad they dropped that.Also impressive was Sal Mineo. Wow. Only Natalie Wood as Judy disappointed me a bit. I think the character she plays is realistic, but somehow I wanted something more. On the whole though, the three leads are superb. Apparently the studio was first considering - get this - the two main roles to be filled by Tab Hunter and Jane Mansfield (!!)If you have any qualms about this movie because it's just another teenage juvenile delinquent movie, put that aside. I'm glad I did.henry",Rebel Without a Cause

He was a GOOD actor,yes, but certainly not a GREAT actor by any means, come on now, he made only three films,and REBEL was the one that gave him that ""icon of rebellion"" image. Had he lived, I'm not at all sure he would've lasted very long, after all, James the MAN was TOO rebellious and headstrong to hold up under the pressures any actor worth his salt has to be! Rather than compare him to young Brando (who had formally trained under Stella Adler), I'm more apt to class him with songstress Janis Joplin: Made a Big impression, briefly, then was gone.

167,pitsburghfuzz,Tear Jerker...,10,23 January 2010,"I recently bought this film at suncoast to watch it. (cuz well, i just like doing things like that). The film is about teenagers and fitting in. You have a teen named Jimmy Stark(Dean) who moves into a new neighborhood a lot because he simply can't fit in or people call him chicken. Plato(Mineo) becomes friends Stark, and is a fellow outcast too. Judy(Wood) hand out with the cool kids until later on in the film. The movie deals with conflicts that teens faced during the 50's and how they try to fit in. Judy, Plato, and Jimmy all lack a decent, solid father figure. Plato starts to look at Jimmy as his father. Dean's performance as Stark is outstanding and Sal Mineo as Plato is also a noteworthy performance. The film also proves that we all have our own problems too. The film gets very intense at parts, is more remembered for its tender moments. The film's ending is a tear jerker and you may need a tissue or two.

169,rose_lily,"There is no ""Rebel"" against society here",8,7 July 2013,"There is a more compelling sub-text running throughout than the accepted, facile storyline of rebellious teenagers suffering growing pains. There is nothing rebellious about this movie; it conforms and confirms cultural norms of the era. It's really about gender identity and how roles of men and women were defined in 1950s America. James Dean's performance is over-wrought and self- indulgent. He emotes throughout the movie like a recently toilet trained teenager who can't hold anything in—crying, moaning, bemoaning his life. His father, played effectively by Jim Backus, is an emasculated figure who tidies up the house wearing a ruffled apron. This poor specimen of a father figure is overridden and browbeaten by his supercilious, strident wife. The father is apparently not a ""real man."" He defers to his wife and lacks the courage to wear the pants in his own family. Jim is disappointed and ashamed of this role model of manhood. At the police station, angry with frustration, Jim tells the juvenile police officer the remedy he feels would fix ""the zoo"" that is his family life: ""If only he (his father) had the guts to knock Mom down onceshe'd be happy."" There you have it. The male/female template of the 1950s.In this film masculine translates into bully with a knife, teen boys who group together challenging each other in dangerous games proving masculine supremacy. These are their self-defined ""kicks,"" of which the ""chickie run"" proves fatal for Bud, the acknowledged king of the roost. Before the game's commencement the two opponents Jim and Bud face off positioned in their respective cars. Bud salutes his rival Jim christening him ""toreador."" Yah, this is it —two bulls in the bullring locking horns in man-to-man combat. Natalie Wood, as Judy, is tormented by what she perceives is her father's withdrawal of love for her. The 16 year old craves his attention, which has lessened as she has matured. He smears off her lipstick, calls her a tramp. He is repulsed by her daughterly hugs and kisses— she's now too old for that stuff. His discomfort with her demonstrative affection could more reasonably be affixed to a darker origin. Maybe Daddy is suppressing a taboo sexual desire for his own flesh and blood? Could it be?!Suppression is no stranger to Sal Mineo's character, Plato, a troubled gay kid, neglected by his parents, in frustration gunning down puppies and pining for the actor Alan Ladd whose photo he has pasted on the door of his school locker. But his desire for the man in the photo is displaced to his new friend Jim whom he stalks with devoted idolatry.All this said, the movie is an interesting curio, a time capsule of American society some 60 years ago. To use the word ""rebel' in the title is a disingenuous branding by the filmmakers. They had the savvy to know they were offering a mislabeled dish to the public. They used a catchword that would entice an audience who were craving more representations of the still novel, media dubbed: Teenagers of the Rock 'n Roll Generation.",Rebel Without a Cause
170,eplromeo8,Rebel Without a Cause on Reel 13,9,16 September 2008,"Every once and a while, a movie comes around that defines a generation. EASY RIDER, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and THE BREAKFAST CLUB are all Examples. I would argue, however, that no film better defines the generation it came from than REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, which aired last night on Reel 13. As a matter of fact, the cultural impact of the film as well as the legend of its star, James Dean, almost seem to overshadow what I was reminded of last night  what an artfully and skillfully crafted film it is.The first thing that struck me about REBEL upon rewatching it was the extraordinary richness of the color. Director Nicholas Ray was shooting in ""Warner Color"" (at the time, each studio was working with various labs to patent their own color process), but it's more than just the film stock or processing. Much of the beauty of the color has to do with the choices Ray makes in terms of the wardrobe or the objects  the red of Natalie Wood's overcoat in her first appearance, the colors in the observatory presentation, the yellow of an apron donned by Dean's screen father, Jim Backus (a.k.a. Mr. Magoo), the mustard color of Sal Mineo's wardrobe or the famous bright red coat Dean wears through much of the film. They all combine to create a beautiful palette worthy of paintings in the Louvre.The second thing that I noticed was consistently inspired framing and angles  and a lot of camera motion, which was not as prevalent in the period as it is today. Ray knows exactly when to be wide and just when a close up is called for. It seems as if he shot a lot more coverage than most directors of the period and used it to perfection. The scene where Wood and Dean are alone in the mansion is notable in the sense of how tightly the two of them are framed together in such a big house  as if they are the only two people in the world. Another example is during the first showdown at the observatory when the cool kids sit on Dean's car while he looks on from overhead. A few times, Ray cuts to an extreme low angle shot with the cool kids in the foreground with Dean and Sal Mineo very small and high in the way background. An unusual shot to be sure, but effective and telling. Other unorthodox ideas Ray sets forth in the film include the occasional Dutch angle (shots off the standard axis) that he uses in moments of extreme crisis (the scene with Dean's parents on the stairs and at the climax of the film). Ray has only recently been recognized as one of the era's premiere auteurs and his ahead-of-his-time work in Rebel only cements that theory.The third thing I noticed was the incredible subversiveness of the film, particularly in regards to the potential promiscuity of Natalie Wood's character (Judy) and the sexuality of Sal Mineo's character (Plato). Neither of these subjects were dealt with head-on as they were taboo at the time, but Ray certainly plants the seeds with subtleties and a clever usage of the mise-en-scene. In the beginning, the police detective subtly hints at why Judy was picked up and her relationship with her father seems awfully unusual  even for the time period. As to Plato, Sal Mineo's effemininity is one thing, but details like the picture of a male actor in his locker and the way he gazes at Dean throughout the film are strong clues as to the truth of Plato's problems  he is not just a boy whose parents abandoned him  he is a young gay teen in a society and era that rejects homosexuality. What's particularly interesting about how careful and hidden these subtexts are is that the film works hard to spell out the surface problems each of the characters have. At one point, Dean, who is still a high school student, theorizes that Plato was trying to make he and Judy his surrogate family (quite an analysis for a 17 year-old). These ""surface"" issues that the characters have are almost too easy and laid out for us that I wonder if the extent to which they offer analysis was in part to mask or draw attention away from the more subversive aspects to the film.If Ray is the brains behind the artistry of REBEL, James Dean is the heart and soul. As many of you know, he was a disciple of the Actors Studio in New York and their style of method acting, which was slowly permeating its way into the movies in the mid-50's (STREETCAR was the first major film that prominently featured this performance style). Out of his three films, EAST OF EDEN features the most method actors, GIANT is about half and half and as a result is a weird hybrid film in terms of performance and REBEL puts Dean all alone on his method island  which in a way, fits the narrative. It almost seems as if he's acting in a whole different movie. Wood is no match for him and is actually not very believable, particularly in her more emotional scenes. Similarly, Mineo's old-school theatrical performance style seems particularly archaic when pitted with Dean. Actually, only consummate character actor Edward Platt (who always seems to be playing lawyers, cops or doctors) seems to be anywhere close to Dean's level as the police psychologist Ray Fremick. With that said, Jim Backus (best known to most as Thurston Howell III on GILLIGAN'S ISLAND) is extremely sweet in his role as Dean's father. While he is by no means a naturalistic actor like Dean, his portrayal of weakness (read: spinelessness) is at times both bold and quite beautiful. Actors generally don't like to play characters that are weak, but Backus manages to do it with layers and dignity.",Rebel Without a Cause
171,sublime501,The classic story of not fitting in.,8,1 June 2004,"REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is that classic story of rebellion that we all know--a boy named Jim Stark (played by the brilliant James Dean) moves to a new town, and has a hard time fitting in with his new schoolmates. Despite his efforts to befriend the popular Judy (Natalie Wood) and fit in with her crowd, he gets turned away and must instead befriend the outcast Plato (Sal Mineo). But, Jim is also a nice guy and doesn't mind his company.*here be possible spoilers*One night, on another attempt to fit in and gain respect, Jim engages in what the kids call a ""chickie race,"" in which two boys drive stolen cars towards the edge of a cliff and see which one jumps from their car first. However, this race ends tragically when Judy's boyfriend, Buzz (Corey Allen) gets caught inside his car and is killed. Jim still earns no respect for the race, and is still unhappy as he goes back to his heckling parents (Jim Backus and Ann Doran) and his lonely life. Of course this is not how the movie ends, but I won't ruin that for you.REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is a great movie, and easy to relate to. It's technically a ""coming of age"" story, but it's not corny or cheesy in the least. Probably because it was made quite a while ago, and is considered a classic, and does stand the test of time. All of the technical aspects are in good shape--scripting, directing, and casting are all great.And as for the acting... well, what is there to say. I adore James Dean, and he was a brilliant and beautiful actor, but there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said about him before or that would do him justice. The only way to understand his legacy is to see him in action. As for the rest of the cast, everyone is great, namely the other two leads, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo (sadly, both have passed as well as Dean).*here be more possible spoilers*The only flaw I could see in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is how unrealistic it is in parts. After Buzz is killed, Judy seems to show virtually no emotion about it. We don't even see her crying over the accident. And then, that very same night, she gets together with Jim? She must be one heartless witch if so. However, this seemed pretty inevitable from the beginning, so I can't say much.Aside from that one gripe, I really can't think of anything else bad to say about REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. It's a great old movie that I'm sure will remain a classic for another 50 years. And I hope it does. 8/10.",Rebel Without a Cause

This film is a landmark movie in so many ways it is virtually impossible to cover all of its bases in one short review. What can be said about it? It was the first film to portray teenagers from well to do families as also being deeply unhappy. Prior to this movie, all movies that portrayed restless youth were always from the ""slums"", which is why they were going against the law. Not in this movie - the neglect of Jim Stark's parents causes his unhappiness. What else can be said - this film features an absolutely phenomenal performance by dean - he was truly destined for stardom.

Natalie Wood and Dean clicked well together since she played an unhappy girl whose father, played by William Hopper did not show enough love for her; her smart-aleckiness was also a veneer for her personal unhappiness.
Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams lent great support as two hoods after him, Wood,and the lonely, shy boy played by Sal Mineo. Jim Backus was the serious father who should have shown more support for his confused son, as his grandmother and mother should have shown as well; this was something of a serious turn for Backus, but he adapted well to this role.

Even though they're old and some lines seem out of time and some plot points seem too obvious cause they were copied hundreds of times, they have a certain flair that makes them watchable. In the case of Rebel without a cause, I fear, this wasn't the case. People in their Mid- Twenties play characters who go to High School. James Dean was a grown up man but acts like a 13 year old through out the movie. It was so ridiculous, I thought at first: Wait, was this supposed to be a parody? The only character that wasn't miscast was Plato. It just didn't fit. But that wasn't the only problem. Take for example the scene after the chicken run. Judy's boyfriend just died in a car accident, but then Jim gives her back her make-up mirror and she's happy again. Come on! I'm not willing to believe that people were so stupid back in the 50ies. And it wasn't just James Dean's rebel that had no cause. Hardly anything that anybody did in this movie had any kind of reason at all. It was anarchy, and you could argue that that was the point of the movie, but I consider that lack of motivation for the character's actions were indeed a failure in the attempted psychological approach.

180,philfromno,My favorite Nick Ray film,10,8 September 2002,"Nicholas Ray may be the most distinctive American director of the 1950s, and certainly the most deeply romantic.  His career was marked by indiosyncratic stories about characters driven by deep internal conflicts, inward violence and outward sexual confusion.  Rebel Without A Cause is the film where all of his themes meet, and slightly edges out Johnny Guitar and In A Lonely Place as my favorite Ray film.Some people will certainly find the dialogue here to be rather stilted, and the performances melodramatic.  I won't argue.  Ray's films in general opposed 'realism' (that most unreal of artistic concepts) in favor of the mythic.What's particularly satisfying about the film is its cohesiveness, binding together its many disparate events and characters with highly parallel themes and motifs.  All of its central characters seem caught in psychosexual conflicts rife with familial gender conflict.  Jim (James Dean) is caught between a weakling, effeminated father and a domineering but inneffectual mother.  Judy (Natalie Wood) and her father are seperated by his uncomfortable relation to her sexuality.  Plato (Sal Mineo), worst of all, is a practical orphan, who suffers all the more for his just under the surface homosexuality. (It's interesting to note here that Plato may be Hollywood's first sympathetic of a gay character.)  All of them are driven by internal demons springing from these conflicts.As usual, Ray is a remarkably sensitive photographer.  And here he proves himself a master of color.  There are too many beautiful scenes to mention here, but the planetarium scene (with the recorded voiceover about human loneliness) beginning of the 'chickie run' are both stunning.The film seems divided between claustrophobic nightmares and utopian fantasies.  The skewed camera angles of Jim's scenes with his parents contrast with the heavenly dream of teenage paradise in the abandoned house. The staircase motif seems to mark several of these transitions.In any case, this is a stunning film by a consummate artist, and should certainly be viewed apart from the distorting lens of the James Dean myth. Dean, for his part, is remarkable here, although, as I stated above, the performances here are in a style far removed from what today's audiences are accustomed to.It's quite silly to say, as several people have here, that this film's themes are 'dated'.  They seem to be the constant themes of youth: idealism vs. cynicism, the turmoil of sexual awakening, the desire to fit in, and the internal violence that constantly threatens to become external.  To say that these no longer apply because these kids have never heard of ecstasy or the crips is like saying that ""Hamlet"" no longer rings true because nobody swordfights anymore.My one complaint about this film is with the title.  Certainly quite dramatic, it sounds more like a marketing tagline than any kind of description of the goings on of this film.  Jim seems less like a rebel than a young man caught in an inescapable turmoil, and his reaction to the final tragedy belies his lack of a cause.  But this is a minor complaint, and I can recommend this film without reservation.",Rebel Without a Cause
181,hiproductions,"Performances were excellent, this picture is truly one of most outstanding of the 50s.",7,27 May 2005,"I saw this film for the 2nd time, expecting to get nothing new whatsoever out of it. I was delighted. I recognized things about this movie that brought out its fullness. I loved the visual storytelling that goes on in this picture. The scene when all 3 characters Jim Stark (James Dean), Judy (Natalie Wood), and Plato (Sal Mineo) are all gathered in the police station on screen at once but in 3 different worlds. The only thing dividing them was the thin glass of the office windows. I also noticed a theme about the jacket that was great. First Plato wouldn't even acknowledge Jim's gesture or jacket, toward the end it is put over him as he sleeps, and then he is shot while wearing it and Jim zips him up in it as they carry him off. It demonstrated growth and change in the relationship in a visual way.Ray had fascinating shots such as when the Starks family is arguing over what to do about the fatal crash incident and whether or not to inform the police. The camera tilted to and fro giving an insane look at the situation which was fitting considering the parents were relating to the child in an insane way. The performances were excellent and this picture is truly one of most outstanding of the fifties. I paid particularly close attention to targeting schemes from Hollywood in this film in that it was a significant contributor to a new genre. The jazz/saxophone music in the background during the planetarium scene in the beginning was VERY similar to ""West Side Story"" and the clothing the ""bad"" kids wore: leather jackets , T-shirts, and blue jeans were taken from the beat generation poets and later ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wanderers"" were to capitalize on this fashion and embed it in our minds. Watching it the second time I FINALLY recognized what Dean was rebelling about: his father's milk toast approach to manhood. It was good to see Jim's father (Jim Backus) assure his son that he would be as strong as he needed him to be. This cemented the rebel's victory for his cause.",Rebel Without a Cause

This movie started the teensploitation movement so heavily felt in the past 5 years.  The difference is Nick Ray and of course, James Dean.  A typical portrayal of family life in the mid 50's, Rebel was a little thin at times. Natalie Wood annoyed me a lot.  I really can't blame her.  She was only sixteen and I doubt she would have defied Nick Ray, so she performs too often forcing what was most likely Ray's instruction.  Mineo is better, harboring geniune emotions.  Cory Allen and Dennis Hopper are the only goons who aren't stereotypical buffoons.  But rising above it all, defying Nick Ray and even his fellow actors at times.. is Dean.

184,Yesh4,Classic teen movie,9,11 September 2014,"As a teenager myself, I absolutely love teen movies and have probably seen most of them. This one I stumbled on to, I think when I was reading something about James Dean. I had heard of him being a legend etc. but I never really paid much attention to ''old Hollywood movies'' but this one looked really good plus I wanted to see what made Jimmy Dean so legendary. I mean to have only done three movies before his untimely death and to be regarded as one of the best actors of all time he must have done something right.Well I must say that if there ever has been a more beautiful man that James Dean was, I have not seen him! He just exuded coolness in that iconic red jacket. Normally I would think ''yeah right, someone as attractive as James Dean being an outcast!''. However, he portrayed his character with shyness,innocence and angst or something that really made you empathise and believe his character.In terms of the issues explored in the movie, it really is something that I haven't seen many times before. Normally, in teen movies the focus is friends or getting laid etc. but this focuses on something way more important to teens' lives: parents. James' character how all he wanted was to do something right and be appreciated by his parents. How he wanted his dad to stand up to his mum who stripped his dad of his dignity. And Natalie Woods' who just wanted her dad to show her love and affection.I think the most interesting character was Plato, his estranged parents meant that he had no family, so wanted Jim and Judy to be his family. I felt that Plato's obsession with Jim bordered on homosexual and that's one of the many ways that made the film ahead of its time.To sum up, everyone should go and see this movie, amazing performances and even though it's so old it doesn't feel dated and we can all relate to it. The events happening aren't realistic but the portrayal of teen angst is the most realistic I've seen and makes the film compelling down to the last second.",Rebel Without a Cause

Rebel Without a Cause is a sad movie that show us that a not understood character may be relevant not to their parents, the people they love, or even themselves, but just to an audience in a theatre.
When we get that, we care about the characters.I Don't get people saying this is really bad, I think they should take another look at it.If this movie is so trivial - as the teenagers problems - as most people say, well, we probably will forget it in ten years from now (and like my teenage problems, I don't think so).",Rebel Without a Cause

He plays the deeply tormented teen Jim Stark, who cannot stand living in a superficial society that refuses to show him any love. Of course, Jim's social criticisms are as true to life today as they were when the film was originally released. This is what maintains the film's elemental power. Writer/director Nicholas Ray shows how sometimes rebellious teens understand the world better than their clueless parents.Nicolas Ray's use of color is nothing short of spectacular. Each character is dressed in clothes that express their heartfelt emotions. Jim's immortal red jacket is the perfect symbol of his fragile nerves and restless heart, which spends the entire movie searching for love and acceptance.As is the case with his other two films, East of Eden and Giant, James Dean is the movie.

189,shadock-2,"Watch ""Giant"" instead",7,26 January 2001,"James Dean's first movie and a credible performance.  Too bad the movie's plot is a bit contrived and the acting, including Dean's, seems very strained at times - as if the actors were going to start laughing out loud at the hackneyed lines in the script.One would have hoped that with this movie's reputation and solid cast, it might have held up better over the last forty-odd years.  The movie tries to explore just why our protagonist is going through a tough time in his life. Every other teenage angst movie made since came up with the correct answer - that's what happens to teenagers.  The premise of the movie is that Dean's behaviour is ""unusual"" for a teenager of that generation despite the fact that every other teenage character in the movie is going through the same thing, even though their mothers don't pick-up and move when their kids get in trouble.The best you can say about this film is all of the cast takes it seriously. For a 60's baby like me (okay, late 1950's), seeing Ed Platt as anything else than ""The Chief"" and Jim Backus as anyone other than ""Mr. Howell"" is a treat in itself.  In one famous and outrageous scene, the emasculated Backus, playing Dean's father, is dressed in a frilly apron and preparing dinner while he talks to his son about problems he really doesn't understand.  You try doing that with a straight face.  Rounding out the cast are Sal Mineo and a very young Natalie Wood.Watch this strictly for historical purposes, not to be entertained.  Dean only made three movies, so even though I haven't seen either of them, they've got to give his considerable talents a better chance at expression than this exploitation flick did.",Rebel Without a Cause

The setting is a small town, where the majority of the students spend their nights wandering around like punks and breaking the law, for ""You have to find something to do"". Not only is it a critique on the present society, it also takes a deeper look into the teenage mind, not as complicated as one thinks and often needs very little to be fulfilled.

192,ericglunneborg,This movie shows the rebls of the fifties,7,6 April 2004,"At a first glance, `Rebel without a cause,' appears to be a typical story about  teenagers in the mid 1950's who rebel against their elders.  But is this really portrayed in the film?  In the reviewer's opinion, yes, and no. Sometimes it actually shows a little bit of rebellion, and other times it shows pure mischief.	At the beginning of the story, Jim Stark      (James Dean) is staggering around late at night  and he passes out in the street.  Moments later, he is at the police station with his parents, and it appears that he is drunk. His parents were worried sick about him.  His mom, throughout the whole movie is a control freak, and his dad is almost too lenient with him.  The next day, he meets Judy (Natalie wood) and seems to be in love with her.  He is on his way to school and he offers Judy a ride, but her boyfriend Buzz and all of his friends (who appear to be thugs) pick her up and take her to school.  On that same day, there is a fieldtrip at the planetarium for the school that he is now attending.  At this field trip, he meets a  student named Plato who has no friends, and somehow they become best friends.  After the fieldtrip is over, Jim walks out to his car to find  Judy, and her thugs standing around his car.  Buzz tries to start a knife fight with him, but he loses when the police showed up on the scene.  In turn, Buzz challenges Jim to a rematch latter on that night.  Jim shows up to the rematch, and finds out that he is going to be playing `chicken run' with Buzz and two stolen cars.  As the two are  racing towards the cliff, Jim decides to jump out of his car before it is too late.   Buzz on the other hand, is too proud of himself, and without realizing, he  traps  himself in his car.   As a result of that, Buzz drives his car over the cliff and dies.  Everyone who is there watching ran away, except for Jim, Judy, and Plato .  Jim goes back home to tell his parents what has happened.  His parents freaked out and told him to lay low.  He ignores their orders and  tries to turn himself in to the police, but is unsuccessful .  At that same time, Buzz's thugs are assuming that he is going to turn them in, so they try to kill him.  Jim, Judy, and Plato   met up near an old abandoned mansion to protect themselves from the thugs that are after them.  While they are there, the thugs showed up on the scene and are chasing after Plato ,  who  shot one of the thugs and ran.  At that point, the police hear shots and see Plato    running out of the mansion and heading up to the planetarium. This is when the standoff began between Plato   and the police.  Jim and Judy see what is happening and decide to help him by sneaking in to the planetarium and luring him out. The plan almost works well, except when  Plato   steps out side, he panics and fires shots at the police, causing him to get shot by them.  Jim's parents show up with the police on the scene to find that their son is not hurt.   Jim introduces Judy to his parents.  To the reviewer, this is a sappy ending.
James Dean does an excellent job playing Jim, who is supposed to be a rebel, but appears to be more of a former troublemaker who doesn't want to fight, and hates the name chicken.  So in a sense he doesn't really act rebellious. But he seems to have had a few run -ins with the law, so he was probably rebellious at one time.  As the girls would probably say, `Whoa, what a stud.'Natalie Wood's portrayal of Judy shows that she is a girl that just wants to have fun.  Because her dad abuses her and her mother doesn't give a darn, she has no one to hang around with, except  Buzz.  The only bad part is, after Buzz's death, she pays attention to Jim.  It is as if she didn't care about Buzz's death at all,  or maybe she forgot.The reviewer would rate this movie a 3-1/2 gold stars out of five gold stars.  The characteristics were good and the movie was funny in some places, but the story did not seem to point anyone out as being a rebel, just a few mischievous teenagers.",Rebel Without a Cause
193,Manuja,""" Rebel"", the title says it all!",9,31 January 2005,"The movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is a microcosm of youth. It deals with the emotional burdens carried by young people who have a society around them that just don't understand them at all. Anyone who's been a teenager can identified with the feelings of disconnection and frustration portrayed by the characters. ""Rebel"" ,attempts for the first time to portray teens as they really are, deeply disturbed and searching desperately for a connection. These are the universal malaise of teenagers and young adults. The fact is that no one takes you seriously, but expects a lot of from you nonetheless. This movie is timeless. The first real ""teen angst"" movie that was ever made. The success of ""Rebel"", has in my opinion never been matched in any teen movie since. Possibly only closely rivaled by films such as ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"". This movie was a very provocative one for it's times. The 1950's where a very conventional time, and this movie's contents where very controversial. The subject matter in this movie is best termed as dark. It deals with subjects such as depression, neglect, violent and suicidal tendencies etc, which where possibly taboo subjects at the time, especially in regards to teenagers. The acting was superb. James Dean especially, followed by excellent performances by Natalie Wood, and Sal Menio, and good performances by he rest of the supporting cast too. It's amazing how James Dean is still a youth icon 50 years after his death. His looks and personality have a timeless quality, and his early death only enhanced the allure, and mystery surrounding him. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is a great dramatic movie, with excellent writing and cinematography, rivaled only by the sensitivity of the performances. Its worth a watch and I give it a thumbs up!",Rebel Without a Cause
194,harfordamanda,One of the best,10,14 February 2010,"There's almost too much that can be said about RWAC. For one there's James Dean. If anyone ever doubted his acting ability they need to take seat, watch and shut their mouths. His portrayal of Jim Stark a lonely, misunderstood and underrated teen is probably one of the best performances to ever grace a strand of film. Natalie Wood of course did a wonderful job of Judy whose need for love at times out shines Dean's lead character and Sal Mineo's best work is seen through Plato's eyes.The film begins when Jim is taken to the police station for drunkenness where we also meet our two other principal characters Judy and Plato. Judy is there because of a fight she got into with her inattentive father after he called her a dirty tramp for wearing lipstick of which she ran away from home and was then picked up by the police. Plato is there for drowning puppies which he could not give a reason for. Later Jim's parents come in and begin arguing which really upsets Jim. After that officer (Ray) takes Jim into a back room and eases him by letting Jim vent his anger on a desk and tells him to call if things begin to go over the edge again with his folks. All go home and begin and new day. The next day Jim meets Judy and The Kids, a gang of delinquents that Judy calls her friends and who is girlfriend to the leader Buzz. Later, on a field trip to the planetarium, Jim consoles Plato who was frightened during the show and then shows off to The Kids to get Judy's attention. Outside Buzz and Jim get into a knife fight and after Jim wins is invited by Buzz to participate in a ""chickie-run"" which Jim agrees. That night, at the bluff, Buzz tells Jim that he actually likes him but that they ""gotta do something"" just to prove themselves to the rest of the gang but once again Jim's main goal is to prove him self to Judy. The race begins and Jim ends up jumping before he reaches the edge only to watch Buzz drive off it due to the fact that his jacket got caught on the door. Buzz dies and the gang scatters. Jim takes Judy home and contemplates whether he should tell the police. Meanwhile Plato is accosted by Buzz's friends mainly Crunch and Goon who are scared that they'll be turned into the cops. Plato gets away and runs home to grab his mother's gun as protection. Crunch, Goon and a few others then proceed to find Jim to stop him from ratting them out. Jim gets in another fight with his parents and leaves for the police station. Discovering that his police friend Ray is out Jim calls Judy but is rudely hung up on by her father. Judy hears this and sneaks out to find Jim. Plato, Judy and Jim meet up after Plato warns him about the gang coming for them and tells them they can hide out in an abandoned mansion by the planetarium. They go there but are soon found out by the gang and the police. Plato shoots one of the gang and then runs to planetarium locking himself inside. Jim and Judy go after him and Jim attempts to talk Plato out of doing anything rash. He takes the gun and removes the bullets hiding them in his pocket from Plato after he gives Plato the gun back. All is well until they begin to leave the building. upon seeing the gun and officer shoots Plato only to learn quickly afterwords that Jim had the bullets. Plato dies and Jim's father consoles him realizing that he has to stand up for his son and to stop taking verbal abuse from his wife. As they leave Jim introduces Judy to his parents and they go home, so ends the movie.Rebel is certainly one of the most time appropriate movies for it's time even with Plato's gay undertones which you can either agree or disagree with. I never really thought about Plato being gay, I always considered it just how James Dean's character Jim described it ""that he just wanted to be part of a family"" and that he considered Judy and Jim his family. I did see though how Plato could be thought of as gay but I don't think that's really a major issue in the film. You can definitely see the closeness in the cast and especially if you look at the behind the scenes footage which makes it even more apparent. It all clicks, the story, the cast, the locations...it's everything that great movies should be and sadly aren't anymore in this day and age. Even though this film is set in the 50's i think many of the problems between the parents and the kids are very real today as they were then which makes Rebel just as relate-able to kids now. It's timeless and tragic all in one which makes ""Rebel Without A Cause"" one of the best.",Rebel Without a Cause
195,Blondeatheart56,Buy Worthy,9,8 April 2004,"`Rebel without a Cause' was a very good movie.  It was one that some, not all, teenagers could relate to.  It involved trouble with the parents, trouble with peers, and young `love.'  It was also very entertaining.  It isn't one of those movies that at some point would make someone so bored that they get up to go get some food or do something else.  It holds the viewer's attention.  Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's dramatic, and sometimes it's just plain interesting to watch.  Overall, `Rebel without a Cause' is definitely a movie worth seeing over and over again.`Rebel without a Cause' stars some familiar actors/actress like James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Jim Backus, all of which are very good at what they do. All three are really talented and make the movie worth sitting on the couch for an hour and a half to watch it.  At some times in the movie the acting does seem a little, well, strange.  Those are the times when the audience might laugh, even though that particular line or scene wasn't meant to be funny.  Despite all that, the acting is pretty good and very entertaining.This is one of those movies where there is music being played throughout almost the entire film.  Doing that sort of makes the movie seem livelier and more entertaining.  The acting grabs the viewer's attention and the music helps to keep it.  The music in `Rebel without a Cause' fits the scene that it is being played in.  If it was a romantic scene, there would be romantic music, and if it was a fighting scene, there would be loud and exciting music.  In most of the older movies that this reviewer has seen whenever a gun goes off there is a loud bang and smoke leaving the gun, which could be considered a special effect.  But in `Rebel without a Cause' whenever a gun goes off, and guns go off quite often, there is just a very loud bang with no smoke.  This reviewer has never used a gun and does not know which depiction of a gun shot is more realistic but both seem to get the point across that they have a gun and it is being shot.`Rebel without a Cause' is a great movie, even though it may take a while for some to think that.

Rebel without a cause is a great film that explores the teenage psyche, the alienation and confusion that kids go through. The first scene sets the tone of film, and the miserableness that Jim stark (James Dean) is going through. Jim Stark has just moved to a new city and it's his first day of school. Accidentally he walks on the school emblem and gets bullied for it, at this point he's has not even entered the school and you already feel sorry for the poor fella. When Jim actually reaches the school, he finds out that all the juniors and seniors are going to the local planetarium for a field trip. After the spectacular show of how the world will end, Jim makes a comment to the tough crowd of the school which gets him in big trouble, and thus arises the drama of the film The great thing about this film is that the writer introduced the main characters within the first scene of the film, right off the bat you're wondering what can these people have in common? Throughout the whole movie you wonder what is going to happen next. Rebel without a cause is not just an action packed film full of teenage drama but it's romantic and very hilarious. The actors and actresses were great in all their roles, James Dean who plays Jim Stark does a great job with making the audience feel his emotions in every scene. Natalie Wood who plays Judy, Jim Stark's love interest, really pulls off that bitch personality who you just grow to love as her character grows in the film. The best role of all was Plato played by Sal Mineo who maybe just a little mentally ill and just wants to feel needed.There was not much music in the film. The only scene with music, which the reviewer can remember is when Jim Stark has his radio on which played popular music of that time.

197,Blondi85,A great movie,8,17 April 2004,"Definition of rebel: 1.To act in or show disobedience 2. To feel or exhibit anger or revulsion. Drag racing, alcohol consumptions, running away from home all define rebellious things. Three teenagers with different backgrounds but in general have the same family issues come together while doing some of those rebellious actions. Jim Stark (James Dean), Judy (Natalie Wood) Plato (Sal Mineo) are the stars of this movie. They worked very well together. What made this film so great was the storyline because it seemed real. Three different characters who are different but yet the same because they all have the same problems, they are all crying out for help. This happens in everyday life which made the movie not just a flick. It had enough depth, but not too much where it would be confusing.No wonder why James Dean was such an icon of the 50s. He is not only good looking but a great actor. He was dramatic, charming and played a great rebel. Natalie Wood did well also. She did great playing a teenager girl just wanting a more affectionate family. Sal Mineo had one of the best performances in the film though. He played a lonely, lost teenage boy so well. He will definitely make the viewer feel his sadness. This is a movie icon of the 50s era. It is a great film and highly recommended to see.",Rebel Without a Cause

A simple and provoking story and the first film to deal with teenage angst as a story. Dean again makes the film a classic , the image of him in a red windbreaker , jeans , boots and a white t-shirt have become one of the most famous looks in popular culture , the way Dean portrays Stark is one of the most realistic performances ever , he really makes the viewer feel the angst and hormone ridden emotions that his character feels. The scenes which really show this are often with his parents where his feelings contrast with their lack of understanding. Natalie wood and Sal Mineo also give memorable performances as two other young kids who's own emotional troubles help them to connect with Dean's character however once again Dean is the show stealer here. A great film and probably the best film depicting teenage unrest and still holds up just as emotionally dramatic and challenging today as it did over 50 years ago.",Rebel Without a Cause
201,TheNihalGursoyOfficial,Teenagers Will Always Be Teenagers,6,23 September 2014,"The main topic and message this movie is trying to give is a very universal theme; teenagers. Its been almost 7 decades since this movie has been shot and what the movie is trying to convey can still be applied to our day and that is, the problem with being a teenager. The problem with not knowing where you belong and where you should be.Time Stark and his fellow friends each represent this problem. However, the movie's main concern isn't this problem. In my opinion, the movie's main concern is how parents lead to this problem and lack in bonding with their teenager to fix this problem.The movie does a great job in showing reckless teenagers, but does an even better job showing the more reckless parents. Society should question themselves here. Why are teenagers having these problems? What is the core of the problem? The answer is easy; family. In the end of the movie this is what I understand and I believe that it is a great message to give. So one factor that makes this movie successful is the main theme and message it gives. There are other factors also; like the acting of the main characters and especially Tim Stark. However, without going onto further detail with the other factors of why the movie is good, I want to also mention why I dropped 4 stars out of the movie.The movie is definitely saying something but it loses one star from the lack of ability to combine effective music with the scenes. It loses the second star from the inefficient acting ability of the background actors. Next, it loses the third star from some unneeded scenes that just took up time. For example, the scene with Tim's parents and his dialogs with his father were very lengthy. Lastly, it loses the fourth star because of lack of emotion in the movie. The movie could have raised its standards with the use of more emotional scenes. After all, teenage years are one of the most emotional years of a human's lifetime. Therefore, it can be said that it is a sufficient movie with a nice little message that could have been conveyed better.",Rebel Without a Cause
202,JPTaylor,A complex and unique coming-of-age story.,9,8 April 2004,"Rebel Without A Cause is a coming-of-age story.  It manages to be both simple and complex, with interwoven themes of maturity, decisions, rebellion, friendship and love.  Ultimately, though, Nicholas Ray's film asks the viewer: what makes a man?James Dean stars as Jim Stark, whose name represents his character quite well.  He is a confused yet passionate, questioning everything around him, wanting desperately to define himself in a complicated world.  James Dean's portrayal is excellent - he is intense and intriguing, able to convey level-headedness and wild emotion and switch between the two without missing a beat.Jim Stark begins the movie with a prolongued shot of him prone on the ground, completely drunk and playing with a toy of some sort.  His tie and jacket tell us that he is from a good background, thus we can tell that he is a rebel - completely out of his environment, in a world he doesn't belong in.  The toy represents the danger he flirts with - he continuously skirts the edge of real trouble - this can be seen from a prologue that was not included in the final film, which explains the story behind that toy.
We follow Jim through his first day at a new school, where he quickly meets up with and befriends ""Plato"", showcasing an impressive performance by Sal Mineo.  Plato is a wiry and loyal ally who wants only to find friendship and stability in his life.  His emotions are high-strung at all times.  At first seeming like the typical tag-along stereotype, one eventually realizes his character is one of the most deep and significant in the film.Going on a field trip to a local observatory, Jim almost immediately finds himself again in the midst of the adversity he had been trying to escape from.  Without giving any details, a few mistakes here eventually build up to the plot that drives the story.""Rebel Without A Cause"" tells a unique and significant story.  Aside from a few flaws - Natalie Wood's shallow and uninteresting character comes to mind - the film is extremely engaging and intriguing.  It rings with complex ideas and fascinating characters.  Its universal themes ensure that it will remain a classic with audiences of any age.",Rebel Without a Cause
203,kaleidoscope_eyess,a campy romance,9,23 October 2019,"At first glance, Rebel Without a Cause would look like the pioneer of all coming-of-age films or even teen dramas. We have seen enough white teens moaning about their unfulfilled dreams, their unreturned love interests, etc. etc. So what exactly distinguishes Rebel Without a Cause from its later counterparts, except for it being the first in line? I would say the answer lies in its juxtaposition of mundanity of grotesque school life of self-important teens and immortality of bigger-than-life romanticist fantasies.A lot of scenes in Rebel Without a Cause are too reminiscent of our school life that has been inevitably embellished by bullying, gossiping and preaching. This, and the very attempt to rebel, can all be summarized by an excellent mark from Jim's father: ""You'll look back 10 years later and think of how stupid you are."" The point is, Rebel Without a Cause is quite candid about our stupid past -- unlike its ill-advised descendants who tried to glorify school years via, well, another series of preaching. Rather, Rebel Without a Cause makes our dumb past appear dumber by adding campy quality to it. The performance by James Dean is, for sure, a perfect example (even designated by Susan Sontag as the quintessential camp!). Dean looks so ridiculous in his suits, especially when he affects a touch of adolescent angst. The score, more suitably placed in a thriller, reminds you of the film's non-realist approach as well.Rebel Without a Cause incorporates romanticist imaginations into ordinary school life. Out of astronomy classes grows a magnificent panorama of the whole universe. Getting rid of formal dress code a nude James Dean puts on a white shirt and a red jacket. Not even to mention the car race -- what can be more romantic than a ride to win over a girl's heart, in which you almost lose your life? It is also cute than Jim has to remedy the ugly situation.The teens are such an ignored group that not only their lives have not been given enough attention, but written stories about them also often fall to the category of trying-too-hard/over-sentimental storytelling. Rebel Without a Cause is astonishingly honest about school life, yet the film counterbalances its banality with an immortal romanticist elevation.",Rebel Without a Cause
204,ranndino,Yet another example of why Hollywood before 1960's was terrible.,2,8 August 2012,"I'm a huge movie fan and am very picky about the movies I watch. Not to sound like a snob, but I more and more find myself staying away from the big budget blockbusters that Hollywood produces at the rate of a Chinese factory because they're getting more and more vapid. I'm no film hipster and can enjoy an occasional blockbuster, but suspending my disbelief is getting harder and harder. The same thing can be said just about any Hollywood movie I've seen that's been made before 1960's. Once in a while I give a chance to some cult classic made in the 1950's just to see it for myself and I end up incredibly disappointed every single time. The style in which the movies were made back then just absolutely crushes my soul. It's as if they were made for 10-year olds by 12-year olds who were trying to teach them some wisdom that they thought they had. The plot of this film is ridiculous, the conflicts are unimportant, trivial things blown out completely out of proportion, the directing is horrible, the acting is terrible (seems to be straight from an acting class at your local adult education program). The whole movie is incredibly naive in every single way and entirely not believable. Everything is overplayed, people don't act anywhere close to how people act in real life and the dialogue is plain stupid. The lines are pompous, simplistic and aimed to squeeze cheap emotion out of the audience who the authors clearly think are stuck at the 3rd grade level.I understand that some of the themes this film brings up were revolutionary for 1955, but everything about the way it was made is amateurish at best. It's like watching some of your not particularly bright friends try to shoot something important with their camcorder. I've seen better acting, directing and writing in many modern film school shorts. This might really be the last time I'll give a film of that era a chance. I watched this on the plane so had time to waste and even then I hesitated. The curiosity of having heard so much about it and its top billed star, James Dean got the better of me, but I will never know how I managed to finish watching it. Almost turned it off on numerous occasions. I also have a very hard time seeing how anyone watching it today can pretend that this is a great movie. I may have enjoyed it back then or now... if I were 12.",Rebel Without a Cause
205,ShanghaichickS,excellent!!!,10,8 April 2004,"Rebel without a cause is in no doubt an awesome movie!!! This movies main star is stars James Dean (Jim). Its for the most part about a bunch of ""gangster"" like teenage kids that are classified as punks and trouble makers, as we all are; it just kinda come with the territory. This movie accuratly displays the rebelion of teenagers, and their desire and longer to just fit it. In the film Jims family (James Dean) moves to another state...and has to just start over somewhat. Jim feels very very alone, and will do just about anything to fit in with the rest of the crowd. The opening scene of the movie shows Jim lying on the street, nearly passed out. Shortly after he is seen in a police station totally intoxicated, walking around like a crazy drunk. Police men try to tame him and get him to sit down, but nothing will stop him. He continues to yell out random things, and is nearly tripping over himself. Throughout the movie the producer continues to show the differention between parents and their teenagers. Their longing to undertand them, and the things that not only tear them apart, but that bring them together. Im going to stop right here cause I definetly do not want to spoil the film for anyone..but I will say this..... EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! It is just such a classic, and the charisma of Dean and the unexplainable attration to him is just phenominal and draws you into his character.

207,eyeluvhotboyz,"Not just a movie, an emotion",8,7 April 2004,"The movie Rebel Without a Cause is about a boy that is on the verge of manhood.  This movie really does a fantastic job of capturing the human emotion.  It shows the bonds that can be formed between friends, girls, and family.  James Dean plays Jim Stark, a boy with a bad past trying to make it in a new town.  Throughout the movie, it shows Jim with his dad, played by Jim Backus.  This relationship is a horrible one.  Jim looks to his dad for answers, but all he gets are ramblings that don't answer the question at all.  His dad doesn't really know how to `be the man' so it presents problems between the two.   This movie also shows a relationship between Jim and Plato, played by Sal Mineo.  Plato is the first person to really befriend Jim.  This is sort of a weird friendship, partially because Plato is a very troubled boy.  At one point, on the first day that they met, a girl asked Plato how long he had known Jim.  He then comes up with a story about how they have known each other for a long time, and that Jim lets his close friends call him Jamey. This is all untrue information.  Finally, this movie, as with most movies, has a love story in it.  This one is, however, slightly `screwed up', for lack of better terms.  Towards the beginning of the movie a chicken game is played.  This is when two people race towards a cliff and the first to jump out of the car is a chicken. Well, the guy that Jim was playing with got caught in his car and careened off the cliff, and died. The girlfriend of this guy was Judy, played by Natalie Wood.  Not only did she not show that she was upset in any way, but also not long after the crash, she was telling Jim that she loved him.Overall, this movie is good if you like drama.  It shows the human feelings very well, and is not a predictable movie.  The only not-so-great aspect was the love story.  Most likely this is not a movie to take children to.  This reviewer gives it an 8 out of 10.",Rebel Without a Cause

209,clarinetgirl25,A great movie filled with good values,6,5 April 2004,"Throughout a persons life they learn many lessons that are necessary to progress in life. The idea of pride is taught and each person in their experiences is humbled and learns the misconception of pride. A young person develops into the person they will be for the rest of their lives and in that season of time the loneliness of being lost is experienced. After time people finally realize that family is the most important thing in this life and that they can always depend on them. All of these fundamental concepts needed throughout life are shown in `Rebel without a cause.' 	Although this movie is famous among many people just because of James Dean (Jim Stark), it surprisingly contains the idea of the evil of pride. Throughout literary classics pride has been the down fall of the hero. In Greece this was known as the characters `hubris' and was the very downfall to such hero's as Oedipus. This is the very climax to this movie as Jim plays chicken in a car with a cliff. This stupidity results in killing another young man, and devastating Jim and others. If Jim would not have given in to his weakness of being called Chicken, his life would have been peaceful and another boy would have been alive. 	The entire movie is about individualism and how Jim struggles to do the right thing and how he wants to become apart of society. In the planetarium scene, after the earth was created the words `Man is alone in this universe' is stated. At that time every main character in the movie was separated from society or their family. As each character struggles to make the right decisions, they are alone. 	As the characters Jim, Judy, and Plato search for their place in life they realize the importance of family. Only when Jim and Judy are with him does Plato feel happy, they are his make believe parents. Jim and Judy are constantly trying to rely on their families but do not receive the strength that they seek. Only at the end of the movie does Jim's dad say `I will be as strong as you need me to be.' Then Jim introduces Judy to his family and he is assured of his newly found strength that is given to him. 	This values and warning are missing in today's society. Families are looked down upon by many, and individuals wander alone not knowing where to turn too. The pride in society and people is astounding, and only events such devastating events such as 911 humbled the USA. This is just like the car accident in the movie, and once this occurs Jim and others are humbled. People today need to look back and focus on the values of the earlier society of America, and if this ever happened then life would be much simpler and peaceful.",Rebel Without a Cause

212,rap-39,Mediocre at best,1,5 July 2018,"I was a teen when this film was released and most teens at the time did not like it very much.. Mainly because of the corny way James Dean portrayed his role. And over the years it seems that the viewpoint of people that were in their teens in 1955 have gradually come to dismiss the movie as either ""trash"" or ""an embarrassment to their youth"", because almost every part of the script is overplayed and didn't even start to reflect the reality of post war 1950's... I've have lived and worked in most parts of the U.S. (and much of Europe) and found that viewpoint to be universal.

213,Itchload,I think I missed something here,5,13 December 2002,"Of all the ""classic"" movies I've seen, I'd have to say Rebel Without a Cause is the most overrated.  James Dean is a good actor, but honestly, aside from him, everyone else is over the top.Let me first list a few things that seemed completely implausible to me: The people in James Dean's new town hate him immediately, without him even doing anything.  A highschooler gets his shirt caught in a car door, flies screaming off the edge of a cliff to a explosive firey death, and no one cares.  These first two problems wouldn't be that bad if the movie didn't appear to be going for an element of realism.  If the whole thing was played as little surreal, or as some sort of social black comedy, I could accept these events, but I'm pretty sure that's not the case.The character of Plato is atrocious, both acting wise and thematically wise. And yet he becomes the focal point of the movie.  My biggest problem is that the themes are literally batted over the audience's head.  It becomes immediately clear that James Dean is serving as a replacement father figure for Plato.  Plato has mentioned he has no father and no friends, it just becomes very obvious.  Does he really need to say things like ""yeah, I'm hoping we can go on fishing trips like my dad used to take me on.""  I refuse to believe audiences were that dumb in the 1950s.  (as an aside, the person who argued that Plato was gay, I agree that this is intentional, [how else would he be so attracted to James Dean after only knowing him 3 seconds] and the movie does get some points for slyly tackling a taboo thing like that). However, I desperately wanted Plato to fall victim to a flail of gunfire by the final scene.Maybe my hopes were too high, It could be that all the themes in this movie have been re-done in more audience-trusting fashion.  Still, James Dean was a much better teen idol than we have nowadays.",Rebel Without a Cause
214,slugbelle,It's kind of a new idea to take wealthy kids and give them a dark side.,10,8 April 2004,"James Dean and Natalie Wood shine in a dark drama about kids in the fifties, but the movie goes beyond the drunkenness you first see.  Rebel Without A Cause is different because of the type of kids it portrays.  Jim Stark, a lonely and yet fully surrounded kid, is forced into multiple everyday situations that have the ability to drive him mad.  He's not just some random teenager, but a child born into suburban misery; growing up all he wants to do is have a ""normal"" life.  The plot is almost unimportant to the real quality of the film, it explores how Jim can have two completely different sides.  First, he acts out to try to get his way and potentially his fathers attention, while all the time being quiet and even sometimes shy.  Jim is beating up an office desk while fifteen minutes later he can be protective over a newfound friend. Secondly, it shows smart, wealthy kids who get good grades and do their chores doing ""bad"" things that would possibly be hazardous.  Setting the entire film so much closer to home than ever before.  The movie blatantly explores the contrast between what people see and what is really going on, the viewer is shown the ""chicken run"" but also sees Jim try to help his friend with a jacket.

He played the rebellious youth not for the fifties, but for all decades, even through the 21st century. He played his role well, giving what I thought to be his greatest performance (out of only three major roles). He played this role so well probably because even he could relate, with his ""Live fast, Die Young"" attitude towards life. The plot is one that many teenagers still today can relate to: any misunderstood, rebel without a cause, who feels like sometimes he is being torn apart. Natalie Wood gives a fine performance as Judy, who hangs with a gang that has taken a particular disliking to Jim Stark, and his friend, the always-misunderstood Plato, played well by Sal Mineo. Jim Backus was an excellent choice for Jim Stark's father, who never stands up for himself. Even Dennis Hopper, in his first film role as Goon, a hoodlum. The scene where Stark tries to settle things with the gang one night by playing a game to decide who the coward is really stook out to me as the film's greatest scene (although there were many others).

They are now in this new town and as always Dean is feeling out of place and left out. Dean's performance on this film is a work of natural art. His character has a certain charm to him and a rebel's confidence which Dean is fully able to capture due to it being so natural to him. The plot in this film deals with the turbulence a teenager in 50's would have gone through and the sort of things they would get themselves into just to go against the rules of society. An example of that is the `chicken' scene, which deals with a car race between Dean and his character's opponent. Within this scene Jim, (Dean), expresses pride and confidence at the attempt to show himself off to a crowd he deeply longs to belong to. Natalie Wood portrays Judy a beautiful girl who now is Dean's next door neighbor. Natalie Wood is also the perfect fit for this role, of giving off innocence when needed and turning around to morph into this smoker rebel girl. The chemistry between Dean and Wood is so amazing it reflects to the audience how comfortable they felt with each other, this is a good mix.

No, I did not expect Dean to excel in the 'rebel' role. Having seen him in Giant, I was more or less sure about his limitations as an actor. Good looking, suave, lots of charisma to drive the young women mad, Dean sure had his own positive traits. But acting? A veritable no no.. he was just an icon, an image which might not have sustained beyond the peripheral level had we not lost him to time so early. Death made him a hero, and even today a below average film like Rebel without a cause is viewed with very high expectations Coming to the film, I found 'Rebel without a cause' juvenile in script and in execution. Characters are true to life, but have been played badly, in fact, so badly that they appear coming right out of comic books than American small towns. Natalie Wood, in a similar role in West Side Story appeared much more sensible and mature, like a character in flesh and blood, something which we do not normally associate with musicals. Was it that she wanted to do proper justice to Maria , something she had failed in portraying Lina? The biggest shocker is James Dean. His acting is comparable to C grade heroes of Indian cinema. I could have imagined Jeetendra and Salman Khan acting in this manner, but Dean? Anyway, I had the experience of watching Giant where Dean was comprehensively overshadowed by Rock Hudson , not a great actor himself, hence, had to adjust to the Americanism and halo surrounding the star.Nicholas Ray may be a good director, I don't know. But apart from the action sequences, nothing impresses you. The family squabbles are like scenes emerging out of South Indian 'masala' films, smeared with sentimentalism and having almost no pointer at logic at all. Script and screenplay does not really help. In effect, it appears like a lolly pop / chocolate effort at creating something which could have really been a great film, a film which could have been a real poignant representative of its times.",Rebel Without a Cause
225,francodelrosario,Candidly Realistic Peek on the Anxieties and Issues of Every Adolescent,9,8 May 2006,"Seemingly outdated today, the strength of its performances, the overall impact of Nicholas Ray's direction and the teenagers' frantic cry for help from anguish make REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE eternal for generations of moviegoers. The film is most renowned for launching a young James Dean into mega-stardom establishing him as a legend of 20th century cinema.A newcomer to the town, Jim Stark (Dean) is a defiant juvenile delinquent and individual, who stems from a stuck-up family. Jim is sent to the police station for staying past his curfew where he meets a weeping, attractive and similarly disturbed Judy (Natalie Wood).The next day, Jim tries to get her to go his way, but she runs off with the ""cool"" crowd led by Buzz (Corey Allen). Because of Jim's maverick behavior, he is not gleefully welcome by Buzz's clique. His and Buzz's competition escalate to violent behavior and brutality solely for the sake of honor. All the while, Plato (Sal Mineo) a distressed, helpless, feeble loner tries his best to befriend Jim by trying to get Jim to support and care for him.Nicholas Ray provides us a fascinating and unadulterated character study. Ray spent hours studying petty crime and misdemeanor among youngsters at the time. He implies that most of the felonies committed by teenagers root from dysfunctional families. Jim's parents are apathetic to his social life. Judy's father never gave her the adoration she required and Plato's parents separated at a young age. All feel unloved and abandoned by their respective relatives and the trio tries to build their own ""family"" based on shared understanding and genuineness to one another. The transpiring events will spark curiosity among younger viewers and ones of older generations will reminisce. Also, the planetarium scene, the brawl scene and the ""chickee run"" scene all oddly make us contemplate on where we really fit in....that is what REBEL is all about.Dean is agonizingly powerful in this tailor-fitted role that made him a martyr in the filmdom. This was undoubtedly his magnum opus in his all-too-brief career. His defining moment in the movie is the devastating drunken performance he gave in the opening sequence. (""You're tearing me apart!""). Natalie Wood is likewise noteworthy and authentic as a daughter eager for love, Judy, who slowly falls for the charming Dean. The scenes with her and her father are psychologically excruciating to watch. However, the most emotionally shattering representation of a character is Sal Mineo's Plato. After his father leaves him, he takes extreme measures to make Jim his ""dad"". He is dangerously engrossed (sexually?) with Jim since he was the only one who would be Plato's pal.If REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE could have been more accessible to other generations, it could have been completely perfect. Nevertheless, Nicholas Ray offers us a mesmerizing analysis on sociology and adolescence with its stars at full power. This turned out to be the most influential movie of the fifties and the most significant picture on teenage years ever.",Rebel Without a Cause
226,Dabaens,When there's nothing to look for except each other.,9,25 June 2013,"Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' is a dramatic, teen movie from the 50's that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. There's no one clear message that's sent through this movie about these kid's lives or their families, which I think attributes to its ever-lasting value. This was a film that was made inbetween times of war, and really there was nothing about society to rebel against, hence the name ""Rebel Without a Cause"". Instead this movie focuses more on home matters and families, particularly through the eyes of the younger generation. These kids all seem to have something to prove to one another, and all want to be a part some group. Jim gets harassed by some punk kids, who manage get under his skin and drive him to do some dangerous things. Judy wants to be loved by her father, but her father doesn't feel inclined to show it. And Plato intends to find the family that he never had. If there was one message I could get out of this movie, it's finding your right place. Unfortunately not everybody ends up in the most perfect situation, but it is their own actions and intentions that lead them there. There was quite a bit of interesting symbolism I found in this movie as well. One scene Judy returns home after a fight with her father and is quickly greeted by her little brother, who hugs her and calls her all the names her father wouldn't call her, which to me shows the love between siblings the younger generation. Also, as mentioned before, the scene where Jim, Judy and Plato all hideaway in the abandoned mansion was one of the more heartwarming moments of the movie. This was one of my most favorite scenes in the movie, and I think told the most about the moral of the story. What these kids want is to be loved. And while it can't seem to work with their own dysfunctional families, they seek to find love in the form of starting their own.",Rebel Without a Cause
227,claudenorth,Dated but Timeless,10,14 June 2005,"I found this film to be a bit dated, specifically when the action veered into melodrama and in the depiction of the ""clean-cut"" ""bad kids."" That said, I think this film is, nonetheless, timeless because it conveys the restlessness that so many teenagers feel, as well as their frustrations that are so difficult to articulate. And I don't believe that those feelings are exclusive to teenagers. What adult hasn't felt the way Jim Stark feels in this film, knowing that he is unhappy, yet not really knowing why, or what to do about it? I'm almost 40 and I still connected with the characters because I am far from having ""it"" figured out. Not every film manages to remain a classic, but this one has because it contains great emotional truth, and that truth is the heart of the film.",Rebel Without a Cause
228,durhamhome,Wanted to love it.,5,4 March 2021,"Anyone of a certain age recalls posters of James Dean put up, because he was so cool. He is a very attractive guy, but I was surprised about the oddity of the story plot. Dean cried at his dad's feet, he was whining half of the movie, and was generally a moody teen.
This was the guy who's poster was on the Fonz's wall in Happy Days.Obviously, Dean's death along with his great looks, cemented him as an iconic figure from the 50's. But had he lived until his old age, I think this film wouldn't have received the same amount of acclaim. It is commonly listed as one of the top film's of the 20th century.Hard to understand why.",Rebel Without a Cause
229,pornguy-2,The first teenage gay scenes in a major Hollywood film.,10,20 April 2000,"The feeling by Plato for Jim are clearly gay longing.  The scene outside Plato's garage reads:Plato: Hey do you want to come home with me.  There's nobody at my house and heck I'm not tired, are you?  See I don't have too many people I can talk to.James:Who hasPlato: If you can come we can talk and then in the morning we can have breakfast like my dad.  If only you could have been my dadJames: Have you flipped or something.  Look I'll see you in the morning o.k.?Plato: Well I've got to pickup my scooter.  See you tomorrow.The longing Plato expresses here and through out the film is primarily for James.  Get the DVD and see the auditions for Dean, Mineo and Wood together. The hugs and by play are mostly between Mineo and Dean, while Woods seems to just be an extra.How would this play out nowadays.  Dean and Mineo would seem to be Rebels With A Cause, that of getting out to the closet.This is the classic teenage rebellion film that started them all and still stands up.  At least the opened the door to the closet",Rebel Without a Cause
230,Kristin-James Dean,A Great Movie!,10,5 June 2001,"I'm only 13, but I can really relate to this movie. I've been a ""new kid"" before and I know how James Dean felt. I can also relate to Sal Mineo's character, Plato. James Dean, Sal Mineo, Natalie Wood, Dennis Hopper, Corey Allen, and everyone else were all great in this movie. It's tragic how James, Sal, and Natalie died, and that they died so young. Personally I think it's one of the best movie's ever made! Long Live James Dean!",Rebel Without a Cause
231,Dude_001,"It is a film of beautiful, yet heart wrenching, metaphor.",8,3 March 2009,"Jim Stark(James Dean), a troubled young man, moves to a new town with his parents in hope of putting his past behind him. However, run ins with a local gang, a love interest in 'girl-next-door' Judy( Natalie Wood), a friendship with a disturbed young man (Sal Mineo), and an innocent game that results in death, spiral Jim further downward then he's ever been.Stewart Stern named his script after psychiatrist Robert Lindner's 1944 book, Rebel Without A Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath, but the story is inspired by nothing other than loneliness, isolation, distrust, anger, rebellion, and hope. It is a film of beautiful, yet heart wrenching metaphor. The opening scene shows Jim, drunk, collapsing on a dirty street, amongst a pile of trash that has collected. It is a pitiful sight, yet next to Jim is a small toy monkey, an illustration of hope and childishness, beautifully juxtaposed with an image of utter defeat. When the characters in the film reach the breaking point, when they have lost any resemblance of innocence, of virtue, they resort to playing childish games in an old abandoned mansion, offering support and love and attention to one another that they could get no where else. A silly high school game results in death.The acting in Rebel Without a Cause is phenomenal, and the film's characters are brought to life with sensational performances. James Dean, who was killed in a tragic accident shortly before the film's release, gives a heart wrenching and honest performance as the film's lead character, who's really more of a frightened loner than a dangerous rebel. Dean plays the part very naturally. Natalie Wood plays Judy, the 'wanna-be-bad' girl with troubles of her own at home. Her performance is a great one because you can sense the aching and the desire her character suffers. Sal Mineo is also very noteworthy in his role as John ""Plato"" Crawford, a disturbed young boy who lives in a huge mansion but aches for a family. His presence at times is delightful and numerous, at other times, disturbing.Nicholas Ray directs this picture in an almost surreal way. Bright, sunny scenes outside are contrasted with cold, dark interior shots. The camera mirrors the story and the spirit of the film in quite a unique way. When we see Jim, drunk out of his mind, lying on the cold street, the camera stares unflinchingly, never looking away. When Jim argues with his parents in a particularity dynamic scene, the camera seems distorted, out of place. Even when our three main characters escape to their ultimate fantasy, alone with each other outside of everyone and everything else, they are shrouded in darkness.Rebel Without a Cause succeeds where a lot of ""troubled teen"" movies fall. It doesn't show young people as helpless, neglected, and powerless against every immorality shoved into their face, but instead, it shows them as humans, suffering as humans do. Jim, Judy, Plato are troubled kids yes, they also multi-dimensional human beings.8/10",Rebel Without a Cause
232,Obelisk94,An absolute classic,8,7 March 2014,"A story of a teenager who struggles with his parents, peers, and himself, Rebel without a Cause was released in 1955 and directed by Nicholas Ray, and is arguably James Dean's best known film.Jim Stark is a seventeen years old boy who in the beginning of the movie, is brought to a police station for being drunk in public. The Starks had recently moved in to LA and are keen for their son to make some friends and stay out of trouble, which seems to follow him wherever he may be. The next morning, however, Jim and this bully named Buzz, argue with each other and eventually decide to settle it in a game of ""Chickie Run"". Things don't go according to plan and now Jim has to deal with the consequences and try to finally do the right thing.James Dean stars as Jim Stark. And even though Dean was seven years older than the character he's playing, he gives a solid performance for the time. Seeing Dean in his iconic attire and with his hair slicked back, you can't help but tell yourself ""Man, this guy is cool"". He doesn't look anything like a seventeen year old but his screen presence makes you forget that. You just want to see this guy do his thing. Also starring are Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, who both got nominated for Academy Awards for best supporting Actress and Actor respectively. Also, a young Dennis Hopper makes his acting debut.I think it's both fair and unfair to say the movie got so much recognition because of Dean's death. Fair because it's true that when an actor dies, the movie they last worked on gets more attention (Like The Dark Knight after Heath Ledger or The Crow after Brandon Lee). Unfair because this really is a good movie. A lot of people who watch it nowadays will say that it's dated. But if you consider that it came out nearly sixty years ago, it was like nothing they've ever seen before.Rebel without a Cause is a classic. Anyone who likes movies has at least heard of it. Most of the movies that deal with teenagers and their troubles owe a lot to it, and for that it deserves a place in cinema history.",Rebel Without a Cause
233,DrFreudstein2011,"Quite good, actually, in spite of Dean's overacting...",8,21 June 2011,"When I was a child, I always thought James Dean appeared in this film riding his motorcycle, with a tough-looking image. (Later on, I learned it was really Brando in ""The Wild One""). I remember this as an example of Dean's iconic stature in the world of cinema, though he never gave me the impression of rebeliousness in Ray's film. Just the opposite, he played Jim Stark, a shy, introspective young man who has a problematic relationship with his parents and gets into trouble in every opportunity he has. He seems to be drifting, wandering in life, and obviously has the need to fit in, to be accepted by other people his age. At a police station he meets Judy and Plato, two misfits just like him, who study at the same school he goes. Judy's father despises her and thinks she is a ""tramp"", while Plato's only companion is his black maid (his mother is absent most of the time). He is emotionally unstable and has homicidal tendencies; he was brought to the police after shooting some puppies. Plato seems to admire Jim's personality, though Ray never makes it clear if it's really a homosexual attraction towards him. The film is aggressive and tender, poetic and melancholic, with a sense of quiet desperation, of things left unsaid, the lack of communication not only between adults and their sons, but also between young people and the prejudice and stereotypes among them.",Rebel Without a Cause

The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise, im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn't it?Dean and others, are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this film, and well, maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could've. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film. Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy... its pathetic.Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the film... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.It may've been good for its time, but, really, its drivel.It must've just been hype about Dean's death that has over-inflated the reputation of this film.",Rebel Without a Cause

This movie captures the way it really feels to be young. Angst, loneliness, isolation, and akwardness are subjects rarely associated with teenagers in movies these days (at least, in a serious manner). Anyone who truly remembers high school will know that it wasn't always so pleasant and silly (to many people, it was just the opposite). James Dean's incredible acting and screen presence conveys this perfectly. He manages to be the embodiment of cool without seeming larger than life. Indeed, it is his flaws and vulnerability that ultimately makes him such a great character. The same is true of Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo. No one in this film is a cliché, but a fully-fleshed human being who not only laughs and lusts, but also rages, cries, and shows fear and emotional depth.What amazes me the most about this film is that it is over 50 years old, and just as relevant today as it was in 1955.

It survives the test of time, because teens have problems dealing with their parents and fitting, and the regular pressures of any teen. The loss of Jim Dean is one of the greatest tragedies in Hollywood history, because this movie truly defines his future in acting as a bright one.  The entire world was cheated out of the chance to see this aspiring young actor turn into a superstar.

And despite what some critics say, this film is as relevant today as it was when the picture first came out.The acting in the picture is superb--particularly James Dean as Jim Stark. It is a fascinating movie to watch because his acting ability takes a new turn in ""Rebel""--Dean matures from the excited, bouncing, youthful Cal Trask of ""East of Eden"" to the more determined, angry, frustrated rebel.

This film sums up American society in the middle of the Fifties. I often feel that the Fifties are unfairly maligned - the Forties are all about the Second World War and the Swinging Sixties are the pop culture at its height. The Fifties are often dismissed as ""that boring decade in between."" Nothing could be further from the truth. To me, the Fifties was the decade when our modern world was born - the ""counter-culture"" started then, not in the Sixties. James Dean still seems like a modern young dude. So many powerful scenes in ""Rebel"" prove that. My favourite is the flick-knife fight with Buzz. Watch Dean's face in that scene and then how he flicks Buzz's knife away, moving with reflexes like a panther and then holds his own knife to Buzz's throat - that scene seems incredibly modern to me, even with an actual gap of 58 years.Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo both said in interviews many years later how much they idolised Jimmy and what an influence on their acting careers he had. So many young actors have said the same in the decades since. There is no doubt this film is dated but yet that doesn't matter at all. Watching it is still a pure pleasure, thanks to Dean's performance. It deserves its legendary status and Jimmy's image will live forever because of it.There is not too much more that can be said that other reviewers haven't already said about this great film. For anyone in that difficult decade between the ages of 15 and 25, when you're struggling to transition from childhood to adulthood, it is a film you will instantly identify with.

250,humdinger,First American Teenager,9,28 June 2003,"""East of Eden"" and ""Giant"" are both great, don't get me wrong.  But this is the James Dean that set the archetype for not only the cool Fifties American teenager but perhaps every teenager since.  Dean has his white t-shirt, sleeve rolled up for his smokes.  He has his red jacket and blue jeans, he's ready to drag and he's ready to fight.  From the first moment we see Dean, drunk on a school night, busted by the cops, he's amazingly both personally secretive and universally accessible at once.  He's hurt, lonely and looking for kicks - and no one understands him except, maybe, just maybe, that one person in the audience...Sure, this movie has it's faults.  The parents are cartoonish, some of the kids are hip in only a stilted sense and a lot of the movie is unrealistic.  There's something disturbingly hokey and amateurish in this portrayal of a typical American town with it's typical American high school. Yet, Dean, Mineo and Wood put on performances that let the viewer suspend reality all the way through..each of these three put on the performance of their lives!Sal Mineo plays a mousey misfit named Plato (whose homosexuality is thinly veiled).  Natalie Wood plays a young women named Judy, part of the in-crowd, who deep down is at wit's end.  Both of these characters are amazingly believable, even fifty years later.  Mineo's never been as enigmatic or as compelling as he is here as Plato.  Then there's Wood - as cynical and alone in her world as Judy feels, we realize quickly she likes James Dean, she needs James Dean - and Dean can dig her.In retrospect, it's not surprising that the jacketed juvenile delinquent that Dean plays here would become a role model for both young gay men and young straight men alike. He's comfortable being intimate with Plato, his words, his expressions are all too much, too overly emotional (for a straight man).  But, the kids, the town itself, quickly learn Dean's no pushover.  He yells, he fights and he's afraid of nothing that other people are afraid of - staring down death is just a way for him to kill time. But, he's afraid, something just isn't right with his life. And most importantly, even if he never really does connect with this ""typical town"" filled with ""typical people"", Dean does indeed connect - to anyone whose ever been young - and alone.....",Rebel Without a Cause
251,Chasecarson24,"Certain Characters Ruin It, Disappointing.",4,1 December 2014,"Well, what I thought was going to be a movie about James Dean being a total rebel turned out to be a movie filled with completely mental teenagers.Let me get started. The character Plato is introduced in the first scene in the police station where all of the other main characters are introduced as well. But instead of being held there for being out too late or for a bit of drunkenness, it is discovered that he killed some puppies. This should already be a red flag for his character. And when asked about why he did it, he responds with ""I don't know."" Except you can tell that he little douchebag is lying, you know that he has some dark reason hidden on the inside on why he killed those puppies. From the beginning of the movie you know that he is going to be a little douchebag. The next day comes and he meets James Dean's character. For some reason, he becomes so attached to his character for no reason at all, later saying ""I hope he takes me hunting and fishing, because I don't know how, and I know he'll teach me."" like James Dean is his dad or something. What a weirdo. Then later when he realizes that James Dean is in danger he grabs a gun. RED FLAG. We can tell that no good is going to come out of this. When he falls asleep at the abandoned mansion James Dean and the character Judy go to another room to make out or some crap. Then when the stereotype greasers come to beat him and James Dean up, he freaks out and pulls out his gun and almost kills one of the greasers and almost kills James Dean. He then goes into a trance like condition where he acts like a baby and complains about not having a mommy or daddy while running from the police. He ends up dead. Good. Screw Plato. This all takes place in ONE DAY. In ONE DAY he becomes this attached to another person. COME ON.Then there is the character Judy. Judy meets James Dean on the first day of school and treats him like fat people do to salad to fit in with her boyfriend Buzz and his stereotype greaser friends. So then later at the Chicken race ,or whatever it is called, Buzz dies by having his jacket caught in the door before he can jump out. So what does Judy do about her now dead boyfriend? Mourn? Cry her eyes out? Nope! She barely appears sad about it and then moves on straight to James Dean within AN HOUR of Buzz's death. Dear Buzz, Sorry, but I don't really care about your death because James Dean is here. From Judy. P.S. Screw you. Later in the movie, which is only like a couple hours later in the story of the film, Judy literally tells James Dean that she is in love with him. Really? She literally just met in him earlier that day. And she is in love with him? It makes no sense at all really, I do not like her at all. I wish that James Dean could carry this movie on his own, but I just don't like his character that much. I thought he would be more of a rebel, but he just acts more like a rebel when he tries to fit in with the ""rebel"" crowd.I'm sorry, I just thought this movie was really disappointing for me.",Rebel Without a Cause

I know it is Hollywood working its ""magic"", but everything is just too fake. Even though I feel that James Dean did a superb acting job in the movie, I felt that most of the other character's emotions were forced. Natalie Wood's character seemed too whiny and over-dramatic.

It's that time in your life where you think nothing is going your way and all you want is to be independent and do things your way. James Dean plays the main character Jim Stark who is a kind, compassionate person, who is trapped in a society that demands him to play the tough guy role. In order to keep up with this image that he is being forced to play he is frequently getting into trouble which causes his family to constantly move from town to town. Jim feels that it is necessary to rebel against his parents to give off the image that he is strong and is fully capable of taking care himself. He also is looking for a chance to be accepted. He thinks that if he acts like he is this big tough new kid, the other kids will think he is ""cool"". He lived in a decade that forced teenage boys to act ""macho"" and to appear to be stable on their own. This movie offers all of the great aspects of ""old and classic"" movies.

The actors seemed too old to be going to high school, and to see Dean drink milk straight out of the bottle was funny enough.

259,sharislaya,a great classic,10,3 January 2005,"""Rebel without a Cause"" perfectly captures that time in a teenagers life, when one feels that the entire world is against them. Jim Stark the main character is played brilliantly by James Dean, who when screaming out the line ""Your tearing me apart!"" never fails to break my heart. Even though there are those that would argue that this film isn't relevant in today's messed up society, I believe that it is all the more applicable as the generation gap between children and parents drift further apart. The two main characters other then Jim is the messed up yet caring Judy, who just wants to feel the love from her father that she used to. Plato, another troubled kid is teetering on the edge and the tragic consequences of the finale prove that we all can't be saved. What these teens wanted more then anything else was to belong, but to belong without having to change themselves. For one night they were a family and they felt true love and happiness, it was the world that had deserted them and it was their desperate longing to be needed and to need that kept them together. ""Rebel without a Cause"" is not a one-sided story, that places all the blame on the parents but rather explores all the avenues of reasons of the disaffected youth.

Rebel Without a Cause, as an example, shows the combination of matching storyline with a fate and life experience of an actors, resulting in something so unique, that it gets away from the stereotype and brings a new kind of spirit, which was missing in the movie industry for a long period. In my opinion, the greatest thing an actor and director can do is to let their spirit, let some part of them, in the movie and make it least forever, despite their temporary lives.

Like we discussed in my film class, Plato was probably some sort of psychopath. That's why he killed the puppies and that's why he latched on to Jim so quickly. That's why he stole the gun from wherever and shot at Buzz's goons. It's also why he shot at Jim. Second, Judy. So what if she got over Buzz's death so easily? She might've not been completely in control of their relationship, if you see what I mean.

264,Gonnie,The Cause that turns out to be Destiny,8,28 July 2002,"Rebel is beautifully shot movie and is deservingly called a ' classic' . It's more than a James Dean vehicle (although it is his best performance), no, it's much more than that. It's a meaningful dark story about taking things in your own hand vs. destiny, risks vs. cowardness, etc. Themes that are particularly portrayed in fifties movies, to name a few, The Fugitive Kind and A Streetcar named Desire (both with Marlon Brando by the way). In this period of movie making recurring elements come to surface in these pictures: beautifully shot stylish settings, heavy thematic drama (it's the Tennessee Williams era!) and scenes that are powered by actors, much more than action (in the same period Film Noir offers a more entertaining fast-paced alternative). Sometimes it's more over-acting than acting to be honest... Dean's method acting is often very good, but if other actors can't stand up to his level, some scenes can be disturbingly out o balance. But, hey, what the hack, the story is great and you get father and son Hopper as a bonus!""I don't know"". These few words come repeatedly from the mouths of the 3 protagonists in this movie: Plato (Mineo), Judy (Wood) and Jim (Dean). And those seemingly irrelevant words touch exactly the heart of this picture: all three kids are searching souls and are somehow lost between being a teenager and becoming an adult.Now, how to choose as an adolescent if you have no or a bad example...Plato has no father, Judy has an uncaring father and Jim(bo) has a weak father; well, in fact you can state that they have no fathers at all! So at the end of the movie they start out their own little family, with Plato being the child. After this 'test' Jim gets his fathers coat...is this a token that means that Jim has entered the league of grown ups? If this is the case than the picture states that their is no escaping adulthood, no matter how much you rebel against it. In the end you will be defeated by societies morale and become one of them...there's no escaping. There's no era like the fifties that supports this feeling of no ' escaping'...unless your name is Jack Kerouac of course.Rating: 4 out of 5",Rebel Without a Cause

270,Stinkoman604,Essay for school.,7,7 January 2007,"Rebel Without a Cause, directed by Nicholas Ray, was an entertaining movie. I chose to watch this movie because it is alluded to in Don McLean's ""American pie"". Although it was rather entertaining I thought that James Dean was not the best choice for Jim Stark. Jim seemed like he should be less awkward around people, at least in my opinion. Mr. Ray obviously thought Jim should be a very awkward character, but I thought he should have been a little tougher, being as the movie is titled Rebel Without a Cause.I feel like the title did not fit the movie, the phrase ""rebel without a cause"" means you do bad things for no reason, but there was nothing like that in the movie. The closest part was when Jim had to do the ""chicky race"" with Buzz. But he had perfect reason to do this; his honor was at stake.The main character, Jim, was a static character. In the beginning he was absolutely no different from the end. But his father was dynamic; by the end of the movie he was ready to stand up for himself. Judy, played by Natalie Wood, was dynamic. She started out taking the abuse that her father put her through and ended up running away from it. Plato, played by Sal Mineo, was a static character too he started out a coward then he got a gun and ran away. He never had any courage, except when he walked out of the planetarium, and then he got scared and held up his gun, again, no courage.Although this is a classic movie that I am positive that everyone has at least heard of, I don't understand what made it such a ""classic"". The only thing that I could see being controversial, thus making people talk about it, would be Jim's father being the ""mother figure"" of the house. Even though this was shot and placed in the 1950's I don't think it is that amazing.In all I would not say this movie was ""classic"" worthy and that it was shot in a rather ""safe"" way. Very few risks as to costume and effects were taken. I would give this movie an 8 out of 10 for entertainment, but only a 1 out of 10 for eligibility of being a classic.",Rebel Without a Cause

272,hursty-1,its relevance is is as strong half a century later,10,17 April 2002,"The reason I love this film so much lies in the fact that it is a perfect way to understand post-war America (if not the world)films and literature of this era are of the most daring and challenging ever produced, nower days we seem perfectly happy to be shown irrelevence in favour of substance as long as something explodes, Rebel is charged with the emotions of youth suppressed at that time. One thing I find quite disturbing is that its message is sadly as pivotal today as it was in the fifties, still the young are treated wrongly in socioty, socially conditioned into something laid down by supposed betters. Rebel is what all teen movies should be, it questions the feelings of its players and reveals the sources of their troubles (lack of understanding from parental figures...aint it always so). Its a sad fact that the youth of today think they know and understand everything, hence the influx of so many irony laden teen flicks , as a youth myself, it irritates me that we as a social group are so pompus, I just wish insightful films like this were still made today, maybe then we would be less up our selves and realise as with the cast of rebel, all we desire from life is recognition and love. James Dean gives an amazing performance, his portrayal as Jim is one of the only truly polysemic roles ever, he shows rebellion and sensitivity without ever seeming false, I defy anyone who cannot connect with Jim on at least one level, his frustration evolves into deep understanding, and his characters growth is a joy to watch.

273,bunnycactus47,"""...You know you've been some place.""",10,28 March 2008,"I didn't have really high expectations going in to see ""Rebel Without a Cause."" I saw it simply because it's a cult classic, and everyone has to see it at sometime or another. Suffice it to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Not only is the acting superb, but the storyline is brilliantly pieced together and the characters are equally well-developed. It is truly a beautiful journey.James Dean's brilliantly subtle portrayal of a troubled teen is perfect  while some of the lines are a bit melodramatic and could be terrible if performed by the wrong actor, James Dean makes them not only believable, but extremely effective. He doesn't even have to speak to let you know what he's thinking. You can just feel it.One of the things I thought was great about this film is that James Dean's character, Jim Stark, is not your regular Hollywood bad-boy. He's not just going around looking for a good time, and he's certainly not looking for trouble, as the title seems to suggest. Like any of us teens, Jim has made big mistakes in his life, but unlike some of us, he genuinely wants to do the right thing. He's surprisingly sensitive and sincere; which, as Judy (Natalie Wood) states, is just the trouble.Weird as it may sound, I absolutely love Sal Mineo's character, Plato, and the way the film portrays him. One of the first things we hear Plato say is, ""No one can help me."" He tries so hard to be accepted, and finally finds a friend in Jim. Even though lots of people say there are homosexual innuendos here, I don't believe there are. Plato's need for attention spawns from his neglectful parents  which, as Jim points out, are who he tries to turn Jim and Judy into. He even says several times that he wishes Jim were his father. A truly tragic character, Plato will go to any length to get the affection he was always denied.Though mostly about the teens and their attempts at being accepted and loved, a huge part of the story follows the relationship between Jim and his parents. The way this family is portrayed is absolutely brilliant, as it shows that abusive and neglectful parents aren't the only ones who can mess up their child's life. Jim's parents love him, and he loves them  but the way his domineering mother ""makes mush"" out of his submissive father is just ""tearing Jim apart."" Every boy needs someone to look up to; but Jim finds it hard (and rightly so) to look up to a man who is even afraid to contradict his wife.The story takes place in just over one day. In some films this can be a bit choppy, but director Nicholas Ray did an excellent job in this one. One of the really cool things about it is that, though Jim is the main character, the story isn't told just from his point of view. In most every scene, Ray takes you into the head of each character. In some cases, it's a real trip.The only bone I have to pick with this movie is the oddly resolved conflict between Jim's parents at the end. When Jim's dad indicates to his wife to shut up, they merely smile at each other and walk away together. I mean, this is what we wanted through the whole movie  but the smiles really do seem out of place in the moment.One of my favorite parts takes place at the field trip to the Planetarium, while watching the light show. While looking up at the stars, Jim leans back and says, ""Once you been up there, you know you've been some place."" At that moment, you can feel his desire to do something great; his desire to really be some place worth being. Watching this film, you feel like you're there  and it's definitely a place worth being.",Rebel Without a Cause

I guess I am a totally non-objective voter on this as I gave it a ten because the movie meant so much to me. Of course at that age or even years later I had no idea there was any underlying homosexual theme. Nor does it matter to me. First of all I believe that the movie stands up today. You can't say that about a lot of 1955 movies. I think a movie that stands up over time must have elements of great acting, directing and writing. I became a huge James Dean fan to this day. He was already dead when I saw thee movie of course. I'm not sure if I even knew that at the time.I can't explain this anymore that my admiration of other idols of my youth, like JFK, RFK, or MLK. I later would read much more about the movie, James Dean, the Director, Nicholas Ray, Natalie Wood. I found out that JD was probably bi-sexual. Perhaps no doubt bi-sexual. We know that Sal Mineo, later known to the public, was homosexual. Not that any of this matters. They were acting parts in this movie. Perhaps Nicolas Ray meant to include this sub-theme, perhaps not.Nick Ray did change the script DRASTICALLY from the original written story. It was to be a juvenile delinquent that was visited in prison by a cop or social worker. It was re-written many times by writers he hired but he changed things as they filmed also.

Caricaturesque characters. I can forgive the movie for not having stood the test of time (few movies from the 50s do), but hard to believe it was even considered a good movie at the time. I can only attribute the stratospheric stature of the film to the untimely death of James Dean.

Even though the plot gets tangled up at times, the overall story shows the struggles that teenagers went through during that era. It was revolutionary of that time, because it was really one of the first films to focus on the teenage coming of age.The performances from both James Dean and Natalie Wood are wonderful to watch, not only do they have great chemistry on screen but clearly embellish their characters to the full extent. James Dean in essence was Jim Stark, having father issues in his real life, which translate so well on screen you don't even realize he's acting. I would recommend this film to everyone. The film still holds up very well to this day 60 years later!",Rebel Without a Cause

281,AustinNicholasHook,Rebel Without a Cause,10,24 April 2015,"From the very beginning, Rebel Without a Cause captivates and makes the viewer ask questions. The opening scene is one of the most famous from any movie, James Dean is the greatest storyteller. Rebel Without a Cause was/is one of the more groundbreaking films, especially for its time. The rebellion that is adolescence is uniquely captured in this film unlike any other. The cast is great, and the writing is superb. The camera angles also are groundbreaking. The Dutch Angle shot during the staircase scene is one of the most memorable from any film. Edgy camera angles and acting makes for a great film. Definitely worth the watch!",Rebel Without a Cause
282,leadersuleyman,Psychoanalysis of this film,9,18 December 2016,"This film gives important messages that not much discussed but needed much care to be given.So this is the only film I saw within men development context which has direct link between mental and emotional development of men also emphasized for girls outlook(Judy case).Here main results need to take care of:Jim has self and grow up with a family which is not emotional abusive and dysfunctional and in a culture of society that does not have harassment and dogmatic mental prejudices inside like middle eastern culture.He also has resources like car money so this is also important factor that there are not life well-being limitations in accordance with monetary issues.I mean if he got stressful he can o out whenever he wants even without dependence and how far it is.Jim is in search of peer acceptance also need for belonging first then opposite sexual need as Maslow Pyramid explains.Plus as you pay attention he also wanted direct answers from his father about some life facts and men behavior however his father is feminize but not feminine (feminize: a bit far from men virtues and not strong man character, you can also put another word instead of feminize)His follower isolated from people and peer group Plato has more men issues than Jim , he want to spend time with man trust to a man to complete his masculinity , briefly has gender role problems that is why he invited Jim to his house which Jim saw this is not appropriate and weird thing as man.People like Plato needs psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapist in clinical psychology background professional.Plato also was in need to talk to someone just easy it is.Last scenes in the films he was shot by police because he had weapon on his hand,lights impulsed his panic action with gun so police shot himFor Judy he wanted to get some care from her dad but his dad refused to kiss her as she was in her mid adolescent time period.Her father did excuse both boys and girls needs care from both parents, that action made Judy emotionally more vulnerable and had problems with her sexual life with menRecently I found out that in US Oprah Show boys with single parent (mom) issue discussed .And I think fathers by escaping so making a big shame , but good to point that is very big problem for mental well being and healthy community.There are various situations apart from single mom issue accompanying to this problem -MALE ROLE MODELMEN need extra step then girls to complete their social development, that so called male role model to separate from mother and feel excitement to discover men world.This is very crucial problem vital for men.Need of attachment intimacy building with men-homosocialityThose are important points I caught up and hope you get better understanding these significant problems arising.",Rebel Without a Cause
