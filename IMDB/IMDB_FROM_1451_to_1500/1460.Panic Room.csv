0,TheLittleSongbird,"Could have been better, but efficient and slick enough",6,11 January 2011,"Overall, I did like Panic Room. While it is not as good as Se7en or Fight Club, it is slick and efficient, and you can tell that David Fincher was making an effort to make this good. He is a good director, and he does do a decent job directing. Occasionally though, the breakneck camera work and unconventional angles get in the way of the storytelling and the action, so while Fincher succeeded in trying to impress, occasionally he tried too hard. The plot is also rather formulaic, the script is sometimes lacking and the film loses its way in the pacing towards the end.However, I loved the suspenseful atmosphere, there were occasions throughout the course of the film where it was claustrophobic, and the scenery and dark colour palette were well judged. When the dialogue was good, it was good, while Panic Room does start off wonderfully with a very innovative title sequence. Although it does lose its way, the pace is efficient enough to keep the plot afloat, and the acting is fine. Jodie Foster is very good as the gutsy heroine, while Forrest Whittaker is quite poignant as one of the intruders. I was also pleasantly surprised by Kristen Stewart, I personally have never considered her as much of an actress, but she is quite decent here.So overall, a slight disappointment but a slick and enjoyable flick. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Panic Room
1,Leofwine_draca,Well-directed home invasion thriller,7,6 October 2016,"Celebrated director David Fincher forgets the sneaky twists and turns of his last three movies and instead focuses on a far more simplistic action-based thriller type film, adhering to a straightforward plot as in ALIEN 3 and once again crafting an above-average viewing experience. Although the storyline is ultra-simplistic in scope, solid levels of characterisation and some great set-ups and situations keep this one moving from the start. Films based entirely in one location can go either way but thankfully the sure hand of Fincher keeps this on track all the way. As far as I can make out, the only flaws are a few plot inconsistencies and an over-reliance on CGI tracking shots, where realism would have sufficed and made a better result.The film's tough heroine is played by Jodie Foster, who seems to have disappeared from the mainstream for yonks. Thankfully she's back with a vengeance and with a solid if unexceptional performance as the lead, crafting a sexy yet cold, fragile yet powerful character. I could have done with less of Foster's cliché-bound daughter-in-peril, who, surprise surprise, turns out to be an epileptic in dire need of medication, but all films have clichés these days and Fincher's are easy to forgive. The main interest comes from the conflicting characters of the three criminals searching for the loot. First and foremost is the vastly underrated Forest Whitaker excelling as the con with a heart, adding extra layers to what could have been a totally unconvincing acting job; secondly we have a cast-against-type Jared Leto as the nervous ringleader, once more getting mutilated for his craft; finally Dwight Yoakam as the very scary and despicable psychopath of the bunch just about steals all of the scenes he appears in.Fincher handles the camera-work and photography superbly, letting some classic scenes play out naturally on camera (the propane gas explosion is a beautiful if implausible moment). All of the usual cinematic tricks in the Hitchcockian tradition are thrown in, from the tracking shots to the dual cutting and slow motion, and there are some shocks and twisty moments you won't see coming despite the simple premise. The action is handled superbly with the tension racked up to breaking point, finally evaporating in a clichéd but still exciting finale awash with power and violence. So congratulations to all and sundry for crafting a solid, well-made and well-acted thriller with a brain.",Panic Room
2,SnoopyStyle,Simple Tight Movie,7,24 November 2013,"Director David Fincher lays out a tight simple thriller. It takes place all in and around the house. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is recently divorced and buying a house in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. It has a panic room. On their first night in the house, they get invaded by three criminals (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto) intend on getting something from the previous owner left in the panic room. Only Meg and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) get there first.Fincher has striped away all the unnecessary filler from the story. It's a simple cat and mouse game. Nothing could be simpler. Even at almost 2 hours, there isn't a slow moment. All the actors get their fair share. Jodie and Forest lead the cast, but Jared and Kristen also shine. I wouldn't say this was the greatest or the most original. It is simply a good movie.",Panic Room
3,Hitchcoc,Bad Panic Room,5,11 January 2017,"I agree with others. Jodi Foster is a gem, but this movie just makes you wonder. She does all the acting stuff, being emotional and enterprising and so on. The problem here isn't with the acting; it's the room itself. If one were to spend a million dollars to create such a safe place, wouldn't you account for eventualities. Like, making it so you could contact the outside world. A simple securely placed land line would do that. Or perhaps a means of outside access. Of course, there is also the whole issue with the bad guys having to get in. What do they want. Oh, yes, soundproofing. That's good because they don't know you're in there. The room is non-functional, no more protective than putting a steel door on your house.",Panic Room
4,kosmasp,Fincher at it again,8,25 July 2012,"Back then when I first watched this, I never could've imagined (or anyone else for that matter), what would become of young Kristen Stewart. I wonder what people think of this movie, that got to know her through her Twilight movies? The movie of course is more of a Jodie Foster vehicle, but credit also has to go out to the male leads (one of the last roles for Jared Leto? Hope he decides to come back to acting, even if his music career works quite well for him).Fincher always was and is very particular when it comes to framing shots. The disc has quite a few features on him preparing for the movie. The whole ""pre-viz"" thing worked great. And the shot near the beginning of the movie, where you get to see the whole house works well later, when the viewer has some sort of orientation due to the fact, he had a ""tour through the house"". A thriller that works quite nice and that should have you at the edge of your seat.",Panic Room
5,lee_eisenberg,"If absolutely nothing else, we can always count on Jodie Foster.",7,22 March 2006,"As ""Flightplan"" showed last year, Jodie Foster can always make a seemingly formulaic story believable. In ""Panic Room"", she and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) have to hide in an impenetrable room to escape some thieves (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto). Probably the best thing about the movie is how each side seems to have a way to outdo the other. But it's also likely to make you suspicious of your own house; just what IS inside a given house.So, even if this is escapism, it's done well. It's always good to know that Jodie Foster isn't afraid to take gritty roles, and that David Fincher (""Se7en"", ""The Game"", ""Fight Club"") is turning out such interesting movies.",Panic Room
6,jboothmillard,Panic Room,6,15 September 2005,"From director David Fincher (Alien³, Se7en, Fight Club) this is a chilling, suspenseful and quite gripping film about two people's struggle to get out of a room and the other people's struggle to get in. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) have moved into a large new house with everything they need, an elevator, a lot of space, and what appears to be like a safe. This safe was known as the Panic Room to the previous owners, and right they were. Just a couple of days later some criminals lead by Burnham (the great Forest Whitaker) break into the house and have Meg and Sarah locking themselves in the Panic Room. Now they are trying everything they can to get help, and the criminals are trying everything they can to get to the Panic Room, for the money. It does slow slightly towards the concluding scenes, when Foster is out the Panic Room, but it is still a cool film. Good!",Panic Room
7,ccthemovieman-1,A Mean But Very Involving Story,8,17 February 2008,"The movie gets high marks for getting you involved with the story. It grabs you early on and doesn't let go. The young girl is a punk with an attitude that is fostered by her too-liberal mother. The film in general is just a little too politically-correct, too, as there are three criminals all breaking into Foster's house and the black guy is the only one shown with a heart. The two white guys, of course, are heartless. Dwight Yokum plays an ultra-profane pig, but that's a normal role for him in films. Jodie Foster isn't real likable here, either, as the mom.The camera-work and David Fincher's direction is very good, especially with the low-angle shots in which the camera roams around the house at about floor level. That's very cool. His direction, along with a suspenseful story, makes this film intriguing.In summary: a mean-edged film that works.",Panic Room
8,rmax304823,We All Need One.,5,15 July 2014,"It's a sign of the times, that panic room. The enemies are all around us. They're smashing down our doors. They're coming through the bathroom window. They're all swarthy and have no taste in clothes. They wear black masks and have weird hair cuts like cartoons out of a 1945 Dick Tracy comic strip. We live on the Upper East Side of New York and they live in Newark. They hate us for our freedom. They're out to get us all right.The unlucky among us come equipped with our own panic rooms, surrounded in steel and concrete, where they can't get at us, but then, since the rooms are in our heads, they may hurt us more than they help us.Jody Foster and her young daughter, Kristin Stewart, have just moved into a jumbo brownstone in the right part of Manhattan. It has a panic room. On their first night in their new mansion, three ugly thugs break in, in pursuit of a $20 million fortune stashed away in a secret safe in that same panic room. When Foster and Stewart become aware of the intruders, they dash into the panic room, unaware that the thieves are determined to break in and grab that stash.I won't bother to describe the rest of the plot. The set-up does the job. You can practically figure out the rest without any help. This piece of dumbed-down paranoia was written by David Koepp, who really knows how to do these things -- ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" ""Spider Man,"" ""Zathura: A Space Adventure."" This is hack work with a vengeance.No possible cliché is missing. You must have seen a thriller in which the helpless heroine, with the madman in hot pursuit, runs to the elevator, clicks and re-clicks the ""close"" button, and the door slides closed just as the villain runs up against and begins pounding on it from outside. Three times here -- one elevator and two sliding steel doors.And as you probably know, one of the captives of the thugs, or even the heroine herself, must have some sort of medical condition that needs medical treatment if she's not to go into shock and perhaps die. A blinking neon sign might as well appear on the screen: URGENT. Often it's asthma, as in ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."" On crippled airplanes, the kid needs a kidney transplant, quickly. Here it's diabetes. The writer and director gave us a touch of claustrophobia in Jody Foster at the beginning but decided to go with Kristin Stewart's diabetes instead. It was a good decision. Claustrophobia can only take the disability so far then it wears itself out, whereas diabetes can change its character from threat to impact over a much longer period, drawing out what little suspense is left in this hoary device.Of the three thugs, Forest Whitaker can act -- and does. Jared Ledo, in cornrows cannot and doesn't. He sounds exactly like a Hollywood actor. Dwight Yoakum as the taciturn, cold-blooded type who kills a partner in a fit of pique, doesn't have much to say, which is just as well. Paul Schulze, as a savvy city cop, gets the best lines and looks right.I didn't like the three thugs, but then I didn't like Foster or Stewart much either. (I thought Stewart was an effeminate boy until the last few minutes.) They're rich and I'm not, and that's why I disliked them. I want to live in a three-story brownstone on the upper East Side too. And I want my own real panic room. I'm exhausted from schlepping these cinder blocks and I beams around inside my head. Whew.",Panic Room
9,Tweekums,A taut thriller set in one house,8,15 December 2012,"When Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah buy a large new home in Manhattan they are surprised to find a steel reinforced safe room in the master bedroom; they certainly didn't think they would need it on their first night in the house. Equally Burnhan, Junior and Raoul; three men who break in hoping to find millions of dollars in a hidden safe had no idea that the house is occupied. Meg and Sarah manage to get into the safe room but there is no way to summon help; as the phone hasn't been reconnected yet. While they are huddled in the room watching the thieves on CCTV the thieves try to figure out how to get them out of the room as the safe is in that room. As the trio of thieves try to figure out how they will get into the room tempers fray.This is a tense thriller where the tensioned is maintained from the moment the thieves break in to the house to the end. This means that while one is watching it is possible to overlook a few questions that will be raised if one thinks about the situation; for example would the ventilation system of a supposedly safe room be as vulnerable as it was here? The acting was pretty solid; Jodie Foster was as good as one would expect from this fine actress and the young Kristen Stewart was excellent as Sarah; it is of little surprise that she has gone on to become a star in her own right. Of the 'bad guys' Forrest Whitaker put in the best performance although I might think that because his character was the least unpleasant of the three! There are a surprising number of changes of situation throughout the film given that it all takes place within one house which helps keep things interesting. If you are after a gripping thriller that isn't non-stop action then this might be the film for you.",Panic Room
10,moonspinner55,Derivative thriller holds the attention but has frayed edges...,6,6 September 2005,"A movie with such a simple premise, taking place on such a confined set, should be very compact, but David Fincher's thin, disappointing ""Panic Room"" seems scattered. Recently-divorced woman and her un-girlie preteen daughter take refuge in a ""safe room"" after three thugs break into their posh Manhattan digs; they don't want to kill anyone, but what they're after is in that precise room. The contrivances in the set-up are very nearly smoothed out (except for a stupid bit involving a flashlight) and the show-off camera techniques are actually welcomed (they add some jazzy visual juice to spike the proceedings). However, Jodie Foster isn't given much to work with in the lead--in fact, nobody is. It's a by-the-numbers exercise in suspense, with echoes of ""Wait Until Dark"" besides. It does get your blood pumping, but the direction and the editing allow it to flag in the stretch. The finale is hectic and visually confusing--releasing the tension the narrative has built up--and the epilogue is flat. Why not add some offhand humor to the mother-daughter conversation? Something like, ""Let's pass on that apartment, Mom, it's got a panic room."" **1/2 from ****",Panic Room
11,dbdumonteil,isolation...,7,4 December 2004,"On paper, ""Panic Room"" (2002) doesn't seem as powerful as David Fincher's three previous movies: Se7en (1995), the Game (1997) and Fight Club (1999). The originality of these three movies that contributed to develop Fincher's image as a unique author is, here, largely absent. It is even a little difficult to believe that he has made this thriller because we don't really recognize his stamp in spite of a few clues (the tracking shots that zoom inside keyholes). Be that as it may, I don't question Fincher's making because ""Panic Room"" is a thriller which doesn't disappoint too much.Very inspired by Alfred ""hitch"" Hitchcock (certain movements of camera evoke certain great sequence shots from the master of suspense), the movie is shrouded in a tense and oppressive atmosphere as soon as the burglars break into the apartment. As for the famous ""panic room"", it is basically a safe place but Fincher does very well by turning it into a threatening room, nearly a vault. Its disturbing aspect is perfectly rendered by the light which badly shines.The script is well designed but it doesn't exclude a few faults. One can underline a lack of inventiveness from the starting idea (the reversal of situation after about 80 minutes of movie is a good example) and the ending disappoints because conventional and cosy. Something tells me that Hollywood passed through that. But the scriptwriter David Koepp did very well very his job for that kind of story: to be suspenseful as much as possible. The proof: it is nearly impossible not to feel stress, shivers and anxiety. One can also thank him for having introduced a certain humor in such a story.At last, 2 actors lead without problems the cast: Jodie Foster who is excellent as usual and I would grant a mention to Forest Whitaker, the best of the three gangsters.At the end of this critic, it is true that Fincher's opus can't hold a candle to his previous movies but it remains a well-crafted thriller.",Panic Room
12,blanche-2,A hard day's night that doesn't go as well as one originally hoped,7,9 June 2007,"Jodie Foster and her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart) are stuck in a ""Panic Room,"" in this 2002 film also starring Forrest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto and Jonathan Pryce. The robbery of a safe in an empty house runs into a few problems when the thieves (Whitaker, Yoakam, and Leto) find the house occupied and the occupants in the very room that has the safe - the panic room. How to get into the room or force the people out is the question, when the woman and girl prove pretty smart.This derivative film, a sort of 2002 version of ""Wait Until Dark,"" seems to have been pretty much blasted from here to kingdom come here on IMDb. I didn't see it in the theater; I rented it, and I think often that makes a difference in how disappointed or cheated one feels. I found it suspenseful and exciting with good acting. The story is full of plot holes that others have listed, so I won't bother. It's easier to accept plot holes in comedy or in a caper film. It's annoying in drama or suspense, admittedly. Foster gives a strong performance, full of girl power and intelligence. She hits all the right notes as a desperate mother. Whitaker is excellent as the weak link who works for the security company that has a contract for the house and doesn't want any violence. Kristen Stewart is perfect casting as Foster's daughter Sarah - she looks so much like Foster it's amazing, though I admit for the first few scenes I thought Sarah was a boy.Someone in a previous post asks if anyone sits down and looks at a script in Hollywood and works on the plot holes. Obviously the answer to that one is no, and here's why - films are greenlit on the basis of their business plan and who's attached. Hello, no one looks at the script or a treatment. And once the script is in production, 8 or 9 writers work on it. And you wonder why there are holes. The answer is, because there are holes in lots of heads.",Panic Room
13,Quinoa1984,Another good example of film-making from Fincher and company,8,3 April 2002,"David Fincher, director of such rough edge contemporary classics such as Se7en and Fight Club, returns with his fifth film, Panic Room, a concentrated crackerjack movie with enough suspense for three movies. Foster gives her best in a good number of years as a new tenant in a large house in Manhattan with roomy spaces and a ""panic room"" where nobody can get in once you lock the door, on the third floor.  The first night seems to be going smoothly for the woman and her daughter, until a trio of ill-matched thieves and somewhat masterminds (Forrest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) break in the house and the panic room comes into play.  What also comes into play is one of the most ingeniously crafted chess game thrillers I've seen in a while.  The film goes down thanks to an ending after an appropriate ending, and some character inconsistencies, otherwise, it is worth the while.  Great cinematography by Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji.

14,wes-connors,David & David Throw Jodie Foster into a Panic,6,3 January 2010,"After divorcing her wealthy husband, scholarly Jodie Foster (as Meg Altman) goes house shopping with her beautiful young daughter Kristen Stewart (as Sarah). The pair find a spacious ""to die for"" Manhattan brownstone, and quickly take up residence. One of the home's selling points is a ""Panic Room"" where you can hide out safely in the unlikely event of a home intrusion. Well, you guessed it. As the new residents begin their very first night's sleep, three dangerous invaders enter the house...Looking for millions hidden (guess where!), the crooked trio - kindly non-violent Forest Whitaker (as Burnham), maniacal bus driver Dwight Yoakam (as Raoul), and ""not built for prison"" Jared Leto (as Junior) - terrorize the new residents. David Fincher directs the cameras to move everywhere and anywhere; he surfs through the house - up stairs and through pipes, vents, keyholes, and even walls.

15,michaelRokeefe,Are you ever totally safe?,5,12 July 2003,"Suspense and white knuckle stress. This thriller is about a mother(Jodie Foster) and her daughter(Kristen Stewart)being forced to hide in a fortified ""safe room"" when thieves break into their new spacious home. The intruders are played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam. Foster did nothing out of the ordinary besides show fear. The scene I liked the least is where Foster goes into her ""little girl"" persona when talking to the police at the front door. I really got a kick out of Yoakam who once again plays a ruthless bad ass. At times a little sluggish; and you have to feel for the estranged husband(Patrick Bauchau)who ends up a bloody pulp of a mess strapped to a chair. You really need to be in a dark mood to survive this one.",Panic Room
16,hitchcockthelegend,Fincher's often derided thriller demands repeat viewings.,8,12 June 2011,"Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah, move into a vast Brownstone home, this place is unique because it has a panic room, a room of safety from where no intruders can gain access. Sure enough on their first night in their new home, they are forced to flee to the room as three intruders break in to the house, but trouble is, is that what the intruders want is in the panic room itself.From the off we know that Panic Room is going to be oozing David Fincher stylishness, the opening credits sprawled across the Manhattan skyscrape like advertising billboards, perfectly set the tone for the movie to follow. I personally think that following on from the harshness and ingenuity of ""Fight Club"", many were surprised at the simplicity of Panic Room's structure, this is after all a straight forward cat and mousery thriller set in one foreboding building. Yet Fincher gains much claustrophobia from such a large building setting, managing to rack up the tension in every reel. The film, in spite of the oppressive nature of the story, never sits still either. The action kicks in from the off and through a series of devilish stunts, it continues through to the pulse raising finale.The David Koepp screenplay does not seem dark enough on the first viewing, because some of the interplay between the three intruders is actually jocular, but it never loses sight of its thriller heart. Subsequent revisits to the film reveal it to be a tightly constructed character piece, in what is practically a five character story. The real winner in that department is Jodie Foster's Meg Altman, it would have been easy for the character to be ground out as some super heroine, with death defying feats of courage masking her out as wonder woman, but Fincher has her pure and simply as a resourceful human being. She's fiercely maternal and strong and intelligent, but at her core she remains fallible, and with that she becomes believable. The other big plus point in the film is Fincher's use of the house, where his camera glides about like a phantom, a ghostly observer to the unfolding proceedings. In and out of locks and coffee pots, up and down stairs, tilts, as we track the movements of the intruders, Fincher isn't showing off, he's putting us the viewer into the mix as well.Cast are very good, Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and a surprisingly potent Dwight Yoakam all come together very well under Fincher's watchful eye, whilst young Kristen Stewart as Sarah puts much emotive heart into a role that could so easily have been too syrupy approaching the final act. Yes it's fair to say that one has to suspend disbelief, this is after all a home invasion thriller following a true course, but in Fincher's hands it rises above cliché to thrive on atmospherics and character dynamics. Well put together and big on ticking time bomb tension, Panic Room gets better on repeat viewings. 8/10",Panic Room
17,Theo Robertson,Unengaging,4,7 December 2012,"Film4 is showing a weekend season dedicated to David Fincher , a director who is held in high regard but one who I've been keen on . In fact when people describe him as the best director of his generation my eyes roll over . Regardless I sat down to watch PANIC ROOM mainly because there was nothing else on The first thing to strike you about the film is the cinematography . It has a well shot murky quality to it , perhaps better than the film deserves . If there's a bad point to this then it perhaps belongs to a different movie . If anyone is looking for cinematographers to shoot a gloom laden post apocalyptic drama then give Conrad Hall or Daruis Khondji a call Of course cinematography can only carry a film so far and it's storytelling that's important and this is where the film collapses .The first half hour plays out like one of these daytime TV shows where someone inspects a house they want to buy which makes for an uninvolving start but once the story properly starts so do the serious problems . Like so many other thrillers PANIC ROOM has an idiot plot where if someone stops being an idiot the film will end . Some films get away with this due to the excitement levels where as PANIC ROOM doesn't . Imgine if you were in the same predicament as the female protagonist here and you briefly had access to a mobile phone . Who would you phone , the police or your ex-husband ? see what I mean by idiot plot ? Once again we see Hollywood coming up with a very good premise and it being sabotaged by the way the screenplay develops . What could have and should have been a tightly claustrophobic similar to the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 where the suspension of disbelief is upheld ends up becoming a rather unengaging film featuring complete idiots . It also illustrates that no matter who the director is he needs a good screenplay to make a good film",Panic Room
18,jotix100,"This ""ole"" house...",8,25 April 2002,"David Fincher's Panic Room is a film packed with action even though it only uses one set, the old house that Meg Altman buys and comes with so many surprises attached, besides the location and the incredible amount of space, even for a brownstone in Manhattan's Upper West Side. The  script by David Koepp is very tightly written. It keeps us engrossed in the story and we don't want to keep our eyes from the screen for one moment.
The Panic Room of the title comes in very handy for Meg and her daughter and serves them well and protect them from the intruders trying to get into it to get the treasure left by the previous owner.Jody Foster's acting is very tight and controlled. We enjoyed Forest Whitaker's bandit with a conscience. Jared Leto shows his versatility here in a role completely different from his previous appearances.
This is a film that will entertain as well as please the viewer.",Panic Room
19,preppy-3,Just OK,5,8 April 2002,"Jodie and her diabetic daughter close themselves off in a panic room when a trio of hoodlums break in for a hidden fortune in a safe.  The problem: the safe is in the panic room.It's well-acted (especially by Jodie Foster and Jared Leto), well-directed (Fincher achieves some incredible traveling shots and shots between floors and walls) and purposefully dark--but it's just average.The plot is original but, other than that, it goes through the same motions any other genre picture would go through.  I saw every single plot twist coming and the constant darkness and dim lighting really gets depressing after a while.  Also I never felt any urgency for the people and their situation--I was always aware I was watching a movie.  And I don't like it when movies put an innocent little girl in danger.It is somewhat worth seeing for Jodie alone (with all due respect, she's a better actor than director) but she's done better movies.  Ditto for director Fincher.  So, I can't really recommend it, but you could do worse.",Panic Room
20,poolandrews,OK thriller.,5,11 January 2008,"Panic Room is set in New York City where recently divorced Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) & her young daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) move into a new house which has a panic room built in which is designed for the owners of the house to hide in if the house is broken into. It just so happens that three thieves break into the house that very night in search of twenty odd million dollars hidden in safe by the previous owner who died, both Meg & Sarah make it into the panic room which is impossible to breach from the outside but unfortunately what the thieves want is actually inside the panic room & as such there is stand off as the thieves want to get in while Meg & Sarah want to get out...Directed by David Fincher this decent thriller is alright but nothing that special. The script by David Koepp has a pretty solid base story with Meg & her daughter trapped inside the panic room with three thieves wanting to get in & no way of getting outside help, unfortunately the film drags badly & becomes quite repetitive as we get lots of scenes of the thieves arguing & trying to come up with ways of making Meg & Sarah come out. Yawn. Having said that towards the end there's a neat twist in which the roles are reversed as the thieves become trapped in the panic room with Meg outside with a gun waiting to shoot them when they come out. Overall I thought it was alright, I didn't like the character's that much, the dialogue is forgettable & one could say it's far fetched at times but at least it kept me watching. I wouldn't say I was glued to the screen but it did keep me interested although I wouldn't call it brilliant or anything like that & I will have probably completely forgotten all about it by the end of the week. Panic Room also uses the standard Hollywood plot device of diabetes for putting someone is immediate danger of dying, I have diabetes & while what happens in Panic Room is theoretically possible it's very unlikely that Meg would suffer a life threatening hypo 'out of the blue' like she does (she is seen eating earlier that night) & Panic Room like many other films gives the impression that us diabetics will suddenly collapse & die if we don't inject ourselves every two minutes with insulin which is complete crap.Director Fincher does OK, he films everything in very muted colours as is the trend for these sorts of films. There's a surprising amount of CGI computer effects in a film that you would initially have thought wouldn't need many, Fincher has his camera travel up along inside pipes & through 'solid' floors & wall. Some of the effects are OK while other's look fake. The violence is minimal, there are a few gunshot wounds including a couple to the head & someone is beaten up. I wouldn't call it scary or that atmospheric but there are a few scenes which manage to raise some tension. The film reminds me of Phone Booth (2002) made the same year since it's stars are trapped in a single location with some bad guy's keeping them there but while Phone Booth tried to say something & only lasted 80 odd minutes Panic Room doesn't & didn't. According to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section the opening credit sequence of Panic Room took a year to complete, after having seen them yesterday all I can say is why?With a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 one has to say that sounds like a lot of money considering it's set almost entirely within one location with only six people in the thing although Foster apparently go paid $12,000,000. Nicole Kidman was originally cast as Meg & started shooting the film but had to pull out after a recurring knee injury sustained on Moulin Rouge! (2002) so Foster was then cast, I don't think any of the Kidman footage has ever surfaced but I would have probably preferred her in the role since I don't really like Foster.

21,zardoz-13,"Don't Trap Yourself in the ""Panic Room!""",2,16 March 2009,"David Fincher has fashioned some first-rate films since he started directing movies back in 1992. The Colorado native called the shots on ""Se7en"" (1995), a gripping serial killer saga starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as the cops and Kevin Stacey as the villain, that disturbed as much as it enthralled audiences. He toyed mischievously with audiences in ""The Game"" (1997) toplining Michael Douglas and Sean Penn in the tradition of George Roy Hill's Oscar-winning Best Picture ""The Sting."" The incomparable and offbeat ""Fight Club"" (1999) qualified hands down as Fincher's finest, reuniting him with Brad Pitt and co-starring Edward Norton in a pre-terrorist 9/11 opus. Until he made the Jodie Foster crime film ""Panic Room,"" ""Alien 3"" ranked as Fincher's least distinguished epic, with a shaven-headed Sigourney Weaver impersonating science officer Ripley for the last time as a flesh & blood human being. Comparatively, as the least commercial entry in the creature-feature franchise, the anemic ""Alien 3"" induced sleep rather than suspense. No matter how atrocious ""Alien 3"" seemed, ""Panic Room"" weighs in as infinitely worse. Only deep-fried Jodie Foster fans will savor this superficial, occasionally sadistic exercise in futility. Actually, the producers cast Nicole Kidman, but she injured herself and pulled out. A hopelessly miscast Jodie Foster brings a certain elegance to this unexceptional nail-biter. Indeed, lensers Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji's atmospheric cinematography, the eerie lighting, and the looming interiors win ""Panic Room"" brownie points, not nearly enough.This inferior feminist fable takes its title from a 12 by 12 foot, steel-plated, concrete bunker inside a four-story Brownstone in Upper West Side Manhattan. The reclusive tycoon who owned it has died, and our divorced heroine, Meg Altman (a bespectacled Jodie Foster) and her diabetic daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart of ""Twilight"") now occupy the place. Plagued by paranoia, the late millionaire equipped the townhouse with a secret room. This impregnable bomb shelter boasts a high tech surveillance system with a cameras that scan the premises 24 hours a day from every angle inside and outside. The chamber contains its own ventilation system and features a separate telephone line. During the first night that Meg and Sarah sleep in their new beds, they awaken to find themselves at the mercy of three harebrained hoodlums out to steal millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds that the dead financier concealed in a vault in the safe room.Predictably, Meg and Sarah hole up in the bunker while Junior (Jared Leto of ""Girl, Interrupted""), Burnham (Forrest Whitaker of ""Bird""), and Raoul (country singer Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade"") toil incompetently to evict them. Aside from their vulnerability as females-at-risk with flawsMeg suffers from claustrophobia, while Sarah requires insulin shots)these females do little to appeal to our sympathy. Ironically, Whitaker's character emerges as not only the most sympathetic but also the most interesting. Poor Patrick Bauchau of ""A View to a Kill"" plays Meg's millionaire, ex-husband (no relation to the deceased tycoon) and takes a hellacious beating from Raoul in a scene which will undoubtedly sicken some viewers.This tedious, third-rate tale unravels from the outset with a premise as contrived as it convoluted plot. What veteran scenarist David Koepp of ""Stir of Echoes"" fame doesn't steal from his own scripts, he appropriates from the durable Audrey Hepburn thriller ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967) and the exciting Sean Connery caper ""The Anderson Tapes"" (1972). The Raoul character clearly recalls the Mafia thug in ""Anderson Tapes"" that veteran character actor Val Avery played in a ski-mask with a penchant for violence. The ending that disposes of the bearer bonds comes straight out of John Huston's ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948). Had the ""Panic Room"" been a tenth as entertaining as any of those classics, this derivative mishmash with its unintentionally hilarious histrionics might have proved tolerable. Instead, ""Panic Room"" resembles a heavy-handed Lifetime channel version of ""Home Alone."" Decked out in a black, tank-top to display cleavage, Jodie Foster imitates the antics of Macaulay Culkin as she battles a trio of bungling burglars. These clueless cretins make the Three Stooges appear like intellectual titans. Foster is a top-flight actress who shouldn't have stooped to this one-dimensional nonsense. Koepp's script bristles with inconsistencies. After making a big deal about Meg's claustrophobia early in the film, Fincher and Koepp unaccountably drop it from the plot when they tighten the screws on our protagonists. The scene with the butane gas tank elicits derision more than dread, and the flashlight batteries in another scene were clearly of the Eveready variety.Don't get trapped in the ""Panic Room.""",Panic Room
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Pretty generic thriller, I guess",7,29 February 2004,"Considering that this is the work of David Fincher, the man who brought us Se7en, it's pretty ordinary. That doesn't mean it's bad, though. It's OK. It just doesn't reach the heights of Fincher's other work. The plot is pretty good, and somewhat original. The actors all perform very well, every single major character shines through. The characters are believable and their actions are mostly understandable. The special effects are very good. The cinematography is great. The movie has some exceptional thrills at several points, and has a good atmosphere throughout the run time. The last scene especially had me at the edge of my seat in excitement, right up until the end. For being relatively mainstream, I think this movie does stand out a bit, from the average thriller. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad either. It's thoroughly entertaining, which is exactly what we want from movies. I'd recommend it to pretty much any fan of thrillers, David Fincher, or any of the head actors involved in this. You probably won't be disappointed, as long as you don't expect too much. 7/10",Panic Room
23,view_and_review,I Want One of Those Rooms in My House,7,23 May 2007,"This movie started off great, even the opening scenes were very eye catching. With a combination of special effects and good camera work, we saw burglars attempting to break into the huge loft Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) lived in. We even got a shot of the burglars through the fine crevices of the keyhole in a door.The movie then became an exciting game of cat and mouse. That game is always more intriguing when humans are involved. The panic room was the safe haven for Meg and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), but obviously the movie would have been very boring if they just ran into the panic room and stayed there until help arrived. Many other variables were cleverly introduced to add suspense, and Jodie is good at playing the anxious suspense role.The movie ended kind of weakly though. Usually when you hit someone with a sledge hammer and knock them down a flight of stairs they die, or are severely injured. Ramon, on the other hand, was still able to climb back up the flight of stairs he was knocked down and pose a viable threat. Just a tad thick on the villain aspect of this flick, but still good.",Panic Room

It is a surprise to them when a gang of three burglars break in on the first evening, and no less so than to the burglars, who thought the house was empty. Fortunately the house has a panic room into which Meg and Sarah escape, and so the suspense begins to mount.This is a high concept movie - a simple set up, developed to its fullest extent. The house is the film's single location, the cast is small, and the suspense is racked up by director David Fincher far beyond what you might expect. In this, David Koepp's concept and script helps, by developing the events which can happen between these five people in believable - and increasingly tense - ways.This is a gripping and enjoyable thriller.",Panic Room

Decent little thriller, but director David Fincher (Fight Club, The Game, Se7en, Alien3) and Hollywood writer David Koepp again just miss offering up a masterpiece. The comparisons I have seen to Hitchcock make me cringe.  The trio of bad guys is at times cartoonish.  Jared Leto is almost unrecognizable as the ring leader.  Forrest Whitaker is the burglar with a heart and Dwight Yoakam is cast as pure evil.  His role is poorly written and we know what he is capable of from his stunning role in ""Sling Blade"".  Jodie turns in another professional, believable role, but is let down by the script and direction. Her daughter played by Kristen Stewart is unable to create the sympathy from the audience necessary for her role.

Jodie Foster moves into a big house with her daughter after a separation. An impressive title sequence is followed by the standard tour of the house, which includes an elevator and a panic room for emergencies. Before long three men break in and begin a long night of terrorizing. Fine setup marred by predictable formula until a right turn is taken. Stylish directing by David Fincher who also made such intriguing thrillers as The Game and Fight Club. Foster is resourceful in her struggle to outwit the criminals as well as obtain medicine for her daughter. Kristen Stewart is effective as her daughter who needs medical care. We know where this is headed but it is the criminals who are the most interesting. Jared Leto leads the trio with profane instructions but Foster is reluctant to reason thus causing certain injuries to him. Forest Whitaker plays another criminal whom manufactured the safe room and needed to crack it. He is more human than the others and has other alternatives as to why he is doing this. Dwight Yoakam plays the third leg in this criminal tragedy where intelligence works against them.

29,JamesHitchcock,"Efficiently Made, Claustrophobic Thriller, but Could Have Used a Tighter Script",6,2 May 2006,"In this film Jodie Foster plays Meg, a wealthy divorcée looking for a new home in New York for herself and her teenage daughter Sarah. The house she chooses is a luxury Manhattan brownstone with an unusual feature- a ""panic room"", or strongroom in which the householder can take refuge from intruders. Meg's panic room is put to the test on her very first night in her new home. A gang of three burglars break in searching for a fortune which they believe was concealed in the house by its former owner. Meg and Sarah retreat to the panic room, but unfortunately that is the very room in which the money is hidden. Roger Ebert's comparison of the film to a game of chess is an apt one. We have an apparent stalemate, with the villains unable to break into the panic room but Meg and Sarah unable to escape to safety or to force the three men to leave her home. Both sides are compelled to try one gambit after another to try and break the deadlock. A complication is the fact that Sarah is a diabetic and desperately needs a life-saving injection.As has been pointed out elsewhere, the strongest influence on the film seems to have been ""Wait until Dark"" from the late sixties. In that film, Audrey Hepburn also played a New York resident menaced in her own home by three criminals who have broken in to search for something which she does not even know exists. In both films the three criminals are strongly differentiated. In the earlier film, the characters played by Richard Crenna and Jack Weston are non-violent con-men who attempt to trick Hepburn's character into handing over the ""McGuffin"" (a doll filled with drugs) by an elaborate ruse; the menacing figure is their boss Roat (played by Alan Arkin), a murderously violent thug. In ""Panic Room"" there is also a murderous psychopath and two comparatively non-violent accomplices. The most violent of the three is named Raoul; I wondered if the similarity of this name to ""Roat"" could be a deliberate reference to the earlier film. In both films the downfall of the villains is caused by the fact that their differing characters and dissensions between them make it impossible for them to work together as a team. (This suggests that other influences may have been ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and the British black comedy ""The Ladykillers"").Jodie Foster is one of the most talented actresses in the cinema today, and her performance as Meg is a good one. The trouble with Jodie is that she has given so many great performances (""The Accused"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Sommersby"", ""Nell"") that a merely good one can come to seem disappointing, particularly in a film like this one where a truly great performance in the lead role could have transformed an entertaining but minor thriller into a major one. (In ""Wait Until Dark"" Audrey Hepburn achieves the feat of turning that film, despite its often far-fetched plot, into something eminently watchable).For much of the time ""Panic Room"" is an efficiently made, claustrophobic thriller. Like Terence Young, who directed ""Wait Until Dark"", David Fincher is clearly much influenced by Alfred Hitchcock. It does, however, suffer from certain weaknesses. The most important is that identified by reviewer Ricky Roma, namely that the three villains, especially the character played by Jared Leto, are often too clumsy and bungling to seem really threatening. The best of the three actors who play them is Forest Whitaker as Burnham, a craftsman who specialises in making panic rooms himself, but even so the sudden twist at the end when Burnham shifts from being Meg's enemy to being her protector never seems plausible. My overall impression was that ""Panic Room"" was based on a promising idea for a thriller, but that it could have been a much better film if the plotting and the script had been tightened up. 6/10",Panic Room

Unfortunately, either the script writers were on strike, or just plain stupid when they put this thing into writing. I mean, these crooks have to be the most stupid crooks ever. Why would you wait until a place has been sold and moved into to decide to break into a safe that has millions of dollars in it? I mean, I would have been there while it was empty to do this. The script does not really give you enough background on why this circumstance came to be other than talking about some estate, but still little sense is made of this.The script even makes fun of it's flaws late in the film when Foster takes a sledge hammer around and starts knocking out closed circuit cameras, and one of the crooks makes their most intelligent words in the film - ""Why the h*ll didn't we think of that?""If you buy the hokey premise of the script then you enjoy the suspense it creates. The trouble is there are so many holes that you have to be a fan of Swiss cheese to really do that. Still, I did enjoy seeing the folks in this cast try to make this into a good film. If it were not for their acting, my rating would be a 1. There is so much wrong with the script that all I can recommend is if you put your brain in park, and just watch it for the cast, you will enjoy it. If you try to make any sense out of the actions the plot generates, you will wind up in a rubber room with a straight jacket to keep you restrained.

Now the plot is about a mother and daughter using the panic room inside there home as a tool for survival when criminals enter their home. The thing is, the movie didn't have the tension I thought it would have in this type of movie and nothing about it was really gripping or anything like that. For a David Fincher movie I expected more, on a positive note the camera work can be cool at times but that is basically the main positive aspect of this movie. The movie starts out okay but quickly loses it's flare after a while, the whole movie seemed like a game of tag inside a house. It's basically a thriller that does a okay job, but it just didn't meet my expectations for it and wasn't all that thrilling either. This film tries to be intelligent but the script just isn't that good and nothing about it really amazes. Most parts of this movie seemed a bit too narrow and predictable and does not pull any surprises. After a while the movie starts to drag mainly because of the tedious aspect of it all, I really wanted to like this movie but was left disappointed after it was finished.

34,sddavis63,An Average Movie; Poorly Cast,4,21 April 2003,"My first problem with this movie: trying to accept Jodie Foster as a mom. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of Jodie Foster to begin with. She was good in ""Silence Of The Lambs,"" and years ago I liked her in ""Carny"" I believe it was, but I just do not - and I don't think I ever will - see her as a maternal figure. That was a stumbling block I couldn't overcome while watching this movie.The story (of a mom and daughter trapped in a secret room in their house after it's invaded by a trio of dangerous criminals) also struck me as a bit silly. (I also found myself wondering why a woman with one daughter wants a house that is at least three stories high from what I could see. How much room do they need?) The criminals were unconvincing. The guy in the mask (Dwight Yoakum) was hardly scary, even though he was, I think, supposed to be the hard nosed one, and Forest Whitaker as Burnham - the most ""likeable"" of the three - seemed strangely out of place (and his very violent bit at the end seemed out of character for a guy who said earlier ""I never hurt anybody."" I mean, he could have just tackled the guy!)Also, what's with the androgynous child (Kristen Stewart?)

The flashy camera work was quite unique and stunning, well all of Finchers films have great cinematography.The dark atmosphere of dread was top-notch, the score was okay, but under all that gloss it's still just an average thriller.

Luckily, this new apartment has a custom-made panic room to keep them safe-ish, but it's also where the loot is hidden. When mother and daughter lock themselves into the sealed compartment, a game of catch as catch can commences between them and the interlopers.Seasoned performers like Jodie Foster and Forrest Whitaker do a commendable job keeping their faces straight acting through ever more unlikely scenes as the film progresses, occasionally with dire dialogue to match, for instance mother hen Josie says to her initially bratty daughter played by a young Kristen Stewart, ""It's disgusting how much I love you "" the kind of line only a movie mother would utter.Fincher employs every weapon in his armoury to draw in the viewer, with a succession of camera tricks designed to create mini-climax after mini-climax but the premise won't stand it and in the end I just felt battered about the head by all the noise, violence, swearing and supposed high-tension.Besides Foster and Whitaker, the surprise turn in the acting is by country-singer Dwight Yoakum, although quite why he goes through half the film with his face covered escaped me. Maybe he had the measles. You will be amazed too at how he survives getting his hand jammed in a lift door, then getting walloped on the head with a sledge- hammer and falling down a flight of stairs, getting up one last time, as it happens, to swat away Stewart and threaten to cave in Foster's head. It's that kind of movie, ludicrous and crass yet not without some vicarious thrills along the way, but these are overdone and come in too quick succession.

The similarities include the fact that both films feature a trade-off between protagonists who cannot communicate with each other: in Spielberg's movie, two drivers locked in their vehicles and in this film, a wealthy divorcée and her child who buy a house with a ""panic room"" (a place to hide from intruders) who promptly have to use it when their home is burgled. However, whereas Fincher's previous movies - 'Alien3', 'Se7en', 'The Game' (my own favourite) and 'Fight Club' were all at some level intellectually interesting, the same cannot be said of 'Panic Room', which follows all the rules of its genre and contains several scenes of purest corn that you can see coming from twenty miles off.

'Panic Room (2002)' is pretty pacy and nicely gritty to boot, being unusually violent for pictures of the kind but never less tense either. It manages to make a compelling home-invasion seem suitably layered, presenting the bad guys as rounded individuals with differing yet believable motives and personalities.

(Doubtless if I looked hard enough I'd find an equivalent film from the silent era.)One of the reasons I absolutely detested 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' was it's cowardly targeting of low budget obscurities just because they were old and cheap; while they never picked on unintentionally hilarious Big Dumb Movies with 'A' stars like this one. The two gormless burglars blunder about like the crooks in 'Home Alone' or a Children's Film Foundation production; and whenever anybody has to make a decision they unerringly make the dumbest one possible.

41,bowmanblue,Tight little thriller,7,25 July 2021,"I do like films that are basically set in a single location and hardly need any special effects, fancy sets or intricate action set-pieces to work. They're a hard trick to pull off. They risk either being called 'cheap,' or simply 'boring' because they don't really go anywhere. Luckily, 'Panic Room' is an example of a good little film that doesn't need action, special effects, or multiple locations to be tense and engaging. Of course casting Jodie Foster in the lead never hurts either.She plays a single mother who moves into a large New York apartment with her teenage daughter (a near unrecognisable Kristen Stewart). Unsurprisingly, this building comes complete with a small, secure 'panic room' which can be used should a trio of burglars ever break into your house late one night. Guess what happens when they move in?Yes, three men (including Forest Whitaker and Jared Leto) break in, forcing Foster and Stewart) to take refuge in the titular location and do their best to launch some sort of 'counter offensive' from there.Now, I know most people will just ask, 'Why doesn't she then call the police?' Well, the film's script does a decent enough job of explaining why no 'obvious' option is available to her from then on, so - in terms of the movie's plot - it does all make sense and you don't have to suspend your disbelief too much to appreciate it.The whole film takes place within the apartment (which, sometimes does come across as more of a 'mansion' due to its size than any flat that I've ever been in!) and, despite the set's size, it still gives off a nicely claustrophobic atmosphere. All performances are good here (but then you'd probably expect that from the talent on the cast list) and the film is still as good today as it ever was.If you're looking for a decent little thriller to watch this will certainly kill an hour and a half and you won't feel like you've wasted your time. Interestingly, it's also directed by a well-known (and highly competent) director - David Fincher - yet somehow, in my opinion, it never really felt like part of his body of work.

43,ThomasDrufke,Increasingly Riveting But Uncomfortably Claustrophobic,8,28 September 2014,"David Fincher is simply one of the finest directors to ever live. He sticks to drama-thrillers but does it so well. Panic Room has a simple premise but is executed unbelievably well. It's also for the most part well acted and the last 20 minutes or so is a true cinematic thrill ride. Out of a home invasion film, Panic Room gives just about as much as you would want.All the colors throughout the house signal Fincher's style. He uses almost all grey, black, and hints of dark blue. He sets the tone in the opening credits with Howard Shore's haunting score playing, and promises quite a ride. At first, it seemed to have all the clichés from past films. She doesn't set up the phone, the child has a medical problem, she turns away just as the robber is passing her room, and also the fact that they rob the house on the first day they buy it. With that being said it gets away from clichés and brings us a nail biting invasion film. Forest Whitaker is a big reason why Panic Room will stick with me for awhile. He plays the intruder who is torn between staying for the money or leaving to ensure the family is safe. He's the best character by far and overshadowed even the great Jared Leto and Jodie Foster. Even Kristen Stewart impressed me with her acting in the supporting role as the child.I really liked the few twists and turns it took near the end. I always like a film that keeps me on the edge of my toes and makes me believe that the main characters could be in danger. If anything this film can give someone a few tips on how to handle an invasion, that is if your house is a mansion with like 5 floors and a panic room. I'm not sure why this film gets all the hate or just lack of love. Sure it's not a complicated plot and sure it doesn't have the shock value of Se7en or Fight Club, but it's still a well directed movie with some great performances. But I will say that I did not like Dwight Yoakam's performance. Partially due to them writing him as the prototypical villain.Panic Room also has a high re-watchability factor. It's not a long film and the 2 hours fly by. It's one of those movies that you don't go out of your way to see, but when it's on, you keep it on. So far, Fincher hasn't made a bad film. In fact, I think his worst movie is The Game which is still a solid film. I look forward to THIS WEEK's Gone Girl to see what else he brings to the mystery-thriller-crime-drama genres.+Fincher's style written all over it +Whitaker's performance +Intense and unique in some aspects +Re-Watchable -Cliché filled -Yoakam was a weak villain 8.0/10",Panic Room
44,MLDinTN,Jodie Foster is pretty good...,5,29 May 2002,"but that is about all.  I was a little disappointed after seeing this film. (SPOILERS):  I was expecting some big plot twist at the end, but there really wasn't.  We get a mean Dwight Yokum, but he just wasn't one of those villains you love to hate.  I thought there was a lot of filler that wasn't to entertaining like them shining a light out of the toilet and trying to get a cell phone and such what. Were we supposed to see Forrest Whitaker as the potential ""hero"" just because he gave the kid the glucose shot and acting like he didn't really want to rob the place once he found out people were home.  He agreed to do something illegal, so he should get whats coming to him. Which I guess he sort of does at the end? (END OF SPOILERS)

45,g-bodyl,Solidly Directed Thriller!,9,5 September 2013,"Panic Room is not one of David Fincher's best films, but it's still a magnificent piece of filmmaking. Thanks to his strong directing and some powerful acting performances, Panic Room rises above most thrillers regarding breaking and entering. This film is dark, well-written, and it reminds me of thrillers of old.Fincher's film is about a divorced wife and her daughter who move into a big house that has a panic room which is a room that will keep you safe in case of an intruder. But once the house is intruded by some people looking for millions, a deadly cat and mouse game will begin.This film is well-acted. Jodie Foster gives an elevated performance and is better than I thought she would be. Kristen Stewart, before her big fame, is actually pretty good. Forest Whittaker and Dwight Yoakam make great, memorable villains.Overall, this is a well-made, taut thriller that really gave me some thrills. It goes beyond the clichés and adds some new material. This is not Fincher's best film, but it shows how one of his weakest films is better than most films. I rate this film 9/10.",Panic Room

The plot is good, but maybe a little conventional overall, and if the details aren't completely predictable, the general flow of events is. The whole cast is quite good--Foster in a familiar embattled, determined role, and Jared Leto is an appropriately crazed, if slightly caricatured, bad guy who just wants money. Don't we all.I saw this when it came out and was dazzled and yet disappointed by the plot. The second time, knowing the events, I was able to just watch how they unfolded, and it was much better.

This is one of Jodie's best films and one of her best performances, and I thought the finale was especially awesome, plus one of my favorite moments in the film is when Jodie races out the door to get her cellphone, as I found that to be very tense. It grips the audience from beginning to end, and what especially impressed me was the direction by David Fincher, plus the ending was very satisfying. This is a top notch thriller, that's extremely suspenseful, with lots of creepy atmosphere and wonderful performances, and I say Go see it now!. The Direction is wonderful. David Fincher does a wonderful job here, with some outstanding camera work, fantastic angles, great zoom in's and zoom out's great use of blue and black, and adding plenty of creepy and tense atmosphere, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Jodie Foster is amazing as always, and is amazing here, she is very likable, on top of things at all times, had really good chemistry with Kristen Stewart, played a really cool character, and didn't crumble under pressure, as i loved that!, she was amazing (Jodie Rules!!!!!!!). Kristen Stewart is excellent as the Daughter, she did a fantastic job for such a young age for this type of role I was really impressed. Forest Whitaker is fantastic as the Burglar, with a big heart, I really liked him, and it was so cool with what he did in the end. Jared Leto is great, and quite menacing as one of the other burglars, he was great. Dwight Yoakam is surprisingly good as the other Burglar, and was also quite menacing.

The story is nothing short of ludicrous, consisting of a series of implausible events. The characters are one-dimensional idiots. The script is bad enough, but the inept direction adds to the misery. Fincher has his camera continually in motion. It tracks all over the apartment, whizzing through floors and walls. It is extremely distracting. If one is not paying attention to the inane dialog early in the film, it is easy to miss the name of Foster's child, allowing one to spend at least half the film trying to figure out whether the child is male or female.",Panic Room

Everything happens in a house almost without furniture and with a cast reduced to the minimum. Sounds like a problem? I guarantee you will not. Lightness and simplicity make the film even more elegant and easier to enjoy. The film is not very tense and the antagonists are not necessarily bloodthirsty psychopaths, but the drama is guaranteed and the plot gives each actor the right time to shine without the film seeming to have been overstretched. In fact, the pace is good, especially given the simplicity of all the story. The cast features a young Kristen Stewart and veterans Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker and Jared Leto.

Written by David Koepp who gave us Jurrasic Park, Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones among others. This man KNOWS how to write a compelling yet simple story.3 burglars break in assuming nobody is home. Too bad. Jodie Foster just moved in there with her young kid. Will she survive the burglars assault in her ""safe"" panic room, a room specifically built to survive such an attack? This movie might at first sight seem the usual run of the mill thriller, but David Koepp and David Fincher have an enormous backlog of great award winning succeses at the box office. They have created the biggest popular classics in modern cinema.David Fincher is the man who directed this thrilling claustrophobic movie. This director also made ""Se7en"" with Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. He also made ""The Game"" and ""Zodiac"". If you know those movies it suffices to say that David Fincher is THE master of suspense in Hollywood. He has created the most thrilling movies of Hollywood. A cliffhanger every 10 minutes, that puts me on the edge of my seat, even if I already know what's coming. The action and the suspense just will not stop. It is portrayed very realistically, it could have happened the way it did and what is more scarier than being attacked in your own home?Excellent performance by Jodie Foster, Forrest Whitaker, Jared Leto and the very young Kristen Stewart. There is plenty of action but most of all it is the suspense that is really nerve wrecking. And that suspense is built on Jodie Foster's mother instinct to save her young daughter from any harm. The families survival is at stake here. What a creepy drama. What a great thrill. What a big scary ride!",Panic Room

In a great wonderfully honed script, this is nothing short of another psychological thrill ride with some truly breathless moments, that chokes you in it's intensity on it's first view. Consider the impasse too, which is what makes it like this. We have a new room to be introduced too and educated about. A panic room, is like a shelter, a safe room you hide in, if intruders ever break in. Electronically operated, thieves can't get into this room. Consider divorcée, Foster and her little daughter (younger budding actress Kristen Stewart) whose first night in their brownstone tenament is one night, they'll never forget, for whom barges in, a trio of thieves. They're headed by Whitaker, the only one with a heart as demonstrated much later on in the movie, in one scene he shares with Stewart, that I really liked, almost as much as I liked this film. His outcome, was one that sucked in the film's ending. This was the only thing that faulted the movie. Whitaker, accompanied by a snooty, younger, and sleazy looking guy (Leto, a trademark in character acting) really hasn't informed him about the third guy, for good reasons (hotheaded and detestable psychopath, Yoakam- Slingblade) a performance that'll scar you. Foster and Stewart hold out in the panic room, only what the thieves want, is in that room, making for one claustrophobic dilemmas, you could say. As well as being a solid never slacking psychological thriller, the story really works from a realistic standpoint, which I liked, one stunt Foster tries to get rid of them, almost backfiring, causing Leto to lose his stack. A hairy standout moment. Foster's husband is a seemingly much older guy with stringy who must be loaded. We share a little time with him, near the end. What Foster and Stewart do in their circumstances is exactly what you would do in their position, where the same goes for our thieves after that moolah. Watching Leto, blowing his stack is fun, but as I said it's really the piece of s..t Yoakam's character that has us. You really want to see this guy go, the inestimable hatred between him and Stewart, frighteningly evident. At one point, he candidly shouts threateningly to her saying ""What the F you looking at"". Fincher to me is a really interesting director, with not a large inventory of films to his credit, but they are handpicked stories, and original, discounting Alien 3 of course. Panic Room, continues that chain of originality, as if an event, in the waiting, if only for a better ending and rosier outcome for Whitaker, who sort of becomes the hero. I actually know a couple of people who disfavor this film, one a video store clerk. You can't please everyone. Fine choice for a night of suspenseful viewing, where ever actor does us solid in their fine performances.",Panic Room
59,bsmith5552,Claustrophobic Thriller!,7,13 December 2002,"""Panic Room""  directed by David Fincher, tries to copy the style of Alfred Hitchcock. It is a creepy dark old house movie that contains many twists and turns in its plot, and holds a few surprises as well. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster)is separated and has moved into a large old brownstone town house with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), formerly owned by an eccentric and paranoid multi-millionaire. The furniture has not all arrived and many boxes remain unpacked. In the house, the former owner had built a ""panic room"", a room that could be sealed off from the rest of the house and hide the residents if danger threatened.
 As luck would have it, three burglars intent on finding a large amount of hidden cash left by the former owner, break into the house. Burnham (Forest Whitaker) was the man who designed and built the panic room. Junior (Jared Leto) had worked for the eccentric. Junior has brought along a mysterious brooding and masked third member, Raoul (Dwight Yoakum) to help out. Of course, mother and daughter flee to the panic room and most of the rest of the film deals with the cat and mouse games played to get them to open the door.  Burnham just wants to get the loot. Junior harbors a secret and Raoul is a ticking time bomb. Meanwhile Meg's ex-husband Stephen who had been alerted by Meg before communication was cut off, arrives on the scene and is used by the criminals to coax the women out of the room. Finally, Meg is tricked out into the open and the crooks gain entry to the panic room. Then we learn that Sarah, who is still inside, has an unnamed illness which requires her to have an injection to survive. But how will she get her injection? By the way, this ""illness"" suggests diabetes although the disease is never mentioned. An injection of insulin would require a specific measured dosage and the patient would have to eat something immediately after the injection. In the film Sarah, appears to be given a pre-mixed injection but does not have anything to eat. If this was the case, she would have relapsed into the comatose like state she was in before. Anyway, eventually everything is sorted out and justice prevails. Jodie Foster is excellent as always and young Kristen Stewart does Ok as Sarah. Whitaker is good as the bad guy with a conscience, Leto is suitably sleazy as Junior but country crooner Yoakum is positively frightening as the psychopathic Raoul.  ""Panic Room"" is a pretty good claustrophobic thriller.",Panic Room
60,dfranzen70,No need to panic,1,18 May 2002,"Any movie that builds an entire plotline around one room in one house is just begging for trouble. I don't care if that one room's outfitted like Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants; if you limit your setting, you're asking for yawns. But that's what Panic Room does. Sure, there's a lot of action - such as it is - outside the room - but even what isn't contained within the ultrathick walls of the safe place is contained within the relatively small house itself (or maybe just the ultrathick walls of the screenwriter's mind).The gist of the story is that Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), who's recently been divorced from her husband, a very wealthy pharmaceutical dude, is buying this upscale brownstone in Manhattan for her and her generic kid (although not a cute generic kid; looks like they ran out of ""cute"" at Child Actors R Us and had to settle for not-so-cute-but-oh-so-spunky). Even though the fee is more than she's willing to pay and even though it's a little weird looking, our plucky heroine throws caution to the wind and buys the place. And immediately moves in - which, you homeowners know, happens with all the frequency of a loan getting approved quickly.The place has this complicated security system - it doesn't look all that large, frankly, but the system separates the house into zones, all ""armed"" at night. Sounds safe, right? When the house was being shown to Meg, she noticed that the master bedroom was smaller than it should be - surprise! There's a hidden room! Oh, what fun! What's it for, you ask? It's explained to Meg that if someone breaks into the house, she can get to the room and call the police from the handy-dandy not-connected-to-the-main-line phone; even if the main line's cut, you see, she can still call Officer Bob.
Now, I don't know about you folks, if, while being shown a new place, I am told that the house has an awesome ""safe room"" in case someone breaks in - I'm getting the hell out of there. Wouldn't that tell even the biggest dunce that there's a crime problem in the area? I mean look - there's a friggin' security system! They're saying that a) people will break in, b) the security system won't do squat, c) you can't call the cops from the main line because they'll show up next week, so yay! We have this neato safe room for you.So to begin with, the premise is mired in utter stupidity. In fact, I sit here dumbfounded by its stupidity.Naturally, the first night Meg and her daughter Sarah are sleeping in the house, someone breaks in. Three burglars are there to recover something from the panic room's vault, but of course they don't expect anyone to be in the house. Okay, common mistake. One of them, Burnham (Forrest Whitaker), almost decides to call off the thing, since people are in there and he's got this thing against hurting people, and all that. But don't worry, he's soon talked out of it by Junior (Jared Leto), the nominal head of this happy bunch, which also includes the unexpected Raoul (Dwight Yoakam - didn't he used to have a music career, or something?).Whoosh! Meg and the youngster rush to the panic room, where they proceed to panic.A lot of contrivances abound. For one thing, Meg's claustrophobic, so she has problems dealing. For another, Sarah is diabetic, a fact that plays an unfortunate major role in the movie. Can Meg save her child before the bad guys get to her? Oh, can she?You know, just as an aside, I remember when Forrest Whitaker was just starting out in show biz. Remember Good Morning, Vietnam? That boy made some great career moves - Smoke was another. He's a great supporting-role kinda guy. It's just a crying shame this movie depends on him so heavily. He's the only one - yes, only one - who turns in even a decent performance. And since he's a bad guy, I should have been rooting against him, right? Ha! Guess again, Dr. Watson. I was hoping Burnham would escape.Jodie Foster, on the other hand, gives one of the most constipated performances of a lifetime. Did she check out her contract before agreeing to this crap? This woman's won OSCARS, for crying out loud! Geez, they couldn't get Ann Archer to do this role? Or Christine Lahti? Or Kathleen Turner? Or anyone else whose career has slowed down a bit?Eleven people, including me, were in the theater when I watched this movie. Eleven! It's a new movie, too! And because there were 11, I tried my darndest not to laugh out loud at the moronic dialog, inept direction, and incompetent camerawork. Really. I tried hard. But failed. I mean, I didn't want to embarrass myself, much as the actors onscreen were embarrassing themselves.Oh, and to add more insult to the whole shebang, the director is the same guy who brought the creative Fight Club and Seven to the big screen. Talk about slumming!This turkey is rated unwatchable. The movie was somehow allowed to rise from somewhere in the murky bowels of Mother Earth to fester like a cold sore in the mouth of the American audience.",Panic Room
61,meeza,No need to Panic!,7,11 March 2003,"I have varied opinions on Director David Fincher's thriller `The Panic Room'. Please don't panic! I will state my opinions in just one paragraph. Jodie Foster stars as an overprotective mother of an androgynous diabetic teenager. They are entrapped in a home security room nicknamed The Panic Room after burglars invade their two-story New York residence. Forrest Whittaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto co-star as the argumentative perpetrators. `Panic Room' is intense and Fincher's direction was secured enough not to be invaded with negative reviews. However, the film's cause of alarm was in its staid screenplay. `Panic Room' is not enticing enough to break into, but there is no need to panic if you do decide to enter `The Panic Room'. *** Average",Panic Room

Nail-bitingly good.",Panic Room
63,MaxBorg89,"A good, effective thriller, kept above average by a skilled director and a committed cast",8,24 May 2007,"Throughout the '90s David Fincher emerged as one of the most talented and interesting American directors of his generation, delivering four bold, fascinating films, two of which (Se7en and Fight Club) stand out as decade-defining (alongside the likes of Pulp Fiction, Magnolia and other gems). This is why his fifth feature, Panic Room, may seem an odd choice at first: a straightforward thriller with none of the director's typical shocks and twists, it is as close to mainstream as Fincher has got thus far. But in his hands even a conventional story manages to rise above the standard level, so while it isn't a genre classic, the movie is professionally executed and very likely to please most viewers.The film gets its title from a bunker located in a New York apartment. Once you enter this bunker, you are completely safe from any external threats. But what if the burglars who break into the apartment are actually looking for something that is inside that room? And what if they are led by the guy (Forest Whitaker) who designed the whole security system? These are the questions Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) will have to answer as they embark on a cat-and-mice game with Burnham (Whitaker) and his associates, the edgy Junior (Jared Leto) and the cold, gun-carrying Raoul (Dwight Yoakam).If handed to another director, David Koepp's script would probably have been turned into something overly contrived and unconvincing. Fincher, on the other hand, embraced the realistic aspects of the concept and manages to get most of the tension out of a believable scenario, with the exception of a few set-pieces (the burning propane especially) which, as superbly achieved as they may be (Fincher is a real camera virtuoso), simply are hard to buy in this kind of film. The other key element is the characters, who, thanks to the actors portraying them, manage to convince despite being fairly archetypal (this is particularly true in the case of Foster and Whitaker: they manage to save roles that could have been awful if miscast), and the tension between victims and crooks (and within the latter group as well, thanks to terrific work from Leto) is consistently palpable and real.As for the trickiest aspect of a film like this (how to end it), that is actually the only point where both writer and director fail to deliver, the conclusion being too flat and unsatisfactory if compared to the premise. Prior to that, however, there isn't a dull moment in the whole film, proving that even when he's going mainstream Fincher is capable of doing something a little bit more interesting than the usual Hollywood production.",Panic Room

The rest of the film is them trying to break into the panic room where the mother and daughter have locked themselves in. Will the thick metal walls keep them in and the robbers out? Watch while the thieves wrestle with that challenge as well as their own erratic personalities. The film's color pallet uses virtually zero color; just a couple mutes reds and not only for blood. ;-) The camera is an invisible character and frequently in quiet motion with non-human direction to paint the picture of the 'large' New York apartment of which the entire film is contained.

65,a_baron,Panic Room,9,11 September 2019,"This film is said to have a budget of forty-eight million dollars. Half of that could well have been spent on the destruction of the house cum palace in which all the action takes place. How much action can there be with such a small cast and restricted scenes? The pleasing answer is quite a lot.This is a slightly off-beat thriller; three dudes with bad intentions break into the house in question hoping to find it empty save for a massive hoarde in bearer bonds under the floor of the panic room. Unfortunately, the new owner has moved in ahead of schedule with her daughter - who might be mistaken for a boy the first half hour, although no one is likely to make that mistake now, even though Kristen Stewart still wears her hair short.When the bad guys are unable to get their hands on the goods, a game of cat and mouse ensues. One is far more ruthless than the other two, and they end up turning on each other. The grand finale is rather obvious with the least bad of the crew, who is clearly a reluctant participant, finding salvation, even though he will clearly face years if not decades behind bars.There is not a lot more to it than that, but many far more spectacular productions have promised more but delivered less.",Panic Room

David Fincher's directing definitely added to the excitement, and it's nice to see that today's filmmakers have seen Hitchcock movies, and Hitch would have loved blonde Jodie Foster I think.But excitement is also added because the characters are quite unpredictably individuated, particularly the bad guys.Howard Shore's music keeps the suspense keyed up without being obtrusive.When Hollywood does what it does well, we can have a crackling good time!(originally written 5/19/2002)",Panic Room

It's true that she's also highly sexy. As a matter of fact, Jodie is a terrific thriller actress. She's equally able in such physical roles. It's an enthralling good hostage thriller, rather akin to DESPERATE HOURS, and implicitly much better stuff than, say, the DIE HARD franchise. And it's the incomparable Jodie who makes this flick eminently worth watching. The pace is frenzied, and the suspense is genuine and enjoyable. Every Fincher flick, however well made, has nonetheless flaws and proofs of clumsiness. Jodie's role is far above the value of the movie. I mean, she's gold, she's incomparable and stunning. A great actressand an especially great actress for thrillers. Jodie's roles are not only incomparably focused and clean, they're extremely lean as wellagility deprived of stuffing, of rubbishhallmark nononsense roles. It's like for a long time we didn't have actors for the thrillers; and now, that we have the performers, we don't have thrillers to match them. Several varyingly annoying things in this flick:--the scene with the two policemen at the door (if the cops supposed they're all listened to by the aggressors, the plainly telling Mrs. Foster how to act wasn't such a good move; the girls; the exhusband's (otherwise venerable) age; the 'Raoul' villain not being very messed up after he just got smashed with a hammer. In view of the ex's fortune, his age might be conceded.Otherwise, the movie's thrilling, suspenseful, nicely paced, and thin. Mrs. Foster is an awesome actress, and she makes a nice B. Willis/ McCulkin here.A reliable performance from Whitaker, who typecasts as a postmodern AfroAmerican Gabin , and 'Raoul' makes a stunning villain (Yoakam).",Panic Room
70,davispittman,Honestly one of my favorite action/thrillers!!,8,9 March 2015,"This film is smartly written and very well made, and omg Jodie makes this movie!!! Great acting from everyone on board, a few twists and turns, very exciting moments, and intense action sequences make for a great film and a heck of a fun time!! Seriously who could give this a 1?? This is a quality piece of cinema, at least as far as action movies go. Kristen Stewart was great in her role. She really captured and nailed it, same goes for forest Whitaker and jared Leto. The movie focuses on its characters, it isn't just a lot of pointless action, I love a good thrilling action film like this that actually has meaningful characters.

73,aidanratesmovies,A fun B-movie thriller,9,18 June 2020,"Although it may seem a bit simple of times, especially in terms of premise, Panic Room makes the most out of its claustrophobic scenario and makes for quite an interesting and entertaining thriller- even despite its flaws. The film is largely led by its strong performance by Jodie Foster, as well as some rather good performances from a young Kristen Stewart and Forest Whitaker. Dwight Yoakam also gives the role all he has, and makes for a bit drastic, but cool villian to follow. Jared Leto seems to try a little too hard in his role as Junior, and his character and line delivery seems too anxious and over the top for it to feel anything except menacing. The film can be a bit formulaic at times, but it's fun nature, and strong direction from Fincher makes the film an absolute blast to watch for the majority of the runtime. It makes clever use of its characters and circumstances, and proves to be a fun B-movie adventure that I was glad I could catch before it was taken off of Showtime. In the end, Panic Room is not a great film, but a very amusing thriller with some strong qualities for such a small premise.

74,Agent10,A worthy effort from David Fincher,8,11 April 2002,"Panic Room may not be David Fincher's best films, but it is certainly one of his more thrilling. The claustrophobia, the suspense, and the inevitable question of ""How will they escape?"" makes this film a must see.My only beef with the film is the cinematography in the second half of the film. Its obvious Darius Khondji put his mark on the first half,especially considering how pedestrian the rest of the film looks compares to the first half.",Panic Room
75,Boyo-2,Okay urban thriller,5,17 April 2003,"This is not up to the directors other movies, not by a mile.  Its not up to other female-in-distress-in-an-urban-setting either, such as ""Wait Until Dark"" or ""Lady in a Cage"".But its all right time filler.  Jodie is not her usual mannered self, for which I was deeply grateful, and the kid that plays her daughter is not overly obnoxious, but close..They are moving into what amounts to a castle, in terms of what most Manhattan apartments are.  The rent has to be six figures a month; most people pay $1200 for something the size of the panic room alone.Almost immediately, they are broken into.  They retreat to the 'panic room' and much to their horror, what the robbers are after happens to be in that very room.  The robbers are amateurs, almost bumbling idiots who couldn't break into a little girls diary, but they seem to think they have a chance at the safe in the panic room.I didn't mind the movie except for one scene in which the cops finally show up.  By now, Jodie has switched locales with the robbers and has to answer the door when they ring.  She is told to get rid of them and through video cameras, the robbers can verify that she does exactly that, but since they can only see and not hear, it didn't seem logical to me that Jodie would not vocalize the situation to the police officers, given the opportunity.  One of them is next to positive something is wrong and even suggests that she give a signal to indicate danger, but I guess the movie wasn't supposed to end there.  Nice to see that Jared Leto's arm grew back after ""Requiem for a Dream"" and its always a pleasure to see Forest Whitaker, although I found his character a little too nice, given his intentions.  7/10.",Panic Room
76,Jonny_Numb,one of the best films of 2002,8,22 April 2003,"""Panic Room"" is a strong thriller that rewrites the rules of its genre with assured audacity.  Through inventive, Hitchcockian camera techniques (through the coffeepot handle, between pegs in the banister, etc.) and three-dimensional characters, director David Fincher pulls off the astonishing feat of confining us, like the characters, in a steel-walled 'panic room' reserved specifically for home invasion.  Jodie Foster shines in a strong female role that's the equivalent of her work in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and Fincher proves--as he did previously in ""Fight Club""--that he's one of our finest up-and-coming directors.8/10",Panic Room

78,aimless-46,Like a Good Game of Chess,8,26 November 2005,"I'm reluctant to make lengthy comments about films that hundreds of others have already posted about because it seems like a waste of time, so I will just make a few observations about ""Panic Room"".The most important thing was that it instantly pulled me in and took me for a ride for the entire two hours. That does not happen often, particularly for a film that I was late seeing and therefore had tons of preconceived notions. I was pleased with how well they established the basic premise of the film at the beginning as, something that had seemed silly in the trailers was perfectly credible in the actual film. The $95 Million U.S. box office must have happened from word-of-mouth because the trailer simply does not do the film justice.There were only minor plot holes, although the lame way that Meg and her daughter initially got into the panic room almost derailed the whole thing. And I still find it inconceivable that $48 Million had to be spent on what is really a very small film. Since so little of the budget ever makes it onto the screen they would have been better served with the creative incentive of a smaller budget.Nicole Kidman was originally cast to play Meg but hurt her knee and had to drop out. I don't think they lost anything by bringing in Jodie Foster, I can't imagine Kidman doing any better, Meg's kind of brainy stubborn scrapper is Foster's specialty. And she is much better from a physical casting perspective as Kristen Stewart looks like she could actually be Foster's daughter. In fact, there were more that a few times when I momentarily got the two of them confused. This was very appropriate because ""Panic Room's"" heroines are not the usual film-fare mother and daughter (one strong and one weak), but rather a like mother-like daughter situation. I think Stewart has a great future in films (see ""Speak"" for a example of her ability to carry a whole feature) and it was nice that she got a chance so early in her career to work closely with Foster. I was particularly impressed with the pacing of this story and its similarity to chess masters hiding one line of attack inside another. The battle progresses much like a chess match, as pieces are lost the layout becomes less familiar and the alternatives fewer. As the two sides use up resources and get sucked in deeper, their earlier choices limit the choices that are available to them. This chess-like process holds until the very end of the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Panic Room

Watching the baddies wind up Inside the Safe room w/ Foster on the Outside in the last third of the movie wasn't Quite what I expected, esp. w/ her daughter locked in-but there ya be. It's Hollywood.I didn't really buy into some of the plot-twists, the phones not working, Forest saving the day at the end, Yoakum becoming 'Jaws' from the Bond flicks after a he gets hammered and falls 2 flights over a stair well, etc. C'mon that was really believable unless it was a Michael Bay movie, and this clearly was Not.Foster and Whitaker are fine.

81,nycritic,Excellent Domestic Suspense,10,18 February 2006,"The conceit sounds too good to be true: a mother and her diabetic daughter move into a chic Manhattan townhouse which has a panic room made expressly for emergencies. It so happens, it also contains bonds worth in excess of millions. Three thieves are after these bonds and will stop at nothing to get their hands on them. They break into the apartment, forcing mother and daughter to hide in the panic room while the daughter's medication is still on the outside. A progressively tense chess game between her, her daughter, and her captors ensues during the course of one long night.David Fincher hits the right note once more with this domestic thriller. Pointing as a reference to WAIT UNTIL DARK, he makes the narration as sparse as possible to get into the meat of the story. As written by David Koepp, nothing is laid to waste and no sooner than Meg Altman is in her apartment that her own security and that of her daughter's is put on the line and the mundane becomes more and more nail-biting as the situations become tense and threaten to veer out of control. Jodie Foster plays Meg with the perfect balance of femininity and steel this kind of role requires her to and Forest Whittaker is a great foil, a man caught on the wrong side of the tracks, who has a good soul.PANIC ROOM is one of those instant classics that asks for repeated views because even when there is the requisite moment of violence late in the film, it is believable and serves as an emotional outlet because of the anguish Meg and her daughter are subjected to. With one of those Hitchcock endings where things are best left to the viewer to determine just how events played themselves out, this is the thinking man's thriller, tight, compact, beautifully constructed. A must-see.",Panic Room

It had Jodie Foster and marked the acting debut of a girl named Kristin Stewart, who would go on to star in the much bigger twilight franchise as well as Snow White and the Huntsman. This movie was recently shown on HDnet movies, with a 4k bluray release coming after debuting on Superbit DVD years ago on the same date as Monsters Inc.",Panic Room
83,eric262003,Effective Performances From Last Minute Performers,8,7 May 2019,"When it comes to thriller themed movies, Jodie Foster can deliver a fine punch.It's such a delight to see her stand up to defend herself against a group of baddies and to show them a thing or two of messing with her or her daughter in the 2002 film ""Panic Room. Foster was a lat-minute replacement to play the leading protagonist role of Meg Altman after Nicole Kidman bowed down because of a knee injury. Most of the other cast members were last minute replacements including Kristen Stewart who replaced Hayden Panettiere as Meg's daughter Sarah, and country star Dwight Yoakam replaced Maynard James Keenan as Raoul. After a four year absence from his very successful 1999 film, ""Fight Club"", director David Fincher is back giving his fans a taste of Hitchcock-like suspense that will likely send shivers down your spine.According to Fincher, ""Panic Room"" wasn't intended to be grandeur in terms of cultural provocation, though the suspense remains throughout and the twists depicted here could come at you unexpectedly. At best, Fincher says it's generally a popcorn flick with relatively no outwardly implications, but a simple story on the quest of survival and protecting the ones that you love. Well that could be debatable. As long as I've known Fincher, he never depended on simplicity. Whether it was ""Fight Club"", ""The Game"", ""Se7en"", or ""Alien 3"", But the simplicity actually stems from the script by David Koepp. So here we have Foster starring as Meg Altman who was recently divorced and has custody of her young pre-adolescent daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). She leaves the suburban life in Connecticut and purchases a 4- story house in the Manhattan Upper West Side. Their reason was to rub it in on her ex-husband Stephen (Patrick Bauchau) who dumped her to be with a sexy supermodel. Meg and Sarah gloomily consume pizza on their first night in their enormous abode. The ladies are oblivious to the fact that three intruders (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yaokam and Jared Leto) are breaking into their enclave. Fortunately, the house is equipped with a panic room that also has surveillance cameras, steel door locks, a phone line. So they're safe in there right? NOT! Apparently the phone line to call for emergency doesn't work and now our victims are trapped. As an homage to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", and through the monitors we could see the thieves squirm their way in while Meg firmly tells them to get out of her house.The thieves are not gullible to play the whole ""Home Alone"" mind games that easily. Aside from the suspenseful elements, ""Panic Room"" does have moments of subtle humour to carry the film over. In a scene, Sarah uses a flashlight to signal a nearby neighbour (Andrew Kevin Walker) for help via Morse Code. When asked how she knew that trick, Sarah replied, ""Titanic"". It takes courage to laugh at your own expense over the cliches that has been utilized in suspense films and knowing that burglars visitation is not for a house warming party, their motives is to retrieve $3 million worth of bearer bonds and it's located in the panic room and one of the thieves is willing to kill someone to get it.What's refreshing is that in this suspense thriller is that it's no surprise is that it rains for the atmospheric effects, however the backgrounds are very effective in tone. Originally, Fincher wanted the Altmans to have their scenes in the dark, cinematographer Conrad W. Wall who filled in after a falling out with previous cinematographer Darius Khondji having our heroes squirm in pitch blackness letting the fear factor do all the talking. The camera is the star of this movie on its own as it guides us through the mansion, exploring all the rooms in this four-story house, while composer Howard Shore's music adds more intensity through each scene. Even though resting on a contrived plot, the performers do what's given to them. Leto shines as Junior as the hip rich kid, Yoakam in his role as Raoul sports a ski mask in the first half manages to become more sinister without it. Whitaker as Burnham is the more self-conflicted one as thief with some level of humanity even when the scenes become more violent. The bonding between Foster and Stewart feel genuine and never once does it feel corny or forced. Foster just kills it in this role, serious, focused and never meanders off in other character traits and even when she has to depend on her ex-husband for help and the supermodel answers instead she lets both of them know who's boss. Even with the level of intensity, Fincher assures you that this is not some mindless suspense thriller and the conflict of two bruised heroes against the dark atmosphere they never anticipated in has some food for thought moments of discussion.",Panic Room
84,JuguAbraham,Average at best,6,27 September 2002,"Fincher has never made me sit up as a director of note and this film reinforces that view.Elegance in filmmaking here is limited to some hi-tech cinematography which makes the audience feel that they fly through furniture miniaturized to the size of a fly. Much of the film was filmed in near darkness. The plot development was most unimpressive. Facts were wrong (propane being lighter than air, for one). Why does one of the hoods cover his face in the beginning? What has the broken marriage to help with the screenplay unless Fincher sees the Panic Room as a refuge to that as well. But the end of the film makes you wonder if the film had any impact on the marriage.Jodie Foster, so impressive in ""Contact"" seemed dumber than her daughter--who I thought was her son until halfway through the movie.I keep seeing Fincher's films to spot an iota of brilliance but I have not seen anything that makes him an above-average director by world standards.",Panic Room
85,philip_vanderveken,Is there something wrong with me because I don't hate this movie?,8,12 January 2005,"Hmmmm, after reading the comments on this movie I'm thinking I've seen a completely different movie than all the other people on IMDb who wrote a review about it. Especially Jodie Foster's performance seems to be a point of discussion. Personally I liked what I saw. I'm not saying it is the best, most shocking thriller ever, but it sure was able to keep my attention from the first minute to the last.It's about a woman who left her rich husband because he cheated on her with a B-rank model. Because she wants to take revenge on him, she buys a very big, nice house with his money (of course, that's how angry women are! Hahaha), where she will live with her daughter. There is even a 'panic room', a room where they can hide as soon as they are in some kind of trouble. During the first night that they stay there, some burglars, who are convinced that the house is still empty, pay them a visit, because somewhere in the house the former owner had hidden a lot of money.Don't expect any special effects, explosions or other kinds of special things that they like to put in today's movies. This is a thriller like it could have been made 30 or 40 years ago. Perhaps that's what bothered some viewers, but does that mean that this movie can't be good? Not in my opinion. Something else that might have bothered some of the viewers may be the fact that you don't get any images of the city or the surroundings. All the action happens in the house, and the biggest part of it in the confined space of the panic room itself. I guess this may be a perfect movie for the people who loved Phone Booth. It's more or less the same principle, but this time in a house and with a woman that you don't love to hate. Anyway, I don't care what other people think about this movie. Personally I liked to see Jodie Foster play this role and I think all the actors did a fine job. The script was good, despite some minor flaws and the director did a very good job. What else could you possibly want? I give this movie a well deserved 8/10.",Panic Room
86,screenman,"Knock, knock,",8,30 August 2010,"'Panic Room'. Is set in a colossal old 'brownstone' semi in New York.It looks big enough to garrison a regiment, yet an embittered mother and her daughter, mean to live in it all by themselves. It's expensive, but their husband/father - who has apparently run-off with some air-head - is apparently rich enough to foot the bill. In short; it's financial revenge. On the master-bedroom floor is the titular panic-room. It's a mini-fortress, almost impregnable by conventional means and self-sufficient.On their first night, three hoods turn-up to burgle. Unbeknown to mother and daughter, there's a floor-safe in the panic room. It contains what the villains are after.Mother and daughter flee inside before the villains can catch them. A siege ensues.For the most part, I found this a very tense, well-acted piece of drama. It definitely had its moments. Jodi Foster was good as the over-protective mother, Kristen Stewart was adequate as the rebellious daughter. The villains did their villain thing.I was a little nonplussed by the curious lack of colour throughout. It might well have been filmed in black & white. Perhaps it was meant to lend some noirish element; for me it was just inexplicably gloomy.I also enjoyed the fluid nature of the relationship dynamics. The nominal leader who ultimately goes to pieces and gets shot by the hard-man in a ski-mask. Later, after trapping his hand in the panic-room door, he himself is unmasked, gunless, a whimpering impotent. The 'expert' knows the criminal consequences of harming anyone whilst committing the robbery and means to avoid bloodshed at all costs. He, of course, has the most to lose. The police will soon realise that inside knowledge was needed. It can only be a matter of time before enquiries lead to him. He must be long gone without trace, almost proof positive of guilt. Yet he could never bluff it out because the mother and daughter would recognise him. I rather liked the ending, where an overhead helicopter whips all of the multi-million-dollar bearer-bonds into the air.There were a number of irritating little details, but by and large I overlooked these because the rest of the movie was sufficiently worthy.",Panic Room

Now that is a good, I mean great, thing for the look of the film. Not only is that this film is visually extensive, it is also very intelligent. And let's not forget that is has been directed by the very talented David Fincher.Okay, if you have read the plot of this film, you expect it to be realistic, no? Well, you're wrong. On the contrary, it's unrealistic, in an encouraging and maybe disappointing way. If you want to watch this film just to find advice to help you when your house has been broken in, then the only thing you'll get is: Lock yourself in a room and call the police. There's nothing else. Seriously.But that doesn't drive me nuts. I really like it that the fact that it's unrealistic because it will actually be interesting. Come on, if the film was realistic, it would have been tedious and boring. I like the outlandish situations the characters get themselves into and I know that you would like to see how they get out of them, by using their INTELLIGENCE.That's what makes this film so great. You have a point of view on the goodies and baddies (surprisingly the baddies aren't clichéd) and you see them playing a chess game with each other. The cinematography is great and so is the score.The performance by Jodie Foster is really good, as always. Forest Whitaker gives us a sympathetic (unnatural characteristic for a baddie) and sometimes dangerous performance and Dwight Yoakam is down right sinister and ugly, in a good way.This is a well crafted thriller that will get your attention.

You are not always surprised about the plot, but there are turnings sometimes, which aren't to be expected.

90,valadas,It could have happened to anyone,7,1 June 2002,"The movie begins with nice images of an ordinary action of two people visiting a house they want to buy or rent. However from that moment on the sharp contrast of these apparently innocuous images with a sound track music full od ominous presage makes us to anticipate that something much more violent is going to happen soon. Well the images are not so innocent as that because as a matter of fact that house is heavily sinister and we don't understand why a young woman and her early teen-age daughter like it so much. So the inner view of the house combined with the sound track music make us shiver from the beginning. The foreseen danger materializes itself soon in the persons of 3 more or less awkward and somewhat human burglars that enter the house with the aim of finding a lot of money they know it's hidden in the panic room, a kind of inexpugnable bunker against burglars where the woman and the girl take refuge and close themselves in. Well I won't tell you the rest of the story of course which develops itself in a succession of events full of suspense until the final  outcome which will rivet your attention until the end. On the negative side of this kind of movies there is always of course a certain amount of clichés but anyhow in this case not very unplausible.

The basic premise is that new tenants to an apartment, a mother (Jodie Foster) and daughter (Kristin Stewart), inadvertently get caught up in an ""inside job"" robbery at the apartment building. They're in the wrong place at the wrong time.The ensuing cat/mouse pursuit, complete with a well crafted claustrophobic atmosphere, provide for what is usually an exciting story. The chess moves made by both sides are logical to the characters, building the plot and suspense level. Forest Whitaker (as one of the three criminals) and Foster deliver the convincing performances expected from these talented actors. However, weaker acting of others in the cast, and inconsistent direction, don't maintain the mood or tension. This weakens the film's effectiveness.The other two villains start out menacing, but when you see some idiot trap his hand in a doorway (and some other slapstick behavior), it's too awkward to take it seriously. The intent was clearly not a Home Alone type satire, but sometimes resembles it. The line reads by the the two dumb crooks, as well as Stewart, just aren't convincing; they each become caricatures. The latter's role is a tom-boy diabetic teen with an attitude, but she plays it more like a mumbling zombie that spikes her insulin shots with heavy depressants.Whitaker and Foster carry the film, and ultimately, succeed in saving it. The ending sequence works well, and has a nice irony attached. Good for one-time viewing, but you probably won't want to revisit it.",Panic Room

95,sme_no_densetsu,Another solid thriller from David Fincher,8,2 January 2017,"""Panic Room"" is one of David Fincher's lesser known pictures, perhaps because it lacks the lurid punch of films like ""Seven"" & ""Gone Girl"". In any case, Fincher knows his way around the thriller genre and ""Panic Room"" is characteristically meticulous and suspenseful.The story revolves around a recently divorced mother (Jodie Foster) and her young daughter (Kristen Stewart). On the first night in their new home they're preyed upon by a group of thieves. They're able to successfully retreat to the safety of the house's 'panic room' but there's one problem: the thieves want in and they're not about to give up easily.On the surface, this premise appears pretty limited but screenwriter David Koepp keeps us interested by introducing new angles that increase the possibilities of the situation. Essentially a 'cat and mouse' game, the script does a good job of maintaining tension and using characterization to give resonance to the story.The cast is small but well assembled. Jodie Foster brought a mix of vulnerability & tenacity to the lead role while 12-year old Kristen Stewart held her own in her first major film role. The trio of thieves are played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam - an interesting combination, to say the least.Of course, being a David Fincher film, the visuals are consistently attractive and the direction is rock solid. The movie's simplicity harks back to high concept thrillers of years gone by. One might even call the direction Hitchcockian.Ultimately, ""Panic Room"" is a well executed thriller but I feel that it's a bit conventional in comparison to Fincher's other thrillers that are more representative of his trademark style. Nevertheless, it's hard to argue against a thriller that's as skillfully constructed as this one is.",Panic Room
96,Howlin Wolf,"Caution! Deflate expectations and don't compare it to most of Fincher's past work, and you'll be fine... (SPOILERS MARKED WITHIN)",7,19 May 2002,"First, the bad news. Barring ""The Game"", the spectacle and effect of which was utterly ruined by the ending, (see review) this is definitely David Fincher's worst film to date. This does not mean it is bad, though; it is indeed quite watchable. All the 'star power' and innovative direction in the world only JUST manages to overcome a fairly formulaic premise and a dull script. THAT is where this film's problem lies.I actually believe it would have been far more interesting to see the Meg Altman character as being destroyed by her divorce, and relying on the mental strength of her young daughter to get her through the resurgence of vulnerability that occurs when three men have the nerve to invade the sanctity of her home. There are little hints of this sort of direction in the script, but they were never pursued far enough for my liking.I understand it was originally going to be set up as I describe, until the script was tailored to suit Jodie Foster's participation after she replaced Nicole Kidman due to a knee injury. Whilst such a change undoubtedly suits Foster's style, it probably hurts the film. Young Kristen Stewart showed me that she was a more than capable enough actress to be able to handle more complex material like that, so it was a little disappointing to see the film descend into a fairly predictable tit-for-tat battle between the indignant homeowner and the burglars. Forest Whitaker is also another standout on the acting side, doing well with a clichéd role. I can't complain about Foster's performance, since I've never seen her be anything less than excellent. I just felt her character to be rather perfunctory. All of them are, in fact, with the already mentioned exception of the young daughter. On a completely base note, special mention must go to the person who recommended Jodie Foster wear such a low-cut top for the predominant part of the movie!(MAJOR SPOILER COMING UP!)After the fairly surprising death of one of the main characters, the script provides no more shocks for Fincher to buoy the material with, so the production design and cinematography are the only things left to help the actors keep us interested. Although that side of the movie is admittedly excellent, at this point there is still a sizable chunk of the movie left, and the 'gasp' factor is now virtually nil. The great visuals could seriously have used a bit more substance to back them up.(END OF SPOILER)As a result of this lack of depth, I found the villains to be much more interesting than our two heroines, because, despite being similarly simplistic, at least they were occasionally funny! This unusual development left the ending something of a moot point for me; which is perhaps just as well, because it's every bit as unsurprising as most of what came before it.Even after taking into consideration its flaws, it's still a good watch; I guess I just expected more from a Fincher film. To be fair though, just like in ""The Game"" only to a much lesser extent, he gets his part of the job right, but is let down by the quality of writing he's working with.",Panic Room
97,Screen_Blitz,"Smart, home invasion thriller is full of suspense and great writing",8,14 January 2016,"From David Fincher, the mastermind behind some of the most crowd pleasing thrillers of the 90s such as 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', comes an insanely suspenseful home invasion thriller written by David Koepp who wrote the first two Jurassic Parks. This film follows recently divorced mother Meg Altman (played by Jodie Foster) and her diabetic preteen daughter Sarah (played by Kristen Stewart) who move in the luxury condos of Manhattan. Upon touring with a realtor, Meg and Sarah come across a small, high security room known as the ""panic room"" featuring medical supplies and video surveillance. Upon settling down for the night, Meg and Sarah are awoken by a trio of burglars: Junior (played by Jared Leto), Raoul (played by Dwight Yoakam), and the most moral of the three Burnham (played by Forest Whitaker); who bust through in search of a fortune left by Junior's grandfather who was the previous owner of the condo. Meg and her daughter quickly take shelter in the panic room, only to learn that what the burglars are searching for happens to be in that room.David Fincher is an expert conveying suspense in his movies, and this is the biggest aspect he achieves in this film. From the first minute of the arrival of the robbers, the film pulls us into a near non stop edge-of-your-seat thrill fest. There are plenty of heart- pounding moments throughout that are very unpredictable, and with the ingenious writing about David Koepp, it is also fun; even when the pacing has its occasional hiccups. Video surveillance plays a key role in the plot with the two main characters watching over the three criminals via video cam in the panic room, so some of the most suspenseful scenes take place through video surveillance; and the video surveillance works very well as a plot device. Then there are the characters are including the main character and her daughter, along with the three antagonists who are well crafted and decently written. Jodie Foster's character and her daughter played by the then 11-year old Kristen Stewart are characters the audiences quickly come to care about, and the criminals serve as the most interesting characters, with a big moral conflict between these three playing a key role in the plot. In addition to this, the performances are quite decent, especially by Jared Leto who is not known for such brash roles like this. Forest Whitaker is very charismatic as the criminal who holds moral values and comes off as a somewhat likable, despite this affiliation with the other two who act in pure evil.Panic Room is a very compelling movie and a decent piece of work by David Fincher. The cast is great in this, the direction is inspiring, and the plot is good and full of strong suspense. It is a solid pick for those fans of great suspense as it delivers the thrills strong and effectively.",Panic Room
98,bobsgrock,Fincher's style brought to fruition.,8,27 June 2011,"Panic Room remains sleek, trim and well-executed right through to its conclusion. For some cinematic snobs, the film seems to be too neatly wrapped up. However, thanks to the very stylistic and innovative direction of David Fincher and solid performances from Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart, this film holds tension for as long as thrillers do, and then some.The premise is as simple as can be: a mother and daughter move into a new Manhattan home, three men break in one night while the two women protect themselves in the home's panic room and shut the burglars out. This classic chess-like standoff allows for several breath-holding moments made even better by a brooding Howard Shore score and some of the most amazing camera work ever put on film. Fincher went even further than his excellent work in Fight Club to combine CGI with Steadicam style to give us a virtual tour of the house, allowing us to understand its every dimension as it is the only set used. Adding to this tension is strong acting from Jodie Foster as the everywoman, capable of sticking up for herself and her safety along with Kristen Stewart as her wisecracking daughter, Forrest Whitaker as a morally centered burglar, Jared Leto as a whacked-out greedy one and Dwight Yoakam as a psychotic gun-toting accomplice.If you are searching for simple entertainment, thrilling sequences and solid performances, this has that and more. The material is lifted out of the doldrums of mediocrity by David Fincher's brilliance of pacing, shot choice, angles and swirling camera moves that will make you ask, ""how did they do that?"" Of course, by the end, you will be too busy trying to catch your breath to answer that question.",Panic Room

I saw it in Amsterdam and a mouse ran over me, and it was my one thrill. Jodie Foster ( who I like very much as an actor ) is able to live in an enormous flat in New York, and divorced with a young androgynous looking daughter. And the bad guys get into the house, but they have a panic room to escape to.....end of spoilers. The suspense is sort of taut, but I did not care then about the characters and on a television re-viewing I cared even less. This is not good David Fincher. The dialogue is banal, and it all looks darkly glossy which kind of looks like an extended commercial on how to not enjoy being rich. Big revelation. The rich fear ' others ' invading their property!!! This one track mind film goes on for nearly 2 very long hours, but if you like Jodie Foster you might want to watch it. Despite previous doubts and watching nearly all of Fincher's films do I really respond to them ? I sense a decisive ' no ' coming on.",Panic Room

Three men entered in the house at night to steal this money and a horror drama begins then. Kristen suffering from a diabetic stroke is very frightened scene when his mother is worrying for her and put her own life in danger to treat her. Indecently Judy's husband coming during the heist period and get captured by goons. What is the end? See yourself once. A good thriller movie from start to end. Cruelty, mercy, caring, fear, sacrifice and courage, all colour of manhood will be seen by us in this movie. Acting by Jodie Foster is always superb along with a decent acting job done by Kristen. Forest Whitaker is seems like a sniffer dong. He understands quickly the situation only by his sixth sense. Recommended to watch.",Panic Room
102,jhclues,"Foster, Fincher Take Suspense To A Higher Level",9,3 April 2002,"Everyone likes to think that they'd know what they would do-- without hesitation, yet-- if suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with a perilous, even life-threatening, situation.  It's human nature; we all want to feel, or at least believe, that we are always in control of everything that happens in our lives.  But, upon reflection, if that IS, in fact, what you think, then you're probably not being entirely honest with yourself. Because unless you're Dirty Harry, or someone of that ilk (and take note, the key word here is `are,' not `think' you are), you're not really going to know how you'd react to any such situation until the moment of truth is actually upon you.  And it's that moment that director David Fincher enables you to experience, albeit vicariously, in `Panic Room,' a suspense/thriller that very quickly takes you to a very dark place-- a place few have actually ever been or would care to go, if given the choice.  But, of course, when it comes to a situation like the one depicted in this film, that's the rub: You simply do not get to choose whether or not you want to participate.  And when you really think about it, it's a concept that is more than a bit disconcerting, to say the least.  Because whether or not you want it, if it happens, you are going to be confronted with that moment of truth; and in that moment, you will probably learn more about yourself than you've ever known before.	As the film begins, recently divorced New Yorker Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is being shown a property, a spacious Brownstone Townhouse, which she ultimately decides upon and secures for herself and her teenage daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart).  They move in, and prepare for their first night in the new house.  What Meg cannot know, however, is that someone else has an eye on her house, but it has nothing to do with wanting to live there.  His name is Junior (Jared Leto), whom, as it happens, knew the previous tenant-- a wealthy, and apparently paranoid recluse-- more than just a bit.  He also knows (or at least thinks he does) that there is something extremely valuable hidden in that house.  And now that the previous owner has passed on, Junior wants it.	Toward that end, he recruits a couple of acquaintances, Burnham and Raoul (Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam) to help him get it.  But as fate would have it, Junior makes his move on the very night that Meg and Sarah move into the house, which as far as Junior knows, is still vacant.  They break in successfully, but it all goes south quickly when they discover the house is occupied, a situation for which Junior and his gang have no contingency plans; and their hesitation enables Meg and Sarah to make it to a safe room-- the `Panic Room' of the title-- a virtually impregnable room built by the previous owner as a safeguard against intruders.  And with the aid of a closed-circuit video surveillance/security system, Meg is able to monitor the movements of the trespassers throughout the house from inside her fortress, and she has no intention of emerging until they are gone.  But Junior is adamant; and he's not about to leave until he has what he came for.  And at that point, the standoff begins.	In his previous films (especially `Se7en') Fincher has established his use of a dark, brooding atmosphere-- pregnant with foreboding-- to enhance the suspense and drama of his story, and this film is no exception.  Night falls, and Fincher uses the oncoming darkness and the stillness of the house to create a sense of isolation that is the subtle beginning of the tension he will continue to build and maintain throughout the film.  He also uses some imaginative camera work, slowly exploring the house from the audience's point-of-view, which-- combined with Meg's initial apparent trepidation upon entering the panic room itself-- gives it all a pointedly claustrophobic feeling.  Those with difficulties in that regard, in fact, may experience some uneasiness during a good portion of this film because of it; and it simply demonstrates what a good job Fincher did in creating the setting he wanted, and which he uses so effectively here to keep you on the edge of your seat.  	The plot is fairly basic, with an inherently narrow framework within which Fincher must work; but he sets a perfect pace and has an inventive touch both visually and psychologically that enables him to take an average screenplay (by David Koepp) to a higher level in the finished product. Considering the storyline, some of what happens is-- some would say predictable-- though I prefer to call it inevitable (granted, a thin line differentiates the two; in this case, however, I feel `inevitable' is more accurate), and there are some surprises, which Fincher uses to great advantage.	It's no surprise, however, that what really elevates this film is the totally convincing performance by Jodie Foster as Meg.  Long one of the best actors around, she has the talent and ability to turn any material she's given into so much more than any writer or director could possibly hope to expect.  What makes her so remarkable-- as she is in this film-- is not only the fact that she can create such a believable character, but that she can do it with such intelligence and resourcefulness.  You have but to look into Foster's eyes to realize how much is going on constantly behind them; this is one savvy lady whom you can readily believe is always one step ahead of everyone else in the room.  And she goes a long way in proving that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep; she's attractive to begin with, but in a pair of black, horn-rimmed glasses, she looks ravishing.  In the final analysis, `Panic Room' is Foster's film; and she makes it a satisfying cinematic experience for her audience.  9/10.",Panic Room
103,Stampsfightclub,"could have been done SO much better, but still good",7,1 June 2008,"Jodie Foster (Silence of the lambs) stars in David Fincher's claustrophobic thriller as Meg, a mother who, along with her daughter Sarah, get trapped inside a panic room whilst robbers invade their house.I'm a big fan of the claustrophobic thriller genre, having scene great films like Air force one and Die Hard, which are both set in just the one main place are excellent viewing and very gripping. This 2002 picture is fairly exciting, but doesn't match the excitement of those other thrillers.Taking a while to get going, Panic room centres around, well a panic room in Meg's new house. The setting is very cold, with horrible grey walls and little supplies to get a feel of claustrophobia. Though the setting is there, by the end of the film I felt it could have been executed so much better, as could have the performances.By far the worst performances I have seen Foster and Whitaker (Last King of Scotland) give in their careers, though in fairness, it does come down to a poorly scripted plot.The dialogue between all the characters is so poor I wanted to rewrite it for myself. Given the intense situations encoded, there could have been much sharper and intense speaking involved giving a feel of the emotional and stressful situations that the characters found themselves in.Fincher's direction is very bizarre, with one shot trailing from floor to floor I was wondering what mood he was trying to achieve by using that particular shot. Though it improved, his other films including fight club were so much better.Despite its faults, I still couldn't tear myself away with the situations and settings the best bits of the film.The situations are excellent as is the setting but had there been a better written plot and more intense dialogue, it would have been up there with the best thrillers, but unfortunately it isn't and only makes it into the mediocre category",Panic Room

It is almost identical to that awful childrens film in the way it looks and the fact the the burglers are stupid and clumsy and that you know they are going to get their come upance. Forest Whitaker acts the way he usually does. Not showing to much emotion and giving moody looks when ever he can. Jody Foster looks good and is hardly stretched in the acting department.

107,Maziun,Bad direction plus lousy screenplay equals bad movie,4,16 August 2013,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS It's a sad thing when once great director is making a movie below his reputation. It's not about the fact that it's not as good as his best movies , but that there was no need for him to make it in the first place . Such is the case of David Fincher and ""Panic room"".Why did he made this movie ? There wasn't anything in this story that would made ""PR"" a amazing movie , even if all the elements were done right. This is kinda of movie that a craftsman , not an artist should do. What is more intriguing is that the movie turned out to be bad.The main problem lies in the script . I've never been a fan of David Koepp and all you could expect from him appears here . Some cliché , some stupidity and some predictability mixed together . For example – the three thugs . From the first time they appear you now that they are three cliché – one innocent saint , one bad psycho and one neutral idiot . It's not strange who will kill who long before the movie will end. It's also not strange who will make a sacrifice and who will be an almost indestructible killing machine.The stupidity – When you're robbing a house , even an empty one , you should wear a mask . Only one robber was intelligent to think about that. One thug knows everything about Jodie Foster life , yet he doesn't for how many days according to law the house should be empty. The cameras are on , yet none of the thugs didn't figure out to destroy them (as one even points out later in the movie). A bottle of gas ""magically"" appear out of nowhere , when thugs need it . A police will ""magically"" appear at the end of the movie , not to mention it will be completely pointless.The predictability – I was able guess almost all the twists here – the body swap , the phone , the SOS . Maybe I'm reading too many criminal novels or maybe they weren't too clever from the beginning.The other problem is the surprisingly bad direction by Fincher . As usual he tries to make his film a dark one . It's his trademark and it worked really well in his other movies . Here it doesn't work . It seems like he is unnecessary trying to make a dangerous situation even more serious than it should be. Like this isn't a game of cat and mouse between our heroes and the thugs , but some sort a battle for souls. The movie also completely lacks hurt and tension. It left me cold. Not to mention that Fincher annoyingly plays with camera in MTV style – camera looks through key hole , camera flies through walls and so on. Seriously, Fincher aren't you too old for this cheap stuff ? On the other hands the movie is very often unintentionally funny and that obviously wasn't the point . The exploding gas is like a stuff from the 80's comedy . Truth to be told the whole relations between the trio of thugs is hard to take seriously . They acting like children and one could wonder if it wouldn't be a better idea to make a comedy out of this story.Good things ? Decent acting from all actors and a bits of really good black humor in the dialogues. Some ideas aren't that far-fetched . I doesn't change the fact that it's better to watch ""Wait until dark"" once more instead of this crap. I give it 4/10.",Panic Room

When they do, Meg Altman (Foster) and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) head to their panic room for safety. But safe it is not, when they find out that what the three intruders want is hidden in that very room. And this leads to many problems. The only thing that bothered me was that both times I went and saw it, i had to sit in the second row from the screen. And as if that weren't bad enough, both times I had to be seated next to the two gabby eight-teen year olds who wouldn't shut up. And, I don't know why, but it got slightly annoying to hear some people laughing. I mean, yeah, there were some funny moments (not very many), but when people begin laughing at a guy screaming at a surveillance camera when he's extremelly p.o.'ed is just annoying.

So, it was different from what I was expecting but I liked it anyway because it's a great thriller, very suspenseful and very well shot.

About the cinematography I enjoyed the camera work which is excellent (especially in the first hour when they shot incredible details and the camera does a ""travelling effect"") and the light (almost the entire film is shot with little illumination, which makes it a suspenseful dark thriller, which I use to appreciate!:).

David Koepp's taut screenplay unfolds within a single set, sparsely furnished and lit with noirish intensity, where Foster and Stewart play a game of cat and mouse with their enigmatic assailants: Forest Whitaker plays a safe-cracker determined to do his job without hurting anyone, Dwight Yoakam is the trigger-happy psycho who believes violence is the solution to all their problems, and Jared Leto acts up a storm as the ringleader, a cocky young buck whose loudmouthed bluster masks an absence of common sense.Notable set-pieces include an attempt by Whitaker and co. to flush Foster and Stewart out of the panic room by pumping gas through the ventilation system, with spectacular consequences; Foster's desperate attempts to secure a telephone line to the outside world before the villains can foil her plan; a terrifying episode in which she's forced to leave the panic room in search of a cell phone; and the climactic face-off, which - not unexpectedly - ends in bloodshed and tears. The film's visual gymnastics are a joy to behold, combining graceful cinematography (by ace craftsmen Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji) and CGI trickery which propels the camera through doors, windows, vents and openings of every conceivable description, and Fincher uses every trick in the book to tighten the screws for his terrified protagonists.

Also factoring in the drama is the fact that the daughter is diabetic and requires periodic shots of insulin. The film has a real claustrophobic feel to it since the action pretty much stays inside the house and a good deal of the action plays out in that one room, but the cat and mouse game between Foster and the thieves works, primarily due to Foster, who brings so much more to the role than written and Forrest Whitaker, solid as always, as one of the thieves who does appear to have some semblance of a conscience.

Many of these have been listed in minute detail by other reviewers. Let me merely add that, beyond all of the factual errors, the entire line-up of characters is incoherent. Everything that anyone should do, they remarkably choose to do the negation of. It is quite unbelievable.In a Hollywood movie, one is accustomed to tolerating some incompetence on the part of the low-life thieves. In this case, the hoodlums spend dozens of scenes arguing with and yelling at one another. Maybe guys that stupid really would not make the prudent decision to exit the premises upon discovering that two people were at home. Smart guys would have departed, regrouped, and returned the next day while the two inhabitants were away. These losers, however, decide instead to have a lengthy, testosterone-fueled debate in the foyer of the house about everything under the sun rather than making any progress toward achieving their goal.How to explain the incoherence of the victims is another matter altogether. In a truly Darwinian world, none of the people featured in this film would have survived beyond childhood. They make blunder after blunder after blunder, leading the (this) viewer to shake her head throughout the entire grueling length of the film, asking over and over again, ¨Could anyone actually be that stupid?¨Suffice it to say that I cannot recommend this B- movie, with both thriller and horror story aspirations, to anyone except perhaps film students as an example of how not to make a thriller. It could, for example, be assigned for didactic purposes in a course on filmmaking, with the students asked to identify as many errors as possible. Perhaps an award could be given to the student who finds the most goofs.Speaking of awards, I certainly hope that Panic Room received the Raspberry for Worst Screenplay of 2002. If not, the screenwriter and director were robbed. There were occasional flashes of decent acting, but overall, the script was so poorly written that I am frankly shocked that Jodie Foster and Forrest Whitaker agreed to appear in such a joke of a movie. They must have been really strapped for cash.",Panic Room
115,virek213,"Intense, claustrophobic thriller",7,22 April 2002,"The thing about PANIC ROOM, which combines elements of STRAW DOGS and WAIT UNTIL DARK in its story, is not merely the intensity of the situation, but also how extremely claustrophobic it feels.  This is the first time in a good long while that a film can make the viewer feel literally trapped. Jodie Foster and Kristin Stewart are a mother and daughter who move into a Manhattan townhouse with a ""panic room"", a virtual 21st century fallout shelter complete with TV monitors and emergency supplies.  To their horror, however, they find out they have to use it when three burglars (Forrest Whittaker, Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam) break in, looking for a multi-million dollar stash.  Worst of all, that stash is hidden in a wall safe whose location just happens to be the Panic Room itself!Except for an excess of profanity in the screenplay, both director David Fincher (SEVEN) and screenwriter David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK) have concocted perhaps the best example of a home invasion horror/suspense film since STRAW DOGS.  Foster is, not surprisingly, incredibly good in her role, and Whittaker, though he plays a heavy, actually elicits a modicum of sympathy while his two ""partners"" go off on psychotic tangents.If you can stand the claustrophobic feel of it, PANIC ROOM is well worth the price of a ticket.  It is one of the best films of 2002.",Panic Room
116,redkiwi,Not spectacular,6,9 December 2002,"In retrospect a rather average film, surprising given some of Jodie Foster's past roles, she plays a woman who is separated from her husband and ends up eluding burglars by locking herself and her daughter in the panic room of their new flat.What ends up as a battle between Foster and the burglars could have been a lot better, and got rather tedious by the time it reached its predictable finish.Her performance as a psychologically unstable woman was adequate.",Panic Room
117,movieguy1021,Panic Room: 8/10,8,10 November 2002,"David Fincher's Panic Room begins with an uber-cool opening credit sequence with the credits being superimposed onto buildings. They even have reflections and shadows. In this stylized thriller, the rest of the movie is also slick.Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is a recent divorcee who is looking for a new house with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They find a giant house, complete with ""panic room"". What is a panic room, you ask? It is a room engulfed in steel where you can hide and there is not way you can be gotten to. Since this is a movie, theives have to come on the first night that Meg and Sarah are in. And, of course, what they are looking for is in the panic room.Panic Room cannot be mistaken for an arthouse movie, or anything of the type. It is a perfect example of a Hollywood movie. Bumbling crooks, main female characters who look weak but inside are strong, teens who are the opposite. In fact, we don't even know that Sarah has diabetes until halfway through the movie. If screenwriter David Koepp had had some more time to make characters, then maybe I wouldn't have been so aback when she suddenly starts to have an attack.Panic Room doesn't slack on tense situations. Anytime when Meg or anyone had to dart out of the room for a quick second (in slo-mo, of course), then you feel like your heart is about ready to jump out of your chest. Camera work by Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji was exceptional. When they panned throughout the house, it may be unnecessary, but it still looks wicked cool. It doesn't rely on split-screens or quick cuts or half-second scenes, it just is smooth and graceful.Foster was pretty good as Meg, but she wasn't anything Oscar-worthy. I thought that Stewart was uneven as her daughter, her feelings were mixed and changed at the drop of a hat. The three criminals (Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam, Forest Whitaker) were pretty good and their bickering looked like it wasn't staged. Many people have complained about the ending. I'm one of them. It seemed abrupt and unlikely, but it's a Hollywood movie. It doesn't have to be original. And the last scene at the bench was unnecessary, two minutes of added time. It was long enough already. I wished that they could have had the entire movie take place in the house and only a couple characters, that would have made it a more inviting premise.All in all, Panic Room is a very tense movie that pales on characters but still makes you be creeped out of your mind.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and some violence.",Panic Room
118,nathanmanson,That really impressed me,7,18 September 2020,"I really enjoyed that, for some reason I went into it with not high hopes but it was a good entertaining film.

119,LebowskiT1000,David Fincher has done it again!!!,10,7 June 2002,"I remember when I first heard about this film, I thought to myself ""How on earth are they going to do a two hour movie about some people trapped in a room?""  Well, my question was answered when I saw the film!  I have loved all of David Fincher's films so far (Alien 3, The Game, Seven, Fight Club), so I had some high hopes for this film.  I can safely say that I was not let down!  I thought the movie had an EXCELLENT story, very original and very interesting.As for the cast, I thought the cast was incredible!  Jodie Foster did a great job with her role as always.  Forest Whitaker did a great job as well. Jared Leto was a surprise hit with me.  I've seen Jared in other films, but never really thought he was anything special, but I thought he did a really good job in this film.  And finally Dwight Yoakam, for a country singer, he sure is a surprisingly good actor!  Dwight does a great job in this film, and does a fantastic job in ""Sling Blade"".  So you may want to check that film out too, if you haven't already.One other thing that I have to mention that really caught my eye was the lettering in the very beginning of the film.  I think it's such a weird thing to appreciate, but I really liked the beginning credits (it's not often that you can say that!)  When you see the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.I would definitely recommend seeing this movie!  David Fincher is a master at making intense and thrilling movies!  And while you're at it, if you haven't seen his other films that I mentioned above, you should rent those too.  I really hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",Panic Room
120,OriginalMovieBuff21,Pretty good,7,9 June 2004,Panic Room I have to say was an enjoyable and entertaining film that was just a big thrill ride. I mean you never knew if she was going to die or not. Forest Whitaker had a fabulous performance. He was a kind character in the movie and I felt sad actually for him at the end. A nice film to see but needed to be a little longer I think. The acting was good as usually with Jodie Foster's southern accent. The girl in the movie was kind of annoying perhaps in some scenes and I didn't like Dwight Yoakam's performance in the movie but oh well the movie was entertaining at least and gave a few twists. I recommend itHedeen's outlook: 7/10,Panic Room
121,Jithindurden,Fincher's weakest,6,6 December 2017,Probably Fincher's weakest along with The Game. With great performances from Foster and Whitaker and impressive performance from Stewart along with the seamless camera effectively using the CGI Fincher is able to thrill the audience. Some of the dialogues and some of the situations seemed a bit stupid but the direction is able to come above it. The feminist touch is elevated now considering the status of both the lead actresses right now.,Panic Room
122,Antagonisten,Disappointing,5,31 January 2005,"David Fincher had quickly become one of my favorite directors of the 1990's with his three entertaining and stylish movies Se7en, The Game and Fight Club. So of course expectations were high.Meg Altman has just divorced her husband and is about to use the money she got from the settlement to buy an apartment for herself and her daughter. Little does she know that the apartment is also the stash of some criminals who soon come to collect their money, believing the house to still be empty. The mother and daughter hide in the apartments' ""Panic room"" while the criminals realize that someone is watching.There are several flaws in ""Panic Room"" that i think makes this a disappointment. First of all the script is not very innovative or interesting. The premise of the women hiding in the panic room is not so bad, but it's hard to build much suspense with just a few people and just one apartment. For that to work the acting has to be solid. And that is another reason this fails. Forest Whitaker looks completely lost as one of the criminals, he couldn't scare a baby. Jared Leto certainly seems to enjoy himself but is equally lost. The only one who manages fit in his part is Dwight Yoakam. Jodie Foster is not bad, but this is not one of her better performances.The style from Finchers other movies is still there. The camera takes us for a ride several times and it's all very nicely shot. But still the movie relies to heavily on actors that fail to deliver. In the end it makes this a disappointment. Not bad, but uninteresting.",Panic Room
123,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: solid, nothing special",6,3 August 2002,"Panic Room is a straight action flick that doesn't make an attempt to bring in characterization or deep themes about life. Since I'm an action movie buff, that's right up my alley. Sort of a waste of the acting talent of Jodie Foster, however. Actually, the acting is good throughout the film, but it doesn't matter.The film makes an attempt to be clever, and to be realistic, but it succeeds more in the latter. Much of the action involves conflict at a distance, which is only mildly interesting. Not much blows up; it's more of a psychological thriller.Who should see this film:-- Action movie buffs, but only on a rainy dayI'll give ""Panic Room"" a so-so 6 out of 10.",Panic Room
124,SquigglyCrunch,A More Serious Version of Home Alone,7,17 November 2015,"I went into this movie without first seeing the ratings, but when I did I was surprised. I thought it was done quite well. Panic Room had a really good idea, and I thought it was carried out in a fun yet still serious enough way to keep it feeling intense. I've read other reviews talking about how little sense the movie made, but none of these supposedly 'unrealistic' things bothered me, nor did I notice any of them, so it didn't take away from the experience for me. I thought that the characters were done pretty well too. They felt pretty real, and the actors all did quite good jobs. I actually cared about them and felt like I knew them relatively well by the end. Overall Panic Room is a solid movie. The plot is well-executed and the characters and acting is great. In the end I would recommend this movie, and I really don't understand why people don't seem to like it that much.",Panic Room

126,StanleyStrangelove,"Dumb, huge plot holes, laughable dialog",1,22 August 2007,"Panic Room must be a comedy. It's not supposed to be a comedy. But because of its silly plot full of holes and ridiculous dialog, it turns out to be unintentionally funny.Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto play a trio of robbers that makes the Three Stooges look smart. They resemble the hapless burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone. Only this time it's Jodie Foster and Kristen Stuart who are home alone when the three goofballs break into their home to steal the millions of dollars hidden in the Panic Room. That's a vault room that the previous owner had built into the house. It's so safe that no one can break into it. It has its own phone and electrical system, its own air filtration system and surveillance cameras to see every room in the house. And guess who helped build it. Forest Whitaker, one of the robbers. This movie is so dumb. Here are just a few of the many glaring errors:1. Whitaker is able to pump propane gas into the room, even though it has its own ventilation system. He does this simply by knocking a hole in the drywall. The room itself is encased in concrete and steel.2.He's also tries to tap into a phone cable, which, get this, is sticking out of a jack in the wall and which, get this, Jodie Foster manages to, in the nick of time, yank out of the wall even though she is in the panic room. 3. The hapless robbers seal the house so that no one can get in or out. But, who happens to appear? Foster's husband. That's right. He manages to just appear in the foyer even though they have locked up the house tight and sealed the doors with screws. 4. How about the fact that large tools appear from nowhere such as the drill press which Whitaker uses to drill into the safe. Why would anyone go to all the trouble to put a safe in a Panic Room yet the safe is so weak you can drill into it? Beats me. 5. Foster's daughter who it turns out goes into diabetic coma and needs an injection. This certainly came out of the blue.In short, Panic Room is one of the stupidest movies in recent memory. It is not just stupid, it's incredibly stupid. The dialog is absolutely so bad it's a hoot. The plot is so full of holes you'll be laughing your butt off.Too bad. I love Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. They have an immense amount of talent. They should never have been in this total piece of rubbish.",Panic Room
127,andrewroy-04316,A taut thriller that sticks to its strengths,7,1 November 2020,"Panic Room is a straightforward, suspense-driven film that doesn't spend much time on larger thematic questions or character backstories, and I think it's all the better for that narrow focus. The premise is simple (just a home invasion), and nearly the entire movie takes place during one night, with about 6 characters involved. There isn't much more to it than a solid, simple thrill ride, but it's a plausible plot, tension-filled cat and mouse game, and the acting and cinematography are excellent. The script merely hints at what else is going on in these character's lives, from why one man needs the money, to the recent divorce, to who the robbers even are. We see these characters as snapshots in this moment rather than spending time on forced exposition. Foster is great as the lead, and the entire ensemble is very good - Kristen Stewart plays a strong teenage daughter, Leto brings a captivating stupid but aggressive man, and Whitaker is some much appreciated nuance in showing some morality. The camera work is fantastic throughout, both in highlighting the contrast between the claustrophobic panic room with the open house as well as transition shots that zoom through the house and remind us of the paths these characters can take through the house. Panic Room probably isn't a movie that will come to mind immediately, but it knows what it wants to be and does that well.",Panic Room
128,Spanner-2,Effective thriller,8,1 April 2002,"This is the latest offering from director David Fincher (toning down his trademark visual style this time) and features Jodie Foster as a woman who buys a weird building after her divorce from her husband and moves in with her daughter. The building of course has this ""panic room"" which is supposedly this impenetrable place that no one can get in or out of.. though a trio of hoodlums (including Forest Whitaker and Jared Leto) decide to try anyway. This film has a number of chilling moments and ratchets up the suspense.. though they throw in a few too many cliches (such as the daughter needing an insulin injection at precisely the worst moment).

The cast is perfect with some great dialogue coming from everyone, especially Forest Whitaker. The story is fairly basic. She's stuck in the panic room and can't escape.

I had heard some disappointing comments, though, so I didn't expect too much. However, Panic Room was almost never suspenseful and it was even boring at times.

The type of film it is limits its ability to be spectacular or universal or groundbreaking, which is why I can't rate it higher, but it never intended to be really. It's exactly as good as it can be, with the right creative applications of restraint and chutzpah when needed. It starts a bit dated but by the end has completely grabbed you.",Panic Room
134,Angeneer,Very poor for its potential,6,23 November 2003,"While films concentrated in one scenery and a few roles can really deliver, this one has plenty of apparent drawbacks, all of which an actor of Jodie Foster's caliber should be experienced enough to avoid. Panic Room doesn't build up any tension whatsoever, it's just a lining up of obligatory scenes that crossed the writer's mind. Cliches and unplausibility reign throughout its duration. The roles are non-demanding, hence any actor could do (let alone this cast). I can give a credit for some really nice camerawork, but fragmentary visual redemption is perhaps the only aspect worth mentioning in this movie.",Panic Room
135,chrisbrown6453,"Few movies in our lifetime really jolt you to the edge of your seat, makes you squirm and chills your pulse as effective as Panic Room.",7,14 June 2002,"The latest David Fincher thriller is dread-ridden and accomplished and is a major indication of his mood-altering brilliance of a director. His films seduce and punish you until you're as trapped as its desperate characters. Fincher invokes such a high level feeling of anxiety in his dark, near pitch black paranoid visions. The result of his new movie is a thriller that pushes all the right buttons on the audience. Jodie Foster plays the recently divorced Meg with a young daughter with diabetes named Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They are talked into purchasing a new triple-decker brownstone located on the better half of New York. As common in movies where the house is big and formidable like the Xanadu mansion in Citizen Kane and the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, the house in play here is an ominous character where it's large and expansive spatial diameters are practically ready to swallow up its timid inhabitants.
Foster, however, has never been anyone's victim. When three burglars invade her house on the first night, she panics with little awareness of where to run but makes the right crucial decisions. She wakes her daughter and gets her to run with her to the high-tech secure shelter called the Panic Room (there is an exciting chase as the bad guys, led by Jared Leto, lunge after them). Harbored by steel walls, the discreet but claustrophobic room has a buried phone line that is (in)conveniently unconnected, its own ventilation system and a survivor aid box.The intruders have a serious, high-stakes agenda and nevertheless, the prize they have in quest is located in the very room that Meg and her daughter are occupying. The bad guys quarrel over the situation, with Forest Whitaker as the sympathetic crook and a third character (the actor is better off unrevealed until the closing credits) is the madman wild-card who spends the entire time hidden under a ski mask. The bad guys try to hammer their way into the room; they try to suffocate the ventilation system, and try to use every threatening method imaginable to get Meg and Sarah to leave the room. The men box up the entire house and threaten not to leave until they get what they want. Suspense is built as much negotiation goes on between parties, and occasional trips from the room are made as Meg tries to retrieve a cell phone that was on her bed side desktop before the incident began. Sarah has diabetes complications and needs her injection. Dirty and greedy maliciousness takes place as the bad guys narrow in on how to harm Meg's most vulnerable fears.
Not until after the curtain lowers do all the script flaws come into question. Foster, at one point, does have an opportunity to bring in more outside help but reasons that it will trigger more danger. The ending has a false note with the invincible villain rising from impending death one more time. But this is a director's movie and the power of the images and intensity of the events make this one heart-pounding experience, and is not for the feint of heart - which is what we expect from Fincher.",Panic Room
136,ethanbresnett,A fine arrow in David Fincher's impressive quiver,8,3 September 2020,"Panic Room could have gone one of two ways, either suffering from or benefitting from its relatively simple premise - a mother and daughter seeking refuge in their panic room following a home invasion. Fortunately its the latter, as David Fincher manages to draw out a lot of mileage and tension from the set up.The plot is very enjoyable and full of tension, with a few fun twists and turns. Albeit the ultimate end is somewhat predictable, but the journey there is thoroughly entertaining. This is in large part due to the cast, with Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart sharing a believable on screen relationship as mother and daughter. Both of them were great at injecting a sense of consequence and terror in the film, which made the whole piece very tense and nail biting at throughout. The standouts for me though were an expectedly great Forest Whitaker and an equally great performance from Jared Leto. Their characters were particularly well crafted and the dynamic within the band of thieves was very watchable.In terms of the more technical aspects Panic Room is unmistakably a Fincher film, sharing the figurative and literal darkness of films like Se7en and Fight Club, as well as the sublime style. The setting allows for some very inventive and creative camera work, with some great tracking shots through the house, giving a great sense of paranoia and unease.You're in pretty safe hands with a Fincher film, and Panic Room really is no exception.",Panic Room
137,nitzanhavoc,"Thriller fans - press ""play""!",7,11 October 2012,"The best thing about Panic Room was, in my opinion, the carefully balanced combination between realistic relatable events and cinematic fiction. Long before Saw portrayed a story taking place in maybe the cheapest single location in the history of the business (and became an all time hit), Panic Room used pretty much the same aspect.A claustrophobic mother and a diabetic daughter, locked in a seemingly impenetrable room after burglars have broken into their house. Both little Kristen Stewart and world famous Jodie Foster performed their roles very well. We also got to see Forest Whitaker (which is always a treat in my book), this time as one of the bad guys! However, writer Koepp and director Flincher were well aware that Whitaker has the ""good guy"" face and charisma, and made sure to use that too.The movie lacked a twist, if you ask me, which would have made it a much better thriller. Something smart to happen towards the end that the audience had no way of seeing coming. As it is, Panic Room had very few violent bloody scenes, and could have easily been rated PG-13 (so the F word is used more than once, so what?)All in all, Panic Room was a fun film which I really enjoyed watching. A good ol' fashion thriller with all the makings of a classic. Though it could have been a lot better, I'd still say it was definitely worth watching if you're a thriller fan!",Panic Room

140,supertom-3,One of the best films of the year so far!,8,9 May 2002,"I waited eager with anticipation for this film as I am a big fan of David Fincher, he is a great director, Seven was one of the best thrillers ever made and the Game and Fight Club were two eerie and surreal films that demand watching. 	The Panic Room is a great film, simply because the Direction is excellent and the acting top notch, these both combine to create a tense and exciting thriller. While the story is fairly simple and far more straight forward than Finchers other films, in particular the Game and Fight Club, the film sets out to keep us on the edge of our seats with suspense and successfully does that. Fincher directs with style and perfectly captures the dark and unsettling atmosphere the house provides, the cinematography in this is very good. There is some stylish camera movement that weaves through the house and this is used to good effect as the camera will smoothly drift from one floor of the house to another. 	The acting is great in particular from Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart (as Fosters daughter) and the reluctant crook played by Forrest Whittaker. There are also some elements of humour incoperated in the film just to lighten the tone every now and again. Jodie Foster is at the top of her game and she also looks very good in this as the mother who turns at to be a pain in the ass for the three crooks as the film turns out as almost a very dark and errie Home Alone without the annoying blond kid who can't act (sorry Mackauly but you can't mate). They never try to make Foster so tough she turns into a Lara Croftesque action woman, just an intelligent woman doing her best to keep her daughter from harm. The film never drags and while this doesn't compare to some of Finchers other films it still has his trademark atmosphere and is certainly one of the best films that has come out in 2002 so far. 8/10",Panic Room
141,skybrick736,Panic Room (7/10),7,27 November 2016,"Watching Panic Room's trailer or reading a quick snippet of the plot points towards the film being just another cheap thriller. However, what David Fincher can do with any script is so remarkable its really something to be admired. Panic Room is a simple story with terrific acting and setting. The apartment complex and panic room's visual intrigue has just as much character as Jodi Foster's persistence, Forest Whitaker's cunningness and Jared Leto's desperateness. There is a great build up scene after scene with clever plot developments that cause many twists and turns. The darkness in the dialogue is genuinely frightful and realistic to what would be an actual home invasion. Although there is a bit of a downward spiral towards the end the technical and stylish directing of Fincher is just too good to discount. Panic Room is a high quality thriller and worth at least one watch having not too much in the way of replay value after that.",Panic Room
142,EthanBJones_03,Competently made thriller that lacks narrative drive and a solid conclusion,6,30 May 2017,"'PANIC ROOM' was directed by David Fincher and stars Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart and Forrest Whitaker. ​Shortly after divorcing her husband, Meg(Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah(Kristen Stewart) move into a brand new, huge house fitted with a specialised Panic Room. After three burglars break into the house, they are sealed into the Panic Room and must find a way to contact the outside world and escape before it's too late.Panic Room is a perfectly disposable thriller with some solid performances and an airtight premise that is sadly let down by it's mediocre conclusion. You will be on the edge of your seat for the majority of this movie but I just don't see many people being satisfied with it's rushed and messy climax which leaves you with way too many unanswered questions, but not in the way that works to the film's advantage. I think this movie's primary strength is Fincher's awesome directing skills, the wide array of villains and the amazing premise. The premise is what keeps this movie so interesting for me and is probably why I enjoyed it more than I would have. That said, some things surrounding the premise don't make sense at all and could have been handled a lot better in the story. Another fault to the plot was how predictable it is. I assumed most of the things that did happen were going to ahead of time and left me with much to be desired. As much as I do enjoy piecing together a story on my own, previous Fincher movies, such as 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club' ended with a bang and elevated the movie. This movie doesn't end on a bang and the ending is just not satisfying in any way. It leaves way too many unanswered questions and just doesn't feel complete. I sense Fincher had to rush his ending because it doesn't feel like him to make it as messy as it is.Firstly, Jodie Foster was excellent in this movie and you really buy her character. I bought her performance and trust that she was just a simple Mum, pushed to the brink of her sanity and that all she wanted was to keep her demon child safe. Speaking of the Anti- Christ, I hated her. Kristen Stewart was so annoying in this role that I just couldn't stand her. She displayed negative levels of emotion and just irked me throughout the entire film. She possessed no redeeming qualities and provided no reason for me to even remotely care about her. Forrest 'Dodgy Eyes' Whitaker was excellent as Burnham and provided a genuinely layered performance that kept in tune with his character. I sincerely bought his motives and even rooted for him at points in the movie, which isn't rare necessarily for movie villains but was surprising considering what he was doing in the movie. Jared Leto was also really good as Junior but I wish they did more with his character because he just kind of served as filler and more of a plot device, rather than a genuinely enthralling villain. Dwight Yokeham was alright as Raol; I believed he was a freaking psychopath. His arc over the movies feels genuine and not forced in any way. He seems genuinely smart, lethal and calculating and is a solid antagonist for Foster and Satan.If there is ONE thing David Fincher can do, it is make a movie look gorgeous, and that is no different here. Fincher is a modern day master of building tension and his artistic talent benefits this movie to the nth degree. I think this movie is a great thriller up until the ending. I hate to beat a point like a dead horse but it's the main point I feel is prominent. If the ending for this movie was different. I didn't need it to be more action packed, or even supply a twist but I would have liked something more to tie the movie up nicely and make it seem more memorable. In conclusion, I do recommend to see this movie but I don't think it'll be something you remember after the credits roll.",Panic Room
143,nobbytatoes,an intense ride,9,14 January 2006,"Meg is in the middle of a divorce with her husband Stephen. Meg's friend Lydia has found Meg and her daughter a new home, only just coming onto the market. The house is a massive four story house, that has everything they need and more. On inspection of the house, Evan Kurlander the estate agent shows them a secret room the house holds; a panic room. Used for home protection, the panic room is an isolated room which no one can enter once you are inside. The night that Meg and Sarah move in, three men break into the house, after a valuable that the house holds. Once Meg and Sarah lock themselves inside the panic room, things go from bad to worse. The object the three men; Junior, Burnham and Raoul, are after resides in the panic room, stopping at nothing to get inside the panic room.Panic Room is another highly crafted film, adding into David Fincher's great arsenal of films. Tightly constructed and moving at a face pace, Panic Room grabs a hold of you from the get go, and doesn't relinquish. The room itself is a small, claustrophobic area, creating a wonderfully tight atmosphere. While the house itself is a massive area, it also holds a claustrophobic feel, creating even more tension, as for the predominant part of Panic Room, we don't leave its walls.David Fincher's direction has such grace and elegance, from all the seamless tracking shots around the house. They move so smoothly, and are perfectly integrated with the computer generated shots, when shifting between rooms through the walls and ceilings. Fincher is a meticulous director, and it does show. Every shot has this perfection, using the surroundings and actor to their ultimate limit.Character development has been kept at a minimal from David Koepp's script. Your not given a lot of depth to them through verbal conversations, yet you are given so much from the actors performances, creating idiosyncrasies which tell you more about the character than the verbal inclinations. Jodie Foster has such a strong presence on the screen. While Meg is fragile on the outside, Foster gives her such inner strength. Kristen Stewart is the opposite to Foster, Sarah has real outer strength, yet fragile on the inside, which Kristen Stewart captures perfectly. Jared Leto is great as the hot headed Junior. Forest Whitaker does well as Burnham, also Dwight Yoakam as the twisted Raoul.Panic Room is a wonderfully, tightly constructed thriller from one of our modern day great directors.",Panic Room

And the humor is so forced it hurt to watch.Why in the world would Jodie Foster light the gas that's killing them on fire?

The first half is Fincher showing off--at the expense of the plot--with impossibly complicated tracking and zoom shots through rails and walls and electrical outlets and plenty of scenes filmed at floor level. But he settles down in the second half and lets the conflicts between Foster and the intruders as well as between the intruders themselves (well-played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) play out; then the film becomes engrossing, well-paced and satisfying. Fincher and his screenwriter, David Koepp, play fast and loose with the story--there are plenty of holes in the plot (a scene involving the use of sound is particularly flawed)--but the performances and the razzle-dazzle help you get past the suspect moments. Darkly but cleanly photographed in Panavision by Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji.",Panic Room

Forest Whitaker and Jared Leto are two of the three burglar-villains set on stealing money hidden in Foster's new home's panic room, which is where mother and daughter have taken base. Both parties use their heads rather than their resources to resolve their conflicts. Panic Room is a little on the predictable side, but extremely tense throughout.

149,christian94,An innovative director turned pop,6,2 April 2002,"Forget about alien 3, that was perhaps to pay the bills.  An immature formulaic debut in the mighty Hollywood. However, after the box-office success and pure creative genius demonstrated in Se7en, The Game and Fight Club, three of the most daring, brilliant and masterfully constructed movies of the 90s, David Fincher had no excuse to accept a project and script as flawed, mainstream and without substance as Panic Room.  Even his camerawork wizardry cannot save this film that sinks like the Titanic as the movie advances forward.  It seems that Fincher has just done the opposite, gone backward.  Back to the mindless audience that is satisfied with a few creeps, a few laughs, good actors but lousy characters and a storyline with more holes than a strainer. Yes, the things that Fincher is able to do with the camera in the scene where the burglars first try to enter the house are quite frankly very impressing.  Even after the beginning opening sequence which was visually aesthetic and original, I had hope.  When I was however told about the ""panic room"" and how it was suppose to protect the house's occupants in case of an emergency, I started to have the feeling that this movie was going to be a series of cliches, which, as it turned out, it was.  I will refrain to talk about the lack of depth, realism or direction of the screenplay, because it might get ugly. You don't want it to get ugly.Overall, I cannot say that it was a bad movie.  Acting was good from all the cast, and if you try hard to let go of the inconsistencies, the mood, although not really scary, is interesting.  It was one of the better Hollywood thriller of the week, but it was still a thriller of the week. That is, unoriginal, uncompelling and certainly not worthy of David Fincher's previous breakthrough work. Mr. Fincher, get your act together.  Soon.",Panic Room

152,squirrel_burst,A tight thriller that you have probably overlooked,10,18 November 2014,"""Panic Room"" is a well-made, really exciting thriller that stays interesting despite the limited location. This is one of those movies that I had seen years ago when it first came out. I'm not sure if I had simply forgotten or I hadn't realized how great this one was because at the time I was a dumb teenager but it really is terrific. The premise is pretty simple. A single mom (Meg, played by Jodie Foster) and her vulnerable daughter (Sarah, Kristen Stewart) move into a new house. The house comes with a panic room, a place where you can hide in should anything go wrong. A bunch of bad guys (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto) break into the place, so Sarah and her daughter hide in the room. Trouble is, that's where the villains are trying to get to.There are many smart choices in the movie, one of which is to keep the cast small. For most of the movie we only get 5characters and that allows us to get to know them. You feel like you're inside the movie, studying everyone and trying to get the edge on them by observing their mannerisms and gaging their personality, just as the people on either side of the panic room are doing. While you're getting inside the characters' heads, a strong sense of urgency builds. I'm no criminal, but I know that with a robbery, you have to get in and get out quick. The longer the plot drags on, the worse it's going to get because you increase the chances of something going wrong and of you getting caught. On the side of our heroes, there are some complications that build too, so you've got Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart's characters that want to get out asap, and the thieves that want to get in. Everyone is either trying to find a way to trick the other party into letting them in or out of the room, or trying to find a way around the big door that's separating everyone, or trying to force someone else to do it for them. Because the characters are intelligent, they're always trying something new and it kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. It's really satisfying to see a movie where people act logically; always trying to sneak past each other's defenses (both physical and mental/emotional) and you'll constantly be surprised by the new elements introduced. ""Panic Room"" is a terrific thriller that really cleverly uses its location, creates genuine thrills and exciting feelings of paranoia and claustrophobia too. (On DVD, September 2012)",Panic Room
153,Cedric_Catsuits,Silly script,2,29 July 2011,"There are too many anomalies in the story for this to be considered realistic, and without realism the viewer will not believe the story and therefore quickly lose interest. I won't detail the errors in case you want to watch it and make up your own mind. Let's say, Meg demonstrates some intelligence, but it appears to be selective and geared towards creating dramatic film sequences - maybe she knew her story would be turned into a movie?! Stupid script aside, the performances are all quite good and the tension is aided by good lighting and camera work, albeit said tension is lost due to aforementioned errors. We do learn a lot about the characters and some credit is due for that.However, with the viewer having invested some interest in a character, it seems pointless to undo all that good work by skimping on a decent ending. It may be logical in terms of the way the film is constructed, but in terms of the story I found it unsatisfactory.If you can stand the frustration and disappointment, it's worth watching for the good points, but as a film overall it deserves a low rating for sheer stupidity.",Panic Room
154,bababear,A Boring Thriller with No Thrills,3,6 April 2002,"Except for a couple of scenes, watching PANIC ROOM was like watching paint dry.  As a big fan of the director from his work on SE7EN, I had expected suspense and plot twists.  What I got was HOME ALONE with four letter words and gore effects.It was at least half an hour too long.  Well, it could have been an hour shorter, though: there's a scene early in the action where mother and daughter are in an elevator that no doubt had an alarm button in it.  But then it would have been a short subject.The scene where the bad guys try to pump toxic gas into the room and the last time the door slams shut are both exciting.  The camera work is awesome, the sound and music are great, and the opening titles are among the best I've ever seen.  But there's so much talk, talk, talk between the three very dull bad guys.My respect for Jodie Foster would have been greater if at some point she had just turned to the camera and said, ""Look, I know how bad this is, I'm ashamed of myself for doing it and I know how bored you are, but do you have any idea how much they're paying me to do this crap?""",Panic Room

156,Gubby-Allen,What?,3,15 May 2002,"I'm really surprised people have rated this as high as 7/10. It was another one where the trailer made it look better than what it was. Occasionally Panic Room threatened to get interesting but never was more than ok.We had the entire cinema to ourselves for this & 20 minutes in I could see why. It was handy as we were able to regularly say to each other ""why is she doing that"" or ""I thought that couldn't happen"" without bothering anyone. Likewise we had a loud chat about what a stupid idea it was calling a boy Sarah, before eventually one of us suggested it may be a girl.Anyway, the film. The main problems (aside of the cliched to death, diabetic girl who needed her sugar intake) was the flaws & inconsistencies. I was aware of some beforehand & thought I could put up with them but they became really irritating. Leaving aside the propane gas error!(1) You had a panic room which you could only speak out of, not into. By the end of the film it had reversed & Jodie was speaking into it. There may have been a reason I missed, but even allowing for that would have created more questions.(2) We're told at the start there are sensors so the door of the room would not shut if something was in the way. Fine. What happens later? Jodie traps the villains' hand in there. Why did it not open again? If it was because the hand was between the 2 ultra violet sensor lines (and not through them) why mention it at the start at all? Forget the sensors completely & it would have worked better.(3) Then there's a brief allusion to Foster's claustrophobia at the start, that miraculously disappears without trace as the film went on.(4) Why tell the police she was fine, and then immediately proceed to smash all the cameras up? Surely the latter would've angered the villains' just as much as the former.On top of that, what a gas lighter was doing in the room I weren't sure, nor why they couldn't have use the hole looking out to push something(s) through to gain help. The ending also seemed a rush job, infact the final scene seemed of no purpose whatsoever other than to suggest the moral of the story was 'don't live in a big house.' The directing from Fincher (and I enjoyed Seven & The Game) become a tad over the top by the end moving through wall, so did the over emphasis on darkness.The story could moved along quicker but was best suited to a one hour TV crime show , not a film. But even allowing for the Home Alone esque villains, the acting wasn't bad & I've still seen a lot worse.3/10",Panic Room

The camera work is outstanding, the suspense is built up very professionally, and the whole thing comes across as quite believable, although there are of course some minor plot holes (for example, how is it possible that the ski mask guy got his hand stuck between the door?). The acting is good and especially Forest Whitacker's character is very likeable in spite of the fact that he's a bad guy. But still, seeing that this movie is directed by one of the most promising and brilliant directors of the past decade, having brought us movies like ""Fight Club"" and ""Seven"", it's simply way too standard: there's a happy end, there aren't any major plot twists etc.Very enjoyable, very high production standards, but ultimately a bit disappointing.*** out of **** stars",Panic Room
158,canuckteach,Say What? The script's the thing...,2,5 July 2008,"I watched part of this film on 'Rogers Pay-TV' after seeing the nifty trailer on iTunes. About 15 minutes in, I wished I'd spent my $3 on a really good cup of coffee instead! Then, I started to read the reviews here at IMDb and realized that I was witnessing a murder in progress--a murder of the suspense-thriller genre.Since the camera work and cast are first class, how does one create such a muddled flick? Simple: the script. High school kids can't really act, but when they perform 'Oklahoma' or 'Fiddler on the Roof', the presentation is usually passable. Why? good script.There is no camera work at a live presentation of one of Shakespeare's plays, even using unknown but gifted performers - yet the final product is generally intriguing. Why? good script.A compelling actor like Hugh Laurie, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, or {fill in name of your fav American actor here - don't want to hurt your feelings - you get my point} could sit in a chair and stare at a live audience, or at a single camera for 2 hours - you'd be spellbound if they spin a good yarn, but only if they had a good script.But without a script, even the best actors toil in futility. Forest Whitaker is always brilliant. Jody Foster has 'A'-list talent. Jared Leto plays a good 'bizarro-type' (try his understated performance in 'Switchback' with Danny Glover) and Dwight Yoakam has the chops to 'weird you out' in bit roles (made me shudder in 'Sling Blade'). How could such a roster produce this piece of junk? Bad script. A revealing clue that the writer tanked the screenplay is when the bad guys show up and start cursing for no particular reason. The 'script' probably reads 'the bad guys show up and start cursing for no particular reason'.The array of dumb things in this film, listed here at IMDb, seems endless, but I'll add one more (apologies if someone got it before): Jody and daughter are using a flashlight to signal a sleeping neighbor for help,100 yards away. He wakes up, looks out his window and.... and.....and... they stop flashing the SOS and they begin to holler 'Help Help Help' (through a rainstorm). He can't hear. He goes back to sleep. Darn it - I hate it when that happens.Finally - looking for a good cast, nifty camera work, decent performance, and forgivable minor slips in logic? try 'Red Eye'! the difference? good script.",Panic Room

162,axlrhodes,Falls somewhere in-between Home Alone and Funny Games.,7,18 August 2012,"Through the lens of David Fincher and the pen of David Koepp comes this simplistic, but highly polished home invasion thriller that while being one of it's directors more incidental films, is still a hugely competent effort with more than enough to recommend it by. Meg Altman (Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Stewart) have just moved into their new Manhattan pad. Built into the master bedroom is a state of the art panic room and – 'whaddya know!?' – on the first night there's a break in. And so begins the film. Just like in his previous feature film Fight Club, David Fincher cleverly opts for CGI to create some otherwise impossible visuals as the camera prowls and glides around the huge house with an eerie grace prompting some good early tension. Once the break-in happens and we get acquainted with the invaders, some of that tension dissipates, indeed there's one comical moment in which a slightly burned Jared Leto reacts in a way that recalls the bungling burglars of Home Alone , but thanks to a menacing turn from Dwight Yoakam the balance is never tipped too far that way and we're never allowed to fully relax. Like all good survival horror's, Panic Room works like a fun puzzle as it often gives you the opportunity to mull over what you yourself might do in similar circumstances. Good direction makes Panic Room a functional suspense thriller that while in terms of classic status could never be mentioned in the same sentence as Se7en or Fight Club, still helps it stand tall in a long line of the old school Friday night-in popcorn rentals.",Panic Room
163,ryan_kuhn,"""My room! Definitely my room!""",7,13 February 2005,"Panic Room is one of those rare movies that features less than 10 actors and a set piece acting as a character in the film. While thin on story, there is plenty of action that helps sustain the movie from start to finish. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a newly single mother who moves into a posh Manhatten home with her daughter Sarah, played by Kristen Stewart. The first night they live in their new home, a team of robbers (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto) attempts to extract contents from the previous owners of the home late at night, setting in motion the cat and mouse game that supplies action throughout the movie. The house is outfitted with a ""Panic Room,"" a solitary fortress that allows the home's owners to lock themselves in, the bad people stay out. It's a great plan, except the out-going telephone service has not been hooked up yet, so the Altmans are locked in the room, and the robbers have to wait from them to get out--what they are looking for, millions of dollars in stocks and bonds are located inside the room. For every move the crooks make, the two ladies have to make a counter-move, each time you think the girls have come up with a brilliant idea to get them out of their problem, something else goes wrong. There is a truly scary moment when gas is used to try to suffocate Meg and Sarah out, you can imagine yourself trying to gasp for breath. Beyond that, there are tense moments, but nothing groundbreaking. It's a solid suspense thriller, and it looks really good. Forest Whitaker plays the role of the crook who has some morals, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, he just wants the money, very very well, by far the best performance in the movie.

The Girl is irritating. Forrest Whitaker and Jared Leto are decent.

This room is equipped to keep people safe in the event for an emergency. And when some burglars comes to steal some thing the only safe place Meg and Sarah can find to hide is the panic room. But things start to become quite tense when they realize that what the burglars are looking for is also in the same room. While the bunch of crooks plan on how to get inside the room, Meg and Sarah has to look for a way to get help from the outside world. Panic Room is a very thrilling ride. It takes place 99% inside the mansion and over night. The sequences builds tension minute by minute and every move made by the burglars and the home people becomes tense every time. For the viewer it's a game of hoping for the best. And this packs good performance by Jodie Foster (Meg). When her kid starts to get sick she becomes desperate to find help. And she makes several very risky moves keeping her life on the edge. One other major reason for the success of this movie is the cinematography. Especially the sequences which require very dramatic camera movements and long shots combined with CG and moving cameras are done very skillfully. The viewer actually feels how big the house is and how you can really move in and around about it. This was directed back in 2004 by David Fincher way before he won the best director award at Golden Globes for 'Social Network'. And he actually nailed it.more at flickshout.tk",Panic Room

172,jrfranklin01,Good Suspense Even If A Bit Uncredible,6,28 December 2004,"The film ""Panic Room"" is about a recently-divorced mother, Megan Altman, and her daughter who decide to move into an expensive home in a upscale big-city district. The home is striking in its three enormous floors, elevator, and a high-tech security system. The film gets its name from a room that was installed by the home's previous owner - the panic room. It is a safe room in the house, complete with its own air source, staple goods, video monitors, etc.Unbeknownst to its new owners, the house has a large sum of money hidden in it. A bunch of crooks, aware of this, break in late one evening. What ensues is a fight for survival for Megan and her daughter. The panic room becomes the apex of this struggle.Jodie Foster gives us yet another excellent performance as Megan Altman. And the director, David Fincher, displays some great creativity in the introductory credits. The names are shown in a 3D-block format that make them appear as signs within a city. He also does a good job in showing the passage of shots through parts of the house, such as the walls, ventilation system, etc. I was very impressed.Where ""Panic Room"" teetered a bit (*SPOILERS BELOW) was in things like the almost-too-ironic nature of Megan's daughter happening to be diabetic. The served well in the film's plot, but I felt it was far-fetched. Also, there is NO WAY Megan could have ignited that gas stream and not been burned to a crisp! That was definitely a stretch, although I confess to liking the suspense of seeing what would happen. Raoul's ability to hike up a flight of steps after being hit with a sledgehammer and knocked off a balcony, was...well, draw your own conclusions. All I know is that it is VERY unlikely he could get back up and then almost take out the entire family, especially with a crushed hand. One last point also bothers me. Forest Whitaker's character, Burnham, just doesn't feel credible enough. I understand his sympathy for the family due to his love for his own, but his actions flip-flop. First he is gassing them and next he is helping the little girl. I had trouble believing he would really return to stop Raoul.""Panic Room"" does a good job at delivering suspense and does so with some unique and quality shots. The cast, including Jared Leto's character and his idiocy, put forth a stupendous effort. The story is just shaky in a few places (why didn't Junior just wait until the family was gone to rob the place?). 6/10 P.S.: I guess the director didn't learn from ""Die Hard""'s plot hole. Bearer bonds have traceable serial numbers on them. While it is unlikely the old man would have confessed the bonds' existence only to Junior, it is even more unlikely he (or anyone else) would be able to cash them without jumping some serious hoops.",Panic Room
173,jmillerdp,Standard Thriller,6,31 August 2013,"*** SPOILERS ***Pretty much what you would expect: A bunch of robbers coming to hit a place they hear has a lot of money (think ""In Cold Blood""); a sudden, unwelcome, and ultimately psychotic addition to the team (like any heist movie); a character with a potentially life-threatening condition (lots of movies where someone's trapped); and a single location (like ""Bound""). All of this is no surprise since the screenwriter is the untalented David Koepp (who ruined the film version of ""Jurassic Park"").David Fincher uses lots of camera tricks to try to make the film more interesting, but it is ugly looking like a lot of Fincher movies. Lots of monochromatic interiors, for example. Howard Shore's film score is lifeless and uninteresting, typical of modern film scores.Of course, there are a lot of plot holes, chiefly, everyone's making a TON of noise throughout the movie, and no one hears a thing; we learn the police had been notified, but take an hour to show up; Foster's ex just walks into the brownstone without the police (or anything else) in tow; The former owner just leaves tens of millions of dollars in the safe; wouldn't you leave bearer bonds like that in say, a safe deposit box?Oh well, if you're gonna see it, turn your brain off.

174,calspers,Fincher's brilliant direction in a simple plot,8,20 October 2021,"""Panic Room"" (2002) is Fincher's fifth film, released after ""Fight Club"" (1999). In other words, few films could be expected so much from as what was expected from ""Panic Room"".And yet, Fincher does not rest at his laurels as a director. The technical execution is just as convincing as ""Fight Club"", be it related to cinematography (the closing shot, for example, is one of the most intelligent I have ever seen), editing or pacing. Also, Foster and Whitaker are stealing the show as usual from the both of them. However, it is in terms of plot that this can be seen as a lesser experience.In its own right, I think this is a highly focused and simple thriller that is both entertaining and effective in its storytelling. Recommended as a good thriller, and as one that deserves to be viewed in its own right rather than be compared to ""Fight Club"".",Panic Room

178,joelgodinho,Some Great Camera Work,6,28 May 2020,"Panic Room is a 2002 film directed by David Fincher and starring Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart and Foster Whitaker. This film has some crazy camera work, going trough the ground and trough the walls and even though some don't quite work for me, I'd say that it is the stand out part of the film because most of the camera work is really good and original and it explores the layout of the house very well, the best lar is easily when the thieves are trying to get in the house it's just incredible. But besides that I honestly don't think there isn't anything else great in the film. The acting is OK, it's not bad either but except for Forest Whitaker and Jodie Foster whose acting I find pretty good it's just OK. The story is also OK and it has a good premise but it's not very memourable.
Overall the film is still good and the awesome camera work definitely prevents it from being forgettable

The mother and her diabetic daughter, who just moved into the upscale Manhattan townhouse don't know it is there - and haven't even installed the phone system yet! They are trapped, with time running out and the daughter quickly heading for diabetic shock. The invaders will do whatever it takes to get into the Panic Room, or to find a way to get the frightened pair to come out. Such is the concept of ""Panic Room"" - and it works very well, although somehow I left thinking it could have been even better considering the cast.It is reminiscent of home invasion movies from ""Wait Until Dark"" to ""Straw Dogs"" - although there is no giant bear trap in this one. The three invaders do try some original stuff with propane gas and switching identities. At one point the situation is reversed with the mother outside with the gun, and the invaders in the Panic Room with her daughter. It all works very well to a claustrophobic, tension-filled effect. Jodie Foster nicely underplays the mother, and Forest Whitaker reprises his well-known ""lovable bad guy"" act to effect. Jared Leto is good as the whiny ""brains"" of the gang, and Dwight Yoakum correctly psychotic as the homicidal sadistic villain. Kristen Stewart is adequate as the generic kid.One of the more effective aspects of this film is the direction that well uses the architecture of the house; its sterile, scary atmosphere is heightened by the fact that there is almost no furniture or decor, they having just moved in.

The performances are great, particularly from Jodie Foster as the lead, but it's the direction that stood out to me. Fincher really helped to make me feel the claustrophobia that the characters were feeling, and that really helped in keeping me invested throughout the entire runtime. The dark colour palette helped to build the tension, and despite me initially being worried that the premise wouldn't hold my interest for the entire film, I was really engaged throughout. The two lead characters are well developed and the film is just exciting to watch on the whole. As far as negatives go, the burglars aren't particularly interesting. I liked Forest Whittaker, but the other two felt way too over-the-top, and it took me out of the film at a couple of moments.

Two hours about being stuck in a room that is impenetrable, how much excitement could there be?  But figuring David Fincher is going to direct it, I thought he might be able to make something out of it.The movie had the usual Fincher touches from Fight Club, and there were a few scenes where I could feel my heart beating.  But I could not say the suspense held on long enough for it to be fully effective.  It was basically many short break-out/break-in attempts in between rest periods.  But the rest periods were not like a commercial break, since there were still a feeling of despair during those time.  Also, I guess the writers threw in the diabetic daughter so that it would not just be a sleep-through for the women trapped in the safe roomThere were more than once where I keep thinking why those men did or did not do such and such (like take out the cameras or make a story up about getting access to the safe), I shouldn't have to come to those thoughts, especially when there are three of them there with at least one that has a brain.  Even a thing or two that Jodie Foster's character did came into doubt in my mind. She could have bluffed about calling the police with a cell phone she had when they showed that they cut the phone line.It comes down to the weakness of the script.  Lack of events to allow the director to do his stuff.Still, a decent movie.",Panic Room

But I didn't like 'Panic Room' at all.This is a movie conveniently written, and worse, you feel it. I don't want to give anything away since they are many ""mini twists"", which is what thrillers tend to be. However, once you see the movie, and think back, you'll see what I mean. There's one example where the robbers say they should have thought of doing a particular thing earlier. And that's the fundamental problem -- there are many things done in this movie to sustain the story or add suspense. Bottom line: I suppose if you don't analyze it too much, it makes for a thriller. But for me, I just felt it was a burden to see it through to the absolutlely anticlimactic ending. 4/10.-Mark",Panic Room
187,bburns,"The worst yet from Fincher, and that's saying something.",4,9 July 2002,"David Fincher is the most overrated filmmaker of his generation.  The only stuff from him that I like are his videos for Aerosmith during their early-90's social realism period.  I remember when everyone was all breathless about ""Se7en"".  I rented the video & I thought it was a stupid rip-off of ""The Silence of the Lambs"", with lots of pretentious camera trickery.  Then there was all the deep conversations about ""Fight Club"".  I saw it & thought it was even dumber than ""Se7en"".  Now comes ""Panic Room"", supposedly Fincher's least pretentious film yet.  This is the (unintentionally) silliest thing I have seen since ""Deep Blue Sea"".The plot as such involves a single mother & her 12-year old daughter moving into a ""modest"" 4-story 80,000,000,000,000 square foot home with ""two bedrooms and one tiny bathroom"".  The tiny bathroom is bigger than my entire apartment.  And in the master bedroom, there's a panic room where they can lock themselves in if the house is burglarized.  Which it is.  On the very night they move in, no less.  And as if that weren't contrived enough, the burglars want in the panic room.  But wait there's more:  Mom's claustrophobic.  And the daughter's diabetic & needs insulin shots every few hours.And if the plot weren't bad enough, there's the dialogue:  One of the burglars smashes a mirror with a sledgehammer while trying to get into the panic room, and another calmly says ""That's seven years' bad luck.""  And when the daughter is trying to calm down, she recites the titles of Beatles albums, starting with ""Yesterday & Today"".  How would a 12-year-old know about that album?  It went out of print before she was born & has never been issued on CD.And for over two hours, there are shots of things being *just* out of Jodie Foster's reach (apparently, the character's mother took Thalidomyde), alternating with a bunch of hare-brained schemes to get into (or keep people out of) the panic room.  I stuck around for the end credits, half expecting to see the screenplay credited to Lucy Ricardo & Ethel Mertz.There are good points to this film: the visual palate is interesting, and the cast do well with the material they are given.I have nothing against directors who throw in every trick in the book.  I admire Quentin Tarantino, Alfred Hitchcock, Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, & Robert Rodriguez.  Unlike those other directors, however, David Fincher is bereft of any real sense of humor & expects everything he does to be taken ultra-seriously, not unlike Oliver Stone.  Stone, however, did a couple of honest-to-god masterpieces before going off the deep end into bizarre, over-stylized conspiracy theories.  Fincher has yet to make an even palatable film.  And the screenplay for this film begs for a director who doesn't take himself so seriously.  4 out of 10",Panic Room

There were far too many of these *too* stupid and inconsistent moments in the movie which made it very annoying. It was obvious that the director wanted to show off 5 or 6 different ""effects"" and decided not to let the plot get in the way.

193,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Panic Room,6,21 January 2016,"I consider this to be a pretty sub-par offering from Fincher. An unmemorable and dire hour and forty five minutes awaits whoever watches this film. A fair bit of my dislike of the film stems from the aesthetics of the movie – The CGI was pretty mediocre and distracting (such as from the not-really-tracking tracking shots as we are taken around the house, through walls and keyholes and such). Panic Room has that crappy indistinct and cloudy look that a lot of modern movies shot digitally have, despite the fact that the movie was filmed with Panavision Panaflex Platinum cameras. In his defence, Fincher made this in 2002 and a lot of modern movies haven't moved on from this look, whereas he clearly has if you look at his recent films. With a premise that harks back to the days of Hitchcock, Panic Room sees Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart locked in their home's safe room, as a gang of robbers search the house for valuables. Unfortunately, events during the course of the film become so far- fetched and unbelievable that your suspension of disbelief kind of commits suicide and you know longer care what's happening because it's so ridiculous and contrived. The script is a bit dumb, which makes it all the more strange that Fincher directed this. Best Scene: The opening credits were pretty cool. Apparently it was worked on for a whole year!",Panic Room

They end up with anything other than perfect, however, when they discover that three thugs are looking for something in the safest room in the house.This ""Panic Room"" is meant to keep any intruders out and keep everybody inside it safe.  However, throughout the movie, the thugs are able to endanger the lives of the house owners over and over again, which seems a little unrealistic, considering it took many years to develop that room.But the good plot, characters, and camera movements are enough to outweigh any flaws that Panic Room might have.  Certain events in the movie really piqued my interest, and I was excited to see what was going to happen next. What could be done to the panic room?  What could the mother and daughter do to evade it?Actually, what kept me going was the question:  ""What can they do with this movie?""  At first I was thinking not much could be done.  But a strange, semi-twisted plot caught me by surprise, and I was pretty impressed.The music is composed by Howard Shore.  I generally don't like him, especially with his work in The Two Towers, but in this movie his music is light and eerie.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's not screechy like horror movies.The most interesting part of Panic Room is the use of the cameras.  Just the way they move through floors, walls, or pan around in an eerie semicircle are extremely satisfying.  They really add to the movie.All in all, I was impressed with Panic Room.

Here's why.First of all the claustrophobic settings are used to little effect, apart from maybe the scenes where the burglars fill the panic room with gas, and the one with Altman trying to get out to fetch the medicine for her daughter. Then the reverse situation with Altman out and the burglars in is still not used to full effect.Then we have the slight irony of the security cameras. As the burglars break in, Altman and her daughter watch as the intruders move around their house. Not terribly sharp, but a nice touch nonetheless in this age of reality shows et all.Finally there seems to be a very faint touch of symbolism, with the money hidden in the bourgeois mansion inhabited by it's upper class denizens, the lower class burglars breaking in, the most humane of them almost making it, but then surrendering to the police. The final scene with the money flying in the air is nice.But despite Fincher's hints at what could be social commentary, this is mostly a generic action thriller, deplete with Hollywood-type slow motion scenes etc. It does show though Fincher's evolution as a director, using some fairly elaborate angles and shots.",Panic Room

You could feel for every character, you really were able to see each character as a person and not just as a figure. This is both the actors and directors accomplishments. The director said what he wanted the characters to be like and the actors took that and transformed the people on paper to people in real life. I was captivated by this in general because it gave that extra bit of tension to the film. I was more scared for each person than I would've been if they just acted fake. The other thing that I noticed and appreciated was the story line. It's common to see films with different settings, different motives, and different characters being put together and having the film called creative, but this film was actually creative. They took one location and used every bit of that location to the fullest. They also didn't have any character that was basic. Everything that was done in the movie was mostly original which gave the film that extra umph the movie needed.CONS: The ending felt a little too concise for my liking.

201,darkjosh,"Suspenseful, But Nowhere Near Fincher's Previous Work",7,11 April 2002,"After delving into a different dimension with Fight Club, David Fincher has returned to the genre that helped realize his brilliance.  Panic Room brings Fincher back into the suspense game, directing Jodie Foster in a thriller that finds her forced to retreat into the room of said title.David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) scripts this potboiler about a recently divorced mother (Foster) and her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart) move into a New York home whose previous owner had a panic room built in; basically it's a room surrounded by steel and filled with surveillance monitors, medical kits, and water to last for days.  It's a good thing, too, since on their first night, three burglars (played well by Whitaker, Leto, and Yoakam) break in, attempting to find a fortune that's been hidden in, of course, the room.Foster is used to playing strong women roles, but she's never come off as being more resourceful as in Panic Room.  She makes her character seem like less a victim than a force to be reckoned with, and instead ably matches her captors.  Whitaker, Leto, and Yoakam all play their parts convincingly as the intelligent, strategic, and violent burglars, respectively.  The only role that comes off as a plot device is the daughter, who seems to be there not as a character but more a hinderance to the film's heroine.Fincher is a master of suspense, and there are droves of it as Foster smartly and able participates in a game of cat-and-mouse with the thieves. She comes up with clever and effective ways of dealing with them, which I won't reveal here.  Suffice to say there are many moments when the audience is riveted to the screen and also never feels as if the movie is becoming an implausible eye-roller.  Panic Room isn't near Fincher's other work, but still is a tense, above average thriller.  7 out of 10",Panic Room
202,boondocksaint20,"Panic room is a really good film, but it could have been great",8,4 April 2002,"*Spoilers Ahead (mostly minor)*I just went to see Panic Room, and I have mixed feelings about it.  The trailer definitely caught my attention as something unique, and though only in one location, I knew that David Fincher, director of Fight Club and The Game would deliver.  The good news is, on most levels, he does.First off is his incredible use of direction.  I have never seen such fancy camera work in a film; the camera will squeak through tiny openings and snake around from one room of the house to another within a single shot. Definitely impressive, and definitely eye candy.  Then we find Jodie Foster and her Daughter, both played very believably forced to seek refuge in the house's panic room when a trio of criminals show up.  I thought that the criminals were the most interesting aspect of the film, though a tad underdeveloped and way cliched (The type of people you might know in real life that would actually be willing to rob a house, yet exagerated in an over the top kinda way).  There were just too many times where they would do things that people in real life would never do.  One of which is at the beginning when one of the three criminals, after establishing to the audience that they have had no prior past together until now, asks for Dwight Yoakam's handgun (the only one who brought one) and he nonchalantly hands it to him.  Why would a professional hand over his gun to someone he doesn't know, let alone an obvious amateur?  Yes, scenes like this really are irrelevant to the story, yet will bother the best of us to no end when we see them.  Still, the criminals are played very well.  Forest Whitaker was superb as Burnham, the conscientious safe cracker with a heart, and Dwight Yoakam was fantastic, as always, as the cold and mostly calm Raoul, a mysterious member of the trio whose screen presence expresses his adherence to violence and mayhem more than the limited dialogue he has at the beginning.  Definitely the most interesting of the three.  Jared Leto was good as Junior, yet his character got annoying very quickly (especially since he demanded that he be in charge and ended up making a complete idiot of himself on many occasions in the film).  The suspense is there, not necessarily enough to make you scared, but enough to hold your attention.  The ending though is very predictable and rather empty, in my opinion.  I feel there could have been more to the ending, something profound to stick with you as you leave the theater (I was also hoping the exact opposite would have happened to Burnham that did.  He did have a good side, you know).  Overall, I enjoyed this film, it was good for what it was, but it could have been great.  This is one of those films that doesn't receive a 9 or 10 for a bad script or bad acting since both were good, but because there is potential for so much more that just isn't there. A solid 8 for amazing camera work, great acting and for overall entertainment value.  Go see it, you'll enjoy.",Panic Room
203,MadBadMovieman,Home Invasion Roller-coaster!,10,30 March 2002,"What an Exciting Movie.  A real home invasion roller-coaster. Jodie Foster was Great. Kristen Stewart may get nominated for supporting actress. Good interaction with Jodie. Forest Whitaker was perfect. Dwight Yoakam was downright Evil.  He was good in Sling Blade but this was a much more sinister role.  He character slowly emerged and you liked him less & less. One scene was very reminiscent of Jack in ""The Shining"".  You'll see.  Dwight may get nominated too but they have to get over disliking his character.The twists and turns were very well scripted and directed.  Amazing how things change. The Cinematography should get nominated.  Screen play was great. Special effects may get nominated too.  Not one thing todis-like about this movie except it's hard to grasp home invasion incidents. The best laid plans- don't always work do they.I am amazed there are no votes out on this movie yet.  Worth seeing but please don't bring children.

204,parhat,It would have been easier if the thieves just rent the place,3,4 May 2007,"The entire movie falls to pieces when you suddenly realize that if the thieves rent the place to get the three million dollars, it would be a lot less messier, no ""thirty years in jail"" and a happy ending. But no, they had to complicate matters. Just the fact that they entered the house is enough to scare the people living there would be more than enough to get a vacant building. In any movie, I think the most important element in a story, is not really the plot, as what Aristotle thinks! It is the premise of the story being more important than the plot. Then we have all these movie producers reading up on interesting plots and catchy titles. Yes ""must see movie"" does grab you, but premise, and then as the story unfolds, it is the suspense that keep people watching. The plots are just the mechanics of holding the suspense minute by minute. The premise of the logic of the whole thing that makes a story believable enough to draw our interest throughout the story. It is true Panic Room has some of the finest actors, including Forest Whitaker, Jodie Foster, but if the premise doesn't hold, the story feels a bit off like a comedy.

Despite some holes which are listed by other reviewers, the plot is not so bad. Yes, the events unfold in quite a predictable way but the movie is still very engaging with its fast tempo and suspense that never lets go. On the negative side, the ending turns out a bit cheesy with too much effort to redeem the character acted by F. Whitaker. One interesting observation is that with good acting and captivating storytelling, the plot holes become less noticeable. After all, engaged audience care more about entertainment than analyzing each and every incident with a fine comb. To sum up, this is a very enjoyable movie with its fast pace, unrelenting suspense and lack of fluff.",Panic Room

207,RolloTomasi,Claustrophobic?,7,31 March 2002,"""Panic Room"" is a pretty good thriller, but disappointing as a David Fincher film. Any number of directors could have done this. I can't say that about Fincher's previous three films, which all seemed to need the dark and innovative visual style he brought to them. His latest has moments with the feel of a Fincher film, as if another director tried his hand at a Fincher film. But even sub-par work by Fincher is better than almost anything else out there. First-time DP Conrad W. Hall (Conrad L's son) shares cinematography credit with Fincher regular Darius Khondji, which might have been the difference.What makes ""Panic Room"" tick is the script by David Koepp. This is an example of a film that survives on its premise, in the way it makes use of its location and the situations that location puts the characters in. The script falls short, however, on characters. Meg (Jodie Foster) has feelings and a past life, seemingly, but never takes on more than your basic celluloid heroin/everywoman persona. Let's just say that Koepp tries hard with her, but doesn't succeed. The film should be her story but the film's construction doesn't allow it. For instance when she enters the panic room for the first time and is closed in, we find out that she has a phobia about small spaces (go figure). She's able to overcome that in order to battle her home's invaders-the only development her character gets. In a way, Burnham (Forest Whitaker), is the focus of this story. He's the one who has to make the tough choices, to do the thinking, to do the most changing. Whitaker's is also the finest performance in this. Not surprising. Even that cop who presses Meg to ""give him a signal"" seemed to contain more depth than Meg.
""Panic Room"" has one of those great premises that begs to be utilized to its fullest. Koepp and Fincher go a long way toward succeeding. There was a great risk of having to rely too much on coincidence, but the script is cunning enough to get by this. Anyone who's seen the trailer (the known world, surely) knows that a woman and her daughter lock themselves into their new home's panic room' when some violent men break in, only to find that all these men came for is IN THERE. Making the panic room both the womens' safe haven AND the reason the burglars are there could make some kind of best movie ideas of all time' list. Wisely, the film's creators know enough to just let this be what kicks things off.
Fincher and co. don't go in a direction that I thought they would, which probably just means they're smarter than I am: Eventually we know Meg and Sarah are going to have to leave the panic room. When they do, I thought the idea would be to give a heightened sense of their vulnerability-but turn the tables. The invaders finally get them out, only to find they wish they had not when the girls fight back. The film does play this card to a certain extent, but you never get a sense that over the course of the story, the panic room has begun to protect the invaders, not the tenants. What we end up seeing is your standard, overly violent, bloody, couldn't-think-of-something-better thriller ending.The major downfall of ""Panic Room"" is that it's not scary. There's a lot of nice cinematic tension, but no 'jolts' to make you clutch the elbow rest. But then, this is not horror. If you want scary, rent ""Se7en.""

Unfortunately there are some annoying and very obvious errors that shouldn't be there. They put this film down a bit.Meg Altman, a newly divorced, moves into her new flat with her daughter Sarah. On their first night they get some uninvited guests and seek refuge in the ""panic room"", a bunker inside the house. Unfortunately what the thieves are looking for is inside the panic room as well.Panic Room has an original story with lot of potential. Unfortunately the characters don't live up to the story and there are some obvious holes and errors that pulls this whole movie down. The story, however, is well told and thrilling from beginning till end witch helps a lot, but David Koepp should have done some more work with the script.The cinematography and editing, however, is excellent. There are some nice long takes and beautiful moves. The composition of the shots, lightning and over all look and feel of the movie is good. The cinematographers does a good job in capturing the mood of the film and the feelings of characters. Jodie Foster delivers as Meg Altman and Kristen Stewart's kind of tomboy style works good as Sarah. The rest of the cast delivers a adequate performance, but still good enough. Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto and Forest Whitaker makes a good cast for the thieves, but I didn't think Patrick Bauchau did too good as Stephen Altman. In my opinion the wrong man for the character.You don't really notice the score. It's just laying there, building up the mood and excitement. It's really not given that much focus, but it's a good classic score by Howard Shore.Panic Room is a good movie, by all means. I can recommend it because of good cinematography and an original story.

The guys that break into the house are more slapstick than they are sinister. Their various attempts at getting at the two main characters is lame at best and doesn't make for exciting viewing.However the final third of the film builds up to a decent climax and has enough thrills and spills to satisfy.

Panic Room is directed by David Fincher (Seven and Fight Club) and stars two great actors who are capable directors in their own right (Jodie Foster and Forrest Whittaker). Because of this my expectations were fairly high, perhaps unreasonably so.Jodie Foster plays a wealthy divorcee with a teenage daughter. As they are looking at a house they are considering buying in New York, they discover that the house has a unique feature-a hidden room surrounded in concrete and steel. The room comes complete with sophisticated surveillance equipment, a direct phone line and a variety of supplies designed to facilitate survival in the case of a siege.What they don't know is that the house has another secret, a hidden treasure worth millions of bonds. The person who does know this enlists the aid of two henchmen to help him find the hidden treasure. They think they are entering a vacant house. When they discover otherwise, the complications unfold-enter the panic room.One of the henchmen (Forrest Whittaker) has spent the last 12 years installing safe rooms for wealthy people. He knows the ins and outs, and he knows that the treasure they want is locked in the panic room with the two rightful inhabitants of the house.This is an intriguing premise with some interesting symbolism. The safe room that keeps the bad guys out soon becomes a prison that keeps the good guys in. A similar premise was developed in the film The Last Castle when Robert Redford compares castles and prisons. Same basic design, it's just that one is designed to keep people out, the other designed to keep people in.The film has some excellent cinematography and some great editing. Jodie Foster and Forrest Whittaker turn in great performances as would be expected. Kristen Stewart does an excellent job as the teenage daughter. The other characters are, unfortunately, cartoon cutouts. So much so that at points the film looks a bit too much like Home Alone.Don't get me wrong. The film is suspenseful and has some outstanding elements. Jodie Foster continues to be one of the top actors working today and her performance here is compelling.

This one is good too incase someone misunderstood.One of the things i really like about Fincher is his originality and his creativity, and his untradiontal methods, for example in this movie we got a very different camera work from what has been seen before, which is nice at some points, it doesn't forefill it's purpose at all times, but it's a good idea with a ""free"" camera and it does work quite well most of the time.

221,johanleupen,Not altogether unsatisfying but ultimately unremarkable and forgettable.,7,23 April 2002,"Panic Room comes from director Fincher whose body of work up until now can be characterized as refreshing and unconventional, even if not all of his efforts have been succesful. It is therefor surprising to see him turn out something that is relatively run-of-the-mill and unremarkable. Panic Room relies on the premise of a mother (Foster) and her child finding themselves trapped in their own house by criminals, having to retreat into a so-called panic room, their only safe haven. In this sense at least it fits into the paranoia-realm that Fincher made his own. Panic Room doesn't suffer from any obvious flaws. Stilistically, the film bears the Fincher-trademark: the sets are dark and gritty, a lot of attention has been spend on detail (especially on the dimly lit panic room itself). Also, the opening-credits sequence deserves special mention. Furthermore, Panic Room features many acrobatic camera-movement as previously seen in Fight Club, although i have to say i sometimes found it too distracting from the narrative. Whitaker is unremarkable as on of the criminals suffering from a morality-attack in the middle of his operation, his acting-range is basically reduced to looking really sad and troubled. Few can be said concerning Foster's acting: it is solid but lacks depth. This is probably not her fault as her role is underwritten; we constantly see her heavy-breathing with eyes bulging out of their sockets but there is relatively little dialogue for her to excell at and there is little complexity to her character. Twists are few and none of it made much of an impression on me. Panic Room is violent but not earthshocking in any way (as we have come to expect from Fincher, eventhough it may not be fair to compare this to his other work). The problem with Panic Room lies in it's subject matter or lack thereof. One of the strengths of Fight Club was it's tendency to cover a lot of ground, tying together many loose ends that didn't seem to add up. The same holds true for The Game, which is extremely cleverly constructed in retrospect. In Panic Room storytelling is chronological, restricted to one space and one (all-seeing) perspective, all of these restrictions add up to a film that isn't altogether unsatisfying but ultimately unremarkable and forgettable.",Panic Room

It's no surprise, then, that ""Panic Room"" doesn't disappoint, but it hardly ranks with their best efforts to date.  As in ""Fight Club"", Fincher's wall-dissolving camera tricks are pretty impressive.  But they actually work against the tension in this story by placing the audience beyond the claustrophobic reality of the house.  Similarly, Koepp's story premise and dialogue are good enough to keep you watching, but his plot offers few real surprises.  Ultimately, it's the performances which save the day.

227,Jona1988,David Fincher creates a greatly suspenseful if straightforward thriller,7,18 September 2010,"David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, apart from Alien 3 all of his films I've seen hold real high quality. It took several year after it was released until I finally saw Panic Room. I tried to see it with an opened mind since I knew the reviews had been mixed. Mostly I found it an entertaining movie. It has its flaws and its not up to the standard of Fincher's Se7en or Fight club. The script is the big flaw, the story is pretty thin and simple. It just starts and you don't really get much of an background, I guess it not really necessary but even later the story is weak in giving any explanation to some of the events. A couple of thinks I feel doesn't make complete sense, maybe some plot holes but it doesn't bother me. However the script also lack in the description of the characters but the film is saved in that department thanks to the always great Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, its also fun to see the young Kristen Stewart who is also really good. The bad guys feel weak, not frightening. Forest Whitaker manages to give his character a bit of substance but the others are just blank. However the film still succeeds in delivering an positive experience thank to other aspects. Fincher is great at creating suspense and that is what lifts this. The dark tone works really well and certain parts takes one to the edge of the seat. The action is well considered to not take away the suspense, and also very nice-looking, unrealistic at one time but not a problem. I get the feeling that it was intentionally that not much focus was put one the plot. One gets a bit of B-movie vibe and thats not bad its nice sometimes to see a thriller that doesn't mess with your head other than with tension keep you somewhat on the edge. Style over substance. Eventough this doesn't play in the same league as some of the other films by David Fincher, Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker I don't feel disappointed. Its a simple, thrilling entertainment nothing more and nothing less. Actually I can think that it's very good what the crew has succeeded in making of the, not bad but simple material. It is a good entertaining watch, the mixed and some quite negative reviews that I've read get me the feeling that the film has been judged by high expectations and not from what it turned out to be. I figure thats often the case that one views it from what it could or maybe should have been. I myself is also often guilty of being affected of such anticipations. But I liked Panic Room, my grade ends up at 7 out of 10.",Panic Room

229,videofreak2002,An edge-of-your-seat thriller!,10,6 April 2002,"""Panic Room,"" directed by David Fincher (""Alien 3,"" ""Se7en,"" ""The Game,"" and ""Fight Club""), works on so many levels that I don't know what to say. 
The story: Meg Altman (played by Jodie Foster), is a divorced mother looking for a new life with her daughter, Sarah (played by Kristen Stewart).  They go to a new house and discover something they couldn't believe.  A safe room-""The Panic Room""-that will protect them from any kind of robbery and explosions and all kinds of things.  On the night they move in,  three burglars, Burnham (played by Forest Whitaker), Junior (played by Jared Leto), and Raoul (played by Dwight Yokham), break in and look throughout the house and discover that there are people in the house, but, there were supposed to be nobody in the house.  Then, Meg wakes up and hears noises downstairs and wakes up Sarah and run to the panic room.  The only problem is that whatever the burglars want is in that room that Meg and Sarah are in.  So, they have to think of ideas of getting them out and not kill them and try to break through the room.  My thought for this movie.  Leave the house and go see this movie.  The cast were excellent, including Jodie Foster's performance.  The best performance out of the burglars was Dwight Yokham.  His performance was a mean person. He was cool.  The script (written by ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park,"" ""Mission: Impossible,"" and ""Snake Eyes's"" David Koepp), was excellent.  What I was most interested by this movie were Howard Shore's music and David Fincher's directing.  Howard's music really made the audience on the edge-of-their-seats (his best since his oscar win for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"").  But, David's directing steals it.  His camera work will take you through places and things that no other director can do. In this one scene, when Meg falls asleep, the camera goes backwards, through the bars of the stairs, climbs down, then comes the burglars, then the camera goes through the lock from the door then comes back and all through the house following the burglars without going to a different scene.  It was just brilliant.  Plus, this movie made me jump a few times (that's scary, and that's a good movie for me) and made my heart jump several times through some realistic and unbelievable scenes.  This is also Fincher's best work since ""Se7en"" (probably his best work right now). This movie is a keeper.  One of the best movies of 2002, along with ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Blade 2.""  Also, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker (""8MM,"" ""Se7en,"" and ""Sleepy Hollow""), makes a cameo appearance as the neighbor Meg and Sarah awake from across the building. If you like thrills and David Fincher's work, THEN GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! TRUST ME!  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!

230,watto124,"Beautiful, thrilling, and a joy to watch.",10,7 April 2002,"David Fincher's ""Panic Room"" does everything right. Writing is excellent. The people seem to say things that would be natural in a situation like the on presented in the movie. Acting is pitch-perfect. Jodie Foster is fantastic. Kristen Stewart is a child actor that rivals Haley Joel Osment. And the thee crooks, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam give memorable and fascinating portrayals of their complicated characters. Another extreme pro of ""Panic Room"" is the cinematography. From the opening credits to the end of the movie, each frame has its own unique, ""artsy-craftsy"" persona that can be sometimes subtle, or fantastic with computer animation. Fincher is a director I have admired for a long time and each of his movies are astounding both in material an visuals. Howard Shore's music sets the tone of the movie right. Another thing I loved about ""Panic Room"" is that although the robbers can be humourous, you still don't like them. Other movies have tried to make villains funny and gross at the same time and it ends up being excrement (John Travolta in ""Broken Arrow"", for one). It somehow worked here, something I thought would never happen in movies. ""Fight Club"" wasn't terrible, but making ""Panic Room"" has assured me that Fincher hasn't succumbed to the Dark Side. This one is on par with his other works- ""The Game"", ""Se7en"", and ""Alien3"". ""Panic Room"" is a colossal experience. See it. 10/10",Panic Room
231,akon5,no matter,7,18 October 2002,"Spoilers.no matter how great the directing is, if the film has a bad script, there is nothing one can do to save it. The 'baddies' in the movie are similar to the guys in 'Home Alone'; just plain stupid. When Jodie was smashing all the cameras and one of the guy said, ""now why didn't we think of that"" gives big indication of bad script writing. But considering the person that did the script also am responsible for Jarassic Park, I guess it is expected. David's direction is not bad, he attempted to bring in a few interesting shots and camera angles, but the 'computer generated' effect is alittle too obvious. If we are to talk about suspense and tension build ups, it is still a long way from the standards of Hitchcock.",Panic Room

233,thomasmitilis1995,GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!,6,18 April 2020,"PROS:The film is a suspenseful and entertaining thriller, a cat and mouse game. Jodie Foster gives a solid performance as the separated mother whose her first and only priority is the protection of her daughter and the chemistry with young Kristen Stuart is impressive. From the side of villains, Forest Whitaker is the one with a more common sense and his motives are comprehensible. The product design is fantastic and the camera movements specify beautifully the geography of the house, slipping from room to room. David Fincher manages to give the viewer an outstanding visual experience.
CONS:Jared Leto is obnoxious and overacts his role for no reason (also the conrows don't help). The villains generally make dumb desicions and the movie suffers from plot conveniences like when one villain is beaten with a hammer in the face but five minutes later is fine, the fact that 911 puts mother on hold, the nonexistence of negotiation about the money or the anxiety-related issue of the mother isn't used later in the story.",Panic Room

There are also some clumsily handled contrivances to be dealt with, and a camera with attention deficit disorder. Maybe director David Fincher was trying to make up for the fact that the action takes place in a restricted space, or maybe he had some visual tics left over from Fight Club.

All seems well at first. The house is enormous and beautiful, and the main attraction is the ""Panic Room"", a room hidden in Jodie's bedroom. Layered into the wall with thick concrete and steel, there's no way into the Panic Room once the metal door has swung shut.And how convenient that Panic Room proves to be when three men invade their house on their first night moving in. Foster and Stewart lock themselves away in the room, without a phone connection and without any means of help.

Fincher did pretty good with a bad script, but that is where he failed.  A good director is supposed fix a bad script, plug the holes, smooth over the rough spots; this he did not do.  Even if all the implausibles were removed (which could have been done), the story gives us nothing to cheer about.  We don't connect emotionally with the characters. That was also true in Fight Club, but it didn't matter because the characters there were quirky and interesting, not so in Panic Room.  I also dislike films that are darkly lit all the way through.  And in this case, fairly monochromatic.  Pure blue flame?  It looked like CG electricity. Have the guts to shoot in black and white if you want that effect.I must say, Forest Whitaker is the perfect good badguy.  Thanks for casting Ann Magnuson.  She deserves bigger and better roles.Oh well, even a good director is bound to have a misfire or two.  Fincher is lucky.  This one will make money.",Panic Room
242,ShinKyo81,David Fincher should include in the DVD Extras the real ending!!!,6,15 April 2002,"It's quite difficult to believe ""Panic Room"" as a creation of one of the most astonishing directors from nowadays: David Fincher. His path along the film industry has been followed by many newborn directors, trying to copy the style of Fincher's creations, like ""Se7en"" or ""Fight Club"". But David Fincher didn't exactly start from nothing. He begun working at the special effects crew in productions like ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Never Ending Story"" and ""The Temple of Doom"", in the ILM. Then, in 1992, he directed his first well-known film: ""Alien3"".Three years later, it started the ""Fincher's fest"": in 1995, ""Se7en"" came out from his imagination and became one of the best movies of the 90's. In 1997, ""The Game"", not as good as the 1995 production, but still on the Fincher's track. And two years later, the outstanding and incredible ""Fight Club"", who broke all the models in the film industry creating a new way of modern criticism. And here comes ""Panic Room"", starring a brilliant-as-always Jodie Foster and the typical creepy atmosphere of ""The Game"". Two things really original in the film: the starting credits (very original) and the camera movements, typical in Fincher's films: he will put the camera through the keyhole, the coffee pot handle or the wall, wherever he wants. A worth look. You should consider that this film is NOT like the other Fincher's creation. First, IT HAS NO TWIST ENDING AT ALL. If you're expecting some twist like the ""Fight Club"" one, you'll be extremely disappointed (like me for example). You should understand this movie like a new one, not like a following of the style of the other movies. Anyway, you wouldn't have had energy for a twist in the plot, because ""Panic Room"" really scares the crap out you! It keeps you at the edge of the seat during the 2 hours! It's true! Probably the most frightening movie from the last years. Maybe ""Panic Room"" could be compared to ""Home Alone"" but for adults, maybe the ending is quite predictable and poor (hey, think about ""Planet of the Apes"" for a bad ending), but it's a brilliant thriller with a creepy atmosphere, a lot of style, and created by David Fincher.

I bet you'll never guess who that masked man is  (nobody tell). I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this film because how much panic or thrill could occur in a movie about a room. But I was pleasantly surprised once the film got going (the beginning they are buying and adjusting to their new home) on a non-stop roller coaster ride of suspense right to the end. There is one scene in the film that goes to slow motion with no sound and I found myself suddenly panicking along with the characters on film. The director does an excellent job to show every aspect of the house and the confrontation between victims and perpetrators. My one beef about the film is with the ending which I feel was left totally open for viewer interpretation. I like closure and this had none. Anybody who saw this film and can explain to me the ending, please message me privately, do not write it here to ruin for other people.

She moves into a huge brownstone townhouse in Manhattan with her teenaged daughter Sarah, wonderfully played by a very young Kristen Stewart. Their new residence has 3 floors, an elevator, 8 bedrooms, 6 working fireplaces, and a 'Panic Room"" which is an impenetrable reinforced cement and steel encased safe-room, which has 8 recordable video monitors which are connected to 16 surveillance cameras, a separate buried phone line, and a motorized sliding reinforced steel door that is secured by solid core dead bolts and a motion sensitive closing system. That evening while Meg and Sarah are sleeping upstairs, a trio of intruders enter the residence thinking rest it is still empty, Meg who gets up to go to the bathroom, and then walks into the panic room which is located in her bedroom to turn off the lights in it, and notices the intruders downstairs in the living room on the surveillance monitor, Meg runs to Sarah's room upstairs to get her as the intruders chase her, they both manage to get back downstairs and into the panic room locking themselves in. An intense cat and mouse game of wills ensues as Meg desperately tries to find a way to summon help. The trio of intruders are terrifically played by Forest Whitaker as Bumham, the security technician who built the panic room, Jared Leto a Junior the manic leader of the group, and country singer Dwight Yoakum as Raoul, the nearly-silent murderous sociopath with the itchy trigger finger. Masterful direction by Fincher, with extraordinary cinematography by the late great Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji which truly breathtaking, razor-sharp editing by James Haywood and Angus Wal, and an effective score by Howard Shore.

I hear he's a heck of guy, and really swell at parties but this was weak. And how did anyone give David Koepp $4 mil for this piece of garbage. I've seen this movie at least a million times and usually on TV for free!!! Don't studio execs watch movies these days.First of all, I want to know where the audiences were that were on the edge of their seats - because that theater needs bigger chairs. The audience I saw this stinker with didn't make a peep the whole time except for the occasional groan. Forget that the film was boring. Forget that the biggest drama in the whole movie wasn't about whether anyone was going to get in or out of the panic room - but rather whether a young girl is going to get her insulin shot - talk about a cheap plot twist - and the ridiculous sub B-movie twitching that she was order to do - (when someone is slipping into a coma they don't flop around like someone in a low rent sci-fi flick) - what the H was the deal with that ending!!!SPOILER ****Am I really supposed to believe that a skinny little dude like Dwight Yokum - almost has his hand severed in the door - loses about a pint of blood - then gets hit in the head with a sledgehammer at full force - falls down a flight of stairs and can still get up and kick Jodi Foster's ass - even though she hasn't been hurt in the entire film - (everyone else gets beat up but not her) - Jeez - that's straight out of Jim Bob Briggs-land. And as far as the twist that Forrest Whittaker comes back and saves the day - well it might have a little punch if it wasn't so telegraphed in the moments before he entered the room. I mean I've seen it before - but did Fincher really have to show him turning his head to hear the noise inside and then hesitate on the fence!!!!! Lame - lame - lame!!!People (and I include myself here) we are never going to get decent films if we keep accepting garbage like this and then defending it because we're told it comes with a pedigree. This is the same movie we've seen for years. Whether it's a thriller or a slasher film (and they are really becoming the same thing at this point) we keep getting B-grade drivel.

Forest Whitaker is a great actor too. I cannot believe both of them appear here! I would give no stars to this movie, but these 2 great actors make me save their performance.Producers made a big mistake with the casting. Probably they spent all the money paying Jodie and Forest, so they put only garbage actors to complete the group. This is not unusual. The masked criminal does not look menacing without his mask at all. And the little girl is cute and a good actress but she seems a boy. In fact, when I watched the trailer I thought it was a boy! She not only seems a boy because of her haircut but because she has boys manners!***spoilers ahead***The storyline is stupid from the very first minute. Anyway the movie was good at first specially because the camera amazing movements and CGI. After the bad guys break into the house everything is very predictable, full of plot holes and it goes only to show the characters stupidity:1- Why do they get a house so big while they are only 2 small people? This house is for about 5 people! Without live-in help it is impossible to have that house clean!2- There are lots of noises when the guys first talk takes place, they even shout (in lower voice), Meg cannot sleep, she is wide awake but she does not hear ANYTHING.3- Why the guys do not leave the girls alone trapped inside the elevator if what they want is in the panic room?4- The 911 never put you on hold, and if so, I might think they are able to track your call and send an unit.5- The fire thing is no real. Gas does not remain in the ceiling and also the carafe outside should have exploited burning the 3 criminals and the explosion should be noisy enough to alert neighbors.6- It is incredible that both mom and daughter do not wonder what the criminals want from the room and try to negotiate.7- At first it is impossible to talk from outside to inside, but later it is! Sounds strange that the big guy who built the room does not know about the intercom and this new owner does.8- At the end, it is stupid that Burnham comes back to the house because he hears a shout, the police sirens were sounded nearby already. Also it is stupid that Burnham let the bank bonds go with the wind, because he could have raised his hands keeping the papers in his jacket.I will not continue with plot holes because it would be endless, but I have to say that I am tired of ""Terminator skills"" at the end of all thrillers. How can I guy survive while he has a hand damaged, he is hammered on the head and he fell one floor down? He still has a supernatural strength to fight 3 people! As I said all the movie is predictable from the start to the end. If you watch this movie with someone else I suggest a guessing game and probably you will guess everything! For example, what do you think a neighbor will do if someone in front is bothering him with flashing lights? I understand the Morse code idea, but face it... only a few among regular people get it.Another thing, the finale is tasteless...

251,masonmorgan-92917,"A perfect thriller, but not much else",7,22 November 2016,"David Fincher is one of the most talented modern directors around and one of his earlier films, Panic Room, doesn't really get the attention that it deserves.Panic Room is the perfect definition of a ""thriller"". It is exceptionally intense and packs many unexpected twists, all beautifully shot and decently acted. But Panic Room never tries to be anything more than just a thriller, which is good because it wouldn't even be half as good if it tried otherwise.Panic Room is light on characterization, but that's not to say the acting isn't good. Jodie Foster's stern, yet caring, mother character and Kristen Stewart's sassy pre-teen share a strong on-screen chemistry. The same can be said for the three rather unprofessional robbers. All the characters in the film are well formed and acted but they don't seem to have much background as the film doesn't really think we need to know. It is hard to say that the characters were paper-thin though, because I feel that too much elaboration and heavy backstory on our characters would feel unnecessary. Despite knowing very little about them, I still cared about our two main characters and wanted to see them escape unharmed.Now as I said before, Panic Room is a perfect thriller and ranks among the best I've seen in the genre. The suspense and gut-wrenching tension is constant as we are thrust into the scenario right at the very start, only to be constantly jerked around as the story twists and the cat-and- mouse roles flip. And boy was it fun. Panic Room had me hooked in from the very beginning and I was hooked throughout the entire run time. There are no dull moments and no downtime or filler. Every scene felt meticulously crafted due to Fincher's respectable attention to detail. Panic Room is really edge-of-your-seat stuff filled with many unpredictable twists and interesting plot developments. Many of the film's best moments are when Fincher throws us into a scenario where we are totally uncomfortable and makes us feel like we are the characters that are actually trapped in this situation. Panic Room was a ton of fun to watch and is probably one of the best thrillers I have ever seen, due to the simple fact that it is 100% thrills.Now I did enjoy Panic Room very much but there is still a glaring issue that stops me from rating this film any higher (which I really want to do). The issue isn't the few dumb plot mistakes, which admittedly are pretty bad at some points (911 operator putting a panicked caller on hold). The issue is that Panic Room is ultimately forgettable and doesn't really leave an impression afterwards. As much fun that I had watching it the first time, I couldn't help but feel somewhat unsatisfied at the end. While the majority of this feeling probably came from the mediocre ending, I still knew at the time that I would probably forget a lot of the movie only shortly after seeing it. It's hard for me to put a finger on exactly why this is, but part of me thinks that it has to do with how intense and fast-paced Panic Room is. The story moves so viciously quick that all of it kind of morphs together into one big tension-fueled blur. This is only after the fact though. While watching Panic Room, I had an absolute blast and I enjoyed every minute of it.Panic Room is certainly David Fincher's most underrated film and it honestly deserves more credit for what it accomplished. It is the most consistently thrilling thriller I have ever seen and it is also beautifully shot and well acted. While the ending definitely could've been better and the whole experience may seem forgettable, watching Panic Room for the first time is an absolute roller coaster ride.

252,nmp381,Good but seriously flawed,7,11 May 2002,"Panic Room had an interesting premise. A family consisting of a mother and daughter, have their home gangbusted by a group of thieves and hide in a room built to keep out any intruders from coming in. It had some suspense but at times dragged on. The acting was so-so, Foster was ok but has done much better work (Silence of the Lambs). The 3 thieves were bordering on comedic. Very bad acting. The ending also fizzled off too quickly. Overall a decent thriller with some good cinematography and suspense but nothing great.",Panic Room
253,FunnyMann,"Not bad, not great",7,10 November 2002,"Wow. The spectrum of comments this film elicits should give you a clue that you're going to have to decide for yourself. To address some of those comments:For hard-core David Fincher fans -- Yes, it's probably his worst work. I blame the script, and I'm not sure why it interested him to begin with. But if you do ""Se7en,"" ""The Game,"" and ""Fight Club,"" eventually you will come up against a script that, while interesting, does not lend itself to visual exploitation. And here it is.For hard-core action fans -- The whole thing takes place in a house. What did you expect, Lethal Weapon? Sometimes, action intensifies BECAUSE it takes place in cramped quarters. If you don't dig that, fine. But this film never promised anything else.For the idiot who sees this film as a racist rape warning (I can't be bothered listing his name) -- If you're looking at a white guy in cornrows as proof as racism, you really need to finish graduate school and get out into the real world. Even Freud conceded that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. If there were no black characters, you would have bitched about that. In fact, the black guy comes off as perhaps the most humane character in the film, in terms of what he sacrifices to make things right. Keep voting Democrat, but dude, get off your high horse. You're way off base.So, beyond that, it's still a fun film worth watching. I figured it would be better. It wasn't, but that doesn't mean it's not good. It is. So enjoy it.",Panic Room

255,arichmondfwc,Circus Performance,1,29 December 2004,"David Fincher is a magician of sorts, he should work in a circus. He does things with his gadgets that are quite extraordinary, but, has absolutely no clue about drama. Based on a tiny, thin, invisible script he builds a theme park ride that gets very tired very soon. All of David Fincher's films look terrific, they all have ambitious intentions but they collapse under the poverty of the scripts. ""Seven"" is the better one, but still, after you get over the magnificent photography, you're left with a formula used and abused for years. ""Fight Club"" has a first hour that makes you think in you're in for a real treat. With superb performances by Norton, Pitt and Bonham Carter and then a massive let down. ""The Game"" was mystical, powerful, mysterious and spine chilling for the whole first part but then... They all have that same common denominator, opportunistic, thoughtless and unimaginative writing. That alone alienates the bulk of their potential audiences. Now ""Panic Room"" the most blatant example of what I'm trying to convey. No matter how brilliant the camera work, where are the characters? Where is the drama? What was with the husband? What about that semi visit by the police? Unforgivable. I should advice Mr. Fincher to look at films with less gadgetry, even less ambition and take note. From William Wyler's ""Desperate Hours"" to David Miller's ""Midnight Lace"" or quite simply look at the sort of writers Alfred Hitchcock worked with, without them Mr. Hitchcock would have been a director of the past not the legendary master for all seasons.",Panic Room

BUT STILL, a couple garish visual and plotting cliches and a few major logic faults in the final ten minutes hold this one back from the seamless excellence of Fincher's benchmark tour de force, Fight Club. maybe not a rare truly visionary classic like his last film, but Panic Room is easily the best pulse pounding thriller you'll likely runs into anytime soon. i just wish fincher hadn't given his unique New York vision such a worn-out Hollywood ending.",Panic Room

The robbers and the mom and daughter have very few means of communicating, yet the story rests on their interplay. It's a very tough job to stretch a story like that into an hour and a half.It almost manages to do it. Sure, it gets pretty contrived at times, and the characters tend to go a little off from time to time to suit the labyrinthine plot, but all in all, it works.David Fincher is adept at claustrophobic feels in his movies, so he was a natural choice. The fancy camera moves are a little ""lookit meee!"" and have aged a little (moviegoers nowadays are too adept at spotting CGI, and it's a little too easy to see it here), but I like David Fincher before this movie and I still do.",Panic Room

From the very beginning it doesn't seem to make much sense, because you wonder why this woman would choose to buy this monstrosity of a house.  It is NOT a fit.  I think that the director and writer should have taken the claustrophobia of being in a small closed-in space and run with that more....hello, the name of the movie IS ""PANIC Room"".  You see, there didn't need to be all the bloody violence.  Terror in the captives' minds would have been scarier i.e. real panic and not so much fighting back from little Sir Jody.

The acting also works. All the actors portrayed their characters pretty good, not letting them stand out and they also developed through the story. Some little flaws as are the situations the characters find themselves are a bit out of the frame but let go of it and you'll get a good one. There's also some suspense and moments where the second matters. Those moments make you rush...

262,The Movie Buff,"Well written, acted, directed",9,4 May 2002,"Panic room is a first class thriller.  It is a completely fresh idea.  As stated above, the acting, script, and directing were all top notch.  So far it is the best movie of 2002.  Panic room wastes very little time setting up the story.  After a brief intro, they get right down to business.   After a while the camera work gets a little annoying, penetrating vents, pipes, and hoses, but it doesnt distract from the film.  The movie possess some of the most heart pounding moments in recent time.  Most of the intense moments, such as when Jodi Foster left the panic room to get her cell phone, were all done in slow motion, which increased one's pulse.  If they had been done in real time they would not have been as effective.     The movie didnt allow itself to get too serious, presenting some comic relief scenes that were done perfectly, ie they were funny enough to get a laugh, yet not too funny to distract from the overall theme and feeling of the movie.   This is the first movie I have seen in a while were I cannot add any suggestions to improve the movie.  Listen for Panic rooms name at next year's oscars.",Panic Room
263,evilasahobby,"Old story, new look",6,13 May 2002,"At an early part of Panic Room, Jodie Foster's character remarks that the panic room is ""very Poe"", or something to this effect. This description is very apt for the film overall, as Panic Room is a very dark, gothic film in tradition with Edgar Allen Poe's work. However it can also be seen as a reference to the movie narrative - you've probably seen or heard it before.I couldn't really get into this film. The camera manipulation is very good with the house being fully explored by this floating point of view, but it feels like the camera replaces any real attempt at plot. Its nice to be able to see everything, but maybe that's the film's problem - it lets you see everything, where it may have been more effective to keep certain things hidden. The panic room is meant to be a closed, tiny space with minimal outside interaction, but instead we fly around the house, listen in on the criminals, go back to the room, watch the criminals some more, etc. The atmosphere is never really allowed to build. Foster's character (and her daughter) are never in any real danger except for the climax, and even then you can see what's coming. In the hands of a lesser director or cast, this would have been a really mediocre film, but Fincher does a fantastic job in setting the style and tone, with the cast putting in a really solid performance. It's a stretch for no-one, however, and isn't worth all the hype its been getting. Even ignoring all of the plot holes, Panic Room is really a see-once-and-forget film. *SPOILER* What really destroyed this film for me was that everyone seemed willing to help (police, neighbours, ex-husband) and yet Foster's character shut them out and went it alone. Again, the panic room is meant to be a small, shut-off area, yet every attempt at seeking help is successful but unwanted when it arrives.",Panic Room
264,skad13,Best thriller in years,10,27 March 2002,"I've just read an interesting book titled Brave Dames and Wimpettes, in which novelist Susan Isaacs posits that most modern movie heroines still use old feminine wiles instead of brainpower to get what they want.Urgently recommended viewing for Ms. Isaacs would be Panic Room, one of the best thrillers I've seen in years.The movie's heroines are Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), a recent divorcee, and her young daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They've just moved into a three-story Manhattan home of the kind to be found more easily in movies than in Manhattan. The prime draw of this house is its ""panic room."" In the event of a burglary or similar emergency, the resident locks himself inside this room and uses its separate phone line to call the police.On their very first night in the house, Meg and Sarah find out just how good to be true this room is, when three unruly burglars break in. It happens that the house's previous owner left a few million dollars behind in the house, and wouldn't you know it, the money's in the same panic room where Meg and Sarah lock themselves. Oh, and for good measure, Meg didn't have a chance to get the separate phone line hooked up.Yeah, I know, this whole set-up could happen only in the movies. But before the thrills are unleashed, the movie takes the time to set up the relationship between Meg and Sarah, and it's nicely done. Because we get to know them for a while, we have a stake in their peril.And believe me, these are not two women who sit around screaming and waiting for some moronically written boogie-men to kill them. Simply because the marvelous screenplay by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) allows these women to think, they manage to stay one step ahead of the burglars, who eventually find themselves cowering as much as those wimpettes Isaacs writes about. You'll not have heard such cheering from a movie audience in quite a while.Except for some overly swooping camera movement at the beginning, direction by David Fincher--formerly known for such existential dreariness as Fight Club and The Game--is as perfectly taut as you could hope to find in a thriller.As for the lead actresses--what a wealth! According to The Internet Movie Database, Kristen Stewart is only *11 years old*. But with her interplay with Foster and her remarkable subtlety, she can only be described as...well, the next Jodie Foster.And what is there to say about Foster? I find her one of the most beautiful women in movies, simply because she makes intelligence sexy.Going to a seeming no-brainer like Panic Room is like expecting an ice-cream cone and getting a dinner at Four Seasons.Panic Room is rated R for much adult language,",Panic Room

266,SanTropez_Couch,"Worthy Fincher movie, on par with his lesser ""The Game""",8,11 April 2003,"The premise of ""Panic Room"" interested me. I've always created situations of getting stuck in an elevator or some such, and playing out all the different scenarios in my mind (usually when I'm taking a long elevator ride). The idea of small, constricting spaces where everything can go wrong, and most often does, appeals to me for some reason. So the idea that an (almost) entire movie take place within the confines of one room, without being something like ""Tape"" or Kiarostami's ""Ten,"" seemed instantly promising.And the movie fulfilled my expectations. I wasn't expecting some sort of masterpiece, or necessarily any better a movie than something Fincher's done before. As is stands, I still think ""Se7en"" is his best film, I was very interested in ""Fight Club"" for the most part, despite the obvious flaws, and enjoyed ""The Game"" thoroughly. This, for me, falls into ""The Game"" category. It's not nearly as polished as ""Se7en,"" and not as intriguing, really, as ""Fight Club."" But both ""Panic Room"" and ""The Game"" work on somewhat of a gimmick level. I mean, does anyone NOT know how this movie is going to end? We want to see this movie because we want to get tense, and we do.The basic idea here is that Jodie Foster and her daughter spend an entire movie within an impenetrable panic room, a hidden room placed in a home to protect from intruders. And whaddya know, when the two girls move in, the bad guys soon follow. So that's all there is, really. The choice of actors is interesting. I've never fell under the spell Foster has cast on some, but I have nothing against her. She's suitable in this movie, but someone else -- someone more capable of showing repressed anxiety could have been better. But no complaints. The bad guys -- Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and a masked Dwight Yoakam -- are fun. Leto is just annoying, but that's a small complaint in the context of the movie. Whitaker is someone I adore, and here you can't help but love the wacky-eyed guy. Yoakam, whose music I love, is a hoot.Unlike ""Se7en,"" which benefited enormously due to its distinctive look, ""Panic Room,"" I think, is far too murky. The whole house is green! That one amazingly fluid tracking shot that glides through rails, keyholes, floors is fun to look at, but it's so much of a show-off piece that I can't believe it wasn't at least half computer-generated.Of course, there are flaws here. The bad guys describe too much of what they're going to be doing, rather than doing. Jodie Foster talks to herself too much. Not only are the girls forced into the panic room, but it turns out Foster's daughter is diabetic. When people are bashed with sledgehammers, they rise again. Explosions don't seem to hurt people indiscriminately. But none of this matters, because we all know what we're getting into when we watch this movie.And Fincher's craft gives it a little extra oomph.***1/2",Panic Room
267,stephenpaultaylor,"Solid Entertainment, through and through",8,2 October 2017,"I love Fincher. All of the films I've seen of his clearly show his love of cinema. Shots that straight through a key lock to the other side and then swooping back again. A lot of motion. Captivating motion. The house and the safe are also characters in this movie, which I really appreciate. His cinematography makes it clear as to why he's such a wildly celebrated filmmaker. It draws you in. You move through the space, into the space and out of the space while at the same time experiencing a very intense and white-knuckle story that glues you to the edge of your seat. Several times I found myself literally with my back arched and knees locked, feeling the tension. That's what I love about him as a filmmaker. He's visceral. He's able to translate the emotional ups and downs of the characters and the situation in a cinematographic way. He tells a story that captivates, and you experience the telling of the story in rich detail. I'm giving this film an eight. Why, you ask? Well, originally it was going to be a nine, but I found myself distracted by Dwight Yoakam's acting. If you see the film, you'll see what I mean. His character didn't seem fleshed out and his acting was over-exaggerated. One moment he's calm cool tough guy psychopath and the next he's acting hysterical. I didn't feel he was true to the character. It was an interesting swing to see these both sides of the character, but I felt he could have dialed it back a bit. Forrest Whittaker is fantastic at portraying a guy who's gone bad who also has a good heart. There's a gravity to his performance that I really like. He's clearly the most likable villain. At the same time, he wants his piece of the pie.Jarod Leto was solid. I loved his mannerisms. He has a real command of his character's body language, which I really liked. Leto in general has a bright energy on the screen. Has a lot of meltdowns. The mother and child connection was surprisingly caring and believable. You feel the love these two characters feel for one another, and it's a strong element of the story as a whole.Foster was fantastic. Utterly believable. There is not a second where you don't feel the intensity inside of this person who wants to save herself and her child. She's sympathetic. She does this wild-eyed thing when she's under pressure that I really like.Steward was great. I really have not much to say other than, there are a lot of cringy teenage performances that I've seen (The kids in the Visit, anyone?) but Stewart did a really solid job in this movie. I loved this film. I have no complaints about the ending or whatever. I thought it was a top-notch, underrated Thriller. Fincher's a very intelligent, thoughtful filmmaker.

I noticed  that Fincher was inpired by Hitchcock when he planned to do this movie.Everything is there: the music,suspense,a little bit of terror and violence.If you want to relax stay away from this movie but if you want to have fun this is the right one,but don't expect a masterpiece cos it's not.6 out of 10.",Panic Room

If you do a movie like this, it is always risky. Because people tend to think what *they* would do in this situation and usually people come up with better ideas than the hero - or the heroine in this case. That's because they don't feel any stress, unlike the hero - does. But if the audience is smarter than the hero it soon will start to get annoyed or bored... They just don't care anymore and thoughts are no longer with the movie - the director loses the audience. The other risk is that it is too predictable. So the director and the author have to come up with something original AND they have to fill all the holes. This is the only way to keep the audience on the right side, identifying with the hero, feeling his slim chances of getting away, feeling his fear. But in Mr. Finchers film you just think: why do they act like this, so stupid? Why don't they do this or that? etc.Another rule is: the more dangerous / the better / the smarter the villain appears the more danger to the hero. And in the end - the bigger the victory will be.This is why ""Die hard"" worked (Alan Rickman as the fast thinking, strategic genius, Godunov as his extremely dangerous hit-man), and that is another reason why this movie fails - the villains act like the 3 Stooges...Macaulay J.

272,SanderStrijbos,Great Thriller (spoilers),8,4 June 2002,"Another great film by my favorite director, David Fincher. Although the film doesn't reach the brilliance of Fight Club and Se7en, it's a very enjoyable film with great performances by all the actors.The story is known, so I won't spend any time on it here. Koepp's script is no Academy Award winner, but surprisingly clever for a big-budget film. God knows we've seen enough (too) simple scripts turned into box-office smash-hits. And Fincher knows what to do with it. He lets the camera spin, fly, move through the house, ceilings, walls and floors. Very close to Fight Club, these camera-moves.Another great thing is that we never leave the house during the actual story. From the moment we take a look (with the characters) in the house, we stay there. That's also a good thing. We learn to know the house along with Meg and her daughter.The villains aren't the most clever people alive. One times, when Meg does something (won't say it here), Raoul says: ""Why didn't we do that?"" and that makes the character more human than the average Euro-terrorists who dominate action films so much. People I know said the burglars made stupid mistakes. Well, people make stupid mistakes.Minor things I liked: the opening credits. Brilliant. Perfect. The weaknesses of Meg and her daughter. They aren't perfect, just like the bad-guys and that makes them human and we can relate to them.One thing I didn't like (and now the spoiler comes): The final scene. We see Meg and her daughter on a bench in a park, looking for a new house. In my opinion it didn't add anything to the movie and we left the house. I'd like us to stay in the house until the very end.In general this is a great film, has its minor flaws, but they are compensated with a clever script, great performances, terrific camera work, perfect direction and the house itself, which I thought was one of the main characters. It might be a little bit of a safe bet for Fincher to do a big studio film. Personally I'd like to see him more risky projects, like Se7en and Fight Club, but he does a great job here and gives me confidence in Fincher doing Mission: Impossible 3, like the rumors are.",Panic Room

Certainly a step back for David Fincher as creative figure.I assume you all know the general plot outline by now.  Nice idea, but just downright dismal execution.  Ridiculous, illogical plot ""twists,"" unbelievable character behaviors, unbelievable dialogue, a storyline as unfocused and meandering as the characters running to and fro about the house, and a predictable, dud ending (with your ""villain that just won't die"" thingy).

The good : Jodie, Forest, the atmosphere, the camerawork (I wonder how much CGI was used). The bad : the plot development, the ending...I cannot understand why anyone would think this movie to be scary. And I say this as someone who has a very low fright threshold. The villains are such a wimpy bunch that I actually started feeling sorry for them in the second half of the film. They do not represent much of a threat after 1 1/4 hours of movie time. The finale is totally ridiculous as has been mentioned before. There are several plot holes, and I do not agree with Ebert that the behaviour of the characters is believable and realistic. The central conceit (woman and daughter besieged in impregnable room) is too static to carry the entire film : very little actually happens, which is logical as hero and villains cannot interact directly. So in act III the roles are reversed - and any creepiness or fear is completely lost, the victim becomes the agressor, and I was left wondering just how long this was going to go on for. It's also possible to predict a lot of what's going to happen, especially in the first half of the film.

AND...was it necessary for Whitaker's charactor to MURDER Yokam's?...especially since Whitaker doesnt want anything to do with MURDER...PERIOD....couldnt he have PUSHED Yokum from behind, put the gun to his head and threatened, etc, etc....FINCHER's WEAKEST film. 5/10",Panic Room
278,motezart,Minimal But Powerful,7,7 February 2014,"In slasher flicks like Scream (1996), break-ins are single scenes. Heist flicks like The Bank Job (2008) or The Score (2001) spend most of the films planning out the break-ins, and then only a scene or two actually carrying them out. So the fact that aside from the very beginning, Panic Room is just really one long break-in scene always made the film seem like a silly waste of time. I mean, it gives the whole plot away right in the title. A couple of thieves arrive and tear up the place, the family hides, problems occur. Hurray.The coincidence of everything just-so-happening to be available at the exact right time: the happenstance of the break-in coinciding with the idea that the house just so happens to contain a panic room, this seems too much to handle.Yet all the mighty forces align and provide the viewer with an experience that is actually quite satisfying. Although not an overly complicated plot, the script is very well written and includes explanations for exactly why these happenings occur as they do.For skeptic viewers like me, who usually find unexplainable exceptional coincidences a deal breakers, David Keopp's logical, explanatory script (Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible) provides answers, and an excellent foundation for David Fincher to build his dark mess. (IMDB says Keopp got 4 million bucks for the script, so.).Seemingly, this film takes the primal fear of invasion, bad people coming into our homes in the night and doing bad things to us. But rather than exploit the concept a has been beaten to death, Panic Room does not rely on the traditional fear of invasion. It adds dimension, reason, even a kind of logic explaining how this whole event could have turned out right for everyone, if only it could have unfolded just a single day earlier.It is in considering the film's simplicity that the profound difficulty of this film's production is most realized. The decision for the director and crew to call ""that's a wrap"" must have been murky one.Unlike any of Fincher's other films, Panic Room is shot entirely on only one set, in linear time, and deals with only with a single event. It is minimal in its approach, like a play. It is essentially all based on the interaction of the actors stage together, almost.Forest Whitacker, Jodie Foster and even Dwight Yoakam all crank out great performances, but Fincher's dark, perfectly influential shots, using unusual angles, intercoms and video cameras, small vs. open spaces, and of course, darkness and rain are what make this cinema, and not theater. Aligning open frames with great musical peaks, the score by Howard Shore (Lord of the Rings) intensifies the single track plot of Panic Room, pushing it along as a series of arcs, suspensefully running up and down, each arc increasing in intensity, until the film hits the peak, and even though we knew all along what was coming, we are still very satisfied with when it finally does.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",Panic Room
279,hankhanks12345,Great thriller,8,30 June 2007,"This isn't a film that will appeal to everyone, but it certainly appealed to me. It's a movie everything fits into a closed space - literally and figuratively- and every move by one character directly impacts the others. Others have likened it to a chess game, and the analogy is apt.I wouldn't call the characters particularly deep, but that's not really the point in a film like this. We see just enough background of each character so we know what motivates each of their moves. It's more like a short story than a novel in this way.The only disappointment I had was that the nature of the plot requires an ending that is sort of tacked on. I didn't think it was a terrible way to finish the film, just not particularly satisfying.Definitely worth a video rental if you're looking for something kind of interesting.",Panic Room

After ""Fight Club"" I was expecting something a bit more lively and twisted, but it looks like Fincher has fallen into the arms of commercial business, where you get simple movies for simple minds. The movie is totally flat. 20 minutes after the the start, you already know the end in details. Standard set up with standard characters and standard situations. He tried to imitate Hitchcock's style, but failed miserably after a good start, losing all suspence for high predictability and poor situations. The only thing I really liked of this movie is the camera shooting, the use of moving cameras: THAT is a remarkable side of this otherwise poor movie. The camera moves smoothly and slowly through walls, following people and action in a nice way and creating very nice effects. The scene in the beginning when the guys try to enter the house is probably the best in the movie: don't miss that one!",Panic Room

282,Jenny Ho,Simple but exciting concept,7,11 May 2002,"The panic room' of the film's title is a sealed off room designed as part of a house for refuge during an emergency situation.  It is also equipped with screens which monitor activity in different locations inside the house.Jodie Foster plays a recently divorced mother who moves into a huge mansion in order to start afresh with her teenage daughter.  Soon after mother and daughter move into their new home, three intruders break in with the intention of stealing and splitting the contents of a safe which resides in the house's panic room.  This plan is foiled when they discover that the residents of the house have retreated into the same room.The break-in occurs soon after the scene is set: mother and daughter view the property and are introduced to the panic room concept; they move in and on their first night, the break-in occurs.  The remainder of the action stays inside the house and because of this, the audience is able to become more involved in the events which occur.  Tension is built up as the camera follows the movements of the intruders while the occupants sleep in their beds.  Any woman who has ever slept in their home alone can surely relate to their vulnerability in this situation!Essentially the film is a cat and mouse' situation with the intruders who will try anything to get at their loot and the two heroines who will use unbelievably desperate and resourceful measures to escape and get rid of the bad guys.  Although the situation is tense in the house, there is a surprising amount of humour in the film and this prevents the intruders from coming across as very menacing.It is also good to see Foster back on the screen like in Silence of the Lambs', she gives a convincing performance portraying a woman who is independent and strong enough to take matters in her own hands.  The only thing I'm not convinced about the character is why on earth does she need such a big house for just herself and her daughter? Panic Room' does not have the impact of David Fincher's recent work Seven' and the Fight Club', being less dark and intense and more mainstream.  My main concern before deciding to watch this film was whether such a simple concept would keep me interested for the full duration.  I need not have been concerned Panic Room' is a very satisfactory thriller with enough exciting moments to keep you entertained for the full 1 hour 50 minutes.",Panic Room
283,Nomad-7,Not even a little impressed,3,28 October 2002,"The situation was terribly artificial. The characters were unbelievable. The story was peopled by idiots. There was never any explanation for why Raoul wasbrought into the picture, who he was or where he came from. There was littleexplanation as to why Burnham, who seems a decent man and who repeatedlyrefers to the security company he owns, suddenly becomes involved in thisburglary turned robbery turned kidnapping and murder.Meg is clearly an idiot. There were more than several times when she waswatching the burglars on her monitors and they were not in the bedroom. Shefinally figured this out and got her cell phone. She was not smart enough to get the phone without knocking over a lamp to let the bad guys know she was outof the room, but there were times after this that the room was empty. All she needed to do was open the door, lean out and call.When she had the police at the door my six year old daughter rolled her eyesand asked me why she didn't just tell the police what was going on and ask them to back off. If a six year old could think of it, why couldn't Meg Altman?When the burglars were trapped in the panic room, they threatened to let herdaughter die if she didn't get out of the room so Raoul could get his handunstuck. ""The police are already on the way. Do you want to add anothermurder to the list of charges against you?"" Meg is an idiot.I am embarrassed to say that I saw this movie. I rated it a 3 because I really like Jodi Foster's work and I can't blame the lousy story on her.",Panic Room
284,deadkerouac,Hitchcockian thrill-ride,9,2 April 2002,"Director David Fincher (SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB) and screenwriter David Koepp (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and two of the JURASSIC PARK films) created this suspenseful thriller set in a brownstone in New York City, which brings to mind the films of Alfred Hitchcock (and reminiscent, in some scenes, of Stanley Kubrick). Jodie Foster shows brilliance in her role as recent divorcee Meg Altman, who moves into the 19th-century, four-story (with basement) townhouse with her teen daughter, Sarah (an impressive Kristen Stewart). Both are believable in their roles, and their relationship as mother and daughter is convincing, both simmering with hatred because of the straying Mr. (Stephen) Altman (Patrick Bauchau), a pharmaceutical industrialist.The first five to ten minutes are especially Hitchcockian. The credits are displayed as floating white letters before various New York City buildings and skyscrapers, and Ann Magnuson, as Meg's friend Lydia, who finds her the brownstone, and Ian Buchanan, as the realtor, ham it up to perfection in true Hitchcock ambiance. The house's previous owner was an eccentric millionaire; the house, though, is large enough for two families, and comes equipped with an elevator, a large staircase located in the center of the room, a fireplace on each floor, and, especially, a large steel-encased security room known as the ""panic room,"" complete with a vault-like, motion-sensitive door, televisions for security cameras that observe every floor of the house, and food, water, and other supplies. Also in this room (unbeknownst to the audience for the first third of the film) is something--a *LOT* of something--that someone wants.[*SPOILERS* AHEAD]""Someone"" comes in the form of three burglars, two of which have a history with the house's former occupant: a conniving, corn-rowed punk (and the millionaire's heir), Junior (Jared Leto, very late of TV's MY SO-CALLED LIFE); the designer of the panic room, a disillusioned man played with startling conviction by Forest Whitaker; and an oft-masked, mysterious psychopath named Raoul (in the film's best performance, country & western crooner Dwight Yoakam). The film boasts much needed humor amid the suspense, and the CGI special effects by Fincher and crew (used previously in FIGHT CLUB) fit, especially with a super-long ""single"" shot that introduces the thieves of the night. You wonder halfway through the film just how can Meg and Sarah outwit the three men, and when they do (in various ways), it's all plausible. No details are left hanging, and when an obvious goof by the men (hint: involving the ""eyes"") is realized by the audience, it's mentioned (by Raoul of all people) in such a way that it's laughable.PANIC ROOM is definitely the suspense thriller of the year, if not THE FILM of the year. Much owed to Hitchcock for inspiring Fincher in this one, and to all the exceptional performances (yes, even the seemingly inept New York cops who stop by during the night, played by Paul Schulze and Mel Rodriguez, are credible and even memorable in their encounter with Meg). Look for SE7EN screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker as the ""sleepy neighbor."" 9/10",Panic Room
285,Momcat_of_Lomita,"It's clever, it's well-crafted, it's well-acted, and feels routine.",6,3 May 2011,"I guess it's a measure of my respect for Jodie Foster as an actress that I expect more of her and the movies she chooses than a well-made, watchable drama that really doesn't rise above the level of ordinary.It's very watchable, though, and if you're looking for a good popcorn flick for a ""girls' night in"" evening, this is a movie I'll happily recommend.Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart bear the weight of this film as Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah Altman, who are the newly-shed ex-spouse and daughter of Stephen Altman (Patrick Bauchau), who is evidently a dirty rotten stinking rich magnate. They are house-hunting in the high-rent district of Manhattan and the realtor they are working with, Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), has a lead on a property that is so new to the market that it isn't even in the listings yet, and so wonderful that it will be snapped up by someone before nightfall.It's the former home of an infirm and reclusive megamillionaire who equipped it with every modern convenience, including a state-of-the-art ""panic room"": a sort of high-security vault where the residents can stash themselves in the event of a home invasion. When closed, it's impregnable from the outside and equipped with closed-circuit monitoring of all the rest of the house.As the realtor who has the sales listing for this manse shows it to Foster and Stewart, we get the information that the eccentric former owner has recently died, and that he died intestate, and that the heirs are battling over his fortune.Jodie Foster as Meg allows herself to be talked into purchasing the house, and further talked into taking full possession immediately, and she and her daughter move in that very night.Thus starteth the nightmare. It develops that one of the heirs, ""Junior"" (played by Jared Leto), just happens to know that there is something hidden in the panic room. He wants to get this something and scoop the other heirs. And he has enlisted the assistance of a couple of baddies-buddies to help him get it: Burnham (Forest Whittaker), who works for the company that built the panic room; and Raoul (Dwight Yoakum), whose presence is only necessary as a dramatic device to bring a truly evil, menacing presence to the party.Junior, Burnham and Raoul break into the manse late in the rainy, spooky night and discover that the empty mansion they expected is unexpectedly inhabited. Meg and Sarah are sleeping upstairs. While the baddie-buddies discuss the unexpected development in menacing whispers downstairs, Meg awakens for a late-night potty run. Coming back from the bathroom in a sleepy stupor, she glances at the monitors in the panic room and sees the baddie-buddies up to no good downstairs.With great presence of mind, she manages to rouse her daughter and the two of them dive into the panic room just ahead of the baddies, who have come upstairs to see what can be done. So Meg and Sarah are safely ensconced in the panic room. The problem is, what the baddie-buddies want is hidden in the panic room with them.And so the rest of the movie consists of Junior, Burnham and Raoul trying to get Meg and Sarah out of the panic room, while Meg and Sarah try to find a way to get help to come and route the baddie-buddies.I won't spoil how this situation develops; it's well-done and suspenseful, and I enjoyed the movie even though I knew what the outcome was going to be. It was interesting to watch how the story moved along to the inevitable and predictable climax. Foster is, as always, very watchable; Stewart does a nice job, and Whittaker, Yoakum and Leto are workmanlike baddies.It's a good entertaining movie that hits all the right buttons and leaves you satisfied without breaking any new ground or giving us any new insights. Which, for Foster and the kind of work she usually does, is faint praise indeed.",Panic Room

287,zerodegreesk,OK... but that's about it,6,7 April 2002,"This was just an ordinary movie in the ""suspense"" or ""thriller"" category. It does nothing new or extremely creative with itself.  The script was predictable and mostly boring.  What kind of twist can they put in these movies that makes them interesting throughout or worth spending an hour and a half watching them?  There's no statement about anything.  All of David Fincher's movies had this, in my opinion.  It's obvious in Fight Club. There are messages in the other three, too.  This movie was just... like, who cares about these people, really?  These three thieves with the all too familiar character traits, er, faults.  The wife of the rich dude who lives in this monsterous apartment with just her daughter, who is the only one worth caring about in the entire movie.  Then there's the filmmaking itself to consider.  Personally, I can't stand to have ""impossible"" camera shots in every other scene.  It seemed that David Fincher used them tastefully in his past films, but in this one... it's CGI hell.  I very much looked forward to seeing this movie, but wish I had chosen to see Blade II instead.  Wait, as one last note, the acting is GREAT in this movie, seriously.  Dwight Yoakam can play one MEAN character, I liked seeing more of Jaret Jeto and Forrest Whitaker is amazing, as usual.  Jodie Foster and her daughter (sorry I didn't catch her name before I started this) were fantastic figuring they only had one room to work with for the majority of the movie.  I guess really the main problem was I expected more out of the story.  David Fincher has picked great scripts in the past, but he should have left this for Tony Scott or Remy Harlin or whoever directed Arnold Schwartzeneggar's last movie.",Panic Room
288,Nahret,Claustrophobics beware.,8,18 March 2002,"Finally a thriller that fully deserves that description. David Fincher's signature style makes this solid script into a gripping movie experience. No cheap scares here, but if you manage to sit still (not as easy as it sounds), you will feel your own accelerated heartbeat. Mercifully, relief from the ever-mounting feeling of claustrophobia comes in the form of a delightfully black humour, mostly at the expense of the somewhat inept robbers. All in all, a movie to remember - although you might be glad when it's over. There is only so much stress the human organism can take, after all.",Panic Room
289,seandchoi,"A stylish, well-made thriller.",9,11 April 2002,"In the hands of a lesser director, ""Panic Room"" could have been all too routine and conventional. But thanks to the directorial skills of David Fincher, it rises above the average thriller coming out of Hollywood these days. It might seem at times that Fincher's too concerned with things like the film's visual style and CGI-assisted ""camera movement"" (e.g. there is an incredible scene where the camera glides down from the second floor into the kitchen, and then *through* the handle of a coffee pot and straight *into* a keyhole--and back out!), but that's part of what I like about this film. It's by a director that really loves and is a master of the craft of filmmaking, and is willing to shoot scenes in a creative, unconventional way. The suspense, after the initial set-up, is pretty taught and it never really lets up until the end. All-in-all, although Fincher fans might be somewhat ""disappointed"" that ""Panic Room"" isn't up to the level of ""Fight Club,"" I think Fincher's latest effort is still worth seeing. It doesn't break new grounds, but it's a lot better than most so-called ""thrillers"" in recent memory (""Memento"" being a definite exception).",Panic Room

291,KubrickCRM114,David Fincher still rocks.,10,5 April 2002,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from Panic Room when I entered the theatre.  I have been a fan of David Fincher since Alien 3 (forget the critics, it was a well directed film) but I was leery of David Koepp's screenplay; I like his work but his scripts usually aren't of that Se7en/Fight Club caliber.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.The film is steadily paced, given the idea that the character are trapped in a small space and it feels like forever, which is not bad at all.  It made me more claustrophobic the longer it lasted.  Of course, David Fincher was making the camera into a character all its own, going through floors, walls, keyholes, coffee pot handles, railing, you name it.  The special effects are superb, but DO NOT have to make up for content, unlike many films appearing so often (Lord of the Rings).  The special effects never enhance the story, just the presentation of Finch's visionary directing style. 
The cinematography was beautiful, giving the panic room itself an assaultingly dark overtone.  Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji are definetly on their game.  The dark, ominously large house is spooky almost to the point of being gothic.  Also, you have to give credit to a film that makes Dwight Yoakam scary as hell.  I can't go into dark rooms of my house without getting a chill thinking about ""Raoul"" jumping out at me.  Any movie that scars me for life (Jaws, Taxi Driver) is, at least in my opinion, a good movie.All in all, go see Panic Room, it is worth every second and penny to say the very least.",Panic Room

294,timtindy,A complete misfire -- 3 out of 10,3,25 April 2002,"Panic Room is easily the most disappointing movie in the last year or so. This movie had a great premise, a very good director, and an excellent lead actress.  But it is a complete misfire of a movie.  There are so many things wrong with the film that I don't know where to begin, but here goes.  The biggest problem is in the casting of and writing for the ""villains.""  These guys are one step removed from the comic villains of Home Alone.  Their periodic bickering and one-liners are not appropriate for this kind of film, and they serve as a distraction.  Because the villains aren't imposing, the terror is not the least bit intense.  *spoiler alerts to follow* Next, the Forest Whitaker character (the only truly good performance in the movie) is the only character that has a three-dimensional side.  I cared more about him than I did the under-written Jodie Foster character.  Even worse, since they made this character gray, I wanted to know what happens to him -- there is NO closure at the end.  He gives up his money and freedom to do the right thing and abide by his conscience, and we don't even know what happens to him!  I wanted to see Jodie Foster not press charges against him. Something -- anything other than that lame tacked-on ending in the park. Back to the comment about the lack of three-dimensional characters.  First rule of suspense -- make the audience care about the potential victims.  It just didn't happen for me with Jodie or the doddering husband, which leads me to the next problem:  unintentional comedy.  The hubby looked about 25 years too old for Foster and after he was beaten up looked like Grandpa from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  There was also more than one occasion when both my fiancee and I laughed out loud when we clearly weren't supposed to. I also can't believe how stupid the characters behaved in this movie -- here we were one step removed from dumb teens in a slasher movie. I really liked Se7en and The Game, but I must lay most of the blame at David Fincher's feet.  During the first ten minutes of the film -- especially when mother and daughter turned in for the night -- the movie was eerily atmospheric, as the house itself was a character and the audience knew something bad was going to happen.  As the camera panned around the house, I was creeped out as I wondered to myself where the bad guys were and what they were going to do.  As soon as we saw them outside getting out of the car, the suspense lessened dramatically.  Then as soon as they started the silly bickering, the suspense was gone.  It never returned.",Panic Room

Panic Room is a thriller set in the NYC brownstone home of Meg Altman [Jody Foster] recently divorced with a young teenage daughter [Kristen Stewart]. The brownstone has a secret high tech `safe room'; legend has it the former owner left a fortune hidden in the building.  It's Meg's first night in her new digs and she's just getting familiar with the phone and electronics system.  Burnham, Raoul and Junior [Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto, respectively] stop by looking for the money.  Burnham installed the safe room system, Raoul nursed the former resident, and Junior is packing the heat.  Meg and the kid head for the safe room, the intruder's breakout sledgehammers and other assorted goodies of mass destruction.  A contest between brain and brawn ensues; in the end the bad guys are at least one `right-hand-man' short.  [See the film to get the meaning of this last comment!]Panic Room is the best of the current litter of thriller / suspense films. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat maybe under it], without using Hollywood's dumb video tricks.  The plot is focused and fast paced, the story is well scripted, and the acting sharp and expressive.  Events are unpredictable leaving viewers to guess what's up next, even having seen the previews. All the action takes place within the brownstone, making the situation all the more focused.  The exceptional cinematography starts with the rectilinear layout [squared angles] of the opening credits against NYC buildings; this is a clue of the photography yet to come.
Nobody does feminine fear and rage better than Jody Foster, just ask Clarice Starling in Silence of The Lambs.  Foster is at her prime in this film.

297,Evolvist,Water into Wine,8,7 April 2002,"First thing's first: Again, the credits in a David Fincher movie were awesome. I love how he always sets the stage with the credits and his attention to details (except for the ""rain on the windshield"" scene in Se7en) are second to none. As far as the rest of the movie went, the story was mediocre (not the worst neither), and probably, in my opinion, on par with The Game, but not better than Se7en & Fight Club. I don't know, however, which director out there could have pulled off what Fincher did in Panic Room with such a setting to work with i.e. one house, one night, small cast etc...David Fincher did it, and I am willing to bet that he allowed himself this movie, not because the story was so wonderful, but because it was a great challange for him. I hope nobody claims that he did not pull it off, because the dead-spots in the movie were close to none--a very difficult feat with what he had to work with (very much the same with Fight Club where Fincher had TOO MUCH to work with, and he ended up pulling that off, as well). Therefore, don't blame the director on this one if it did not strike your fancy, there are too many other variables. Having said that, I will not say much more, because a lot of my fellow IMDB users have said multifarious things already, and have brought up many good points.  Nevertheless, I will say that Jodi Foster, besides being a great actress in Panic Room, was looking pretty HOT in this movie (and I have never really thought she was all THAT--perhaps it was the nerd glasses that made her look so good). Dwight, ""The Cowboy Singer,"" must have taken some acting lessons, for the man was pretty root-n-toot-n good in this one (a far cry from his bland acting in When Trumpets Fade. Enuff Said! I will be getting this movie on DVD for its eye-candy alone. Just watch David Fincher go down in movie history one of these days for his vision and contribution to the industry.",Panic Room
298,driver_8,Great Performances,9,18 May 2004,"This was one of those summer movies that you did not expect much from. It seemed like a rather inane plot and simple story. However, few could have imagined the truly great performances handed in, primarily by the bad guys here. Jared Leto is incredible as the weasel in charge of this criminal operation. Moreover, Dwight Yoakum, who is always great, turns in both a funny and evil performance. Couple this with the performances of Jodi Foster and Forrest Whittaker, and you got a movie. One does not need a great great story, when you have big time talent to tell it. The story involves a heist of an old house occupied by Foster and her daughter. However, what the bad guys need, is locked in the safest room in the house, which also happens to be where Foster and her daughter are locked in. That is the premise, you will have to watch the rest.",Panic Room
299,klheintz,Good pacing/flow until the end,5,4 November 2016,Panic room is a great idea even in it's simplicity. People move into a rich house with a fortune there unbeknownst to them way earlier than they were supposed to. Robbers break in and of course they need into the room that the tenants lock themselves into.It advances at a nice pace and they are able to keep it tense even though it seems like the movie could be over in 5 minutes. That's what I like the most about the movie: The setup and flow to the film and the various problems Foster and Stewart and faced with. All the acting in the film is good but there's some problems with the editing that makes parts of the film feel very choppy. I think Whitaker delivered the best performance as the burglar who doesn't want to mess with people like the other criminals do. Makes for some good emotion coming from his character when those criminals start to do things he's not into.Overall it's a well paced film with decent performances all around. Not Fincher's best and the ending needed some serious work.,Panic Room

I was excited to see ""Panic Room,"" but the theatrical trailers were better than the actual movie. You'll be a bit bored watching this, but enjoy it all the same.

303,Dave-330,"A boring, strange movie...",3,8 April 2002,"Let me start by writing that I don't usually write reviews for big-budget movies, with tons of reviews already out there, but I have made an exception for this movie:This movie is very odd, because it seems to want to bring elements of ""Home Alone"" to an adult audience, while attempting to make a strong female character, and at the same time have said-character where a tank top which shows her constant cleavage. The strangest thing is that they are selling this as a ""thriller,"" while really it seemed to me to be a ""yawner,"" at least up until the first shot was fired. MAYBE A SPOILER Then it kicked it up a notch (from Neutral to 1st gear), and after the ""ruse"" from the intruders another notch (from 1st to 2nd). END SPOILER From there the movie just seemed unbelievable, but at the same time, amazingly watchable (not unlike a horror movie).My problems with this movie are many. First, if you are going to try and tailor a movie to a female audience, why bring Fincher on board as the director? It doesn't make sense, because he is going to try to make the film dark and draw soon-to-be-disappointed males (like myself) into see the movie. It doesn't make sense, and while I brought ""the great one"" up, anyone else see his ""Alien3"" disaster? He needs a great script to shine, and this failed to have that.Back to the target audience, if the movie is tailored to women, why have Jodie Foster run around with her breasts hanging halfway out her shirt for the first-half of the movie? I'm a guy, and would usually applaud such blatant T&A, but it's JODIE FOSTER, and I was looking for a plot, not her cleavage. Once the movie was over, the first thing I said to the two women I went with was, ""Jodie Foster's breasts should have had top billing, because they were the only thing going for the first half of the movie.""On to the ""missing"" plot, I cannot believe you can rehash bits and pieces of different movies and expect it to work. Everything just seemed thrown together and then you have to suspend reality more times than should be expected. SPOILER ""Hey look, Jodie was ten inches from the fire and didn't get burned, but Jared Leto did."" C'mon, let a three-year old watch that part, and tell me if he believes that could happen. It's just stupid. That coupled with country music's hardest head, and now you've gone to far-fetched. END SPOILER Also, the fact that I went in thinking that the idea of a ""Panic Room"" seemed utterly stupid, and left feeling that the plot-device actually did NOT seem to hurt the film, means that Fincher should be congratulated on being able to sweep over the idea either quite well, or quick enough to not let the audience really think about it.The actors all seemed to be acting in there own movies. Foster ran around enough that it was hard to tell how well she was ""acting."" I think she was doing her best ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" impression by running around like mad and leaning over everything just to make sure you knew she was female. Leto played his part well, but unfortunately his character had the depth of a mud-puddle. Forest Whitaker brought his ""every other movie"" role to this, and just seemed TOO nice from the VERY beginning. Note: It is nice to have the character progress over the movie, instead of keeping him the same. Dwight Yoakam brought some much needed life to the movie, and progressed into what you figured he would be, but how hard is it to act in a ski-mask though? The girl played her part well, and was very realistic in most every scene. She shouldn't have ran circles around some of the other, more decorated actors the way she did.If you ""must-see"" this movie, you will be fairly impressed with the cinematography, some of the acting and occasionally the direction. If you are a guy, you will probably find the plot too ""sweet"" and the action not up to par. If you are an avid film watcher, like myself, you will find most of the ideas have been recycled and that the acting and writing are not as good as they should be. Overall I was quite disappointed, but I'm not the target audience (but who really is?). I rate it a 3 out of 10.",Panic Room

Without Forest Whitaker and Jodie Foster this movie could be a 'USA' Original Movie.The opening sequence was good.  The camera moves through the house walls and through tiny appliance handles to show action from one side of the house to another.  It was an obvious digital trick, but slick none the less.  Nothing else is really worth commenting about.  The movie is so predictable that it is quickly forgettable.",Panic Room
305,gkearns,These heroes are human,10,31 March 2002,"THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THESE COMMENTS As a ""suspense thriller"" ""Panic Room"" does its basic job - lots of tension and scares. But in some ways, it isn't scary-thrilling in the same way as many others. Meg and Sarah aren't dealing with invulnerable monsters, nor with genius homicidal maniacs. The bad guys here are seriously flawed - that's the point. One of the three, Junior - the more or less leader, is an emotional and intellectual dimwit. Raoul has about a dozen more IQ points, but his invented-sinister nature make us rightly wary of him (he enters the picture in a ski mask for effectiveness - Junior calls ""Joe Pesci""). Burnham is the genius of the outfit; he had worked on the design of the house's complex security systems and knows the girls' protective strengths and weaknesses. But he is by nature non-violent, unwilling to go all the way to hurt or kill. But together the three are a truly scary potent force, all together possessing: twisted emotions, amorality, and brilliant mind. Their imperfections give them a more realistic unpredictable sinister-ism than the typical scare movie villain. But the girls are flawed too. Meg (Jodie Foster) is recently divorced and is emotionally brittle. Eleven year old Sarah (Kristen Stewart) has serious diabetes. Her blood sugar must be constantly watched with a wrist monitor; over-excitement can send her blood sugar level plummeting, requiring an emergency shot to prevent her slipping into a coma. At the start of the movie, she has more or less alienated herself from her parents; she puts up with them, but is rapidly losing confidence in them. But she possesses a typical naive eleven year old ability to cooly assess situations and possibilities. Her impulsiveness becomes a power. The growth of the characters of Meg and Sarah, individually and together, is the beauty of this movie.MORE SPOILERS AHEAD I've put ""Panic Room"" down as one of my all-time favorites, and I'm looking forward to its someday DVD release. The characters of regular people Meg and Sarah fit right up there with the best of superheroes. They are human, with human weaknesses, which they rise above, and indeed use, in their battle for life. The panic room starts as a prison for the girls, but is later ironically turned into a prison for the bad guys, who cringe in fear of the intrepid mother. But the story isn't just about politically correct women's empowerment. SPOILER If they escape, it will require the cooperative effort of each of four flawed humans.As usual, Jodie Foster is outstanding as Meg, the brittle single mom who digs deep into her character to find the power required to battle for the life of her child. Kristen Stewart's Sarah is one of the truest depictions of the heart of an eleven year old I have ever seen.",Panic Room
306,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Fincher goes Hitchcock or Fincher goes commercial?,6,12 May 2002,"***Minor spoilersLet's get one thing out of the way first; David Fincher is my favorite director. He has a talent for using all tricks in the cinematic book in a way that perfectly marries the content. He also always makes the most out of every script, which means the comparative quality of the movie relies strongly on the quality of the script Fincher has to work from. Alien 3 was a false start for Fincher, a mangled and predictable script made watchable by excellent direction and some good acting. In the cases of Se7en and Fight Club the screenplays were brilliant and so are the movies. The Game has a script that's slightly more streamlined toward being a full-blown blockbuster, but contains enough subtext to be fascinating in its own right; so is the film. This brings us to his latest film and a strong contender for the worst screenplay Fincher has worked from (yes, that includes Alien 3 and his Madonna videos).I won't even begin summing up all the plot holes David Koepp has come up with (ripped off is more accurate). And the fact he's aware of some of them (a villain says `we could've done that' after Jodie Foster's Meg Altman smashes the cameras) doesn't make them any less dumb. There's a case to be made for characters not behaving completely rational in the circumstances the movie presents, but Panic Room frequently stretched my ability to suspend my disbelief. Fincher does a good job of masking some of them (apart from one particular and far too explosive sequence), but no amount of great directing could ever compensate for the script's inclination towards cheap thrills.Koepp's screenplay is conceptually quite strong but turns out to be not only a shelter for plot holes you could build a panic room in, but also a collection of ideas that you could call 'tried-and-tested'. I would rather call them tired-and-testing. You've heard the derogatory terms before; it's Die Hard in a house! or: it's a grown-up Home Alone! - although to be fair the Home Alone flicks are far more sadistically violent. There's truth to both labels, but it goes beyond that. A scene echoing Rear Window I can forgive, but does that cops-knocking-on-the-door sequence have to be lifted from Bound entirely? And is it just me or does the (in itself excellent) opening sequence merely update the one from North by Northwest? Then there's the use of plot devices so familiar you have trouble actually remembering in what film you've seen it before (because it's ten movies, not one). The best example may be the diabetic kid fitted as standard.Another thing I appreciate in Fincher's other films is the amount of depth he finds room for. One thing becomes clear when watching this film, it's Fincher's Hitchcock project, a thriller played straight with some technical wizardry supporting it (lots of CG camerawork and a reverse dolly zoom, a technique pioneered by Hitch in Vertigo, as the final shot), but a thriller which mainly goes for suspense. While Fincher's direction goes a long way in the suspense department (he cleverly bypasses the predictability of the screenplay) he doesn't seem to have applied any knowledge about why (certain) Hitchcock films are still interesting. Those films' main strength are the strong psychological themes throughout (Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo). While Koepp makes some desperate resort to Altman's claustrophobia, it doesn't really go for that angle. In fact it doesn't seem to go for any psychological angle at all. As such, I found it too plot driven and lacking characters I really connected with. That lack of depth in any sense may not kill the movie, but it does reinforce my impression that this is Fincher's 'good-career-move' flick. A straight, stylish thriller with plenty box office potential but little substance. It feels somewhat like a film to rebound his career after cult hit Fight Club became a box office dud.BUT....like I said, while the writing on this film isn't anything to be proud of, in terms of bringing it to screen there are little errors. Fincher succeeds in drawing tension from the most trivial of scenes, using his trademark bag of tricks. He's helped by Howard Shore's fitting soundtrack as well. Again every one of his shots is interesting in itself while they still serve a function, which is atmosphere. It's not as doom-laden as Se7en but threat is always sustained throughout. Panic Room isn't simply stylistically satisfying the way most Hollywood movies are nowadays. It goes beyond that. Technically, this really is a masterpiece. Also, Fincher gets the best out of his cast. Foster has a few truly wonderful (short and emotional) beats, while also showing being capable of handling a physical role such as Meg's. And the triple act of the burglars works wonders, even if Dwight Yoakam goes far OTT by the end.So how to rate a film which I thoroughly enjoyed due to direction, acting and the excellent work by all technical departments (the set-design is absolutely brilliant, as is the cinematography), but rubbed me the wrong way it terms of writing? Hollywood High Concept filmmaking and Hitchcockian direction go head to head in this one (where they should have gone hand to hand), and I feel the first wins in the long run. Make no mistake, I DID have a good time watching this, but will I be talking about it in a week or so? No, and that's less than I expect from Fincher.Rating: 6/10",Panic Room
307,missrljane,Suspense thriller that'll keep you on the edge of the seat every time,8,10 April 2008,"That Panic Room is a suspense thriller that retains its suspense in repeat viewings, a very rare occurrence for the genre, is a sign of its quality.David Fincher directs the film to create a real feeling of utter isolation in the middle of Manhattan and realistic touches, not needed for plot, convince the audience that Meg is a real woman in a real predicament. The thriller works due to an insular plot of a mother and daughter trapped inside the panic room of their new house when three men break in, who want what is hidden in that panic room. It doesn't feel the need to branch out or become over the top, and it is a situation the audience can relate to on a basic level  intruders in the home.Its few flaws are that at the start of the film when Meg and Sarah move in, it is too quiet, with too much ominous music to emphasise this woman and her daughter are in trouble, feeling a little heavy handed. Why do Meg and her daughter need such an enormous labyrinthine house anyway? The fancy camera-work is impressive on a first viewing, but distracting on re-watches and the ending is slightly too abrupt.As for the characters, the film cuts between Meg and Sarah on the inside, and Junior, Burnham and Raoul on the outside, letting the audience get to know all the characters equally. If there is a problem here, it is that Junior's inconceivable stupidity is unfortunately inconceivable, but he and Burnham remain likable throughout, he for sweetness due to his dumbness and Burnham for being the nice one, while the faceless Raoul is suitably despicable.Panic Room is one of the best examples of the suspense thriller, taut and terrifying, exhilarating and entertaining, viewing after viewing, a talented ability for a film set in one house during one night. Highly recommended for a thrill, but not for a relaxing night in.",Panic Room

314,jagfx,Toned down and tightly wound,8,29 March 2002,"In a role once pegged for Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, newly divorced from her husband, a pharmaceuticals millionaire. She moves into a new, large, four story, brownstone on the Upper West Side with her daughter in tow. Along with the standard spacious rooms and spiralling staircase is an elevator (the previous owner being disabled) and a ""panic room"". The titled room is a steel encased room that houses a bank of tv's taking video feeds from camera's around the house. This ""safe room"" is to protect yourself from a home invasion, after all, what are you going to do if someone breaks into your home: ""...call the police and wait until Tuesday?"".Now enter: Jared Leto, the kid with the plan, doing his best ""Brad-Pitt-in-Fight-Club"" impersonation; Forest Whitaker as the soft-hearted, but clear-headed of the criminals and Dwight Yoakam in another terrifying turn as the quiet but viscious one. Director David Ficher doesn't waste any time in getting to business. On the first night the home is broken into and while Meg and Sarah make it safely to the panic room, there's just one problem - what the criminals want is *in* the panic room.In Fincher's fifth feature he tones down the wild visual style of ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" and opts for a more classical, Hitchcock-ian style. Of course, Fincher doesn't leave his bag of tricks at home, offering some amazing tracking shots between rooms and floors.Foster is great in the lead role measuring out her change from vulnerable to protective mother in measured doses. Leto almost overacts his way out of the role, choosing large gestures and tics in addition to articulation, but luckily Whitaker and Yoakam reel him in everytime he almost reaches into the ridiculous with calm, cool and in Yoakam's case unnerving performances.
Fincher's take on the thriller genre is wonderful, with shifting perspective's and genuine surprises. There are a couple key turns which I can't give away here, except to say that this is another top notch directorial effort by David Fincher.8/10",Panic Room
315,mrsknoll,Excellent - best this year so far,9,29 March 2002,"I find it is so difficult to be entertained these days.  However, this movie had me captivated for two hours.  There was never a dull moment throughout the entire movie, which really impressed me.  Usually, there's at least a momentary lull which I tend to use as a bathroom break.  But Panic Room kept me in my seat throughout.  Jodie Foster is marvelous in this movie.  Nicole Kidman was originally cast for this role, and though I love her work, Jodie Foster was ideal as Meg Altman.  She is as strong and powerful as she was in Silence of the Lambs, which is her definitive work.  She empowers women in almost every role she takes and Panic Room is no different.  Kristen Stewart plays her daughter, Sarah.  Take watch of her - she's definately up and coming.  I was convinced that she was Sarah Altman - stone on the outside, fragile inside and afflicted with life-threatening diabetes.  Forrest Whitaker was also excellent as Burnham - the kind hearted safe-breaker.  I was hoping it would turn out a little differently for him than we assume it had to.  I haven't seen Jared Leto as a character I actually liked, and unfortunately, Panic Room was no different.  Although he's attractive, he just doesn't have the skills as an actor that I would like to see in such a major box office movie.  He plays Junior - the money-grubbing grandson of a very rich man who has died; also the mastermind behind the botched plot to rob a supposedly empty house.  I will give him credit for playing this role very well - I just don't respect him as a serious actor.I was surprised that the movie started out so quickly - pulling us in almost immediately.  I loved that they didn't drone on about who they were and what kind of lives they were leading.  I don't know if it was the screenplay or the direction, but I felt it was an outstanding idea to just show the audience who they were through various objects (insulin in the tiny fridge) and short phrases (Sarah: ""F-him. F-her."" telling us her father has had an affair). This, I think, ensures that we pay attention to the characters' surroundings, which is very important.  And also that we listen to what they say.  Their facial expressions, body language and tone of voice lets the audience know exactly who they are - and that Jodie Foster is not going to let them win.In any case, Panic Room is a beautifully written and superbly performed movie and sure to be a major box office smash.  I highly recommend Panic Room as a must-see for 2002.",Panic Room
316,herbstnebel2ss,Stall for the inevitable double cross.,8,30 August 2009,"Besides being a thrill a minute actioner, Panic Room clearly exemplifies the fact that there's no honor among thieves.Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart give above board performances as Meg and Sarah Altman. The two latest statistics of the broken family syndrome, they have just moved into a majestic house in Manhatten.Unfortunately for them, their home has been targeted by a trio of thieves intent on liberating millions of dollars in bearer bonds hidden inside. The three consist of Burnham (Forest Whitaker) Junior (Jared Leto) and Raoul chillingly portrayed by Dwight Yoakam.It is only after the three are inside that they realize the dwelling is occupied. Yet the stakes are so high, they decide to pursue their quest. Awakened by the intruders, Meg and Sarah take refuge in the covertly installed panic room. As was revealed early in the movie, the room is virtually indestructible and the thieves spend the majority of the film trying to gain access to it. Not only do they want to get to Meg and Sarah, but the treasure they seek is in the room.During their endeavors Junior and Raoul engage in a power struggle, while Burnham just wants to get the whole thing over with.They are really creative in their attempts to get the Altmans to open the door, trying everything from poison gas to beating Meg's soon to be ex husband to a pulp. Meg and Sarah are just as creative in seeking outside help.As time races along and it becomes clear that the room is impregnable, the inevitable falling out occurs between Yoakam, Leto and Whitaker.I really liked the clip at which the movie progressed. There are more than enough tense moments, tight spots and fisticuffs to keep your attention. Performances were first rate and convincing, especially Dwight Yoakam as the cold blooded Raoul.There were several flaws however. Early on while Meg and Sarah are initially examining the house, Meg reveals to us that she is extremely claustrophobic, yet throughout the remainder, she shows no such symptom's even though she is confined in the panic room. Another is when the real estate agent demonstrates that the panic room door will not shut if anything is obstructing it, much like an elevator door. Yet later, it slams firmly shut on Raouls hand.Despite these minor flaws, Panic Room is exciting, suspenseful and will have your heart skipping a few beats.",Panic Room

The cinematography was good but the editing drove me insane -- what was with all the completely random fade ins and outs to black?  I kept expecting commercials to appear on the movie screen.  I think that the editor and director must have been trying to cause suspense with them, but that's the most juvenile way of causing suspense I've ever seen.  I feel very disappointed in both the director -- who apparently was the same director of the excellent Fight Club -- and Jodie Foster.

No intruder can invade that room and its inhabitant can last longer than the best equipped burglar.David Koepp´s screenplay introduces a very weak McGuffin but then again that keeps the McGuffin in line with the surrounding script itself. For all the stylishness of Mr. Fincher´s staging, it´s let down by the other David´s writing. It´s only too evident that there once was a brilliant movie idea that pitifully enough never materialized into a real movie.Keeping that in mind you just have to marvel at what a masterful director Mr. Fincher is, even when his material sucks.",Panic Room
320,buckleym-1,"Decent, but ultimately forgettable",6,13 April 2002,"David Fincher's ""Panic Room"" traps and eventually buries itself under cliche and familiarity. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, who recently divorced from her husband and moves into a new house with her daughter (Kristen Stewart). Of course the first night in their new home, three burglars brake inside in pursuit of a missing fortune located in the panic room. Meg and her daughter, Sarah, hide in the panic room after the three men break into the home. Thus begins the cat-and-house game between the mother and daughter and the burglars. The definite highlights of the film are the camera movements and Foster's performance. The camera is extremely mobile, moving all around the house, through walls and along the ground. This adds to the sense of dread around the situation along with the claustrophobic feel of the house and panic room itself. This style perhaps allows the audience to get an even better idea of the surroundings than any of the actual characters in the film. Jodie Foster does a great job in a difficult role. She switches from a confused and weak protagonist to a smart and creative heroine in a split second and does it with the utmost ease imaginable. David Fincher films have always featured intentive camera work and dark source material and this is no different. The problem though relies in the fact that while Meg is a strong lead, the script allows for no other memorable roles only cliches. Forest Whitaker, a vert gifted actor, plays the bad guy with the noble intentions. Jared Leto (who was terrific in ""Requiem For A Dream"") is the over-the-top psychotic one and (country singer) Dwight Yoakam plays the evil one that never dies. Throughout the course of the movie Raoul (Yoakam) has his hand crushed in a metal door, and is bashed in the head and still keeps coming back for more. Foster's acting in ""Panic Room"" shows why she is one of Hollywood's best actresses and Fincher adds some dark touches. The film, however, bogs down under cliche to point where the whole film, especially the ending, leaves an empty feeling inside. A 6 out of 10.",Panic Room

The three criminals are relentless and determined because they think there is a lot of money stored away in the panic room.I won't give the rest away if case you haven't seen it, but I will tell you that this film has a lot of violence, like most of Fincher's films.The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't flawless either, and the script probably could've been better.

325,prezike,Fincher misunderstood once again,8,4 April 2002,"When I heard about ""Panic Room"" I was quite intrigued as to how this movie was going to include one of the most important, and consistently overlooked, aspects of David Fincher films.  What I am referring to is his devotion to sending a strong message, which is usually a societal critique, within almost every film he has created.Maybe it's because I generally agree with his critiques, but I am surprised to see so few reviewers, both amateur and professional, overlooking the message of this film, and even some of his others.  The NY Times seems to have completely missed it, as have several other critics who have argued ""Panic Room"" ""lacks substance.""  This is also funny because the complaints some had of ""Fight Club"" was that it was pretentious, over the top, and  intent on sending a message to the audience.  So what does Fincher do?  Actually panders to the critics (whether it was intentional or not is almost irrelevant) by creating a subtle psychological thriller that also sends a clear message about American society and values.  But then it seems that these same critics completely miss it, thinking that this is more of a classic ""what you see is what you get"" thiller.Based upon Fincher's history, I found this VERY hard to believe, when I read some reviews.  Then I saw it with my own eyes and once I thought about what he might be saying for one moment after leaving the theater it hit me.I don't think it is anyone's place to tell anyone what that message is, but I suggest to all those who have seen it, or even haven't, to examine the primary themes of the film, the character relationships, and their values, which were all played out in some key scenes.  One being, in particular, the last camera shot in the grand finale, which I read someone here argue meant nothing.  Well, in my opinion, if you saw that and believed it to posses no meaning, then I think you missed David Fincher's message.  Unfortunately, a lot of us will likely miss it because Fincher's style and entertainment value is what they are seeing the movie for.  The problem is he has consistently gone beyond that, but it usually falls upon deaf ears with the audience he attracts.Hopefully one day he will be remembered for his attempt in bringing social criticism and thought provocating scripts covered by conventional and pop appearing Hollywood film making.  Until then most will likely think of him as a Hitchock disciple who incorperates a lot of style and tricky camerawork (all of which are evident here, like his patented camera movement through walls and other solid objects) to gain his audience.  There is more there...just look a little harder.",Panic Room
326,pnc777,Inticing,10,29 March 2002,"With the current standards for film, this is very impressive.  I saw the screening last night 3-29-02 and I have to day, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  It gives me butterflies in my stomach thinking about it. Now, for those of you who get anxious easily, take caution...for those who don't, you will.  The entire movie is a strong build up to a climax. However, at one point in time, when it builds up so much and you are sure that there is so much suspense that something is bound to happen, black screen and another shot.  Believe me, you won't guess which climax it is until you are done with the movie, that's how many there are.  A very well chosen cast, the performances were above average...Now, I have to say that the coolest part about the entire movie are the camera angles.  Such wide and continuous sweeps are unorthidox and make the movie seem cutting edge, though we know we are capable of much more.  From cameras in coffee pots to cracks in the walls to the typical camera in the lock routine, it's all blended together in a concoction of mystery.  Though it's atempts at comedy are somewhat mislead, the intent was good, and the over all movie was excellent.NOT a movie to take a kid to see...some scenes are made twice as creepy with the sound effects (ie: when large objects are used as weapons, at impact, someone breaks a carrot, creating a sickening feeling in the gut of the viewer from their thoughts on how bad the damage done was.), also, like I have stated, it is very suspenseful.

330,dltdvd,An exciting thriller...,8,31 March 2002,"When you first think about the premise of ""Panic Room,"" you would think that it's just a cliche like most of the movies out there. However, with the exception of a typical burglars-break-into-house idea, I find the chemistry of this movie to be totally unique and elaborate with all of its modern era Alfred Hitchcockian-type camera work that director David Fincher uses quite often. Fincher is also able to make the story thrilling, yet quiet. It often makes you wonder what's going to pop out around the next corner.The story centers around Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), a recently divorced mother, and 11-year-old her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They are interested in buying a huge house in Manhattan, which the real estate agent gives them a tour, and introduces them to a safe room known as the panic room. This particular room is used as a hideout from burglars, it has its own phone line, video monitors, and the room is made of very strong steel so the bad guys can't get in. They won't be needing the panic room any time soon...or will they?Soon enough, we are introduced by three burglars who each have their own different personalities. There's Burnham (Forest Whittaker), the brains of the outfit, the designer of the panic room, Junior (Jared Leto), a foul-mouthed leader of the group, and Raoul (Dwight Yoakam), the deranged psychopath with a gun. When Meg notices the three men in the house, she quickly wakes up her daughter and rushes into the panic room. She asks the burglars why they are here, but what they want is inside the panic room, and they won't leave until they get it.",Panic Room
331,avanwhy,"""Why didn't THEY think of that?""",3,30 March 2002,"*SPOILER* The last straw for me in being willing to ignore some plot holes was when Dwight Yoakam said (as Jodie Foster's character was smashing all the surveillance cameras) ""Why didn't we think of that?""  Why, indeed, did the ""bad guys"" not think to smash those cameras (even when they stared right at them).It is holes in the plot, like that, that make you want to just say out loud ""oh come on!""

No way, there's only one bad gory scene but other than that, there's nothing that really scary, granted that a thriller can be scary sometimes.  I believe that if Nicole Kidman would have taken this part, it wouldn't have been better.  Jodie Foster does a great job playing a mother trying to take control of her own home after three robbers want something in her home. Now, the ending: you have to conclude it yourself, but if you don't like doing that, there is no ending.  What happened to the money and the ""friendly"" robber?

A tit-for-tat cat-and- mouse game, it has many twists and turns, some of which you guess at, some of which you don't see coming. Best of all, the film is very suspenseful without being over the top (are you listening Hollywood?). Indeed, this shows how a film can be a pleasure to the mind and not just to the eye.

335,igm,Much Ado About Very Little,7,24 March 2003,"There are acres of atmosphere in this thriller, generated by the polished visuals of Fincher, and an unrelenting original score by Shore.  But why? The film jumps straight to the premise, with economical characterizations of the few players populating it and the house break-in in under 15 minutes. There just doesn't seem to be much of a point.Fincher has developed an unmistakable feel in all his movies, used to a lesser extent in The Game, with a gritty, underlit, urban grime suffusing the visuals.  He also has developed a signature effects-laden, pullback and zoom technique, with long camera swoops.  In Panic Room, the camera drifts through spindles on a balcony railing, zooms into keylocks, passes through floors, and ultimately--with successive iterations--distracts from the film.Dwight Yoakam plays Raoul, a Chucky-esque baddie in a ski mask who manages to upstage Forrest Whitaker and Jodie Foster in this thinly scripted Fincher showcase.  There is not much movie here to digest, but it plays well, builds genuine tension, and benefits from Fincher's wit and skill, Shore's driving score, and, perhaps most surprisingly, Jodie Foster's skimpy tank top.7/10",Panic Room

Panic room was extremely appealing in the trailers, so I did have my reservations about it.  I think that partially I was right.  Set aside certain concerns about why, how, and what the hell happens during some parts of the movie.  I had so many of them it interfered with my viewing pleasure. When I did that and focused on just how the story developed I think I got more out of it.  Jodie Foster is good, I don't think its the movie that allows her to show off her range of acting ability.  Nonetheless, I can't complain.  Forest Whittaker's character is so cliche as a mild hearted thief that I just couldn't even get mad at the writers, I let it go.  Is Jared Leto supposed to be this stupid? Oh well, overall, I say acting was balanced out: certain weak moments were forgotten during the intense scenes.  I gave it a 7 because I didn't feel that anxiety, that sense of doom, that uncomfortable feeling I associate with psychological thrillers.  Or rather, that feeling was involuntary quite rarely.  There were parts where I knew it was expected, where I knew what was the director's and writer's intended effect, but knowing and feeling are two different things.

It's not. Simply a nail-biting, hair pulling, teeth gritting, white knuckle roller-coaster ride of a film. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but other than that a great fun film that I had a blast with. With surprising performances by Jared Leto and Forrest Whitaker.   The film opens to a recently divorced mother of a child and they are finding a new place to live, they come across a three or four story place that they decide to move into, noticing that one room is smaller than it should be, because of the panic room. A room with phones and a servaillence of the house and covered in cement and steel as thick as a tree. One night three men come into the house, not to rob, but to get something in that room, unfortunatley where Jodie Foster and daughter hide. A ride, I recommend this film only if you go in expecting no head trip like Fight Club or the film The Game (also done by Fincher) biut just expect a good solid ride.

Objectively, however, I saw some places where the film could have been a little better.  In the beginning of the film, the audience is treated with shots that are reminiscent of Kieslowski's Red, almost giving the impression of an omniscient narrator who can go literally anywhere he wants (into keyholes, through coffee pot handles, through floors, etc.). This is very cool stuff.Once the action kicks in, however, all of this changes.  Instead of gliding through the walls and maintaining the illusion that it could all be one steadily-flowing scene (not harsh breaks from one room or place to another, only intercutting within each locale), the narrator almost completely disappears.The movie is still very entertaining, but I think it could have been much eerier if David Fincher had kept the illusion that all of this was unfolding in front of one observer.8/10",Panic Room

Of course, that's exactly what happens.  Pitting the grit and fierce motherly protection of Jodie Foster against the evil intent of Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakum, the script has some genuinely intense moments. Dwight Yoakum?  In one of the worst casting experiments in recent memory, Dwight does his best to separate the country singer from the country actor and (literally) falls flat on his face.  There was so much unrealized potential in this roll that could have been filled with so many competent actors (Gary Oldman and Kevin Spacey come to mind).  Then there is the script --- more full of holes than a donut factory (you will count at least three continuity errors and a few lapses in character motivation that must have been caused by some serious editing).

352,dgoody,Possibly Fincher's best film yet,9,9 May 2002,"Every so often a an off-the-wall director plays it straight. Sometimes it blunts their edge, like Robert Altman's Grisham-by-numbers adaptation of The Gingerbread Man. Sometimes it produces an entrancing oddity, like David Lynch's The Straight Story. However it sometimes brings out the best of the director, and Panic Room is a massive example of this, showing David Fincher's class through and through. The story revolves around Meg, a recent divorcee who moves into a cavernous property in Manhattan that looks for all the world like the dream property to take care of her daughter. However on their first night in the house a trio of burglars break in and a stand-off ensues with Meg and daughter trapped in an impenetrable bunker in the middle of the house (the titular Panic Room) and whilst the burglars trying to get in to access a hidden safe. It is the greatest credit to the cast, writer and director that a stock genre situtation is shown in such a fresh and vital light throughout. From Forrest Whittaker's compromised morality to Jared Leto's drug addicted craziness each role seems so real it would be an injustice to attempt to describe them in a few lines. These are not characters, these are people and people can only be defined in a few sentences by a great artist, and here there is definate evidence of greatness at work. However where the film finds real depth is in the character of Meg. After Nicole Kidman withdrew because of injuries sustained during Moulin Rouge, Jodie Foster was brought in and the character of Meg toughened up and made less glamourous. This change in the character opens up completely different areas of the film. With the absent husband / father having left for a young model, Kidman would have lent the film an air of rejected fragile beauty being slowly crushed before finding her inner strength. A classic tale of having to reach the bottom to find a way up. However with Foster's tougher screen personna we have a battle of the rejected woman trying to re-assert her ability to function in the world alone as stronger as she did before and determined to lose no diginity along the way. The trio of intruders become like phantoms of her husband whilst her claustrophic fear of the Panic Room mirrors her fear of this strange and new world closing in around her. Given the trust of writer and director, Foster lets her body do all the acting and gives a master class in showing how dialogue should illustrate everything the character isn't saying. Fincher's visual style builds on Fight Club, even from a credit sequence that recalls North By Northwest but stands on its own in invention and execution. The whole film seems to be shot in a new form of 3D where every object seems perfectly natural, but with heightened depths, as if you were admiring the craftsmanship of a  perfectly rendered computer simulation, but without being able to see any flaws. This works perfectly in the claustrophobic confines of Panic Room where the viewer is drawn into each room of the house and left standing next to the protaganists. Despite featuring a couple of scenes which will have you screaming at the screen because of the characters stupidity to do the sensible thing, it is hard to find fault with David Koepp's taught script. However without Fincher's obsessively bleak vision to give it an edge Panic Room would have been another slick forgetable thriller, instead it is classic film-making that truly deserves the title of 21st century Hitchcock.",Panic Room

While closer than many Hollywood attempts, here's my experience with someone whose blood glucose has dipped below 40. They get very combative, not compliant. Once the blood sugar drops to the point of being in convulsions, the person doesn't ""come back"". The spell doesn't pass. The blood sugar keeps getting lower and lower until coma. The shot Forrest W. administers was mostly right, except for a few small details. At the blood sugar she was at, the daughter likely would not have been able to help him at all. Didn't you find it odd the prior owners would build this room and not put any food in it? Especially candy or other carbohydrates? There's plenty of Type-1 diabetics around to help Hollywood get it right. Most productions I've seen always get it wrong.",Panic Room
359,Barry_the_Baptist,"Flashy, gimmicky and nothing special.",5,5 July 2002,"Fincher's latest film is nothing more than an excercise in flashy camera tricks and comic/disaster situations. There are much more humorous moments then there are tense moments and the film lacks the feel of a real thriller like ""Psycho"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". This is due to the one-liner writing and absurd plot line. Granted, Fincher's ""Panic Room"" is well made and the production is nearly flawless. But the highly-stylized shots and the crazed performance of Dwight Yoakam do nothing but provide a few cheap thrills in a film that contains criminals who do nothing but ""the three stooges"" routine for the first hour of the film. This is disappointing coming from Fincher whose thriller ""Seven"" was such a brilliant film and coming off the amazing ""Fight Club"". I was expecting more than petty slapstick and a by-the-numbers performance from Jodie Foster. Weak plot but well made. Definitely a renter. Slightly above average: 6 out of 10.",Panic Room

As you can imagine, this leaves me plenty of time to pursue other hobbies.",Panic Room

Not only because I am a big fan of Fincher's work (with the exception of Alien 3), and I thought that he really did a good job with this one. Even though the plot is not always as cohesive as it should be, there is brilliant camera work, visual tricks that are A-class Fincher, good acting, solid suspense, an interesting premise and decent dialog.It was hard for me to dislike those things. Were many people get irritated by some of the plot holes (which is some sort of thing Fincher makes mistakes in more often, i have to admit, if you look at The Game for example), I could hardly notice them because of all the excitement and tension the movie was building up to.Hard to dislike it's slick style. Period. I give this movie my fullest recommendation for everyone who wants a simple thriller with excellent camera-work, acting and directing. I give it a 7/10",Panic Room
362,pepitovfr,Pretty dissapointed.,4,17 April 2002,"Saw this last night. Pretty dissapointed. Yes it had some neat ""camera work"" but I found this film unengaging, not much suspense really and with too many plot holes. There's also a lot of shameful camera shots prominently showing the Sony name on the equipment throughout the house. Hmmm, I wonder which entertainment conglomerate owns Columbia Pictures?",Panic Room
363,mk4,"This Being The Further Perils Of Pauline, Er, Jodie Foster.",3,29 March 2002,"Fincher in retrograde. Others have delved into the ""story"" but I won't bother as this sort of stuff was done better nearly 100 years ago in ""Perils Of Pauline"" (will the heroine get rescued by the villain from the locomotive/bandsaw/raft-over-the-waterfall?). All ""Pauline"" lacked was expletives and gore, which this flick has in abundance.  It's just not done right, so the effect is unintentionally comical. The suspense comes in the form of just how many holes in the storyline can the viewer spot every minute or so. After the first ten minutes of gratuitous product shots of Coca Cola, Evian and Sony littered about The House I had already lost whatever sense of going to the movies is supposed to be about because they were not even GOOD placements (Quick ECU of hand opening bedside fridge (!) reaching for bottle of Evian) and they drain any opening scenes of momentum. This was followed by some of the most unconvincing thugs that ever wandered onto a set. Jared Leto played a loud, foul-mouthed intruder in the manner of a wanna-be actor on his first audition ...I kept expecting an off-camera voice to  yell ""Thanks. We'll call you."" It's as if  Rick Fox of the L.A. Lakers (whom Leto slightly resembles) was to suddenly land a supporting role and imagined himself An Actor (come to think of it, Rick Fox might have been a better choice).  The bumbling trio is rounded-out by a psycho-killer (Raoul) portrayed by Dwight Yoakam and a con-with-a-conscience played by Forest Whitaker. Yoakam and Leto (in a real bad display of miscasting) are about as sinister as a pair of Don Martin cartoon crooks who couldn't crack an egg, let alone a safe inside of a ""panic"" room, while Whitaker does OK with his role by reading his lines without screwing them up. If he could have improvised the script, he would have (spoiler ahead) taken his partner Yoakam apart after the latter had a major malfunction to a certain part of his anatomy and was subsequently rendered harmless by an incident with a sliding steel door. These three very unwise men almost succeed in breaking into the panic room, but quit trying for some reason known only to them. An implausable episode with an air duct heightens the awareness in the viewer that this ""panic room"" is about as easy to break into as a can of sardines. There are security cams galore throughout the house, but does anybody think to do anything about them? The Whitaker character has a heart of gold and could have stopped the movie with a happy ending 2/3's of the way through, but then...oh why bother? Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart are the victims, along with you, the viewer.  And The L.A. Times is already running ""puff pieces"" in its ""Calendar"" section about ""Panic Rooms"" and why they are ""catching-on"" with the rich and paranoid under the guise of ""news"" and how ""David Fincher-this and Jodie Foster-that""... so go on and be a chump and plunk down your $8.50 and wish you didn't. Like Edward Van Sloan said in the intro to ""Frankenstein"":  ""Well, we warned you! ""Or save yourself the trouble and go rent Kubrick's ""The Killing"" and see the ending that Fincher pays homage to in his own tepid little way.  4 out of 10 for some neat camera work that will soon be turning-up in every TV spot that can afford it while it's still ""cutting-edge.""",Panic Room
364,MikeB-9,An intense thriller that keeps you gasping for breath.,9,27 April 2002,"Panic Room is a brilliant piece of film making. Fincher's unique camera shots build tension from the start and keep it going at a frenetic pace to the climax. Foster is very believable as Meg, the mom who really cares for her diabetic daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Jared Leto, Forrest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakum give convincing performances as slightly inept bad guys after millions stashed in the house. One of the key shots is a seemless camera to computer graphics to camera shot that starts in the upstairs bedroom, pulls back, down two floors, zooms through a coffee pot handle, pans and zooms through a keyhole and pulls back to 2 shot of the bad guys trying to get in the house. Another interesting shot involves an Close Up on Foster in bed with one of the bad guys, out of focus, in the back ground. The camera rotates to show Foster vertical and the bad guy horizontal. I rate this one high on intensity and camera work. Overall - 8.5",Panic Room
365,billreynolds,"An outstanding, intelligent thriller",10,23 June 2005,"""Panic Room"" is based on a spec screenplay written by powerhouse writer (and sometimes director) David Koepp. Finished in early 2000, the script was reportedly purchased for the astronomical sum of $4 million, which is a little less surprising when you consider some of Koepp's credits (Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible, the Lost World). The script is available to read on line. To me, the spec script comes across as a moderately interesting concept, reasonably well-executed --unlikely to set the world on fire.For whatever reason, David Fincher decided to follow his mind-blowing masterpiece ""Fight Club"" by directing ""Panic Room."" Based on the script alone, I had low expectations for the movie. But I should have known to have more faith in Fincher. His greatest brilliance lies in cinematography (lighting and framing shots, camera movement and placement) and editing, and those aspects of course cannot be captured on paper. Fincher has taken the opportunity with this movie to go hog-wild with interesting camera angles and movements that greatly enliven the fairly mundane story and make this movie a feast for the eyes.In particular, Fincher showed with this film and Fight Club that he has a far different concept of the use of CGI than most current Hollywood directors. He uses it not to create ""special effects"" as much as ""camera effects"" -- not to create things (explosions, spaceships, monsters or creatures) that don't really exist in life but rather to show us things that do really exist but an ordinary camera could not possibly capture (such as the inside of a keyhole, a flashlight, a four-inch ventilation pipe). In this movie the camera moves in ways I have never seen before, peering around impossibly narrow doorway openings, moving between the rails of a banister, dropping down a three story staircase in seconds, moving through the handle of a coffee maker. Remember the shot in Hitchcock's ""Notorious,"" where the camera started atop a grand staircase and gradually craned down to a close-up on a key clutched in Ingrid Bergman's hand on the floor below? That shot is legendary in film history. Well, this movie has at least a dozen, probably far more, shots like that, all realized through the utterly seamless use of digital effects technology.It's not only through technical means, however, that Fincher has enhanced Koepp's script. The movie is exceedingly well-cast and acted, with Forest Whitaker, Jodie Foster, and Dwight Yoakam all giving excellent performances. Kristen Stewart is solid and believable as the daughter. Jared Leto is at times annoying and over-the-top, but his character is meant to be so. Subtle shadings and nuances have enhanced the script at every turn, deepening the characters, sharpening the action, and improving the sometimes shaky logic of the situation.It is in the third act (the last half-hour or so) that the film most widely deviates from Koepp's original blueprint, and it is this part of the movie that is most gripping and remarkable. Visually Fincher seems to be channeling Kubrick (as well as Hitchcock) for much of the final act, with some very strong echoes of ""The Shining"" (and a few frames that strongly recall ""Dial M for Murder""). Of course Fincher's haunting, powerhouse visual style, while evocative of Kubrick and Hitchcock, is all his own, and it achieves maximum effect in these scenes.The final five minutes of the movie display a stunning level of moral and emotional ambiguity, particularly involving Forest Whitaker's character. ""Panic Room""s most obvious antecedent in movie history is probably ""Rear Window."" Unlike ""Rear Window,"" the basic story of ""Panic Room"" has no deeper resonance beyond the thrills of the moment. On the other hand, however, the resolution of ""Rear Window"" (IMO, at least) has little resonance, other than to tie up the story. The ending of ""Panic Room,"" on the other hand, is fascinatingly open-ended, and left me tantalizingly uncertain as to what to feel. It was just a great, great ending.Howard Shore's score is outstanding, and the technical credits, as usual in a Fincher film, are excellent across the board. As always, Fincher has gotten the most out of everyone, from the supporting members and all of the crew.",Panic Room

The first half of this film was great, good build up, but I just couldn't ignore several holes....The worst ones- 3 criminals, one of them an experienced guy who works for a security firm, break into a house with loads of cameras. First thing you do? Smash up the cameras, so the Panic Room occupants can't watch you, surely. Do they do that? No.Raoul gets his hand trapped in the door- a very heavy door. Does he pass out? No. Does his hand, when freed, resemble a piece of bloody paper? No. In fact, this indestructable guy get additionally whacked over the head with a sledgehammer, knocked over a bannister and still comes back for more, to be a serious threat. Ridiculous.And why, oh why,, just for once, can't the bad guys get away with it? Why did Forest Whittaker come back? Why not take off, and actually not be predictable? Using the morality thing, we know he was a 'good' character, didn't he deserve to get away with it?!This could've been such a good film....",Panic Room
367,ungerz,Another awesome movie...,10,1 April 2002,"I have walked in to see Panic Room with thinking its going to be another sleeper. Little did I know that the director of this movie is David Fincher. You might remember that he did some awesome movies like Fight Club and Se7en. Anyway as soon as the movie starts you feel confused by the unique way of the beginning credits. As the movie progresses we see some awesome effects such as the camera moving between walls, going across the house in a very very unique manner and seeing a fair amount of slow motion shots to create a great sense of suspense. Overall I was amazed by the directing. The acting was was very good. The move did kind of start slow but there were fair amounts of twists and small humor. So if you liked David Fincher previous movies you should enjoy Panic Room. I give it 9.5 out of 10.",Panic Room
368,BuffDonky,Decent but flawed film,5,4 April 2002,"David Fincher will not be winning any Directing awards for Panic Room.  He had a true opportunity to take a movie to the next level and while it was not a miserable attempt, it was a failed attempt.  The movie started strong with some very interesting camera work. Great angles and continual motion. Unfortunately, about a third of the way in Fincher seemed to lose his confidence in his ability to frame a scene properly and the movie suffers because of it.  Suspense that was created by Fincher's early movement fades and by the end the action fades into an average episode of NYPD blues...The writing is almost good but there are no signs of brilliance here at all. The bad guys were cliched.  They make occasionally interesting decisions, however they end up being disappointing.  In my opinion for this type of movie to be great, the bad guys should be the most intelligent characters in the story.  This is just not the case in this one.  They end up running around like Keystone Cops.  Jodie Foster's character is the usual semi-terrified, semi-brave one she usually plays.  It really is getting old Jodie, even if you do only make one movie every two years...The daughter reminds me of Edward Furlong from Terminator II.  That is right.  Annoying.Considering these flaws, and perhaps a few others I would have given this movie a 6 or maybe even a 7.  But for some non-sensical reason David Fincher or somebody down at the studio added on an extra 30 seconds to the movie that somehow took some of the life out of the movie.  It was a very 'made for TV' moment, and made my eyes roll into the back of my head it was so whatever.  Perhaps it could be that I never really gave a damn about the so-called heroeines in the first place... 5/10",Panic Room

I'll say that it had it's moments of suspense and a few good scenes of ""Cat and mouse"" but overall, the ""Cell phone"" scene was just SOOO rediculous, as was the scene where she lost it under the bed.

Jodie Foster, Forrest Whittaker, Dwight Yokams talents often shine in his obscured parts......I don't understand it. I really don't.

372,cyril1974,The desperate hours,8,18 July 2004,"Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) recently divorced her husband (Patrick Bauchau) because he had a relationship with another woman (Nicole Kidman, but you won't see her on screen). With her daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart), she finds a new home in a wealthy neighborhood of New York City. The apartment has a panic room, i. e. an armored shelter where people can hide and survive for a long time, in case the mansion being besieged by strangers. As Meg and Sarah spend their first night in the apartment, three men step inside the apartment looking for a missing fortune. Burnham (Forest Whitaker), the most human of the three, spent his life building panic rooms and knows all their secrets; he's only there to get the money. Junior is a spontaneous crazy and stupid young kid, and the masked and enigmatic Raoul is the head of all this and the most cruel of the criminals. When Meg and Sarah realize that strangers are in the house, they take refuge in the panic room. And this is exactly where the three guys want to have a look. They start playing a cat and mouse game.The panic room is probably the most classic David Fincher movie so far. This movie bears some similarity with William Wyler's `The desperate hours' (1955). In this respect, Jodie Foster has the exact same line as Fredric March in that movie: `Get out of my house' (except that, following the advice of her daughter, she adds:'Get the f*** out of my house!', obviously times have changed, we are some fifty years later). And I must say that Panic room holds pretty well the comparison with Wyler's movie. Much of the interest that we get is in what will be the new ideas developed by the criminals to get into the room and the creative reaction of Meg and Sarah to counter their efforts. It also strongly lies in the characters. The determination of Meg to protect her daughter and her house is equal to the determination of the three criminals to get into the room. It gives a suspenseful thriller till the last sequence. You can be a cool director making great shots, and there are a few interesting ones in this movie. But you are nothing without a good script. This movie is here to prove it again. 8/10.",Panic Room

Every film he has directed has made me say ""wow!"" and Panic Room is no different. With all the twists and turns flying around movies these days it made a refreshing change to watch a film that didn't need a huge revelation half-way through. The film was entirely shot in one location with most of the action taking place between two adjacent rooms so it took great acting and storytelling to keep the excitement levels high.David Fincher knows when to use clever visual tricks and that is one of his greatest strengths. He knows when to go into slow motion (and have me jumping up and down, shouting at Jodie Foster to ""Run!!!""), he knows when to fly around the house showing the bad guys' attempts to break in in one beautifully long take. He is a master of the camera and all of his films show it.Casting can sometimes let a movie down but this film flourished because of it. Everyone was perfectly suited in the roles. From Forest Whitaker's nice-bad-guy all the way to the random cop who suspects something is happening. Perfect!It falls short of top marks, not because of any real problems with the film, but because this film could never have been a masterpiece.

The film fails to develop its main characters adequately before overeagerly diving into the sticky situation in which the main characters find themselves for 90% of this movie.  The ""villains"" were a bit too weak in my opinion and were more comic than intimidating....not a good quality to have in a movie that is clearly intending to be a thriller. Another aspect that made them weak was that I kept finding myself thinking ""Why don't they just...and they would win!?""  I'm sorry Mr.Fincher, but I have to have a villain who has more common sense than Joe Schmo in order for a thriller to be thrilling.

Keep your eyes open -Fincher isn't simply an empty stylist, but as he's proven in all of hisfilms to date, he's a keen observer and possessed of a sly, darkwit that goes beyond his camera pyrotechnics.But I'm reading too much into it already, or at least missing thepoint of its real qualities - the fact that it more or less kicks ass.Suffice it to say, ""Panic Room"" is a great ride, and highlyrecommended to anyone looking for a genuinely tense andexciting thriller.",Panic Room

It was great to see how space was used to create tension throughout, as the film was able to utilize the room's location within other areas of the house to create tension as the characters move in and out of it. I thought that this movie was thematically and structurally similarly to another movie I watched called Flightplan. The difference is that this movie much more efficiently used the features of the house to advance its plot more so than how the plane was used in the Flightplan, and I also believed in the relationship between Jodie Foster and her daughter more in this film. I also really enjoyed the dark sense of humor that the movie has throughout, which really added to an enjoyable experience.

The ending is also very weak.There are even a few scenes that are downright boring. I don't mean slow parts, those are fine and help provide contrast with the thrilling parts, I mean uninteresting parts. Having those is bad. Having Forest Whitaker seems to be good, though.

We all love those ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Terminator"" franchises (among others) for they all carry some kind of a subtle inside process that keeps ticking as a clock while our heroes jump above pitfalls or defeat liquid robots. The audience is ready to follow these scripts anywhere as long as a tiny red thread is visible. No thread of this kind in Panic Room. Writing down the main plot lines is useless here, others reviewers did it perfectly well. How come so many acclaimed professional people (Fincher, Khondji, Foster, Whitaker, name them) could get involved in such a waste of talent ? Because waste it is. Waste of time, for the pointless plot develops no drama or suspense at all as everything has been seen before, so the audience could legitimately feel cheated on (actually... that's what happened). Waste of characters development, for they all act illogically the most absurd way, swapping behaviors from silent to noisy, bad to good, victim to aggressor, shy to fearless, negotiating to threatening ... and even from semi-dead to alive-and-kicking, all in an eye blink. Waste of money, since the set designers had this huge mansion built with no other purpose than offering to David Fincher the ability to prove his virtuosity in camera work or crazy zoom-in zoom-out shots, thanks to some CGI to help... where some viewers might have expected a chilling mouse/cat maze chase between aggressors and victims up and down the many stairs (there's even an elevator that is completely ignored... What a shame, we all know that elevators are an excellent way of making the audience sweat). Waste of acting, for no-one will buy the sadness of Jodie Foster who just got away from a divorce with a few million bucks in her pocket, the shy mother/strong daughter relationship, the obvious lack of tenderness between the mum and the kid who is just shown as some kind of partner, the stupid hate the 3 aggressors vow to each other...

It takes a cliché, boring story and makes it work. If you ignore the bland ideas and focus more on the characters, acting, action, and film techniques, you will enjoy this movie.It may be a stretch for some people, and I can understand why, but I guess for a movie like this, you just have to let your guard down and enjoy it.

385,rambow,Be afraid of small spaces,9,6 April 2002,"After hearing the early buzz on Panic Room I was curious to see if a movie about being stuck in a small room would work, especially with a big star like Foster.  It works and actually quite well.  Foster is wonderful and along with it is an inventive movie with some good twists, and come very nasty villians that add to the mix and keep it suspenseful. A nearly perfect movie, worth a full price ticket in a good theatre.",Panic Room
386,acdance,Just Okay,7,13 April 2002,"This movie wasn't scary, as some people would want you to believe it to be. However, I wasn't bored either.  Plus, I got to see Jodie Foster who I thought was a looker in this movie.***Possible Spoiler***The film kept went on fast pace enough for me to keep my interest in.  It was interesting to see a movie with mainly one background setting, which is the house.  Then the focus was on one of the rooms called, ""panic room"", where the money was hidden.One of the ""bad guys"" in the movie is Forest Whitaker, who is responsible for building the house.  What I didn't get was, if he knew where the panic room was, why didn't he stand guard in front of the room in the first place as soon as he found out that someone had moved in?  He knew there was no way an intruder could brake in to the room.  The result, the whole plot of the movie.Overall, I have to say this is one of the many slightly-above-mediocre movies that came out from the last decade.  They just don't make the movies like they used to.  As long as there are morons out there who approve of making ""movies"" like 'Freddy Got Fingered' and 'Dude Where's My Car?' (and who writes these garbage so called script???), being an average movie translates to a good movie going by today's standards.  And no, I have not seen either of the movies.  But you don't have to see the whole movie to draw a conclusion that the ""movie"" is a dud.",Panic Room
387,dadedo13,4 Stars,10,29 March 2002,"I was very excited before seeing this movie. The trailer was good, I like Jodie Foster, and David Fincher is a great director, with movies like Fight Club and The Game. I had set my goals pretty high for The Panic Room and guess what, every goal was answered and then some.  The camera work in this film is phenomenal. The camera takes us everywhere, through keyholes, coffee handles, stair banisters, etc.  The acting was also very good. Jodie Foster shows she can still act with a very versatile performance. Her daughter, Kristen Stewart, is also good, which surprised me. Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam supply great characters outside of the panic room allowing the audience to really get a feel of who they are. All in all I recommend this movie to everyone.  It's supposed to be a thriller and it definitely is.**** out of ****",Panic Room

It's almost as if Fincher has taken a break from the hard-hitting, complex style of his three previous movies, and Panic Room is a relaxed, maybe even 'on-the-side' kind of project.Panic Room has some memorable scenes, and when people ask me 'is it good?', I can only say that it's entertaining, but not to expect too much. So what good scenes? Well, go and see it and find out. All the performances are good, the actors seem relaxed. But for me, the movie, or more specifically the story, is missing something.It certainly isn't missing special camera effects, there's plenty of this sort of thing - perhaps too much. The camera goes places where cameras aren't supposed to go. It's eye candy for eye candy sake, and audiences will lap it up (I did).As a work of art, this movie is unresolved in my opinion...but like I said, still entertaining. Will make a great DVD. And I'm looking forward to Fincher's next movie - hopefully he'll be back from his 'break'.",Panic Room

Sure, the film was gripping and exciting, but aren't all thrillers like that? In my opinion, the best aspect of the film was the direction. David Fincher put some excellent camera-work into the film that is truly mesmerizing. His shot selections were perfect and precise, which makes the movie much more watchable.

394,clover27,Pleasantly Surprised,9,14 April 2002,"I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed Panic Room.  Having seen the trailer beforehand, and being put off by its overbaring noir-ish tone, I nearly didn't go.   However, being a fan of director David Fincher (and an even bigger fan of his last directorial effort, 'Fight Club') I decided to check it out.  I'm glad I did.  Jodie Foster gives an excellent performance as beleaguered mother Meg Altman, and newcomer Kristen Stewart is wonderful as Meg's daughter, Sarah.  Forest Whitaker delivers a solid performance as Burnham, the burglar with a conscience, as does Jared Leto as the cocky young Junior.Panic Room is an effectively thrilling ride of a movie, utilizing some excellent performances, fantastic camera work, awesome special effects and an almost water-tight script.  It's a much-abused cliche when discussing movies within its genre, but Panic Room really does leave you on the edge of your seat for the majority of its 112 minutes.  My only real complaints with the film are uneven performances by two of the actors.  Patrick Bauchau who plays Stephen Altman, the ex-husband of Jodie Foster's Meg Altman does not imbue his character with any sort of personality whatsoever, and as a result his character comes across as flat and one dimensional.  Maybe it's partially because the Stephen Altman character is not (physically) introduced until around halfway through the film, but we are not really given any idea of what sort of character he is. (And consequently, you don't really care what happens to him.)  Dwight Yokam's portrayal of Raoul, one of the burglars, seems to be a 'paint-by-numbers thug' role.  He does no favours (to either movie or audience) by playing it as such.  These instances where there is definite lack of character development are minor blemishes on what is ultimately an effective and engrossing thriller.   Watch out for a cameo by Seven' scribe Andrew Kevin Walker as a clueless neighbour and a (vocal) cameo by Nicole Kidman as Stephen Altman's bitchy girlfriend.   I'd recommend Panic Room as a good thriller movie - but if you're squeamish, you might be best to wait for this one on video so you can skip the yucky bits. ;)9 out of 10.",Panic Room
395,Rod-88,Old-Fashioned Thriller,5,30 March 2002,"Like the Mountain Dew commercial says, `been there, done that,' Panic Room is reminiscent of a movie from yesteryear.  It is quite simply an old-fashioned thriller.  The plot is simple, the characters are stereotypical, and of course all ends well.  Panic Room is the new film from young director David Fincher.  Fincher was a very successful music video director that went on to direct standout movies Se7en, The Game, and Fight Club.  Panic Room, however, does not live up to his `hot' reputation.  One thing that all of his previous movies have in common is that they all have surprising plot twists in the end.  Panic Room does not delivery any such twists.  It comes off as a simple thriller that does not take any chances.  Panic Room is equipped with a very good cast: Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto (who was great in Requiem for a Dream), and the quirky Dwight Yoakum.  They all turn in satisfactory performances, however, none standout playing the one-dimensional characters provided to them.Panic Room starts with an interesting premise, and it is has you on the edge of your seat in parts, however it will soon be forgotten.  This is definitely a disappointed from Fincher.  I expected a much more frightening thriller with an `edgy' quality, not this old-fashioned movie with some flashy camera shots.  In this day and age, it takes a lot more to shock or scare me.5/10",Panic Room
396,renchloctc,Great Characters in the movie especially Forest Whitaker,8,30 March 2002,"This movie starts off with a house tour and then moves slowly up like the first hill of a roller coaster.  Next it really gets moving. Jodie Foster ( ""Contact"", ""Silence of the Lambs"") and (Kristen Stewart) play mother and daughter. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman a newly divorced parent. They seem to have a good relationship. The villains in the movie are Jared Leto (""Switchback"", ""American Psycho"")  and Dwight Yoakam (Sling Blade"". Dwight Yoakam is a little psychotc to put it lightly and Jared Leto's character is a little over the top and crazy. When he panics it is sort of funny. Forest Whitaker ""Ghost Dog: the Way of the Samarai"" is part of the crew but he seems like the man with a ""heart"" throughout this thriller.  The cinematography was great and even though this is classified as a thriller it had a sppoky vibe to it. It really almost gave the feel of a horror picture. There is some violent scenes but everything seemed pretty realistic. I would rank this as my third favorite David Fincher Picture . My favorite being ""Fight Club"" then Seven.

SPOILERS AHEAD! when Meg and her child come to the house we see the mobile phone in closeup, when 3 guys come and rumble the bedroom we again see the mobile phone this time under the bed. even at that point im sure that it was clear in everyones mind that the phone would be useful in future situations. now where is the unpredictability? it was also very sentimental to see one of the robbers giving an insulin shot to the girl but hey this is all too much mainstream! even the camera movements cant make the film an exciting one. hope that Finch will regain his all-time-unpredictability in Mission Impossible 3..",Panic Room

399,morgana-6,A must for Jodie Foster fans,8,13 May 2002,"I was very pleased with this flick. It has few 'idiot' devices (i.e. only an idiot would do that), something I abhor in a thriller/mystery. How do you trap someone in their panic room so that they can't alert the police? Do it the first night in their new home, before everything is hooked up. That's not giving away much, as it happens early in the film. Thus begins the series of problems for everyone: victims and criminals.The criminals have their own problems: they didn't know anyone had moved in yet, so their keys didn't work, and what they want is in the panic room. As they attempt to coax the victims out, they have internal conflicts about how to proceed. There's a fair amount of dithering by them as one thing after another goes awry, but they are human reactions, not just plot conventions.
I've admired Jodie Foster movies for a long time, as she picks good scripts and portrays strong women. As a mother, trying to protect her daughter and to figure out how to get out of this dilemma, she's done it again. The character isn't perfect, but she doesn't panic and she uses her brain.

The cast did a great job and the writing was subtle,yet excellent, which is what you would expect from David Koepp. Jodie Foster portrayal of a nervous, quiet, almost paranoid mother, was very believable. She has always done a great job in her films and this one is no exception. Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto, and Forest Whitaker all did a great job in the film. The lighting and photography for the flick was superb except that David Fincher is relying a little too much on his tricky motion camera work that was done so well in Fight Club. I felt this movie had  a little too much of that. The movie was a simple thriller that kept me entertained. I was worried what the director was going to do next to keep the pace going but the story worked it out. The burglars kept the movie very entertaining because they seemed to be a bunch of bungling idiots who really didn't think this plan through. The ending didn't have David Fincher's twists and turns but it was good. All in all a very good movie to see.",Panic Room

However, I went and I enjoyed the movie in an overall sense.Ok, Fincher has and will do better work. This movie won't touch his cult classics like Seven, Fight Club or even The Game...well it won't for me especially for the first two...but it's enjoyable.The premise, plot, story or whatever you might call it was the lacking feature in it. The idea was cool but it just didn't seem to be one that a movie of 10 star calibre would get. However, great acting from a few solid, seasoned veterans and a brilliant sense of a directions from a brilliant director carried the movie to an above average showing.Foster is her usual amazing self with a smart, witty, and not too overemotional performance. She isn't just going through the motions in this movie but instead giving a believable, solid performance.The three villains play their roles well. Whitaker, of course, shines the brightest. But Yokam is strong as the true protaganist. Alongside as the third villain, Jared Leto continues to impress me as a strong actor in a gutty performance.It's an enjoyable movie for adults and one that all movie types can enjoy. A particular scene with a sledge hammer made the entire audience cringe, a sharp job with that by Fincher as mass audience reactions always make for an enjoyable movie.If this movie enticed you in the least bit, or if like me you love an actor or actress or perhaps the director or even movies in general. Check out Panic Room for a good viewing.My Rating: 7 out of 10 Best Performance: Sorry Jodie, but Forrest Whitaker made the movie with his acting.

404,markd-2,Excellent yet misplaced cast - subpar movie.,4,30 September 2002,"First off, I can't understand how Foster would turn down the reprising role of Clarice in a sure to be hit ""Hannibal"" and then accept the role for this sleeper. Of course, ""Hannibal"" was not a hit, which I think the poor turnout had a lot to do with her not taking on the role.But anyway, the premise for this movie about a separated mother and her diabetic teen daughter being terrorized by would be thieves, probably would have been better suited for more up and coming younger actors than the superstars Foster and Whittaker.  If they used younger stars (like those of the teen thrillers), it probably would have done better.  Adding Foster and Whittaker immediately placed the film into a more adult market, and this may be why it didn't do so well. I could see Leto and the surprisingly talented newcomer Kristen Stewart in their roles, but Foster and Whittaker seemed out of place.The movie is rather slow at times to be a thriller and I caught myself dozing at various points.  Foster just goes thru the motions of the script, and never convinces me that this role was no more than just some quick pocket cash.  Whittaker is pretty good as the tough but compassionate lead thief, and I would like to see him in more ""bad guy"" type roles, but it's still not a type of movie I expect to see him in.  Leto is very good as the hotheaded young ""rookie"" thief, and newcomer Kristen Stewart did the best acting job - from being the sassy teen to the near death diabetic teen.Overall, to me, the best part of the film is the cool style in which the opening credits were displayed. After that, it just cruised along in slow motion without really causing even a stir, yet alone ""panic"".

Forest Whitaker turns in a great performance as the guy who never wanted trouble from the beginning, and Jodie Foster is excellent as a woman who uses her intelligence under pressure. This is no female Bruce Willis, (mild spoiler) as we discover in the dying moments when she becomes totally helpless.Nearly every scene is filled with suspense and almost doesnt let up until the end. Fincher proves once again you can take a light script and turn it into an excellent thriller.9 out of 10.(Mild spoilers follow)For those who thought the criminals were too dumb, it was even spelled out right from the start. You want a movie about hyper-intelligent gangsters? See Ocean's Eleven. So what if the bad guy who went down the stairs got back up again? You dont know how much damage he sustained.

Their only defense is the built-in panic room, which unfortunately is what the thieves are after. So far, nothing innovative.The story contains a few twists, and this is a suspense movie more than anything else. But to me, the real beauty of the movie is the cinematography. I've seen this movie on a big screen, and again on a TV screen, and both are remarkable. This is a rare quality in movies.The soundtrack dictates a suspense atmosphere very adequately, and the actors are quite good (though not amazing).

414,Bravesfan82,Very Overlooked Gem,9,25 January 2016,"This is a shortened review. For my full length review, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/ I recently watched an analysis on the career of David Fincher, one of my favorite directors, and it put me in the mood to re-watch a lot of his films. It had been a while since I'd seen Panic Room, so I decided to start with that one.Panic Room is often considered to be a lesser work by the talented Fincher, but I think that's very unfair. I've always really liked the film, ever since I saw it in the theater during its release in 2002, but after watching it again, I think it may be one of Fincher's best - and a nearly perfect film.I think some of the criticisms of Panic Room may stem from the fact that it's a relatively simple film: a recently divorced woman (Meg played by Jodie Foster) and her pre-teen daughter (Sarah played by Kirsten Stewart) move into a new home, an extravagant three floor Manhattan brownstone with a secured ""panic room"" off of the master bedroom. The real estate agent explains to Meg how the room operates and how ""you can never be too safe these days"". On their first night there, a trio of men (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam) break in and intend to rob them. Fincher, by way of his technical expertise and ability to direct his talented cast, manages to elevate the film quite a bit.The film starts out with a staple of Fincher's films, an interesting opening credits sequence. While not at the level of Se7en or Fight Club, the credits for Panic Room are first rate. Thanks to the score and title design, Fincher is able to evoke the feeling of a Hitchcock-like thriller and sets up what is going to be an intense and exhilarating film. I'd even go as far to say, this is the exact type of film Hitchcock himself would have made if he were making films in the 21st century. Like the best thrillers, the back story and set up is handled well and very quickly - within ten minutes or so, we have all the pertinent information we need about Meg's separation, Sarah's medical condition, the layout of the house, and the previous owner's family squabbles.As Meg and Sarah go to sleep on that first night, the three men break into the home and Meg retreats to the panic room with Sarah in tow. It's soon revealed that the men want something that is in the panic room itself and the film is at full tilt speed very quickly, and it barely lets up at all during its 112 minute running time.Meg and Sarah are fully realized, believable, and strong female characters. Foster, who replaced Nicole Kidman early in production, gives one of her very best performances as the terrified and angry mother who would do anything to protect her child. Stewart, best known now for not being able to fully close her mouth and the Twilight franchise, showed a lot of promise as a youngster. Sarah is, at times, brash and defiant, but then also scared and childlike. Stewart is able to handle both sides of the character with ease. Their chemistry together is palpable - you really believe they're mother and daughter.The three intruders - Burnham (Whitaker), Junior (Leto), and Raoul (Yoakam) - also work well together. Each one is a bit of an arch type - the mild mannered Burnham, the spoiled hothead Junior, and the sadistic wild card Raoul - but are all so interesting and well acted that it hardly matters we've seen these types of characters many times before. Fincher introduces us to this trio with a marvelous ""floating"" camera trick - digitally stitched together in post production - that goes through the whole house in seemingly one take, following them from one door to the next as they attempt to gain access. The shot is so masterfully done, it's really a sight to behold.I mentioned the score for the opening credits, but it's really wonderful throughout. It helps build and maintain the tension all through the film, up until the breathtaking finale, where everything comes to a head. Considering I've seen Panic Room at least four or five times and know exactly what's going to happen, you wouldn't think I'd be tense and on edge while watching it, but I was. There are several moments where I caught myself actually holding my breath, due to my excitement and fear.Generally, I don't care for the use of slow motion in films, but Fincher uses it in a couple of key sequences to add to the tension and dread, and he does so with his usual technical brilliance. These moments are heart racing affairs, where I found myself wishing things would speed back up just so I could see the outcome that much sooner.Considering how suspenseful and tense the film is, it might be a bit of surprise to hear there are some great moments of comedy, as well. Most of these instances come from Leto and Yoakam's performances, but Foster manages to add a couple of her own, too. It's a perfect mix, so that you don't get overwhelmed by the darkness and the dread.My only complaint in regards to Panic Room, is that some of the character's back stories (especially Burnham's) are handled in such a stiff and obvious manner. I'm not sure how else this important information could have been delivered, but I'm sure there had to be a better way.Overall, this is a tiny nitpick, though, and in the end Fincher has managed to create one of the very best thrillers I've ever seen. I can't recommend it enough.",Panic Room

416,kirbysta,A frightfully good yell at the screen movie!,7,30 March 2002,"I finally got to see Panic Room on opening night.  The anticipation was killing me.  The movie had been hyped so much by Rolling Stone and many other critics.  Was a dissapointed?  Far from it.The movie played like a game of cat and mouse except that the people who are the cats change throughout the movie.  We hear about the house at the beginning of the movie by the Real estate aggent.  The game played by the cat and mouse then follows the rules of the house.  There are no tricks. The movie doesn't rely on plot twists to keep itself from being a ""thriller.""  I found myself yelling at the screen during the movie because the suspense was killing me.  One scene in particular where the sound is cut completely was an amazing effect.  I especially liked the camara angles and the original score by Howard Shore.  And can I just say...Jodie Foster is amazing!  She steals the show as the woman-with-a-vengence!  If you see one movie this weekend, I recommend Panic Room for its edge and it's thrills.

417,Fermented,Disappointing... (With Spoilers),6,7 April 2002,"Let me tell you, this was one of THE most disappointing films I've seen in a while, and from Fincher, no less (who I will not mention again, since his rep has been attacked frequently already).  This movie is a typical thriller movie that doesn't even make you think. **Spoilers**The first thing that truly disappointed me was the lack of any new concept in robbery.  Just like all the trailers say, ""What they want is in that room"". Well, it's money.  Yawn. Then, of course, there's the little girl.  A plot device, nothing more. I was, of course, saddened to see Jared Leto in such a plain role after ""Requiem"".  Of course, I could go on and on about how he should hold a higher standard, and whatnot, but then again, Jodie Foster did this movie as well. Then, of course, was the horribly disappointing ending.  And the fact that the guy got hit in the head with a sledgehammer, fell down the stairs, and lived. And the ""Add on"" scene, which frankly was useless (What kind of house shall we get?  I don't know, lets ask the director?).  And the terrible typical tense scenes which, for some reason, I didn't find tense at all. Actually, my favorite part was when the door close on the guys fingers, and the other guy refused to open it until she left.  That and the flying gas tank of fiery destruction.I think the entire second half of the movie should have ended in a giant slapstick ""Three Stooges"" type ending, with Jodie Foster running around the house and hitting people on the head with a sledgehammer, the masked wonder with his gun shooting at shadows and hitting the tubby guy in the butt, and some weird jokes involving needles.  It would have been much more interesting. Nyuk nyuk nyuk.",Panic Room
418,clay_animator,Terrible screenplay,4,4 July 2014,"Most of the people involved in this film did a fine job, but none of that could save this awful screenplay. The entire plot is full of these little moments where the story would have ended if the character thought for a second or acted like a rational human being.The film starts with our villains breaking in and our protagonists hiding in the titular panic room. The burglars need money out of the safe in the panic room it can't get it while it's occupied. Now, the goals of all of these characters aren't really in conflict. The burglars aren't interested in harming anyone and Jodie Foster would probably be more than happy to let them have the contents of the safe especially since she didn't even know it was there. So it would make sense for the burglars to at least try to explain why they broke in, but instead they give some cryptic answer and try to break in to the panic room. Later in the film, the burglars try to smoke the main characters out with some propane. This at least sounds like a plan that makes sense, but the way our heroes escape this is so stupid and so implausible that it makes your brain hurt. After searching the supplies for like 10 seconds and not finding any gas masks, which seems like it should be standard for a panic room, Jodie Foster decides to light the propane on fire. If I were to make a list of ways I would deal with a room filling with propane, burning it would rank somewhere below trying to hold my breath for six hours. What's worse, is this actually works without murdering everyone like it would have in the real world.The movies full of little moments like this. There's no real tension because the villains are idiots and a normal person could have waited it out in that room no problem. The only reason there's any conflict is because Jodie Foster is also an idiot.",Panic Room

421,irisofdarkness,Highly Recommended,8,21 April 2005,"Panic room is a nicely done film. The concept is really interesting because the Panic Room was supposed to be the safest room, and after all it turns out to be the most dangerous one. Many nice camera techniques are used in this film and it looks very good. The director obviously paid a lot of attention to detail. From the credits to the final scenes the cinematography is top notch. Jodie Foster was just amazing and her character was a very intriguing one because Meg seemed often confused, vulnerable, and strong at the same time. Forest Whitaker did a great job with his character. The character of Burnham is an interesting one because he was a paradox between good and evil.

If you are expecting more depth out of a film, look at David Fincher's other work.PROS: +Very original opening title scene. +The movie gets started right away.  Very few movies do this. +Cool tracking shot of the burglers breaking in. +Tight order and flow of the story. +Situations leave little room on options. +What happens to the villians.CONS: -That child was a girl?  Spend half the movie convincing myself she was a girl. -How the two get out of the propane would have killed them. -Too many hunched over boob shots. -Too many F words. -Pretty graphic violence. -Not dark (as in light intensity) enough.  David Fincher had a special camera made just for this?  It doesn't show. -Meg & Mr. Altman's relationship was not delved into as much as it should have and there was no resolution between the two. -Not much depth to the movie.

425,ibuck-2,Taut action thriller,8,14 March 2002,"Fincher has made for yet another reason to give pause while walking past the usually mundane action/thriller section at the video store.  Certainly not as complex as Seven, and without the social commentary of Fight Club, Panic Room is just a good, old fashioned, tension filled game of thrilling cat and mouse.  Most films of this sort have plot holes big enough to drive trucks through.  You find yourself hating the protagonists for being so stupid as to miss the obvious way out of the situation, or the writer/director for thinking the audience is so stupid as to not see the obvious way out. Fincher and Koepp cover all their bases, at least that I saw.  There is only one thing I saw that they didn't do at first, and it was completely understandable that they forgot about it in their panic...and they DO get to it, just not right off the bat. (Those who've seen the movie know what I mean, for the rest of you I won't clue you in)Don't look for subtext or deeper social significance, it's not there, though I did like the gradations of ""badness"" among the ""bad guys"" which lent a little bit of moral ambiguity to the proceedings. Fincher is unapologetic in his gleeful pursuit of the simple goal of scaring the pants off us.  And when it's done this well, that's enough.",Panic Room
426,aorman,Home Alone for grown-ups it ain't,7,20 April 2002,"The point of this film is to ask yourself, what would I do in this situation? For the most part, Panic Room has us asking that question at a feverish pitch.David Fincher has a wonderful directorial style that ignores the physical limitations of the world (walls, floors, etc.) when describing the spaces the characters operate in. There is also an intensity of character focus which is more prevalent in his earlier films than in Panic Room. Unfortunately this intensity disappears about two-thirds of the way through the film, and the final third becomes run of the mill and predictable in both writing and direction. Present however is Fincher's usual play with colour.Despite several attempts at shoring up the main characters, the only one whose characterisation remains strong is Bhurman (Forrest Whittaker). Raoul (Dwight Yokam) changes from a frighteningly cold-blooded mercenary to a run-of-the-mill villain. Meg (Jodie Foster) seems weak throughout, and young Sarah (Kristen Stewart) is difficult to identify with as she portrays the stereotypical annoying teen.The verdict: this is a good film, not a great one. The first two thirds are a delight to watch for Fincher's direction, the last third is disappointing.",Panic Room

I just don't get it.  Panic Room is full of flaws.  Every character in this film makes TERRIBLE decisions. There is no reason for the majority of action that the characters take, except of course to create drama, and therefore to produce a movie. But I say, if it's so obvious to the audience that the characters keep making BAD decisions (and therefore digging themselves deeper into trouble), all to create ""plot"" and ""tension"", then what's the point?Once the bad guys entered the house and the real ""action"" began, I started to panic . . .

The ending was kinda impossible (this guy gets knock with an hammer and falls 2 stairs. however he comes back up alive, not to mention that his fingers have been already cut from an earlier scene!  come on!)  other than this part, the ending was all right.  however, the reason one should go watch is movie is because of Jodie Foster...did i mention how good she is?",Panic Room

But this is only the half of it, as the plot turns this way and that as Foster and the burglars battle wits.The tension between adversaries is excellent, but what I really liked about this film was the style element. Fincher uses camera viewpoints that would move impossibly through walls, windows and pipes, to truly explore the panic room's connections to the outside world, and the house itself, to bring across the interesting concept that the film and story were as much about the property (as a character) than the actual people in it - and I'd not really seen that do before so well, if at all.Very competent thriller, and highly enjoyable.My score: 8/10.",Panic Room
432,robert-jalberg7,"5/10. Not a patch on Se7en, The Game and Fight Club",5,18 January 2004,"David Fincher came up with some of the most arresting visuals and ideas in the 1990s - Se7en, The Game and Fight Club, but this dark thriller doesn't reach the same high standards.It is a watchable affair nonetheless, with Jodie Foster as a recently separated mother searching for prime New York apartment block space with her 10-year (roughly) old son (Kristen Stewart). The apartment is spanking brand new with all the mod cons, including the all important ""panic room"", a kind of impenetrable safe for humans. This comes in handy when their quarters are invaded by a group of professional burglars (Billy Bob Thornton, Forest Whittaker and Dwight Yoakam).A battle of wits ensues, but it becomes increasingly hackneyed and silly, particularly the bit with the gas pipe. It has plenty of tense moments, but the daft plot lets it down. The gloomy visuals add a certain degree of class, however.If you have seen Desperate Hours and many other films of this type, then you will pretty much know the routine.",Panic Room
433,haegint,Completely unbelievable,2,27 March 2006,"I am a great admirer of director Fincher's earlier movies The Game and Seven. Fight Club was of lesser quality in my opinion and Panic Room is a complete letdown. Normally I find my IMDb ratings not much out of line with the consensus vote. But here I'm at a great difference. The main issues for me are the abstruse story and the female lead character. The plot outline is unconvincing to start with and the script is not good enough to make the viewer a believer. The gangsters do idiotic things, certainly not what real thieves would do (for example minimize noise). The dialogs are painfully bad to listen to, for example when the gangsters fight among themselves. It all comes across very forced and constructed. Then Jodie Foster is the coldest woman on the planet. I get a deep-freeze in my pants whenever I see her. As a mother she is completely unbelievable in the sense that she might have embraced a man in love to receive a child, and a terrible miscast in this movie. There is no grace, no redeeming charm whatsoever in her performance here. No wonder her movie husband left her! (Actually Foster's last good performance was in Nell, that suited her perfectly.) Hollywood is full of ""older"" attractive lead actresses who would have been so much better suited to star here and make a terrified mother actually believable: Kim Basinger, Michelle Pfeiffer, Andie McDowell, Deborah Unger (from The Game)... I'm sure I forget to name another 20 top candidates. So please Mr. Fincher, choose your next script carefully and cast a believable woman (again)! You can do better than this. Panic Room just doesn't work!",Panic Room

Now the story is a great idea but it's hard to make a film long 2 h and keep it interesting when it's a one place film. They should make it shorter for at least 15-20 min and keep us on the edge of our seat. Some scenes are too long, and u get bored. But still it's a pretty good film whit good acting, nice camera movement and a interesting story.Panic room is about a divorced mother who moves in to a new house whit her daughter. It's a big house whit a room called the panic room. The room is used when the owner is in danger and can not get out of the house. And it happens that the first night of their stay some people brake in. They tough it was empty but it showed it wasn't. But since they are hear there is no point of going back since there is a lot of money in the house. The problem is the money is in the panic room, and mom has been able to get in whit her daughter...As i sad this hat a lot of potential but it kinda lets u down whit some slow moments and some typical h'wood cheese. The best performance comes from Forrest Whitaker who i think has a good future. The rest of the cast puts on a good performance too. Now i very much liked the camera movement. Yes some were made whit fx but still looked cool. Also a very nice direction by Fincher.So overall i liked the movie but hoped for a little bit more. Now Fincher is no Hitchcock but still did a great job of keeping us interested of how it ends. Koepp is a good writer but has some faults.

They're there, it's only them five (mostly), and the plot's simple and to the point. Acting was incredible, but the writing could've have been a bit more imaginative. A lot more, to be honest.However, one major thing I hate about the story is that the three intruders are going through all of this for JUST 3 MILLION DOLLARS? From all the crap that they've suffered throughout the length of the movie, in my opinion getting into the panic room wouldn't be worth the trouble unless there was AT LEAST 10+ million. I get that one of them let it slip that there was actually almost triple the amount in the locked safe than he had let on, but by that point he was ready to quit. Initially, the other guys agreed to go through all of this for just 3 million dollars, makes you wonder just how bloody desperate they truly were?",Panic Room

I only had one complaint in this movie. I'll explain later.The cinematography in this movie was excellent. Conrad Hall does an excellent job of creating a moody atmosphere with the lighting and camera tricks. I especially liked how he made the camera ""fly"" in and around the house, very nice. (When you see the shot of the burglars first entering the house, you'll see what I mean.)Oscar worthy work, in my opinion.Again Howard Shore provides a great score, almost reminiscent of his work for ""The Cell."" No need to say more here.The screenplay by David Koepp was great. The story has been done before: a burglary that turns into a cat-and-mouse game with a twist: the use of a panic room. You'd think that with this tried format, the story would be rather boring, but with Hall's camera work, Shore's score (hey that rhymes!) and Koepp's script, this is a VERY intense piece of work. Which brings me to my complaint.The ads for the movie proclaim a movie that will make you jump out of your seat. I did not jump out of my seat; in fact, I didn't even jerk back in my seat. I was hyped for something that wasn't there. Don't get me wrong, the movie/story is great, but just not scary, and that was what I was looking from this movie: to be scared. Although, my heart was going pretty fast towards the end and a few moments in between.So if you're looking for a good movie to take your girlfriend/boyfriend/fiancee/wife/husband/best friend to, go see Panic Room.

I agree with most, this film severely lacks the potential you expect from Jodie Foster. The first act (prior to them going in) is basically just moping about. It kept coming back to me how a single mother can afford this cavernous mansion in Manhattan. I cracked up when the daughter (it took me a while to realise it was a girl) said, ""What's going on?"" or whatever and Mum replies, ""People in the house"" or something. Just in case she didn't spot the armed men, one of whom has a balaclava on, right in front of them. Well, duh! It's such a slow film - sure the photography is okay but the music is too dramatic. The music reminds me of ""Silence of the Lambs"" but without the tension.The characters are inconsistent (well, the one with the braided hair who swears a lot).The film is on in the background now and I lost interest just before she ran and got the cellphone.The other half is enjoying it but honestly, after reading some of the reviews on here, I'm not going to waste my time!!",Panic Room

However, his latest release, ""Panic Room"", isn't what most would expect from him. Unlike his previous films, the plot of this one is considerably straight-forward. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman who, as a single mom having recently settled a divorce with her wealthy husband, moves into an expensive four-story brownstone in the Upper West Side of Manhattan along with her 11-year-old daughter, Sarah. The brownstone looks to them like the ideal place to live - equipped with all the modern-day conviences. It even has a ""panic room"" that encases you behind a steel door in the event someone were to break in. Now that's protection!What they didn't expect though was that three burglars - Junior, Burnham, and Raoul - had come prepared to rob the house that night. They're looking to find a safe, one that the original owner of the house had kept hidden in the floor somewhere, that contains millions in bonds. They break inside, surprised to find the the new owners had already moved in. Meg wakes up and finds there are thieves in the house, and immediately runs to wake up her little girl. The mother and daughter quickly lock themselves up inside the panic room, narrowly escaping capture. Unfortunate for them, even though they're safe, the emergency phone with which to call the police is dead. And of course, as you may have guessed, the safe that these crooks are looking for happens to be inside in the panic room.Burnham, the burgular whom Forest Whitaker plays, built the house and knows every niche and cranny of the place. He informs Junior and Raoul that it is impossible for them to penetrate the steel door. He says that in order for them to get inside the panic room, they have got to somehow get the woman to come out. This incites a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse between Meg and the men who threaten the lives of both her and her little girl. Its all very intense.""Panic Room"" is somewhat different from David Fincher's other movies. According to the director, the film is a popcorn flick. ""There are no great, overriding implications,"" he claims. ""It's simply about survival.""Even so, Fincher still manages to deliver the goods as usual - displaying the same stylish cinematography he showed in ""Fight Club"", as well as his knack for keeping people on the edge of their seat as he did with ""Alien 3"" and ""Seven"". Not only that, but the film also features a terrific and energetic performance from screen veteran, Jodie Foster.

Its the kind of film playing on the siege mentality done to perfection in 'zombies dawn of the living dead', except that in this film, the loose ends and unreality get to the point where halfway through you just wanna scream at the screen and go 'oh yer - how realistic that is - not!'. To be honest I half expected donald duck and mickey to knock at the door.Now for some brief examples and possible spoilers so stop if you wannna actual suffer and see this movie with no for knowledge.

Sure if the people concerned were affiliates of buffy, but they were meant to be regular guys. There are many others (the fire!, the phone!) For me the very nature of this film as with say oceans eleven or the score which are somewhat similar is that it covers all angles in the clever plot so there are no loose ends.

443,Beachwood,Home Alone IV,4,30 March 2002,"Where do I start?  WANTING IT TO END!  This film is definitely David Fincher's worst movie yet.  Worse than Alien 3 (Fincher's least favorite, of his works)? Definitely.  Some of you, including the person who wrote the plot summary (What are you his mother?) may disagree with me here.  So...I give you this rant.  His shot's might as well have been hand drawn because the CGI is just plain ridiculous.  Jodi Foster does ok but her acting is overshadowed by her Cleavage.  Dwight Yoakum's character might as well have been named Larry (everyones favorite ""Home Alone"" cap-burglar).  With his stamina nothing short of kryptonite should be able to hurt him.  The pop-culture references in this movie are worse than those written in this humble review.  This rant could go on... but why waste the time.  Everyone is still going to love this movie, and I can't wait to hear from all the kids at school and as to how ""Panic Room"" blew their minds.",Panic Room

The movie is at best so-so, but there are just too many instances of ridiculous behavior that I got tired of it. It's the typical problem with such a narrow concept of a movie, that constant coincidences and misguided actions are necessary to maintain the plot. I probably could have forgiven most of those implausibilities and flaws had it not been for the horribly pathetic and cliched ending. At best I can say that the acting was decent and Fincher has some good moments of direction, but overall a throwaway movie.",Panic Room

The movie is cinematically gores, very inspiring actually, the movie takes place during only several hrs on one rainy night, a great hitchcock attitude that is. People complain about the flaws of the panic room that was made in the house and then rate the movie negatively??? WTF??? Absolute BS. The majority of the negative ratings for this movie on IMDb are not actually related to the movie, but actually to props and sets in the movie. The flaws in the room and its weaknesses MADE THE MOVE WHAT IT IS.OMG!!!! A HOLE IN THE WALL IN THE ROOMM!!!!! AHH, 2/10 stars!!! I can't handel that!!!!This is a great, dark movie and is in fact highly suspenseful.

446,SteveL,"Good, but not quite what it could have been.",7,29 March 2002,"In ""The Panic Room"" we have a fine colleciton of actors, a good director and an interesting premise - all the elements for a great film.  Sadly, it never quite got there.  There are gaps in the story line, bouts of unnecessary violence, predictable plot turns, and incomplete character development. There are some great directorial choices involving unusual camera angles and live action intermixed with B&W closed-circuit TV effectively using both visuals and audio.  The movie kept moving at a fair pace and the 2 hours flew buy.  Overall it was eminently entertaining.  Not as good as ""Wait Until Dark"" but better than ""What Lies Beneath.""",Panic Room
447,apuluvmanjula,Why this is the greatest film of 2002 (so far)...,9,27 March 2002,"Because most of the films released so far this year have been really dull and uninteresting, whereas this film actually engages the viewer for more than twenty minutes.  Intense thrillers don't get much better than this.  I suggest you go see this film with a large audience.  If the audience has as much fun as mine did, you will be cheering and gasping with all the rest of 'em.  Never in all my years have I ever witnessed a movie-going audience cheer and applaud at a particularly intense moment in any film.  ""Panic Room"" actually makes you fear for the lives of Jodie Foster's Meg Altman and her daughter (who oddly enough is a bit of a tomboy--go fig).Speaking of Jodie Foster, she has never been better.  It's a wonder why we never see more of her in film.  After her two Oscar wins before she was thirty, one would think that she would be the most highly sought after actress in Hollywood.  But, being the choosy woman she is, she only plays in the films that interest her.  And it's no surprise what drew her to this role.  On one hand, Meg Altman is a bit of a paranoid, borderline clautrophobe insistent on moving into a very large New York townhouse with a special ""panic room"" she can hide in if worse comes to worse (which it actually does--on the first night in the house!).  On the other, she is a tough, resourceful woman who remarkably shines through the toughest binds, especially when attending to her diabetic daughter.  This is not too much to give away, as the film manages to convey this highly suspenseful twist through a very subtle and implicit means.  Very little of this film is out-right revealed.  You have to pay attention, if you blink for just a minute you may miss something important.David Fincher does it again by taking a relatively simple story line (three burglars break into a large house to find a hidden stash of cash while the two inhabitants are inside) and weaves this brilliant thriller into a wonderful thrill ride.  I'll even go so far to give Kudos to Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and the surprisingly convincing yet purely EVIL Dwight Yoakam for their ecstatic performances as the three burglars.  Jared Leto is probably the most inept and ridiculous burglar out there and one cannot help but laugh at his banter with Dwight's Raoul and Forest's Burnham.  That banter though quickly subsides (thankfully, as too much may have ruined the film) as the real action begins...I won't say much more to keep the fun from being wasted.  Have some fun this Easter weekend and go to see this great film.  You won't be sorry!",Panic Room
448,ressandeys,not a great movie...but entertaining,7,31 March 2002,"panic room. what can i say? its not the best fincher has to offer, but if you want something just to watch, i'd recommend it. had some good parts, got silly at the end. but, an ok flick nonetheless. gave it a 7/10 only because david fincher is one of my favorite directors. if he didnt make it, id give it a 4 or a 5",Panic Room
449,magic_rich,An all round excellent effort,7,20 May 2003,"I very much enjoyed this movie, both from a technical and performance point of view. The performances by Foster and the girl were excellent, and the intruders did exactly what was required of them. The cinematography was also impressive (similar to fight club) and unusual for a movie like this, with very dark and steady scenes, and a very ingenious fluid movement around the house (although I think the 'camera goes inside a light bulb' movement was pushing it a little).The ending dragged on a little bit, but ended on a pleasing note and the opening credits were unlike anything I've seen before.***1/2 / *****",Panic Room
450,gustafsundberg,Nice start....,5,18 April 2010,"But unfortunately it continues in a bad performance throughout the movie. Jodie Foster doesn't exactly do her best performance, and the same goes with Withtaker. Although these two people were the movie's good parts. The rest is just a confusing mess with a bunch of plot-holes. The entire script is just an annoying piece of fail which unfortunately keep the viewer looking for holes. So I will, as most people already have done, make a list of things I found strange with this movie.1,Why doesn't the burglars use the microphone close to the bed? 2,Wouldn't it be more appropriate with a common surveillance system like all other houses, instead of a locked room without any food? 3, Why doesn't the movie handle daughter's diabetic problem? It just appears out of nowhere 4,How did her husband get in? Why didn't they at least lock the front door? 5, Why does Withtaker let go of the money when it is safely inside his collar? He could try to stash them or at least keep them. 6, How could the burglar that got hit with the sledgehammer survive? How could he walk after falling down 4 meters? How could he after this have the powers to assault a woman when his hand is completely destroyed? 7, What is the purpose of stealing the money? Who has stashed it? Why is it there? 8, Why does Jodie walk right past her husband when she sees him lying ""dead"" on the bed? 9, Why does the criminals accept that Jodie destroys the camera system? She could potentially bring the police. 10, Why doesn't the daughter stab the two men with the syringe earlier? 11, Why is Jodie's face so weird in the end just before they cut to black? What does she see? It just stops so sudden.You could probably fill in with more stuff. I just did this to ease my heart a bit, and somehow prove my point.Bottom line: This movie has some good parts. I really liked the opening credits, the magnificent camera work and the CGI. But this movie doesn't get onto you. It doesn't play on your emotional strings. Predictable plot, blatant characters and a bunch of plot-holes makes it hard for this film to really suck you in and make you participate in the action. I give this movie a 5 out of a 10, because it's still a entertaining flick, at least it gives you one or two laughs ;).Gustaf",Panic Room
451,jasonpb,A very entertaining movie,7,1 April 2002,"I got the chance to see Panic Room this weekend, and I must say  it is quite good.  Jodie Foster makes the movie work, (as always) and all three of the criminals were well-played.  One of the things that works best in the movie is that the chemistry between the ""villiains"" is very amusing.  One criticism of this movie is that the ending is predictable, and even obvious.  The movie makes up for this, however, with incredible cinematography throughout. David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven) can and does put the camera wherever he wants to.  He even takes it inside a keyhole at one point.  Even though the filming is limited to a house, Fincher makes it work.  He scrolls up and down the floors of the house, and in and out of bedrooms.  I also like the way he pans around an entire room, adding to the feeling of mystery provided by the surprisingly good soundtrack. I give it a solid 7/10",Panic Room

I went with no expectations and no idea's in my head. I thought the movie was really good. It was a well made movie with good acting and good direction. The script was original and it made for excellent entertainment. The movie is about a divorced woman in her 30's called Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) moving into their new house in New York. On the first night in their new home, three men break into the house in order to retrieve a hidden cache of cash. Mother and daughter hide in a secret room called the ""Panic Room"" which has been built for such emergencies. They are safe for the moment as no one can get into the room...but the men need to get in there. Because what they're looking for is hidden inside that room. I would recommend this movie as it is well made and provides good entertainment. Which is what movie's are supposed to do in the first place.8/10",Panic Room

I was really shocked that Nicole Kidman played Stephans girlfriend on the phone.This movie was so cool. I wish that we had a panic room at our house. they seem so fun and are a great idea for people who live in a city where they have a lot of burglaries. Having a panic room was such a good idea for a movie.It was cool how the panic room was so dark but i hated it when the lights kept flickering it really hurt my eyes.In conclusion this movie rocks and i will watch it next time its on TV even though i own the DVD!,Panic Room

Any director who wants to make a Thriller genre should watch this film.I was hooked up from start to finish. Jodie Foster displayed both vulnerability and resoluteness at the same time. The mother and daughter have to confront the intruders who want to get their hands on the money which is kept inside the panic room. Initially, unaware of their motives they holed up inside the same panic room. How they overcome this situation forms the crux of the story.Forest Whitaker also displayed compulsion as well as compassion to his character simultaneously.I highly recommend this movie. Watch it because it is one of the best film in thriller genre.",Panic Room
457,czarinaanya,Good thriller with two strong female leads,9,10 April 2015,"I like this thriller. Maybe it's a ""girl power"" thing. But I think it is a good entertaining movie. Maybe not the most unpredictable plot out there, but good for a Sunday with nothing else to do. i could do with a bit less gore and a LOT less F bombs but with a movie that has other aspects that make me like it enough, I can look past that. I want to address a few recurring complaints I have seen in other reviews. For one, GET OVER Kristen steward's ""boyish"" look. The comment ""didn't know at first if it was a boy or girl"" is a common comment in reviews I've read. When she started filming panic room she had just finished shooting a movie where she plays a girl that looks like (and is mistaken for) a boy. Thats why her hair is so short in this movie. (obviously she chose to really cut it rather than use a wig). Get over it. It's not that big of a deal and there's a very logical explanation behind it. If you don't want spoilers click off of this review right now. Also some have talked about the ""unrealistic"" depiction of diabetes. You want unrealistic, watch Con Air, where a character claims he'll die without his insulin in a short time. (Unlikely.) In panic room it IS realistic that Stewart, a type 1 diabetic who is thin, is prone to low blood sugar in times of stress. She probably took a little extra insulin because she drank extra coke (watch the pizza scene where Foster tells her to go easy on the soda but then ultimately pours her more). Taking her insulin like she should (and a little extra maybe) WOULD put her at risk of dangerously low sugar if there is something unexpected like missing her next meal, exercising, being under stress. It is realistic, I know Type 1 diabetics who have to stay up all night some nights to monitor their blood sugar because it's too low and won't stay up. Hypoglycemia can go downhill very quickly. And in the ""almost coma"" scene, Forrest Whittaker is NOT giving her insulin (as someone complained) they are giving her a shot of sugar, most likely glucagon, which diabetics do keep in syringes for emergency and is an appropriate treatment for this situation. It does not have to be given intravenously as someone claimed, and would be easy for someone who doesn't know much about injecting. (He should have cleaned the site first though and it shouldn't have been kept in the fridge but rather room temperature.) The most unrealistic thing about the diabetes storyline is the special monitor she wears on her wrist. From what I understand that technology (especially in 2002) is still very much ""in the works"" and isn't really ""a thing' yet. My last rebuttal to other reviews is the scene where Forrest Whittaker gets arrested and loses all the money. OK maybe you want him to get away with the money because he's not such a bad guy. Im' not saying I felt differently, but I always saw this part of the movie differently. I saw it as a noble sacrifice, like the man in ""A tale of Two Cities"" who dies so the woman he loves can live happily ever after with the man she loves. In Panic Room, Forrest Whittaker is getting away with the money when he hears and realizes that the mother and daughter are still in danger. He hesitates a split second before going back to help them. I think it's a conscious decision he made, the ultimate sacrifice and redemption, that he KNOWS going back to help them can cost him his escape, but chooses to do it anyway because they're innocent and he can't live with himself if they come to harm. He values their lives over his own freedom. That's why when he does get caught and releases the money into the wind he has a look of resignation. I think he mourns his freedom, family, and the wealth he almost had, but that he knows he did the right thing and that gives him a peace about it all. I think it speaks volumes about what kind of person he really is deep inside. That makes him ultimately my favorite character. LOL I didn't mean to get so philosophical but it is a good movie and well worth the watch on a rainy Sunday without too much else to do.",Panic Room

461,AnnieO-2,Great Directing by David Fincher,8,31 March 2002,"Not to lessen the quality of any other part of this film, but the best part is truly the directing by David Fincher. His unique camera use of one continuous shot, even when changing floors, helps make him one of todays more original directors. He creates his own identifiable style so you KNOW when you are watching a David Fincher film. The story does seem a little slow moving, but it really is necessary since their (the three men who break into the house) original plan was disrupted by the presence of Jodie Foster's character having moved into the house, so naturally they had to think as events occur. And of course Jodie's reaction wouldn't be planned so she wouldn't be prepared in three seconds. The casting was excellent. Dwight Yokam was very creepy and evil, while Forrest Whitaker draws some amounts of sympathy from you. Jared Leto plays off his part very well also, and the three together have a nice blend of chemistry and detestment for each other, that, at some point makes you laugh a little. It's filled with plenty of surprises that make it a great thriller. I saw it in a packed theatre which I think has the best effect so you can feel the tension of the audience in the air.

The first 15 minutes nothing is going on, only information to the audience. Wouldn't it be better to learn about the panic room once they are in there? Instead of a long scene in which they explain everything about it and further more... there is no dramatically tension about the panic room. Is her daughter diabetic... why? only because they need a reason to be out of the room? This film has nothing to do with Mr. Hitchcock. Absolutely nothing. Hitchock made The Rope... one shot one set! This story needed that... Fincher thinks is hip and cool to move the camera around or through a key hole but... why? to show us that the house is not so safe? You can do better than that!

466,bunior,Stunning choice of wardrobe for Jodie Foster,7,20 February 2005,"Sorry, I just had to get that in there before I started.'Panic Room' is essentially a basic cat-and-mouse thriller with a decent premise, typically over-stylised by director David Fincher. Fincher's work is mostly enjoyable, and the end result looks polished and pristine, but sometimes you have to ask yourself exactly why he does things the way he does.When Jodie Foster and her daughter move into a new house, they must spend their first night in the panic room, a specially reinforced room built into the house to protect you and your family in the event of a break-in, as that is exactly what has happened - burglars, in the form of Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakam, who, incidentally, have come for the hidden millions in the panic room.Like I said, it looks good throughout, Fincher's trademark camera-work and effects and tricks on show nearly the whole time (shots moving through cup handles and cross sections of flooring), but what sets it above being just another run-of-the-mill thriller are the lead performances. Foster is excellent, as always, and the three intruders play brilliantly off one another. Yoakam injects a real creepiness to Raoul, Whitaker always the strong, level-headed Burnham, and Leto in frantic mode with a little hint of Tyler Durden as Junior (although he looks like he got Forest Whitaker's hairstylist).There are some good action set pieces and a tense moment here and there, but nothing that's going to have you on the edge of your seat. The movies suffers a little from predictability and a lack of pace, but the dramatic finale rounds it off well enough. A salute to the fact that a movie can be good through good performances, so why does David Fincher insist on drawing it out so he can add more clever camera tricks? Is it for us or is it for him?",Panic Room
467,Emma D,Jodie Foster Rules!!!,10,25 April 2002,"I went to see this movie the other night with high expectations.  David Fincher has directed 2 of my fav. films, Fight Club and Seven.  Jodie Foster is one of my fav. actresses.  She has yet to give a bad performance in a movie.Now, usually when expectations are high, the film doesn't deliver.  This film delivers.Foster plays Meg Altman, who is buying a new home for her and her daughter after the break up of her marriage.The new house has a 'panic room', a room that is secure and can not be broken into.  It has it's own phone line, security cameras monitoring the whole house and basicly everything you would need to survive if you had to hide there.  The house is broken into, and what the bad guys want is in the panic room.And so starts the fun!  Jodie is great, as is the girl who plays her daughter.  The relationship between them seems real.  The bad guys are bad, but they are human which is great.  They aren't two dimensional characters, which most bad guys in the movies are these days.Any one who likes thrillers, which are few and far between these days, should see this film.  It is definitely one of the very few thrillers that thrills!!!!",Panic Room

He smoothly runs the story using many elements of the house to increase the suspense and smartly use the camera to make you feel the darkness of the atmosphere.

Fincher always does great stuff (the title sequence of Fight Club for example).  It was amazing to me how they pulled off some of the shots. This made the house actually seem like it was one of the characters in the film.The acting performances were all very strong.  Jodie Foster had wonderful believable chemistry with the young girl who played her daughter.  The other three characters also played well against them.  Dwight Yoakam was particularly menacing, and Jared Leto's character added some much needed lighter moments to the story.It was entertaining and certainly provided a decent 2 hour distraction.  I didn't find it as ""edge of your seat thrillerish"" as it has been billed in reviews.

In this day and age, it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't rely on flashy action sequences and contrived ""climaxes"" to generate tension.  This movie was one of the smartest I've seen in recent memory. Sure, it was a bit predictable (I never thought the two main heroines wouldn't come out alive), but the tension generated by the cinematography, directing, and performances of the actors (which were outstanding) was much higher and more satisfying than most ""thrillers"" filmed lately. For those of you who were confused/upset/bored by ""Panic Room"", I suggest you stick to watching movies more in your intellectual range...like ""Pearl Harbor"" or any other dreck produced by Michael Bay...

473,adrian-87,"makes me think of Hitchcock, without being a copy",9,23 May 2002,"I went to see the panic room because I was wondering how David Fincher mannaged to translate this relative simple idea to a movie. Therefore I was a little bit sceptical about this movie. But after the first title screen was displayed, I knew this one was going to be OK. The title part is a verry nice piece of art wich sets the standard for the rest of the movie. David Fincher has done a great job on the camera movement through the house, with a camera flying through a coffee maker and through a light bulb as absolute highlights. The story is simple, but yet verry good translated to the white screen. In some way this movie makes me think of Hitchcock, without being a 'Hitchcock-copy'.All the actors display a good level of acting skills, (Jody Foster is good as always) and especially Forest Whitacker does a very good job, playing the 'not-so-bad-badguy'. The only negative part of the movie is the ending, wich, in many ways, does not fit the overal quality of this movie.
So, the question rises: Ís this Fincher's best movie ever?' For me, the answer is yes, since he managed to create an even better atmosphere (mostely, because of te briliant camera movement) than in his other masterpiece, the fightclub.9.0/10",Panic Room

So I thought to give it a shot. And I enjoyed it thoroughly. It's a claustrophobic thriller which acts more like a cat and mouse game.Almost completely shot indoors, yet it showcases some of Fincher's best efforts with the camera.Like always, Howard Shore has done a brilliant job with the score, setting the tone of this pulsating thriller.Jodie Foster is outstanding as a recently divorced mother with a teenage daughter(played by a very young but brilliant Kristen Stewart!) who isn't scared to take matters into her own hand. She is intelligent and likes to take necessary risks.More a player than a pawn. Her worthy opponent is one of the illegal intruders (played with excellence by Forest Whitaker). He is spot on as a criminal with compassion who is somehow forced to play the role of an antagonist in the great game of life.I wouldn't rank it among Fincher's well-known masterpieces like 'Seven'/'Fight Club'. But, overall, a decent 'edge-of-your-seat' thriller.No doubt about that.If you love this kind of movies, then you should give it a try.",Panic Room
475,lisa_thatcher,David Fincher misses the mark.,5,3 October 2014,"Panic Room is the first time we see a genuinely intellectually bereft David Fincher, but it won't be the last, and it probably is no coincidence that it exists hot on the heels of one of Fincher's least successful films, which ironically will become one of his most popular. Sandwiched between Fight Club and Zodiac, two of Fincher's best, if not his best, it has the feel of an exhausted director and a conflicted film maker who wants (needs) to invite a larger audience. In Panic Room, Fincher is still attracted to strong themes. The house is a transitional space for Meg (Jodi Foster) and Sarah (Kristen Stewart), over large and painted as a threatening space, just as Fincher did with The Game. In The Game the family home is a threat to Nicholas because it is the scene of his fathers suicide which laid a trajectory Nicholas inevitably follows. In Panic Room, the enormous house is a threat because Meg has left the safety of her marriage and is venturing out of the family home into a house she will need to defend with her androgynous daughter Sarah. Meg is in a feminist transition, Sarah is a new generation of self sufficient female. And yet, Fincher strangely keeps the force of his directorial presence at the surface, resting only on the house as impregnated fortress and the panic room as both a source of safety and vulnerability. Panic Room is a new set of problems for Fincher, different to what had with Alien³, which was the only film that could be counted as a failure prior to Panic Room being made - at least the only one Fincher really considered a failure. It could be that Fight Club just took too much out of him, because we don't see the surfacing here of a need for commercial appeal, but rather a failed attempt in the stylistic approach that leaves the film soulless.Panic Room comes out in 2002, right at the start of a new century and it becomes one of several films at the time to use video surveillance as a vehicle for a citizens big brother style of visual oppression over each other. The cameras are static, while Fincher's camera is the only entity that can move through the house with giant sweeping motions that imply an all-seeing eye. The fixed video surveillance is always seen through the presence of the character watching, and it immediately provokes reaction. It is only when Meg destroys the cameras that she is able to defeat the intruders, and provoke the comment ""Why didn't we think of that"". Yet none of this scope is portrayed with the substance that, for example, the Ikea catalog house is portrayed in Fight Club. Fincher is able to give the aesthetic sense of all of us living in an Ikea catalog in Fight Club, cross referencing the square cleanliness of the apartment and the office against the ruinous warmth of Tyler Durdens mansion. While Panic Room stands on its high themes, Fincher never properly establishes a connection between the human creatures who are both trapped and liberated by their video equipment. Meg is distrustful of the equipment immediately, from her claustrophobia (which bizarrely disappears) through to her struggling to program the electronics of the panic room, and subsequently not hooking up the phone line. We never get a sense of an immersion, a connection with the equipment, therefore we never get a sense of it betraying her, as we do with the Ikea houses. Fincher overlaps her ""scared housewife"" persona with an ineptitude that, although overcome toward the end in triumph, still keeps her at a distance from what could have been the most powerful theme of the film, if Fincher hadn't shied away from it. Think of Sex Lies and Videotape (made thirteen years earlier) and the way Soderbergh was able to establish a connection between the anxiety surrounding human interaction and the relief of distance created through the surveillance properties of video. Fincher is never able to convince us of a two-edged sword connection between the advantages Meg clearly has because she can see her intruders, and the problems this causes for her.This is especially highlighted in the first time Meg sees the panic room, and makes a reference to Edgar Allen Poe. This has some significance when later we realize the burglars want to infiltrate the house in order to get to the panic room which sits like a proclamation of what is to come, think of The Raven, but loses power when compared with The Tell Tale Heart, which is obviously the story being referenced. The old man's ""evil eye"" is the video surveillance, and the young man's murder represented in the relationship between Junior (Jarod Leto) and the old man who lived in the house previously (who built the Panic Room) as well as Meg's emerging feminist. Unlike the Tell Tale Heart, money is the motive, but the image of the vulture like all-seeing eye, coupled with Fincher's brilliant feel for paranoia, becomes a great idea so poorly represented that the garishness of the conspiracy thriller takes over, and flattens all plotting nuances except for the clichés we revive through the viewer. Much of this is the problem of an uncharacteristically ordinary script by David Koepp who brings poorly conceived, clichéd antagonists into the house. The value of the invaders is left to quality of performance, and Jared Leto is a horribly shrill, hysterical Junior, Dwight Yoakim is an unconvincing symbol of chaotic evil (that flails even too much for chaos) and only Forest Whitaker becomes an interesting foe, and that is mostly because he wisely downplays his heart-of-gold-victim-of- circumstance Burnham rescuing us from that hopeless cliché. Even Jodi Fosters great performance as Meg and Kristen Stewart's confidently portrayed Sarah can't save the film from its self-inflicted wounds.",Panic Room
476,igor_henriquejs,Great psychological Thriller,9,18 August 2013,"Trespassing the house is the main factor to ignite the plot, once it happens at the very first minutes of the movie and immediately provides suspenseful moments. This perspective is different in relation to some other Thriller movies, where tension progressively rises up as time passes. Throughout the film, we can notice constant changes between extremely suspenseful moments and other not so much ones, in which characters stop to brainstorm the next step to be taken and serve as ""refreshments"" for spectators. This can be considered as a real psychological Thriller, once an interesting ""action and reaction game"" is created by taking into account all various elements featured in the plot.

Although things get out of hand (otherwise there'd be no movie), the movie's constant struggle for comic relief is not only unwelcome (especially in a thriller, and it wasn't funny anyway) but it defeats the genre by subduing the suspense.

I was so close to the edge of my seat by the end of this film, I almost fell off.  Jodie Foster is as usual perfect. I'm glad that Nicole Kidman had to drop out of this film because I can't imagine the heroine not being the strong presence that is Jodie Foster.  This isn't a ""gross out"" thriller but a ""yell out loud in the theater"" thriller.  The girl that played her daughter, Kristen Stewart, was great, too.  They had a great mother-daughter chemistry and she looked so much like Jodie Foster.  I had a couple problems with things that were just a tad off and didn't make common sense but I won't go into them because I don't want to ruin any part of the film for anyone.  They were minor things and didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. I also wondered at the casting of a 63 year old man, Patrick Bauchau, as the ex-husband but then I thought maybe that they did that so that Jodie would be the stronger presence in the movie.  And I loved Forest Whitaker as the sympathetic burglar.  Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam were also enjoyable as the other tw o burglars.  Over all I greatly enjoyed the ride that this movie took.  The camera work was brilliant and made you feel like you were on a thrill ride.

Anyway, my expectations are my problem; so, in spite of mi disappointment, there are good possibilities your experience will be different. I could say this is the worst movie Fincher has directed, but that is also something to be taken with a grain of salt: even the worst Fincher's movie is well ahead of most of Hollywood movies.
Good or bad, no doubt this is a film which deserves to be seen and which can make you think a lot. It is a quite accurate metaphor of the US as a safe room, where you can control every corner of the world, and, in spite of that (or because of that), we are not immune to horror. Think about 9/11 and you can not avoid to feel this movie as almost horribly prophetic.The day after I saw it, I was thinking about safety, horror and how you just can not close your doors to the unthinkable, when I came in the Bible with these rather thought-provoking lines:""...the day of the Lord is going to come like a thief in the night.

Fincher proves he is the new master of suspence. I think his first choice, Nicole Kidman, would have been excellent. Foster is Ok, but Whitaker is the absolute star. As for Jared Leto, he proves he can take on any role. As I watched this movie in a theater a few months ago, I must admit the audience was very quiet. That is an absolute proof of Fincher's directorial skills. Can't hardly wait for MI3. Another kind of movie, could Fincher become the King of the 21th century-thriller?",Panic Room

I assumed the movie will be about a man locking a woman in a closet and she panic as she tries to find a way out. I was wrong. It's about a burglary, and a mother and daughter seek safety inside a vault-like room called the panic room. You may think this movie as boring, just about a family panicking inside a room. Actually, this is a very scary movie, and will knock you off your chair as you see it. The performances are overachieving, (always expect that from Jodie Foster). But to let you know it's just not about people waiting inside the panic room. Meg, the mother, leaves the panic room because she has to get medicine for her daughter, Sarah. i thought the action is very good, everything just fits. I say its a horror/action/drama. There are some flaws, they are usually minor, but sometimes very easy to point out. David Fincher doesn't make this movie to thrill you, he makes this movie to scare the heck out of you.

Skip to the final paragraph to avoid the following spoiler-based refutations:1. Why did she get such a big house?: She's a rich, recent divorcé with a kid who wanted a backyard in New York City and she could afford it.2. Why didn't she hear them whispering three floors down through several doors and walls?: Sort of speaks for itself, doesn't it, very quietly? 3. Why didn't they just leave them in the elevator?: Because they didn't make the decision, she did because she felt the impenetrable panic room was safer. 4. How did they get the gas in the vents when it had its own ventilation system?: Because the guy who designed them knew how to get into it, its separate from the main vents but he knew the precise location at which he could break through the dry wall and drill into the simple polyurethane vent, not steal or cement. 5. Why didn't the fire blow up the propane tank?: Because the propane was being filtered into the vent secured to the wall with tape, the heat melted the tape and the air pressure blew the hose away from the wall and the further from the wall the faster the gas dissipated, that's why only the guy right next to the wall got burned. 6. Why didn't the designer know about the intercom?: He didn't say he didn't know, he just told the one character that you couldn't just talk back to the camera with no audio functionality, you have to push the wall-mounted intercom button that was behind the bed cushion he flipped over first. 7. Why would Forest Whitaker go back to help the family?: Because he didn't know the psycho, didn't plan for violence at all and had a wife and kid of his own whom they likely reminded him of as you can see by his constant defense of them from violence imposed by Raul. He just planned to walk in, open the panic room door and crack the safe. 8. Why let the bonds fly in the wind at the end?: They weren't properly secured in his jacket so he was still clutching them with his hands up until the police told him to open his palm so they could check for weapons. 9. Why was the climax so anti-climactic?: Because it wasn't a big dumb summer blockbuster, not everything has to end with a huge explosion, they get back to business as usual and try to get on with their lives, happily ever after.While this isn't admittedly Fincher's best, it bares his signature, style, detail, passion and quality, most directors are content to throw in a jump scare when the mirror closes, Fincher goes out of his way to make even the most mundane of plots smart, exciting and entertaining.

This won't be nominated for any Oscars, but it is a perfect popcorn flick.The first part of this film is more funny than thrilling. From the trailers, everyone knows the basic idea -- there's a steel room and some guys break into the house. The criminals, however, bring a great deal of comic relief, and unlike most scary movies this one means to be funny. Watching the men trying to get in the room and bickering amongst each other adds a light-heartedness to the show.Not that it isn't suspenseful. The tension is running high throughout the film, getting you wrapped up in the movie. I remember one part, a mad dash for a cell phone, which had the audience yelling at the screen ""Hurry up, he's coming!"", ""No, turn around!"", ""Run! Run!"", and ""Close the door!"". There were cheers and gasps from everyone in the theater.As the movie goes on the laughs die down for the most part as it becomes a much more tense film. The shift is done very well and doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film or the film's story. The ending is very suspenseful and exciting. I have heard the phrase ""edge of your seat"" before, but this was the first movie I've ever been to where people literally were on the edge of their seats.I won't call this a scary movie, but rather a thriller/suspense movie.

503,Joos,A worthy addition to Fincher's body of work,8,30 March 2002,"Panic Room is not a masterpiece. That disclaimer should be taken not as a knock against the film, but merely as an advisory for those that are expecting this film to be a work of genius in the way that Fight Club was. This film is more akin to Fincher's The Game in that it takes a tried-and-true film genre and shows that a simple of story can generate incredible suspense. This isn't the type of film that will leave you mulling over the intricacies of its plot and meaning for days; it is 100 minutes of adrenaline. I am going to avoid going into great detail about the story and even the performances; this isn't the type of film that needs to be analyzed on every minute level. Quite simply, Panic Room is an excercize in the way that a great setting, coupled with superb acting (for the most part) and direction, can create a very enjoyable night at the movies for either thrill-seekers or students of film, even if many of the plot developments are heavily foreshadowed. The suspense isn't achieved in the ends, but in the execution, and Fincher's ability to continually create an engrossing and entertaining product across his body of work is what makes him one of Hollywood's best talents at the moment; this film is no exception. The casting, as was anticipated, was nearly perfect, though I found Jared Leto's character to be overly comical in a quite serious film.

It's not too suspenseful where the slow motion and other cues seem to indicate, not funny where the jokes are. And the resolution! A slow pan on thoughtful Foster then a cut to Whitaker in obvious distress, then a fade? Ludicrous! Not ambiguous nor thought-provoking. Just a real miss. A few ""camera"" moves are good here, but the flashlight shot was the most unnecessary shot in the history of film.

There is definitely a dark mood brought about by this film. It's got the requisite good mixture of thriller, drama, some laughs, and the like. It is clearly more mainstream than ""Fight Club"" but that's not a bad thing. There's isn't a whole lot to say about it without giving too much away (I had been avoiding the previews for months because I wanted to go in as blank as I could). Good thriller, realisticaly played out. You'll probably like it.One thing that you can always expect from David Fincher is a really neat-o opening credit sequence, and I sure did like this one.",Panic Room
506,tjordan90,"Set up for sucess, but riddled with too many holes",4,9 March 2003,"Panic Room had the potential to be a very engaging and a very different suspense/action movie.  Jodie Foster plays the divorced wife of a rich man who moves into a very elegant Brownstone/Townhouse mix.  With her daughter, the pair discovers that the house has a ""panic room"" -- a covert room fully equipped with water, food, and supplies in case of emeregency.  Sure enough, the room will be put to use very early on.  The filmmakers spend little time BS'ing and just jump right to central premise of the movie: lockdown.My main gripe with the film is that too much of the action went back and forth between the characters trapped in the room and the characters on the outside.  This third-person approach just seemed to dilute much of the suspense in the movie -- even though the filmmakers used every gimmick in the book to build suspense.  The movie should have focused more on the plight of those in the room -- make the viewer feel as if he or she is in the room, rather than watching omniscently as a third person spectator.As with any suspenseful movie -- horror movies being the prime example -- characters in this movie make stupid decisions which the audience knows will cost them later.  I have a tolerance for a few mental slips at which I may express verbally their stupidity, but when the film constantly relies on character mistakes and horrendously bad luck, it begins to get on one's nerves.  I can understand a few bad things happening -- I can suspend some reality & accept some improbable events for the sake of the story -- but not the onslaught of impossible occurrences.  In particular, the two lines in the movie which delegitimizes so much of the movie:-""Hello, 911!"" -""Please hold.""The film does have some dazzling camera tricks, as the camera gives the audience a magnificent tour of the house (although I believe these tricks helped contribute to the third-person problem which I believe causes the movie to suffer).  Additionally, the acting is very good.  The movie just suffers from a well-contrived concept turned into a poorly-told story.4/10",Panic Room

Those aspects of the movie were consistent throughout, but I could not bring myself to overlook the obvious unrealistic aspects of the plot.  The bumbling crooks reminded me of when I was eight years old watching ""Home Alone"".  I kept waiting for them to trip over some Micro Machines and get hit with some paint cans or an iron.  The film was very predictable with obvious foreshadowing and a hackneyed, unoriginal climax. I feel the need to point the most obvious flaw in the movie, so the next section will contain a minor spoiler:*********SPOILER ALERT***********When you dial 9-1-1, the operator will never say ""please hold"", and if they cannot call back, the police will arrive ASAP.

The characters seem a facsimile of characters from other, better, movies without being able to nail that extra dimension that could make them, at least, watchable. The husband, the cops even the baddies are all laughable.

Though I am a real fan of the other fincher movies (especially ""se7en"" and ""the game""), I didn't really now what to expect from this one.The story didn't sound very original, but like stuff that could make a great movie in the hands of the right director.Well, Fincher was the right director. With this movie about a young divorced woman and her daughter being trapped in a security room of their house while criminals trying to lure them out in my opinion is his very best work so far.Despite some little plot holes that are very easily forgiven, ""Panic Room"" not only is a great flick, but a wonderful pice of art. I think so because even though the whole movie takes place in one big house, director David Fincher and cinematographers Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji manage to create some truly unique shots you haven't seen in any other movies so far.I don't want to go too much into detail, but if you are even a little interested in the art of film making, you have to see this movie.Of course I also highly recommend it for fans of Fincher and/or Jodie Foster.I talked to some guys who didn't really understand what I meant when I told them how great the (digitally enhanced) camera movements were, but that was only because they weren't really movie fans who would recognize these kinds of details.My conclusion: you might argue that the plot is not very original, but the cinematography alone justifies to see this movie at least once.I give it 9 out of 10 points.",Panic Room

Both gave quite good performances which, alas, did not make up for the terribly forced and trite acting of Leto, Dwight and Whittaker.  There was no development and no convincing interaction in this threesome.The movie had some holes which I believe have already been given adequate attention on this list.  I will give this movie (not film, mind you) a few points for effort.  The initial camera work in the tour of the house was superb, especially the movement through keyholes and walls (we really didn't need to see the inside of a flashlight later on using this technique, however) I also love the opening credits - How unique and fun to watch!
My real problem with the movie was that I had expectations.  I have come to expect so much more from the director of Fight Club, Alien 3, The Game and Se7en, all of which I loved because they were so innovative!  That was the problem with the Panic Room - It was not innovative in its feel or script. I also love most films Jodie Foster touches in any way and I was hoping for more - she came through with a great performance but had to work with such a pathetic script and that deserves kudos.

Gory horror movies don't scare or enthrall me. But movies like this and Speed do.In recent years, thrillers have relied less on suspense and tried to outdo themselves with over-the-top endings and plot twists like Se7en, Usual Suspects, Spanish Prisoner, Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable.Writer David Koepp spent the most of the 90's successfully adapting other thrillers like Jurassic Park, the first Mission: Impossible, Carlito's Way, and Stir of Echoes. While his originals, Trigger Effect and Snake Eyes, were just so so. Here, he sets up a wild premise, intriguing characters, and some very funny moments.By now, director David Fincher has proven that he is by the best thriller director period. Se7en is by far the creepiest film of the 90's. The Game is a great ride and that just keeps on twisiting and keeps you guessing.Panic Room's key moments are when the viewer is kept waiting for what will happen next.

A revolutionary use of typography, computer generated graphics, and beautiful photography of Manhattan is used to create eye-popping, 3-D titles aligned to the photographic perspectives of New York buildings. After this, Fincher proceeds to make camera moves through a house that know no bounds. Some of the coolest camera shots I've ever seen.Panic Room is a tightly wound thriller that kept my undivded attention for the duration and made me jump, wince, and laught in several spots.

Panic Room is not.  While Finchner has been known for his original cinematography here, with the exception of the establishing shot of the Alten's apartment, a lot of it is superfulous and quite distracting.  The other major problem here is that David Koepp's script makes two of the three robbers quite likeable and sympathetic.  Worst of all is the resolution, very incomplete and illogical.

Jodie Foster gives a splendidly controlled performance and David Fincher through excellent positioning of cameras always clearly defines the characters' positions in the house as well as in relation to each other. In addition he ""sends"" the camera through walls, keyholes and other unlikely places creating some very smooth footage that adds to suspense and is very enjoyable to watch.Again, this IS a tense movie, (probably just up there with ""What Lies Beneath"") and I fully recommend it as such.

It is all photographed beautifully and Foster does a good job, but the problem is it's just not exciting, it's all very predictable and Forest Whitaker in the role of one of the the bad guys? I didn't buy that at all, Jared Leto plays the dumb crook and Dwight Yoakam is the only one that's remotely scary. This is I feel the main problem with the film: it's simply not very exciting and the ending is too predictableIt seems that Fincher wanted to make a film that would appeal to the general public and in that he has definitely succeeded: this is a film that seems to follow the Hollywood guidelines perfectly, there's nothing wrong with that, but It's a shame, because Fincher can do much better than this, but let's just hope that for his next film he goes experimental again like he did with Fight Club(to excellent results)*** out of *****",Panic Room

Even from the beginning with the credits, the producers were doing something different. Camera angles, characters, the general story line... all made this movie an A. I can't say enough about the realistic acting. Kristen Stewart (plays the daughter) not only calms you at times, makes you laugh at others, and just terrifies you with her completely believable terror and acting. And then Jodie Foster, damn! She is just always on top of her game.To make a movie that solely takes place in one room, but yet keeps you on the edge of your seat, is a feat on its own.

Not to say he is replacing him, but the styles of the directors are similar, alot of imagery. Great camera work, haunting visuals, and a Pace that never drops. Alot of effects that were used in Fight Club are used here plus some new tricks.The characters are well developed for their purposes. The actors, all superb. I really enjoyed watching Jared Leto in this film, as well as Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart and Forest Whitaker.We become involved with both sides and nothing becomes unclear. We see how human all these characters can be and we see the leaps and bounds they will go to for survival.You might think that the film would get boring if everything takes place in a house. You quickly learn that you are wrong. Character chemistry comes into play and we don't want to miss a beat.I loved it, I gave it a 9. Do yourself a favor and see it.",Panic Room
543,Milian,Welcome to superboredom,3,19 April 2002,"I sometimes still can't believe how incredibly stupid and boring Hollywood's blockbusters have become. With disasters like Tomb Raider or Pearl Harbour in mind, one can't possibly look forward to next blockbuster summer. Who knows how empty and hollow Attack of the Clones nad its clones may be.But here is David Fincher, Hollywood's hotshot, with something we wouldn't expect from him: A flat, boring so-called thriller. After two overrated (Seven, Fight Club), one underrated (Alien 3) and one just plain good film (The Game), we believed that guy could do at least one thing: Keep us interested.Wrong. After probably twenty minutes, Panic Room falls flat. Jodie Foster and her terrible cliché daughter hide in a special Panic Room in their new house when Forest Whitaker and two thugs (one of them being Jared Leto in the worst of overacting moods) break in to get the previous owner's money out of the Panic Room.And that's about it. Fincher shows absolutely no talent for suspense here. When Foster at one point leaves the Panic Room to get her mobile, it's important that no one hears her. So Fincher turns off the sound and makes it all slow motion. No excitement. Fincher prefers to show one digital camera move after the other, which is boring at first but ultimately becomes unbearable. There's also a digital gas explosion. I wasn't sure whether I was watching Poltergeist IV at that point.The script doesn't help. The attackers are not scary at all. Whitaker's the nice guy, the good guy, the sad guy; Leto is a joke, and Raoul, the masked marauder, is all violence. So we're not really afraid. What scared me was Jodie Foster's daughter because I had hoped that we would never have to see a movie character like that again.Then, after 90 minutes of boredom, comes a moment that totally sinks the film: The gangsters are in the panic room with Foster's daughter. The cops arrive. Foster's opening the door, telling the cops nothing's wrong because she's afraid something might happen to her daughter. Now at that point we know that the gangsters have absolutely NO CHANCE of hearing what she tells the cops because the film told us EXPLICITLY earlier on. So why doesn't she tell the cops to stay outside, but also what is going on in there??? I rest my case.The finale would be a letdown - if there was anything good in the film before that.Now don't get me wrong: Of course it's not as bad as Michael Bay.

Yes it was made well, the acting is good, and the sheer thought of being trapped in a ""panic room"" is eerie. But what ruined the movie for me was its ending, or rather the lack thereof. To me, what makes or breaks a movie is it's beginning and ending. If your movie opens with a lot of action then it has to go out with a big bang! Now by no means did this movie open in a huge way (I did like how the credits actually loomed over New York City though...this WAS set in New York right?) but it seemed as if the director was unable to think up a way to end it. The last ten minutes are predictable and the ending scenes just seem to have been tacked on. This is only MY opinion however, so I do suggest you see this film.

Throughout the beginning of the film the view is left thinking ""I wonder when that bit of information will be used later in the film"". The villains are predictable and, given their goal, painfully stupid. In the name of suspense (I assume), the villains bumble around providing windows of opportunity, while the heroes dash around risking their lives with obvious consequences. There are so many points which are simply too far fetched to be believable, for example: The timing & manner of the police arrival - If they took that long answering my distress call I would demand my taxes back!",Panic Room

David Koep is writing the script for your next movie!  Haven't you noticed yet!  Yes, David Koep is the same man how Slaughtered Michel Crichton's best selling novel The Lost World with his screen adaptation. For all you Fincher fans, all you Foster fans,  get ready for a movie that is sustained for an hour and half on a plot that isn't mearly as complicated as that on Home Alone.  A story that could have been told in a much simpler and shorter way, lags on for too long (long enough for you to fall asleep in the theater...LOL)  Yes it has an amazing CG/live footage secuence in which the camera goes through walls, key holes, and coffee pot handles, but does that really contribute to the story's end... No.  Absolutely not.  The same rule aplies in the game of chess.  You strategically postion your pieces in the fastest and most logical way to get an end result.  Here Fincher Plays with his pieces like if he is playing chess for the first time. SPOILER ALERT!! Another thing that bothered me was (Spoiler) the way a character is practically smashed to death with a sledge hammer and thrown down the stairs, then magically climbs up, hits the little girl, sends her flying to the wall and still has the strength to try and strangle Jodie Foster...

I personally don't like olives, but many do even when it's not soaking in a martini. Jodie Foster's new film, PANIC ROOM, was anything but an olive for me. Most films deal with conflict of one sort or another, good films take the movie goer to the next level referred to as ""complication"". Foster's character finds herself with her child in conflict when intruders invade her home and seek the safety of the panic room. The plot becomes an emotional complication when Foster's character becomes trapped outside the panic room with her child trapped inside with the intruders. That's good story telling with a twist. The film is edited especially well and does not lose the audience with a series of quick action scenes. So, here's my suggestion, stop sucking on olives and go see the PANIC ROOM.",Panic Room

Forest Whitaker gives his usual excellent performance, although you've seen him play this same essential character elsewhere.  The really interesting performance for a relative newcomer is from Kristen Stewart. Dwight Yoakum also makes a pretty doggone good bad guy.I give it a ""5,"" but I think that is a pretty good grade for a movie that is entertaining but not enduring.  (Only the very best get higher from me.) Overall, I think it is a pretty watchable firm, especially in view of the overall poor crop of films in 2002 to date.  It is probably worth the extra $4 to $5 to see this one on the big screen -- lots of the filmmaker's work will likely be lost on videotape or DVD.",Panic Room
556,husey,"Sometimes too much, sometimes not enough.",4,30 April 2002,"WARNING: there may be plot spoilers in this review.This piece seems to have two major problems: some elements are far too superfluous, while others are simply not there.On the technical side, I found that the (I admit) beautifully original sweeping camera shots/dollies throughout the house were creative and well-made. However, when viewed in the cinema, they tend to make an audience feel queasy rather than excited or interested. I suspect these scenes would have a different 'feel' (and therefore a different impact) on smaller screens. The transparency of these shots (especially the computer-generated ones) did however mean that I personally was made aware all too often that I was watching a film, rather than being drawn into the whole experience. It was a nice idea, but half of these shots could have been left out.As far as the plot is concerned, I felt that the major weakness there was the lack of character motivation and history. For example, the character is obviously very frightened when she is first shut in the room - yet she still wants to buy the house. Why? I would have expected her to not want to stay there (in fact, the plot could have been contrived very differently to make this a lot scarier). The characters are introduced in a very weak, cliched, manner.The idea of a panic room is an excellent one for a creepy film, but frankly: I wasn't that impressed.And finally, how is it possible to put one's HAND in a FLAME and come out unburned (and still nicely manicured)?",Panic Room

As I read the plot holes, I found myself amazed at the fact I hadn't noticed most of them while I was watching the film as I tend to pick fault with story lines of movies a lot.I confess to being totally ignorant on the subject of diabetes, and although this wasn't supposed to be a public information film, I think they ought to have got those medical facts right because there are enough people out there that have diabetes and would know the difference and especially having made it such an important part of the plot it should have been accurate. Otherwise I think the errors are forgivable and didn't intrude on my enjoyment of the film. I have come to expect to spend a good bit of any thriller shouting ""Why are you doing THAT?"" I think in Panic Room the characters were good enough to engage the audience and once the movie got into the main story the direction kept it rolling along in a competent manner.

It was a beautiful moment, him standing there, arms out, with his treasure blowing in the wind, knowing that in the end he'd given up everything for these people.

567,sweetleafnib,Panic Room,7,20 August 2019,"Director David Fincher dominated the box office in the 1990s with hits such as ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"", his first film of the new century was widely anticipated. With stars such as Jodie Foster (known for The Silence of the Lambs and Taxi Driver) and Jared Leto (known for Requiem for a Dream and American Psycho), it was bound to be a hit. Panic Room was considered to be a solid thriller, but audiences and critics alike compared it to that of Fincher's other work. Meg Altman (Foster's character) is the mother to Sarah Altman (Twilight girl), who is diabetic. Both move into a new home, which contains a panic room (hidden shelter). The room is proven useful when three men, Burnham (gentle giant Forest Whitaker, Raoul (country star Dwight Yoakam), and Junior (Jared Leto) decide to break in and uncover the secret that lies in the room. The cast is the film is solid, with characters that grow and change throughout the film. The audience eventually beings to care about the safety and survival of Meg and Sarah. The three thieves are likable and provide an entertaining yet well-written presentation to the film. The film really shines with the camera work and cinematography. There are many shots in the movie that one room to another and the execution of these shots is exceptional. The tension build-up and paranoia is amazing, and well done. The only real thing that crumbles, is the story line. It's similar to Cujo (1983) in the sense that the lead characters are trapped in a corner while the threat is lurking outside. It drags and drags to the point where the audience begs for something to happen. Overall however, this thriller is quite enjoyable. While not on the league of Se7en, it's a different and entertaining movie. It scores 7/10 stars.

The safe room is a metaphor for the tragedy of 9/11, about the fears we face in everyday life and how vulnerable we are.I love the moody, spectacular cinematography. Think about the camera work when it zooms through the kitchen, seemingly suspended.

In other words, if you're looking for some light entertainment to take your mind of your day to day problems, then this is a good way to kill a couple of hours. The main characters are well acted with great camera work and the director manages to keep the suspense going even though you can guess how its all going to end (I mean we've all seen Home Alone and we all know the dumb burglars are not going to get away with it). However, what spoils the film for me is the tedious sub plots: Foster coming to terms with her divorce and trying to build a relationship with her daughter.

I know it sounds stupid, but the whole movie this bugged me. Secondly - I think this movie would have been much better if the criminals had a collective IQ above that of a rodent.  These are the dumbest criminals this side of ""Home Alone"".  Which makes the whole picture unbelievable. Thirdly - In a cat and mouse thriller - the movie needs to be one step above the audience.  This movie is so stupidly written that the audience figures out what's going to happen and waits for the film to catch up.The last distraction is that there is no point to the direction.  Camera shots are pointlessly convoluted (i.e. swoop down the stairs over the counter and through the keyhole).

Perhaps the only aspect that didn't seem credible was that the burglars would choose to strike when they realized that Jodie Foster and daughter were home (as opposed to waiting for them go out the next morning, perhaps).  In a way, I found this movie to be reminiscent of the 1967 Audrey Hepburn flick, ""Wait Until Dark"".  The two movies share the following similarities:  NYC setting; a trio of bad guys infiltrating the home of an arguably helpless woman; the trio of bad guys looking for something in the woman's home that the woman doesn't know is there; one of the trio of criminals appearing to be more sympathetic than the others (Richard Crenna as ""Mike Tallman"" and Forrest Whitaker as ""Burnham""; and  a young girl who helps the adult female main character.

This flaw was the injection scene.  Anyone who knows anything about diabetes knows that when someone is suffering from low blood sugar and verging on going into a coma the last thing you would do is inject them with insulin (which would just cause them to go into a coma that much faster and very likely kill them). Even if the syringe contained a sugar solution the film-makers should have known that to be the least bit effective this would have to have been injected directly into the blood stream not into stomach tissue.  Not only is it insulting to diabetics everywhere that the film-makers couldn't even be bothered to get the facts right about this deadly disease, but this depiction could conceivably result in a tragedy.  Anyone using this scene as a basic for trying to help someone who is suffering from low blood sugar could end up killing them.  Other minor flaws with the movie: how could Forest Whitaker's character have know what Jodie Foster's character was doing when she was trying to ignite the gas, how likely is it that Jodie Foster's character would know how to reconnect the phone, pushing a light sofa in front of the door is not terribly effective in blocking the door which is made clear when Jodie Foster's character had no problem later in the movie in getting the front door open, etc., etc., etc.  Very poorly thought out and executed.

I know that this film is trying to lure you in and ""feeeeeel"" Jodie's pain, but when she can't even make simple, obvious choices to help herself I can no longer empathize with her.

Some of the camera shots are incredible and the timing of the movie is phenomenal.  You do manage to stay at the edge of your seat without a lot of TENSE music added to force you there.  Really, the movie is good, but the plot stinks.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!
An example of how STUPID Jodie's character is.  In the trailers for the film they show this very creepy scene where the bad guys hold up a sign reading ""What we want is in that room.""  Now, does Jodie say ""what is it?"" or ""how about I put it outside the door, you take it and then leave"".  NOPE, nothing....the film doesn't even address that fact.

It has the same plot as every other movie in theaters now and is insulting to the viewers intelligence.  The acting is horrible and the story line is painfully predictable.

I First saw this on TV and was taken a back by the great acting, a really good film to see if there is nothing really to do. doesn't really require a lot of thinking so is good for the hard of thinking . I wasn't expecting much as I had not come across Jodie's former work such as the accused and silence of the lambs. She is a great actress who really delivers. Wow she is good and so convincing. Of course the film is not just about Jodie as the other members help bring the movie together. If you haven't seen this movie yet you must it will leave you shouting at the screen.",Panic Room
586,mburns4,excellent thriller,9,30 March 2002,"I'm not usually one for suspense/thrillers, but I am a big fan of Jodie Foster, so I went to see this movie.  It's excellent!  It keeps you guessing the entire way through.  I didn't know how it would end until literally 60 seconds before the film ended.  It's a very tight script, not a wasted moment (except maybe a rare few chatty bits with the bad guys) but the whole thing works so well in sequence, always surprising you, that it's definitely worth a look.  Suspense fan or not!  This movie had me clutching the armrests and covering my eyes.  I'm still wired from it, hours later.The cinematography is also amazing.  With a very limited set and a muted palette of colors, the cinematographer somehow manages to keep everything visually interesting and constantly varies what you see and how you see it. I love that in movies!  There was one funny moment when I realized from the changing angles that the camera person must have been perched on a toilet seat.  There are some amazing parts where the camera does impossible things.Overall Panic Room was a lot of fun, completely stressful, and not for the faint of heart!",Panic Room
587,Ghazi,Nothing to panic about,8,29 March 2002,"I'm a huge David Fincher fan, and if you like his work, this movie doesn't disappoint. By no means flawless, Panic Room is a solid effort that's definitely worth checking out.The cast is fitting for the most part, I had my convictions against Jodie Foster in this role, but after viewing it I must say she did a good job. The three men who break into the house hold just as big a role also. They provide a good amount of humor at times (as do Jodie and Kristen Stewart, who plays the daughter role fairly well), and are easy to watch on screen. The movie itself moves along pretty quickly, and doesn't have very many dull moments.The standout point is by far David Fincher's incredible camera angles and techniques. If you were a fan of Fight Club's tracking shots that penetrate walls and buildings, and follow objects as they twist and turn (like the apartment explosion scene) then this movie will impress. Towards the beginning, it's absolutely full of them. This movie also holds some very intriguing action scenes that are executed well, though sometimes exaggerated in terms of reality (you'll see what I mean). As far as being suspenseful, at times Panic Room truly pulls of suspense.Overall, the acting is perfectly watchable, and the humor is actually very funny sometimes. If you can look past the mundane plot, the script is actually pretty refreshing in the way its handled. I personally think it falls apart near the end, and the ending itself left me kind of empty. But hey, you might like it. As a whole however, I'd say it's worth a look. Enjoy.",Panic Room

589,UrbanLegendzGal,Chilling,10,2 April 2002,"Thanks, Jodie Foster, for reassuring my confidence in you! In Panic Room, Foster gives a performance worthy of praise as a single mother in a terrifying situation. Moving in to a NY brownstone with her daughter, it's not long before she (Foster) must utilize the ""panic room"", a steel walled saferoom for paranoid rich people. The burgulars (Whitaker, Leto, and Yoakam) are there just to get-- you guessed it-- in that room. Whitaker plays to perfection a good guy in a bad situation once the power hungry Yoakam is brought in by the hysteria-prone Leto. Foster and her daughter (Stewart) must fend for themselves as the burgulars resort to devious methods to get them out. This movie thrilled me to the very bone, provoking true emotions out of me as I rooted for Foster. It's a frustrating, gritty, terrifying movie-- and if it's violent at times, it's because it should be. Go see it-- although don't be surprised if you find your legs jelly- like afterwards!",Panic Room
590,carrot-16,"Great suspenseful, thinking mans thriller - (or womens' in this case)",8,1 February 2008,"When I decided to watch Panic Room, I didn't think I would get much enjoyment out of it. Mainly because of the mixed reviews I've read on IMDb. But having watched this film, I realise that some people don't recognise a great, clever and personal film when they see one.The dialog in Panic Room is fantastic, especially the conversations between the three intruders. Characters where great and never veered off track - Raoul was the icing on the cake, being a socially retarded, violence buff.The only criticism I have with Panic Room are three things: One being that no-one can possibly walk on broken glass with bare feet (Jodie Foster) and two being that no-one would survive in igniting a room full of gas with a lighter. And finally third... NOBODY can survive a sledge hammer to the head... yes I'm looking at you Raoul.But that aside; Panic Room is a really suspenseful thriller and clever in it's logistics of story telling.Bernard: ""Man, who the f@ck is he?""

591,ricaritatu,Considerably predictable and disappointing,5,9 April 2002,"I consider Jodie Foster as the world's best actress and I always enjoy Forrest Whitaker. However, they were definitely plagued by a poor script. As writers and directors attempt to come up fresh ideas on the big screen, this one fell short of the mark. I didn't find myself scared at any moment during the film and the only suspenseful segment of the film was when Meg (Jodie Foster) was attempting to get from the panic room to retrieve her cellular phone. Expectations often play a role in determining whether or not a film is entertaining and that was the case with Panic Room. However, you still come to expect to be scared at some point by watching a movie that is called a 'thriller.' I was not. Bring back 'The Exorcist!' Now that's scary!",Panic Room

593,xzjq,One of the best action-thrillers I have seen in a long time...,9,30 April 2002,"What can I say?  It's been almost 2 hours since I walked out of the preview screening... and I'm struggling to find a flaw in the whole film. The acting is top-notch, with the characters being believable and the talents sliding into these forms effortlessly.  Jodie Foster stands out though as Meg, the lead character who has just gone through a divorce and is trying to settle down in a new house with her daughter. As a strong Fincher fan I was not at all disappointed with this film, as I knew before I saw it that there was no way it would be as good as Fight Club.  It was better than The Game (starring Michael Douglas), which I thought was dragged out a bit too much and had an ending which, amongst my group of friends and myself, has been the target of many laughable conversations, although I guess there wasn't really any alternative... I can only pick on one part of Panic Room - the ending.  I won't give anything away (coz that'd be nasty) but you do get out of your seat thinking ""hmmm. I wish they'd at least done something better with the money than that..."" Otherwise, all the other Fincherisms were there.  The CG-assisted camera shots moving through walls etc (like in Fight Club) could be considered overkill, but I prefer to look at them as required art which raises the tension by portraying the proximity of the burglars to the females, whilst raising the sense of chlaustrophia in the Panic Room itself. With enough touches of humour to call this a part-comedy, this is a thriller that grabs you, throws you about a bit and doesn't let go until the final scene... and the action sequences themselves are pulled off with incredible stamina and energy.  And boy, that bit with the cellphone, all in slow-mo and absolutely NO sound whatsoever... had me sweating! This is going straight on my 'to-buy' list...",Panic Room

595,Movieman19,3 1/2 out of 4,8,4 March 2002,"I happened to catch a screening of David Fincher's new film ""Panic Room"" while I was on vacation in Los Angeles. Since 3 out of 4 of his movies have been disappointing for me, I wasn't to enthusiastic about it.It tells the story of Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah. Meg has been recently divorced and both of them are looking for new life after the rather unsuccessful marriage. So they settle down in the big city and find a nice, cozy, perfect house. Or is it...They learn of a safe or ""panic"" room in the house that has video screens, buried phone line, ventilation system, and a 1 foot thick steel wall. Why would a house need a room like this and when would they need to use it? They find out soon enough.One of their first nights in the house (You'll never guess) people break in. Meg and Sarah are able to get to the Panic Room quick enough, however, to hide from the intruders for a short time. So the first 2 questions on the 2 girls' minds are, of course: Who are you, and what are you doing in my house. They find out that the burglars want nothing other that what is in that room. In fact, they won't leave until they get it. So what is in the room that is soooo special. Are you just dying to know otherwise you won't see it because it looks too scary or something? Well I'm not going to tell you. It's against IMDB regulations.I will however say that this is a very VERY creepy film. If you get the heeby-jeebies already when you stay home alone, this movie will make you catatonic. Just because it takes place in a house doesn't mean there isn't room for fancy camera work. David Fincher can and does take the camera wherever he wants to. Whether it's through cracks in the wall, keyholes, or coffee pot handles, the camera will go there.So did I like it? Yes I did. It is my favorite movie of 2002 so far. (Keep in mind there haven't been many good ones) I loved pretty much everything about it. Do I recommend it? Yes, but only to people who loooooooove a good scare.",Panic Room

597,SupDave1,Panic Room Delivers...See It!,8,30 March 2002,"Panic Room starts out giving us a detailed tour of a 3 story brownstone built in the later 1800's located on the upper west side of Manhattan that has quite a storied history with the last owner being a paranoid rich eccentric.  The house looms large as the 3rd main character with it's intriguing construction and the inclusion of the ""Panic Room"", which in theory is an impenetrable room from which one escapes harm.  Located inside the Panic Room and it's 3 inch steel enforced reinforced walls, floor and ceiling are various supplies such as blankets, food, water and a state of the art video surveillance system with cameras in virtually every room of the house.  The movie starts out a bit on the slow side and adequately builds the suspense throughout the movie.  If you're looking for a well written, superbly acted suspense movie, this is the film for you!The real movie starts when 3 intruders break into the house and the two tenants (Meg and Sara Altman) are forced to escape into the Panic Room. The intruders (played with more than adequate believability by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) believing the house to be empty, are there to crack a safe located inside the Panic Room.  Things begin to unravel when the intruders realize that a mother and daughter are located in the house.The two main characters (Meg and Sara) played with wonderful brilliance by Jodi Foster (as a recently divorced mother of one) and Kristen Stewart (in only her 2nd performance in as many years) as her 11 year-old, wise-cracking, diabetic daughter are forced to retreat to the Panic Room when Sara realizes there are unwanted ""guests"".  After it's clear that Meg and Sara won't come out of the Panic Room, the intruders bolt, screw and nail all the doors and windows thereby ruining the chance of escape.  One feels trapped inside the house and the Panic Room for the rest of the movie as Meg and Sara Altman feel.  The rest of the movie is a well constructed with even some light and funny moments.  If you want to learn more, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!",Panic Room
598,Girolahozz,Really enjoy this more with each time I watch,7,16 February 2009,"I didn't feel like Panic Room stood up to Fincher's previous lovable monsters (The Game, Seven, and Fight Club) but it was certainly better than what most people claim it to be. This movie has an incredible cast, a grouping that I wouldn't think could have played off of each other so well, but Fincher made it work nicely. After reading on who was originally cast, I applaud Fincher for going with Jodie Foster, she's dead on excellent in 'most' of her roles and is very believable in this film. To me, though, Kristen Stewart and Jerod Leto steal the scenes until the end where Dwight and Forrest really step out of the shadows and perform brilliantly! Take this movie for what you will, but the idea of it on top of the excellent direction makes it a classic thriller in the path of mid-era Hitchcock films.",Panic Room
599,jackass14,Held my attention for nearly 2 hours!,6,30 March 2002,"First let me echo the comment about the wicked-cool opening credits. Something I've never seen before but will probably be used in many movies to come.The movie was paced well, like the headline says I never even looked at my watch, a rare occurrence for me.  It is a good movie to take you away for a couple hours, as there are few moments where you are not anticipating the next move by the girls or the boys.  Unfortunately a healthy handful of those moves are fairly predictable, as with most suspense/thrillers these days.  The R rating is almost not needed, although a couple of shots are somewhat graphic and Jodie Foster uses the F word.  At least the idea is original, hats off to Koepp for that.",Panic Room
600,rogerlintzeris,"Captivating Thriller, Fincher reigns supreme once more",8,8 April 2002,"While his other movies have all silent thunderstorms, Panic Room has the media hype to match the brilliance of the film, for better or worse. I belieive worse. For people expecting some horror flick with a bit of a thrill you're mistaken. This film while it has its brilliant moments which will, shoot me for using this terribly over used cliche', have you sitting on the edge of your seat, is mainly a great film to watch, and watch again because of the mastery Fincher has over the camera, his ability to place the camera anywhere, and i use that in the exact sense, is spectacular. The film it self lacks the depth and creative flare commonly assosiated with this now, household name director. David Keopp, who also wrote Jurassic Park (screenplay)and number two and three doesn't handle the mood and tempo of the movie with the correct dialoge, perhaps his intention to make it comedic, however jokes in the wrong places never work. Overall a great film to watch but do not go into it expecting anything better than Fight Club, alas, perhaps i shall view it with these intentions myself.",Panic Room

602,avwak,Bad Screenplay + Bad Directing=Bad Movie,1,15 April 2002,"I am a fan of Fincher.  I love Fight Club, I like Seven and my opinions for his other films vary.  His direction was so absurdly horrible, I couldn't help but to be distracted.  Almost every shot was unmotivated toward the action; the camera was subjective to the house more than the characters, so the visual aspects dominated the film.  Further more, it is my opinion that the visual aspects of the film (Fincher's trademark), were nothing to behold.  The lens choices were terrible; extreme wide shots of intense drama on charcters made certain scenes come across phony; the lack of depth of field and very wide lenses, caused shot after shot to have so much 'dead space' in the frame, it seemed painfully obvious the reason was for a claustrophobic mood. As a fan of Fincher, it was a slap in the face to have the amount of product placement abundant (the Cocca Cola scene in the beginning is cringe inducing), when his previous 'Fight Club' basically negated his aesthetic choices in this film.  The screenplay was brain dead and gimmicky, mood was so contrived it was shoved down your throat.  Maybe Fincher should calm down a bit, understand the meaning of the term subtly and not be so in our face. Just because the camera moves through objects doesn't mean it is well directed, motivation is the key and that was absent.",Panic Room
603,kidbeat,Sadistic Suspense,10,3 August 2002,"Perhaps you saw Fight Club and could appreciate the visceral intensity but were put off by its muddled message. Or maybe you saw Se7en and noticed the slick and grainy visual style, but couldn't handle the more grotesque aspects of that film. Or maybe you (like me) love everything Fincher's ever done and cannot wait to be once again welcomed into his world of paranoia, pathos, and amazing visuals. Well, no matter who you are, you need to see Panic Room.In Panic Room, David Fincher pulls out all the directing stops, every trick in his magic black bag of film wizradry and delivers on a simple, solid suspense story with none of the concept or pretense of his previous films. This one goes straight for the gut, fiendishly manipulating every standard suspense contrivance, mercilessly playing with any jangly nerve, and keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.There is not one sour note in the whole film (with the exception of the possibly too Hollywood ending, but it still works). Every aspect of Fincher's technical mastery is on full display. His camera moves gracefully across every square inch of the house which becomes a prison for Jodie Foster and her daughter, and the three men who break in one night in search of the former owners hidden riches. In one amazing shot, Fincher moves from the fourth floor of the house where Foster and her daughter are sleeping soundly, all the way down to the first floor where we see the intruders beginning their break-in, throught the handle of a coffee pot, and then all the way BACK UP to the fourth floor where they finally succeed in getting in without the shot breaking once and sliding the whole time with the cool, slow, impartial grace of a cat burglar.The premise is simple: Foster and her daughter are locked in an impenetrable room in their home, along with the loot that the 3 bad guys are looking for. The bad guys want in, the good guys want them out of the house. The plot is really as simple as that, but in Fincher's hands it turns into a beautifully paranoid battle of wits. No time is wasted on anywhere and the suspense is instantly in high gear. The performances are all perfect, with characters fully developed in their first moments of screen time. You know who everyone is right away, with no time wasted on extraneous details, so all that's necessary is to sit and wait while the tension builds to the breaking point. It is a terribly effective tactic as it leaves the audience totally open to watch the sparks fly without miring them in sentimentality.Essentially, if you like suspense, see this movie.",Panic Room

Forrest Whittaker is also great playing the more sympathetic of the criminals who break into the house.  Jared Leto is very good as well, and even Dwight Yoakam is good.Fincher does some incredible camera work, bringing the perspective through floors, keyholes and anything he cares to.  The tracking shots are good and help build the psychological drama of the film.In the end, the movie failed for me because of one small point that it is hard to tell without giving away much of the film.  The criminals fail to do one incredibly simple thing to make their lives easier simply to allow the criminals and the captives to communicate.I still give this movie 7 of 10 because of the fear that Fincher creates. If the criminals had been smarter, it could have been a 10, though.",Panic Room
605,randommango,The worst movie I have ever seen,1,10 April 2002,"I saw the trailer to this movie and decided not to go. Joy of joys I was then invited to see a preview screening for free. I went with low expectations and these were shattered. This film is contrived, insulting, boring and a total waste of your time and money.It is not the scary suspense you are lead to believe by the trailer. In fact you've only just met Jodie Foster and her daughter when the crime begins, and you care no more for them as characters than the criminals who are trying to get inside the ""panic room"". The minimal plot is completely inconsistent and has you laughing in despair. After films such as Fight Club and Seven, it's hard to see how the director could have made a film so monumentally awful. Sadly though your left wondering if it was all done on purpose, not so much as to mess with your mind, but just to see how disappointed and angry they can make you feel, whilst running away with your cash.On top of this the film was shot terribly, showing countless close ups of mundane items, such as phone rechargers and plugs, and repeatedly flying the camera through walls, door cracks, key holes and coffee pot handles. Complemented by blatant brand placement, contrived close ups of Jodie's bust and unnecessarily gruesome violence.However, there is in fact a good game you can play with this film. Take any detail, and then ask yourself ""Does this really make sense?"" or ""Was this believable?"". I challenge you to find one thing that made sense.  A few for example...If you built a panic room so that no one could get in or harm the occupant, would you really put the wires and ventilation system on the outside?Rather than simply stocking a panic room with water, might you not also put some food inside?Is there any reason why you can't use a cell phone inside the room?

I am very sure that David Fincher is well on his way to becoming a key factor in the shaping of twenty-first century cinema. The movie itself is very fast paced and very well written.

For example, it bugged me that she didn't tip off the police when they FINALLY arrived at her door.  The premise being she couldn't say a word because she was being watched on a security camera by the ""villians"" but in actuality they couldn't ""hear"" her so she could have easily alerted the police that she was in trouble.Another scene which really didn't make sense was in the first 1/2 hour of the film when the thieves break into her home and realize someone has actually moved into the once vacant house and now lives there.

The acting was good for what they had to work with, but the ending and the plot progressions were very predictable and heavy handed.  Fincher style usually is to give you bits and pieces of information as you need it, but in PR the audience knows what is going to happen 30-40 minutes before it actually happens.  I do not know if it is the script, the editor or produces' that are responsible for this piece... But we know that Fincher can direct a great film and the visuals were great.

615,Elbonio,Kristen Stewart is excellent,8,22 May 2002,Kristen stewart - the 12 year old who looks like she's about 17 did very considering this was her first major flick... in my opinion... She was competent and convincing. Foster was also very good and although the plot was slightly predictable the foster-stewart relationship kept the pace of the film up.,Panic Room
616,legzzakimbo,"Very disappointing, structurally flawed",5,19 October 2002,"I thought to myself, great, David Fincher is brilliant, this will be fantastic, but no. Panic Room is disappointing at best. It starts well, with wonderfully clever long, sweeping shots full of Fincheresque imagination, and little cinematic hints of events to follow, however, the subtle hints begin to become screamingly overdone, and the audience is treated as children to be explained to. This never happens in Fincher's past gems. Also, never before have we had to put up with ridiculously stupid characters; the premise of the movie is flawed, no protagonist or antagonist should be that ill equipped.",Panic Room
617,evildoom_bunny,"A nice ride, tad predictable - spoiler!",7,30 May 2002,"This movie really did have me on the edge of the seat - however the movie was not completely perfect.Some of the plot was predictable - such as when the three men kept arguing, and the fact that it seemed obvious it would lead in part to their downfall, and the ending was a tad trite - however in terms of a suspense movie, I think it really delivered.It has been accused of several flaws which I thought I would address in my own understanding of the movie:that you could speak out of the panic room, but not in.. I don't remember anything being said about that, and when it did happen, Jodie Foster's character used an intercom which I thought was part of the security system in general.that ""Raoul"" could not have gotten his hand stuck due to sensors being in the door.  Yes there were sensors, in my understanding there was one at the head, one at the chest area and one at the feet - but these don't sweep the whole way down, therefore if his hand was not where a sensor was, it would get caught (which it did).One flaw that really was a flaw however was the gas cylinder scene - it was wishful thinking to believe that it would be possible to do that and not blow the whole place up or something equally drastic!!I find the movie visually was quite appealing, and the opening credits really set the scene, and made me think this movie was going to be something different than a movie about a panicky mum.As to Meg turning away the cops - well it's simple really.. if she let them in, the men would have killed her daughter for sure, but by not letting them in on anything, she could be sure that at least whilst inside that room, her daughter would be safe.  As to why she didn't wink etc.. I'm not sure, it could be something to do with the fact that she was freshly divorced and wanted to prove she could stand on her own and be just as capable as any man.All in all, it's NOT a waste of money, it's a nice ride even though at some points a tad predictable - in general, I don't think David Fincher has let himself down with this one.",Panic Room
618,onekell,Tight suspense,8,15 November 2003,"The film explores the basic psychology of survival in a clever, well-timed manner. The characters play a cat and mouse game with unpredictable twists in the house. Given the length of the film, it may be too much to ask for more character development and better dialogue, especially for the chief baddie. Altogether an unexpectedly enjoyable ride!",Panic Room
619,ChiaraMiaMoi,Sterile,5,28 September 2002,"A completely ineffectual thriller that has all the fancy camera work, top set design and an A list actress and director.  What's missing though is the suspense, intrigue, and that on the edge of your seat aura.  Kudos to Jodie Foster for doing a fine job in a very sterile film.  A half empty script that's beautifully shot.Pick yourself up one of those black and white british thrillers from the 60's.  That's the real Mccoy, this is just Hollywood baloney.",Panic Room
620,haleyscomet389,Decent Film,8,1 April 2009,"Jodie Foster registers well as a middle aged New Yorker looking for a new house with her teenage daughter (K Stewart) in the city. During their first night in they're spacious new Brownstone home three burglars break-in resulting in a game of ""Cat and Mouse"".This movie had high expectations and it didn't fail to deliver. With its suspenseful scenes and great visuals this movie is one of my favorites. The opening scene has shown the capability of computer graphics/generation today. The location was chosen very wisely as it brought twists into the script.Although Jodie Foster was very convincing (as usual) it didn't make up for the long and tedious second half of the film. Most of the twists were very predictable and didn't deliver the suspense.On another note Kristen Stewart proved herself in her first big role. She plays the diabetic daughter of Jodie Foster. Kristen and Jodie worked extremely well together, resulting in two very well played characters. On the same note Jared Leto brought a very much-needed comical element to his character (Junior).Even though this movie had its major flaws it still delivered a decent script and great cinematography.",Panic Room
621,timothygruich,Severely underrated,10,2 February 2009,"Way ahead of it's time. If you can come up with a story based in a single room and make it as engaging and exciting as this one... you deserve to be frozen and preserved for future teaching of inspiring film makers. This is a fantastic film and I'm glad Jodie Foster was available for the lead when Nicole Kidman got knocked up and bailed. I loved the off-character casting of Jared Leto and the unbelievable casting of Dwight Yoakam... DWIGHT YOAKAM. Everything worked. Another great, and yet again... underrated film by David Fincher. How long is it going to take for an established directed like Fincher to take a chance and roll the dice on trying to make a script like this work again? ...No one has the guts.",Panic Room
622,SickBoy-Romania,"Not Fincher's best, but still impressive",8,27 March 2003,"This latest movie by David Fincher is not exactly what you may call a masterpiece, but is still one of the best thrillers in a long time. First of all, because it's a Fincher. And you can see the director's cut. He used most of the same techniques that made his previous movies (Se7en, Fight Club, The Game) the best thrillers of the 90s. Then, there is the superb cinematography of Darius Khondji, who really puts his mark on the tensionate atmosphere in the picture with slow moves of the camera. Jodie Foster also gives a pretty good performance and the villains are beautifully portrayed by Forrest Withaker, Christian Bale and Dwight Yoakam. So it's a decent movie, but not revolutionary (like Se7en and Fight Club) and I think that Fincher is indeed a master of suspense. Probabily, the new Hitchcock. The only thing that disappointed me in Panic Room was the end. A bit to predictable. Otherwise, a good film that might haunt you for a while. 8/10",Panic Room
623,moo_vee_watcher,Disappointment,5,6 January 2003,"After watching the trailers, I was really looking forward to watching this movie.  But the plot holes, inconsistent character behaviors and erratic character development left me wondering why this received such favorable critical reviews.  The acting was not bad, but I thought the writing was inconsistent and illogical.  Places where I should have been on the edge of my seat, I was unable to because I was still shaking my head at events leading up to those points.  I give this a 5 out of 10.",Panic Room
624,LekkereKwal,"High tension, soft story (*spoilers*)",6,20 July 2003,"*spoilers!!!*To my opinion, Panic Room was made with a great fealing for building up the tension and keeping it that way. I got incredibly nervous when Jodie Foster ran out into her bedroom to get her cell phone while the burglars were comming back up.However, there were few strange parts in the story which altered my overall rating on this film.1. If the panic room is so designed that it would imposible to get in, why is it possible that intruders can easily access the phone lines and the ventilation shafts? I mean, that clearly showed that this panic room was not as safely as it should have been. The drain tunnel wich Jodie Foster and her daughter used to send light signals through it could also have been used by the burglars to blow in gas or something.2. Why wouldn't there be any other means of communication in the panic room? Now the victims had only 1 phone that they could use, so that if the phone would not work (which was the case), they would be stuck there forever! There should have been something like a cell phone with a large antenna or a 27MC radio.3. Why was it impossible to talk to the police? The burglars could not hear Jodie Foster talking, so if she just said like ""my daughter is held hostage and if you show up she will be shot"", than the police would at least try to find a solution. If the squadteam showed up just 10 minutes earlier, then maybe the daughter would have been shot because the burglars would think that Jodie Foster alarmed the police!!Without these flaws I would give the movie an 8, but now only a small 6. If you shoot a movie at such a small spot with a small number of actors, than you should invest the energy and time you gained by that into a foolproof script.",Panic Room
625,ryan_music,Fun and entertaining thriller,9,4 November 2011,"I watched Panic Room not knowing what to expect, I read nothing about it. I only knew that the cast had award winning actress Jodie Foster known for her role in ""Silence of the Lambs"". Knowing her from that movie and seeing the cover art of the DVD for Panic Room lead me to think this was a horror movie. I was happily surprised to see that Jared Leto was in the movie because he's a great actor and one of my favorite singers. Forest Whitaker is always good, and it was funny to see a young Kristen Stewart. Kristen is 12 in this movie and she does a surprisingly good job and turns out to be one of the most likable characters. So right off the bat the cast is strong. So the plot is a mom and her daughter move into a new house that has a room that is for emergencies that has a vault like door and monitors on the wall to watch whats going on inside the house. Three robber break in not knowing they moved in. When the robbers first break in one of them named Raoul drops 3 one liners that had me laughing at each one. This movie has several comedic moments that are sure to make you laugh. This movie isn't all jokes though, at times you're at the edge of your seat. It's a great thriller because the situation these people are in could happen to anyone. Well anyone who has an enormous room in their house with screens so you can watch whats going on in every room. You get so attached to the characters in this movie that you really want them to get help. On the other hand though you also like the dialog between the robbers so you don't really want them to be caught. I loved this movie and would suggest it to anyone.",Panic Room

Super one dimensional cartoon characters.
No one ever acts reasonably. All the crooks had to do was go home and wait for the occupants to leave. Super stupid!
Forrest Whittaker was the loveable safe cracker
Dwight yoakim as the unreedeemable immoral crook
Jared Leto was a mindless yeller

The worst!!",Panic Room
627,gerald11,"Some Plot holes, but still decent movie",7,21 March 2012,"Panic Room is not a bad film by any means, but it does suffer somewhat from a mediocre script, thin characterization and a lackluster ending.The main problem I have with Panic Room is the performance of the three thieves. They enter the film like The Three Stooges, immediately undermining the tension that their entrance generates. I mean, for the film to work as strongly as it could, they should be a major threat, but instead they enter the film while bickering like a bunch of numbskulls. And two of them even think they can break through concrete and three inch steel with a sledgehammer. You're dealing with mental midgets here.Stupidest of the three is Leto's character. He doesn't know how escrow works, he puts his head against the wall when Foster is about to ignite the gas they're pumping into the panic room, he shouts at a PA system and he exposes his plan to screw over his fellow burglars simply by talking to himself. The extent of his stupidity is really too much to ask of an audience with any intelligence and his whole character smacks of lazy writing.But thankfully Leto's character gets shot halfway through. And his killing is nicely done. It's quick, it's brutal and it allows the unhinged Raoul to step up to the plate as the main villain. And although Raoul is a knob and a bit of a rent a psycho, he does seem like a genuine threat. And it's even more impressive considering that the actor who plays him, Dwight Yoakam, is a country music star. He may sing hick music, but he turns in a superb performance.But although Yoakam is excellent, the film easily belongs to Foster. She's strong, she's resourceful and she's entirely believable as a mother who'll blow your head off if you mess around with her kid. After all, is there anything more dangerous than a mother backed into a corner? Personally I'd rather take on a 6 foot 4, 300-pound, bum-hungry redneck called Bubba than a 5 foot 4 woman who wants to defend her kid. The burglars should have left the second they realized they were dealing with a 'mom'.However, while I can easily believe in Foster managing to wrestle a gun off of the psychotic Raoul (again illustrating how stupid the thieves are, Raoul at one point tells her to come out of hiding so he can shoot her and get things over. Didn't he ever have a mum?), her MacGyver routine stretches credibility – igniting the gas is fair enough, but there's one bit where she somehow hooks up the phone line. She even says, ""I have no idea"" when her daughter asks her what she's doing. It's obvious that Koepp (the writer) has written himself into a corner and this is the result: suddenly she's a phone expert. But I'm willing to overlook these sorts of things as Fincher gives us ample opportunity to stare at Foster's cleavage when things get silly. It was actually an excellent decision to have her spend virtually the whole film in a black vest, as you're never too far from jiggling breasts, which is fair compensation for gaps in logic.",Panic Room
628,Aevora,"A simple, yet powerful performance",7,28 January 2005,"PANIC ROOM (2002) Jodie Foster stars in Panic Room, written by David Kroepp and directed by David Fincher. The movie tells the story about Meg (Foster) who inhabits an apartment in Manhattan. The Realtor explains to her that this house contains a 'panic room', which is used to ward off any intruders.Unfortunately, the Panic Room is something Meg and her daughter Sarah are forced to use on their first night there: three burglars enter her house searching for something. Unfortunately, what they need is in the Panic Room! The burglars stop at nothing to get her out, while Meg tries to defend herself from their attempts.The story is pretty simple, and all plays in one day (and night). There are only two locations used in this film: a bench in NY City and of course the house Meg and Sarah live in. The story takes a simple approach to a not very original plot.However, David Fincher manages to make this in to a thrilling experience, which makes Meg twist and turn to get her out of the Panic Room. The film is nowhere scary, but the thrill is there; and how! The minimum cast (mainly consisting of 6 people) sets an experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Furthermore, Kristen Stewart does an excellent performance as Sarah; the diabetes-daughter.Then why not give this film a 10/10? Because it fails to add any originality or story twists. From the moment you start, you can pretty much expect what's going to happen. Furthermore, the CG Title Sequence seems to hi-tech to compare with the simplicity of the film. The long takes, which take the viewer from the top floor, all the way to the third are (although beautifully shot) again a total difference from the style of the movie. It seems that these things were included to make sure the audience would not write this off as a independent film of some sort.On a total view, the film is certainly not bad and is definitely worth viewing. If you're a fan of very thrilling, yet not complicated films: watch this. If you like clever story lines and plot twists, you might want to leave this.",Panic Room
629,ClayCyr,Kill a little girl with 2 cops present?,9,3 June 2014,"Loved this film as it's always a pleasure to watch an actress as talented as Jodie Foster. I did however give the film 9 out of 10 due to a plot element that truly annoys me. What mother, regardless of how strong her maternal instinct is, would actually believe that the intruders would have killed her daughter whilst two cops were present? Compound home invasion, burglary, assault and murder with a second murder with nothing to gain but more jail time? Would any criminal be THAT stupid? She could have swung the door wide open and told them they were in the panic room on the third floor with her daughter. The End? Perhaps they would have shut the door and taken her hostage? That would be a truly ironic plot twist.",Panic Room

633,steve_bv,Another success for David Fincher,8,30 March 2002,"Panic Room is a wonderful piece of film-making, a pure thriller.  Almost the entire film takes place inside of one house, in a near real-time unfolding of events.  Fincher takes us on a modern-day Hitchcock ride, building suspense at every turn.  With obvious inspiration from ""Rear Window"", the film is a joy to watch, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The acting is top-notch, Jodie Foster is great, Jared Leto turns in a performance above anything he's done to date.  Forrest Whittaker is magnificent, building his character as much by his actions as by his silence.  And Dwight Yoakam is the most surprising, entirely unrecognizable, and one of the most terrifying characters seen on screen in a while--pure coldness.  All in all, the acting and directing make this movie subtly disturbing, unlike any suspense film we've seen in a while, from the visually stunning opening credits to the morally ambiguous ending.  It all combines to more than make up for minor shortcomings in the script--tacked on developments to hastily add more suspense.In short, it's worth watching.  Five characters, one house, two hours, and constant thrills.",Panic Room
634,smashy-2,"An enjoyable, if somewhat disappointing thriller",7,30 March 2002,"Fincher's ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"" were masterpieces in my opinion, so I was enthusiastic to see his latest, ""Panic Room.""  Unfortunately, I am not so enthusiastic about recommending it to others.  It is definitely signature style, David Fincher, but it appears as if Hollywood script doctors got ahold of this otherwise excellent movie.To start with, it has all the usual Fincher direction.  As a telephone call is placed, you get the camera moving along with the 'pulse' through the phone wires.  As a key is inserted in a lock, you are treated to the same perspective as the key.  All of this is signature Fincher (see Fight Club's opening sequence if you don't know what I mean).  Visually, it is an excellent film.  Fincher deserves the usual credit for direction and casting.  The actors portray real emotions on screen.  Jodie Foster does an excellent job of emoting as a mother, and Forest Whitaker's concern for life comes across colorful conflict.Unfortunately, the writing withers.  A sudden surprise illness of the daughter, Kristen Stewart, seems too scripted to be believable.  Likewise with appearance of police officers, and the ludicrous dialogue in the '911' call for help.  Why do script doctors, writers, and other Hollywood parasites continue to churn out carnage?",Panic Room

The little girl is portrayed as being a diabetic going into a coma because of low blood sugar. Unfortunately, the insulin shot she supposedly needs would worsen her condition, not help. Diabetics suffer from high blood sugar, unless they take too MUCH insulin. Then, there is a third crook who suddenly is brought in, for no reason, other than to be the mean guy. The fellow who is supposedly smart enough to design panic rooms, is too stupid to take off the jacket he is wearing with his name on it. All the crooks had to do was act like they left the hosue to get Foster and her kid out of the panic room. But, no, let's build a story around incredible stupidity. Why do two people need, or for that matter, want a three story house? How ludicrous is that? Makes no sense. Jody foster can afford a three story house in Manhattan, but has to hook up a friggin phone line herself and didn't get it done before the crooks show up. Finally, you can short out a phone line anywhere in the house and it will make the line appear busy to outsiders and be unusable to insiders. Why would mister smart enough to design a panic room have to use a sledge hammer to disable the phone line?!

641,lhirsti,Purely entertainment,5,23 May 2002,"David Fincher's previous film; ""Fight Club"" offered something new and exiting to its audience. It was a critique, a statement not only about consumerist society - but about the state of masculinity. ""The Panic Room"" seems to me to be more about the entertainment value a thriller creates and forgets about the ""message"" it transcends.The stereotyping of the different characters makes this film quite predictable - which is a shame. It is a good film when looking away from these issues but the ending spoils the film completely.

However, it was poorly written and the acting was only as good as it could be. The following mistakes ruined this as a realistic film:1) the main character realized she didn't hook the phone system up inside the Panic Room upon moving in
2) main character realized this once in panic room and never tried to escape for a second to do so/grab defense controller even seeing all 3 captors were downstairs

656,sdepew,David Fincher at his best.,10,30 March 2002,"I would first like to point out that this movie is the perfect example of the genius that is David Fincher.  No other director that I can think of of the top of my head, except perhaps Ridley Scott, could have successfully adapted this type of a story to the silver-screen, let alone make it as GOOD as he did. This is, to put it short, the most suspenseful film I have ever watched. Upon leaving the theater I was so tense that I felt like yelling as loud as I could to vest the feeling.  And I loved ever second of it.  From the first five minutes, until the credits began to roll, not a single sound came from the audience witnessing the spectacle.  Not one.  Not a cough, not a laugh, not a clearing of a throat. The entire crowd was caught in Fincher's brilliance. He has, perhaps, out done himself.  I cannot possible imagine how he will ever be able to top this movie.  But, I pray he does. He seems, with every movie he has released, to improved on aspects from the one before. Se7en was much better than Alien3, The Game, though not better in my opinion, showed him experimenting and trying to make it better.  Fight Club was a major improvement cinematography wise(and to some, plot wise) from all predecessor's, and now, Panic Room, in my opinion, has topped them all in every aspect.  My recommendation is that you watch it.  Then watch it again. You'll like it even more the second time.  Trust me. 10/10",Panic Room

And I must say: the movie didn't let me down! It is a solid story about a mother and daughter spending the first night in their new house. A house that isn't really something out of the ordinary except for one peculiar room: a panic room, used in cases of emergency to seek shelter in. It has everything on the inside to keep one alive: survival goods, cameras with views on every angle in the house, a separate phoneline and ventilation system, plus steel walls and a steel door. On that first night three men are breaking in and the mother and daughter seek refuge in the panic room with no means to get out.. The movie is basically a dark thriller which has its funny moments, set in just this one house, delivered by a well-chosen cast.The camerawork is simply fantastic once again: through floors, inside keyholes, etc. David Fincher is a true master when it comes to innovative handling of a camera. Plus his choice of colors, entourage and timing is superb.All in all: a very nice, straightforward thriller [no plot twists at the end or whatever] revolving around an intriguing concept: a room that no one can get in to or out of..",Panic Room

I saw it tonight and was absolutely blown off my feet. Now, let me assure you that this is not your typical ""thriller"", as I knew it wouldnt be. This was not a movie theater teen slash movie that you'd go to with a girlfriend or boyfriend, with little stupid suspenseful scenes where the person hears something and turns around and its just their little brother coming downstairs for a drink of water. No, its not like that. With even a plot as simply thought as Panic Room's, Fincher refuses to give in and sign the teen slasher cheesy directing paper. He scared me with simply the theme of the movie. He constantly reminded me what was going on in the film, and how petrified I know I'd be if I were in Meg's (Jodie Foster) position. I guarantee all of you reading this that this movie would not be as scary as it is if it wasnt Fincher in the director's chair. The fear he puts on the characters' faces, the way he set up the whole story through the camera, and especially his camera placement and movement. He throws in all of his unique directing trademarks, most of which will remind you of Fight Club, and does them all the right times. The camera placement and movement alone scared me. I will now say that Fincher is one of the most thought provoking directors in the movie world. He makes his movies come alive, and with simply his angles, timing, and movement of the camera in coordination with the characters makes you think. Perhaps I'm speaking a little too deeply here. Fincher fans should understand what I'm talking about, especially after you see this, unless you already havent. This movie is strongly strongly recommended. I'd definately pay another 8.50 to see it again... in fact I'm considering going again tomorrow with a friend who wants to see it.

667,gojason,"Another Fincher ""tween"" Flick Doesn't Fly.",7,31 March 2002,"David Fincher has the style and technique that gives a visually impressive and immersive experience, but without the ""knock your socks off"" story the impact is diminished. It seems that Fincher gets a rather less than spectacular story for every other film he makes, starting with his first film and it leaves the audience less than blown away. Alien 3 looked good and was a solid effort, but the viewer didn't leave the theatre cheering the way his follow up Se7en did. Then his next ""tween"" film, The Game had an interesting premise, but lacked the ""what the hell is going on"" twist and turns that made Fight Club the much loved story it was.Here now we have  Panic Room which in my humble opinion continues this trend by telling a rather simple tale that really leaves you simply asking yourself, ""How are they going to get out of this one?"" instead of ""What the hell is going to happen next?"" With Alien3, The Game and now Panic Room we pretty much know where this story is going it's just a matter of how we get there whereas Se7en and Fight Club in the end left us in awe, slightly dizzy and numb from the trip we had just been on.Panic Room (and Alien and The Game for that matter) is a 1st rate suspense-thriller that carries the audience through the whole film without any snags and delivers a much better than average film.The cast was top notch and though we've seen most of these actors in many other films they left any hint of their former movie identities at home and delivered totally new and convincing performances. My only gripe is with such genre blowing titles as Se7en and Fight Club under his belt you'd think Fincher would be searching for a much more amazing tale to tell.",Panic Room
668,darwinx0r,Implausible thrillers are not exciting.,5,15 March 2002,"Just a moment to share my thought on the new film Panic Room. I happened to get a pass to an advance screening of it, and the US release date is March 29th (2 weeks from now). Many people (including myself) liked Fight Club and will probably go see Panic Room in part because it's directed by the same guy.I have to recommend against paying money to see this movie.For those of you who don't know, the basic plot :A mother and daughter move into a house that was owned by a reclusive multi-millionaire. The house comes with a ""panic room"", a safe room adjacent to the master bedroom which is intended to keep the person safe in case of home invasion. Of course, shortly after moving in, there is just such a home invasion.The fundamental problem with this film is that it isn't plausible. In order for a dramatic situation to be suspenseful, the audience has to be able to imagine that actual events would unfold as they unfold in the film. This is not the case with ""Panic Room,"" and neither nice cinematography or solid performances from two (Stewart and Whitaker) of the five leads can save it.Example :The mother and daughter are in the panic room. They're unable to call the police because they haven't hooked up the extra phone line, but the bad guys can't get in because the room is encased in steel and concrete. The bad guys try to think of a way to put pressure on the people inside, and knock holes in the wall. Luckily for them, the ventilation duct for the room is easily accessible behind a thin layer of drywall. The bad guys make use of this to pump propane gas into the room, causing a crisis.This crisis is only exciting if one can imagine a world in which a paranoid millionaire pays tens of thousands of dollars to construct a steel and concrete safe room, wire cameras to it, stock it with supplies, etc. etc., and then ALLOW UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE AIR HE WILL BE BREATHING.There's a long list of similar no-brainer plot holes that you could drive a Budget truck (from Pittsburgh) through. There's lots of bells and whistles and the script/direction keeps the movie going, but the real excitement of a thriller like this lies in imagining ""what would I do in this situation?"" However, you could never be in this situation, because this movie is not set in the real world that you and I share. The movie even makes hip self-aware nods to some of the most obvious plot holes, but referencing them without explaining them only serves to make them more glaring.I give it a thumbs down. I don't have a problem suspending disbelief, but I do have a problem suspending rational thought.",Panic Room

Anywhere he wanted the camera to go, it went; keyholes, through walls, through floors, anywhere. The only reason I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 is because I found it pretty predictable.

Regardless of what the academy may think, Fight Club was one of the best movies of all time. However, in Fincher's lasted film (Panic Room) I felt that it lacked a certain edge to it. With this genre, the quality of the film is defined by its ability to take the audience into the eyes of the victim and feel his/her terror. All I really ended up getting out of this film was a soar bum from the theater's seats and a nauxious feeling from the vain attempts at suspense.

677,queequeg092500,Foster and Fincher - A Winning Combination,10,30 March 2002,"Having set his tone and style with the breakthrough ""Fight Club"", David Fincher creates another cinematic masterpiece with ""Panic Room"".  It's the story of a recently divorced woman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) looking for a home in New York.  They find one and as an added bonus, it has a panic room, a steel lined room with tv monitors, seperate phone line and ventilation system and emergency supplies stocked in it. On the first or second night in the house, three intruders come in, not knowing anyone is living there.  What follows is a stand-off of sorts between the intruders (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam) and the residents of the house, laced with nail-biting, edge of your seat moments of suspense and action. Although not having as many speaking lines as normal, Jodie Foster is brilliant (as usual) and belivably carries the movie and the emotions in the film.  Just her facial expressions are amazing.  Another incredible force in the movie is newcomer Kristen Stewart, who plays Foster's smart-mouthed, tough but sweet, pre-teen daughter.  This being Stewart's first time under the weight of a major role, she handles it with wonderful depth and realism. Not to be forgotten are Forest Whitaker as the oafish burglar, and Dwight Yoakam is a bad guy you love to hate.  Both are memorable, along with Jared Leto as a wannabe thug.  Fincher's inventive camera angles, x-ray vision style, and uniquely-lit sets really set the mood.  He is a powerful director, who has been quite underrated. I loved this movie!

679,milan1,exercise in style over substance,3,30 March 2002,"Panic Room proves to be a very disappointing film in all aspects, except the creepiness factor. Visual ""innovation"" cannot save uneven plot with characters you don't believe-in for a minute. And that ""innovation"" means countless camera drives through insides of locks, through the walls, into the glowing fiber of the flashlight ... none of which reveals anything pertinent to the story. What seemed fresh in Fight Club is now used over and over and over ... but without a structure or purpose it really only underlines the weakness of the whole undertaking. Foster seems to be not well in trying to walk a fine acting line between unsecure sheepish mother and soon-to-burst-out ass kicking mental patient. There is a plenty of ""I love you's"" between mother and daughter characters but you feel no real relationship between the two. Her character's behaviour towards the end of the movie is out of the common sense realm. She knows that she can tell the visiting cops anything she wants because the bad guys have no audio-only pictures while watching them, but follows with a long scene of trying to make the cops believe nothing's wrong in the house. ... there are plenty of opportunities to better their plight, in the last quarter of the movie she's the one with the gun, yet isn't able to use it to her advantage... And of course she hits the bad guy in the head with a big sledgehammer so hard, he falls down to the next floor, only to come back half a minute later for the ""finale"" Pleeeeaaaasseeee!

With The Game he showed us a great story, but the ending was too happy to accompany the film.Fight Club brought us back to the gritty with an ending that wasn't happy, but wasn't sad.In Panic Room, he gives us nearly 2 hours of seat gripping, nearly over bearing, suspense, but the last two minutes makes us wonder who slapped it on there.Don't let that stop you from seeing it.  It's not THAT bad.  The movie twists and turns in directions that you'd not see coming, and better yet, while watching, you don't even TRY to think where it's going.  It grabs you and takes you for a ride.The only negative comment I really have to make is the fairly ambiguous ending.  It leaves things unanswered.  Not in a good way like Fight Club where you want to know what will happen next, but in a way that makes you think... so what DID happen?Everyone is superb in this film, Foster, Whitiker, Leto, and yes, Dwight Yoakam.  He portrays a character that you can't hate any more.  It's just not possible.I give the film an 8/10 Better that what it needed to be to be a good suspense film, but lacking in how much story there is.

The psychological twists and turns did not impress me - I was searching for something more along the impact of The Sixth Sense or The Others. I did not find that in this movie. In addition, I have a big problem understanding movies that aim to cross genres and be both a thriller and a comedy.Comedy? Yes, Comedy.No fewer than two dozen times, the audience exploded into laughter as the thieves' characters were more like the stupid robbers in the Home Alone movies. I faught between telling myself that was the point of the movie, and that it was a goof-off on the part of the scriptwriters. As a result, I found it difficult to generally be scared or frightened or thrilled because each and every time, the suspense is interrupted by laughter and silliness.Is it dark humor? I don't think so. It's not so much dark humor as a totally misguided plot. Jodie Foster's character and her daughter's performance are great - they are genuinely scared, but I see no connection between their fright and the robber's silly behavior.To conclude, I felt like laughing and shaking my head at this one.",Panic Room

For the most part I liked it until a few things started to creep in and drag the movie down.  The plot seemed forced along in parts, such as the husband showing up on his own to see what was wrong. This IS New York City we're talking about, and the guy's closer to Moses than Van Damme.  You would think after getting an emergency phone call you would wait for the police. Bring a gun or some mace at least. However he does the ""Friday the 13th There's danger there let me go have a look"" thing. Speaking of old Vorhees the one criminal that gets hit in the head with a sledgehammer, falls over the railing to the ground floor which is several floors down then crawls back up a few minutes later was REALLY Jasonish. Lastly it baffled me why she didn't at least tell the police what her situation was as no audio could get up to the panic room.

685,Leela610,weird,5,5 April 2002,"I think that this movie had a good story line, and it was fairly easy to follow. Jodie Foster was good, and so was the little girl. The only part that I didnt like about the movie was the stupidity of the criminals and the remarks that they made. Many of the things that they did reminded me of the Home Alone movies... This was a bloodier Home Alone in my eyes..... Sorry if I offended anyone!",Panic Room
686,kloffolk,"Predictable, Uninspiring, and Completely Over-Hyped.",3,9 April 2002,"After reading many reviews and hearing everyone rant and rave about this movie, I finally decided to check it out.  Boy, do I wish I could get my $8.75 back for this piece of junk. I went in expecting to be thrilled and kept on the edge of my seat like so many people were claiming, but I left the theater baffled and VERY disappointed.You all know the basic plot of the movie (if not, go find out about it), so I don't think I have to go into details on it.  Instead, I'll concentrate on telling you the reasons why I thought this movie sucked.Basically, I didn't find the movie thrilling at all.  Everything that occurs in the movie is SO predictable that you're not thrilled or surprised by anything that happens.  Supposedly though, the whole thrilling part of the movie is supposed to be the idea of you being in Jodie Foster's situation. However, if you're anything like me, you don't have a panic room so it's kind of hard to relate.  In real life, if people break into your house (God forbid), they're going to take what they want and aside from having an alarm system or something, there's pretty much nothing you can do about it.Also, if this were real life and you by chance HAD a panic room, once you locked yourself in the room you're safe.  There would be no reason to go out, no reason to do anything but either wait for the police to come or wait for the robbers to leave.  But since this is a movie, of course there HAS to be some reason for Jodie Foster to leave the room or else the movie would have no point since the room is impenetrable (although last time I checked, steel is far from impenetrable). So the movie throws in ridiculous, predictable excuses for her to leave the room that are there for no other reason than to prolong this sorry excuse for a movie.Finally, the biggest thing that bothered me about the movie was the end scenes.  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone (although the movie is so predictable, there's nothing to spoil about it), so let's just say that someone portrays super-human abilities after having something done to them. When you see the movie, you'll know what I mean.The bottom line is that this movie is nothing but a waste of your time and money.  As one of my friends that saw the movie with me said, ""This is basically just an R-rated version of 'Home Alone.'"" I couldn't have said it better myself.",Panic Room

Jodie Foster did to try to make the film work but (just like the other actors) but the script was just lame. Nice concept but no eye for details. For instance the scene when she found out the cell phone didn't work in the room.Fair enough, that could happen in real life, but at the moment she got out of the room to get the stuff she needed to aid her daughter she didn't use her cellphone! Make a call, cops arrive  , everybody safe. Maybe i am just whining to much but there were more scences like this that just irritated me.

Well, the first thing i saw: Who the hell sleeps with the lights on and someone who has diabetes, already passes out if she doesn't get a shot in an hour??. If you read some other comments you see a lot more stuff that just isn't right. This movie is so unrealistic and really no excitement at all. I laughed at parts i actually had to be shocked.

693,RoyStampler,Great movie,8,12 June 2002,"Ok, that's the best film I've seen recently. (Not counting The Others, but that's another story.) And I just can't see the problem of some people. (Possible SPOILERS ahead.) I just start hating the world ""cliché"". Yes, I admit that there are many clichés in the world of films, and yes, some of them are REALLY annoying. But hey, wake up! People make films for 100+ years! That means a lot of films! Thus it gets harder and harder day by day to make a really original story of which no one can say it's ""clichéd"" (I think it is impossible). The most important thing - for me - is simple: Panic Room can stand on its own. And it has no real faults.I don't want to repeat others, but it seems that I have to for some. Yes, the burglars made some stupid mistakes, but hey, they aren't professionals and they are REAL men - not all criminals are ""Die Hard""!  And yes, Foster had to be a little bit ""MacGyver"" and yes, his daughter had to be diabetic, because we wanted an interesting and exciting film - if you would make Panic Room with my sister and her daughter, believe me, it wouldn't be near that entertaining! And the little things... Why is that ventillation system accessible from the inside? Because the panic room isn't a prison for God's sake, its designers were not thinking about cut phone lines and criminals just wanting to get in there! (But anyway, there were that other tube leading to fresh air.) And the cameras... So simple. At the start they were the only way of two-way communication. After that they just wanted to frighten the women so it made sense to let them see what they are up to. Maybe later it would be wiser to set them off but they just forget it (they aren't perfect and they were in a stress).All in all: Panic Room is a great film, 10/10.",Panic Room

The acting in this film is acceptable enough but the plot line is completely idiotic. The bad guys here are too stupid to make it as far as Dumb Crook News.

698,MovieManiacIvy,Tepid Storyline,7,27 September 2002,"The Panic Room is essentially the story of a jilted wife, newly divorced from her wealthy, philandering husband and her young daughter having to fend for themselves and fight off three intruders the night they move into their new large brownstone on the upper west side of Manhattan.  The only place of refuge that they can turn to is the ""panic room"" - a room built for any sort of emergency to seal them off inside and keep them safe from whatever lurks beyond - an impenetrable fortress of concrete and steel.  The intruders in the meantime wreak havoc on the house trying to get into that room and a tale of cat and mouse follows.  Given the whole idea of a panic room and the premise of outwitting three seriously dangerous men in your home leaves open such a vast array of opportunity for twists and turns and suspense in a movie.Now, all that being said, I would like to say that I was disappointed with this film, but I can't as I found myself too lackadaisical to be able to ever get disappointed.  Technically proficient this movie certainly was, but I pin this waste of time on the writer, David Koepp and whoever the hell the producers were on this film.  Jodie Foster as Meg Altman turns in a wonderful performance, when does she ever seem to fall short as an actress? Her daughter, played by Kristen Stewart was also quite good and David Fincher as a director, well, he's just magic.  You give that man a camera and he settles for nothing less than perfection.  However I have a suggestion for the studios regarding Mr. Fincher - why don't you try giving him a top A list script.  Hell, I don't know, maybe have William Goldman stir one up for him, but for God's sake, do something because to see such a stellar actress and such a phenomenal director deliver all the way round and still have the story be so-so - well, the blames on the executives and the people who were supposed to be producing this thing.  I looked up the budget on Imdb as soon as I finished viewing it, and to find out it cost 48 million nearly made me choke.  Yeah, movie budgets are soaring through the roof nowadays, but please, for close to 50 mil, I want suspense, and I want plot twists that I don't expect and there wasn't much here that I wasn't already anticipating way ahead of time.  I voted a 7 and I really think that's too high but I did so only because of Foster and Fincher - afterall, why should they suffer for something that wasn't their fault.Oh, and by the way, Jared Leto is soooooo two dimensional in this film - what was he thinking?  And actually, what was Fincher thinking putting him in the role?  Villains can be very complex and they can be three dimensional, hell - real life ones are.  Leto, on the other hand, spends half his time whining and the other half screaming and never does it come across as anything deeper going on in him.  Dwight Yoakim is slightly up the food chain from Leto, but on an acting level he's still superficial.  The only one that holds up is Burnham, played by Forest Whitaker.  He shows that it's possible to take a part of a burglar and have conflicts and criminality at the same time as having humanity.  Perhaps if the other villains had been as good as him it may have helped the story not seem so robotic in it's style.All in all, I would say it's not a bad movie, but if you're looking for a good thriller, I would not recommend this film.  The only recommend I would give for this film is if you're killing time watching cable.  Above and beyond that, it just doesn't do enough to warrant much more.  And not to nag, but will somebody please give David Fincher a great script, finally???",Panic Room

Also, she's trapped in a room and doesn't know what's in it. What exactly is she spending her time while in the safe room. Make an inventory.She knows how important her daughter's medical condition is but doesn't look to see if there is food until it is almost too late. She falls for a stupid trick. She really needs to be more careful. She really should first call the police when she first gets out. Where exactly is her cell phone...I didn't even watch the last 30 minutes when the cops showed up at the door. I am going to assume that she thought it best not to tell them to keep them ""safe"".

Great performances from Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart strengthen the story and creates that 'close your eyes suspense'. Never boring and always exciting to watch, 'Panic Room' is a universal film that appeals to the action/thriller genre fanatic. The camera-work is a CSI esquire 'zoom in' 'zoom out' style.

It doesn't leave a cliffhanger as hint to a 'part two'; it doesn't even leave with any real conclusion. All that we know is that Jodi Foster's character & her daughter survived. We don't know what happened with the father, with the remaining robber, with the millions in bonds, etc.This movie leaves an excited viewer feeling completely balked.I believe that a lot more excitement would've followed this movie around for years and possibly gained quite a devoted following had it actually been granted with some form of ending.All of the actors delivered ""stunning performances"", but were left in the cold with no resolution.I don't recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys seeing a movie through until the bitter end (nor 'happy' end); there is none here.-KT Pierce; Auburn, AL",Panic Room

708,wicked101,Great movie - a response to the message board filling up with stupid comments.,9,23 January 2005,"Honestly, I watched this movie from start to finish without any storyline discrepancies. I'm amazed at some of the things people have come up with to complain about. The intruders could not simply leave the house even for a short time because that leaves Meg (Jodie Foster) and daughter Sarah free to wander the house. One could remain in the panic room, eyes on the criminals now outside (thanks to the outside cameras) while another gets a mobile phone, shout across to neighbours, hell even make an escape by taking as long as is needed to undo the barricades previously set  so long as there is ample warning time if the criminals decide to come back in, which the person in the panic room could provide. The situation goes in favor of our heroes once the criminals take the defensive  any lengthy amount of time can be used to their advantage to do whatever they want in the house, including calling the cops, which would defuse the entire situation. The criminals therefore must stay on the offensive; thinking of ways to get them out or lingering nearby the panic room entrance. The also could NOT have waited for them to 'starve to death', which would take weeks given the food supply (they did not know about Sarah's condition), as somebody somewhere would have noticed. As you mention there are cameras in most places but not everywhere. I can guarantee there would be cameras at each entrance/exit, so the ""we escaped (but are actually hiding)"" trick would have no effect. Even more ridiculous is the user review on this movie that states the robbers could leave he premises and return when they Meg goes ""to work"". That would be a great idea, because there would be ample time to call the entire state police department the guard the area. Sigh. Think before you write stupid things. The single mother and daughter were able to afford it, as touched on, hmm. many times during the film, the husband was rich and, as stated in the first five minutes of this film, ""He could afford it"". The SWAT team arrived as a result of gunshots and general loud noises. They had been called before that morning so a second call from multiple people (probably different ones too) would have a greater effect. Anyway, enough bashing people's stupid ideas. I thought it was an ace movie and just how a panic room should be portrayed. A safe as can be humanly created, but once the slightest thing goes wrong in the most intense situation, you can kiss your panic room mentality goodbye.

I think Kristen Stewart (who played Sara)was brilliant in Cold Creek Manor, and seeing that she starred in this film, was what attracted me to it. The film is about a mother (Meg Altman) and her daughter (Sara Altman) who buy an enormous townhouse, complete with working elevator and a full security PANIC ROOM, in Manhatten. However on the first night in the house, three armed robbers break in an attempt to steal a fortune which they think is theirs by rights. Unfortunately, Meg wakes up and realises what is happening. She and Sara only have one chance to survive. So the claustrophobic mother, and the diabetic daughter take refuge in the panic room. Sure, with four concrete walls, a reinforced steel door between them and the robbers, as well as monitors that allow them to see every room of the house, they seem pretty safe.

Sure, some films like to leave the ending open to interpretation...but I don't think this qualifies as a successful attempt at that. Characters are supposed to grow and change by the film's end...in this film we're left at the exact same place we started...with Jodi and her kin seeking a home.

True, it does start out kind of slow to introduce the characters and how they act/are. As soon as the killers are in, it's a question of what to do next? This movie really makes you want to lock your doors at night. I really like the choice of criminals: the true-Mofia guy (Raoul), the one who wants the money (Junior) and the one that needs the money (Vernom/Bernom). It was a shame how the last part of the movie was, since we never really did get to see what happened with Vernom (or Bernom, I never could tell). He didn't get the money, had to kill a guy to save a life, and then go to jail.. that is, if Meg didn't tell them he was a good guy. It makes you wonder what she would say, though. ""He's my body guard,"" or ""He's a friend of mine,"" doesn't seem like a cop would believe. I really question what Meg did that made the cops come back. Nonetheless, this whole movie is about 'What comes next?' A lot of questions are left unanswered, but sometimes that makes a great movie. It made this one even more awesome.

Many reviewers complained that the script was weak, I agree to some extent, but even with an unspectacular script this is still a very watchable thriller. If you think it's difficult to forgive the way this film grabs you, there are other ways to like it. The story, even clichéd, is still interesting and suspenseful.
