0,nogodnomasters,She's very pretty,7,21 April 2021,"The story centers on Danielle (Rachel Sennott ) who has constructed a web of lies. She was sex for money with Max (Danny Deferrari ) and tells him it is for law school. I don't think she is even in college as her major changes depending on who she talks to at the Shiva. I believe it was once ""gender business studies."" At the Shiva is her old girlfriend Maya (Molly Gordon). They were once an item and her mom knows about it. Danielle starts to drink when Max shows up with his wife and her baby that Danielle did not know he had. Danielle makes things more complicated than they needed to be.There was a lot of Jewish style humor in this feature that might seem funnier to someone who is actually Jewish.Guide: F-word. Brief sex. Near nudity. Danielle likes to take her top off with her back to the camera.",Shiva Baby
1,deloudelouvain,Not bad for an Indie.,7,19 July 2021,"Shiva Baby is better than I thought it would be. I'm not going to say I was constantly laughing, far from that, but it definitely has something entertaining about it. Rachel Sennott did a great job playing her character. Watching her lie through her teeth all the time, and that whilst staying very charming (I think she's a real looker to be honest), it had to be done. The story is simple but effective. The funny parts are the older women gossiping in their Jewish way. The cinematography was not bad at all, with some really good shots every now and then. Shiva Baby isn't a long movie, rather too short, but for an indie production it's certainly worth watching.",Shiva Baby
2,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Shiva Baby (2020) 7.5/10,8,10 April 2021,"""Actually, a sitter is gravely needed when Max's Gentile wife Kim (Agron) brings their bawling bundle of joy to the shiva, Danielle's secret is at risk when telltale signs are observed by Kim, her naive act of sexual autonomy backfires and it is Maya who twigs her side hustle, a falling-out dampens their renewed passion. Beset by family friends' gossipy inquiry, a hot-and-bothered Danielle is desperate to leave, when measured small talk becomes exceedingly awkward, only a cup of lukewarm coffee can offer her a breather, and the family's egress is another scrape where everybody is squeezed out of their comfort zone but Seligman also celebrates the girls' solidarity whereas their older generation is predisposed to pass judgement.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",Shiva Baby
3,MOscarbradley,One of the best films of the year.,9,10 July 2021,"Emma Seligman's ""Shiva Baby"" is very definitely a movie in miniature, (it only runs for 77 minutes), but its bright, widescreen palette belies the fact as does the immense skill of everyone involved. It's a Jewish comedy of the old school but with a razor sharp edge, (think Elaine May), and it almost all takes place at a shiva, the 'after-party' following a funeral though we are initally introduced to its central character Danielle, (a terrific Rachel Sennott), having sex with her sugar daddy, Max (Danny Deferrori) in his apartment. You see, Danielle supplements her income, the one she gets from her rich parents, as a sex worker, not because she needs the money but because she seems to enjoy it and you can just imagine her reaction when she runs into Max at the shiva with wife and baby in tow.The film, Seligman's first feature, began life as an 8 minute short which she has now expanded into the cinematic equivalent of a really good short story and as comedies of embarrassment go this is a gem. Sennott is a star in the making but then everyone in this film is pitch-perfect especially Molly Gordon as Danielle's ex-girlfriend, (yes, she's bisexual0, and Polly Draper as the archetypal pushy but loving Jewish mother. Throw in a score by Ariel Marx that seems to be priming you for some 'Psycho'-like action and you have one of the very best films of the year.",Shiva Baby
4,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The chaos of cringe.,7,13 June 2021,"Set mostly in real time, 'Shiva Baby (2020)' focuses on a young woman whose life seems to spiral out of control when she bumps into her sugar daddy at a shiva. It's basically an exercise in controlled chaos. With its claustrophobic atmosphere, creepy soundtrack and uncomfortably relatable cringe, the picture basically feels like a panic attack on screen. In many ways, it actually tells its tales using tropes of the horror genre. It swaps jump-scares for awkward confrontations, monsters for judgmental relatives and blood and guts for unattainable expectations. It's not scary, as such, but it certainly gets under your skin, eking as much suspense from its central situation as possible. It puts you in the position of its protagonist, bombarded with passive aggressive prying and close calls with the truth. There's almost always an impending sense of doom; devastation seems inevitable. The flick isn't dour, though. It's often quietly funny, its comedy coming purely from its characters and their almost unbearable social situation. There's quite a bit of dramatic irony going on and it works very well. As does the character development in general, which is slight but significant. Every player feels like an actual person, like someone you could (and probably do) actually know, and that's really impressive. Overall, this is an entertaining and engaging film. It's interesting, well-written and unique. 7/10.",Shiva Baby
5,A_Different_Drummer,Let's Be Frank ...,7,3 April 2021,"Hollywood has taken a lot of body blows recently; from COVID; from the endless demand for streaming content; and from audience pushback against Tinseltown's horrid culture of self-adoration. Viz, the historically low ratings for the award shows. The only content sector unaffected by all his is the indie category. And, with almost Biblical timing, along comes Emma Seligman, an indie writer/director with an ear for dialog and an eye for staging a scene. She faithfully delivers just the sort of fun ethnic romp which, only a few short years ago, would have been the exclusive territory of a ""name"" writer or director. Good for her! Recommended.",Shiva Baby
6,ops-52535,a master and his mistress...,6,3 April 2021,"At the finishline, and handmoney for the handjob i exchanged, is the start of this movie, the next moment we dive into a jewish funeral, a relative to our mistress has passed away. And as serendipitous the world maybe, the master shows up with his wife and baby, a slam dunk in the young mistress tummy, and the whole calamity of shiva parafrenilia becomes like a preassure cooker of humble embarassing comedy...its a film youll either love or hate, it could have been like loadinga haubitser with a nuke of slapstick and jolly good fun if they wanted, but its all held in a very serious tight way of humour, cause the elders are still the oldest, and the gossip and backtalking really shoots the target very well.Its a film of secluded sexual cravings, anhd the mjobile phone shows its significance yet again on the silverscreen. The filming is quite special, and i wonder if the whole shiva segment was filmed as a ''one-take'' experiment. Good it is, and the acting are dead on realistic all over the line.But if your in for a comedy where you laugh at the top of the lungs, you might be let down, i though, the grumpy old man, had a long smiling event watching, therefore a recommend.",Shiva Baby
7,matthewssilverhammer,Family Gatherings are Nightmares,9,30 July 2021,"Shiva Baby is like if Ari Aster stepped away from horror (sort of) to make a raunchy college rom-com. Danielle, a troubled, razor-sharp, self-conscious Jewish woman, confronts all kinds of personal trauma (most of it self-inflicted) at a family shiva. Director Seligman presents the extended family gathering as the claustrophobic nightmare it often can be. Danielle's unnerving, thinly-veiled calmness and inevitable bursts of overwhelmed breakdowns are a cathartic and uncomfortable good time.",Shiva Baby
8,paul-allaer,Outstanding character study with astute observations,7,8 July 2021,"As ""Shiva Baby"" (2020 release; 78 min.) opens, college student Danielle is with her sugar daddy, a guy named Max. Danielle rushes off to meet up with her parents at a shiva. There she runs into her longtime friend (but now somewhat estranged) Maya, who has just been accepted into law school. The contrast between these two couldn't be greater. Then comes the shocker: who but Max himself, along with his wife and their 18 mth. Old baby, show up at the shiva...Couple of comments: this is the debut feature-length film from writer-producer-director Emma Seligman, adopting her 2017 short of the same name into a full-length. I haven't seen the short, but from having seen the feature-length, I have nothing but praise for Segilman. This film is full of astute observations, and provides a nuanced portrait and character study of Danielle, insecure and lacking in confidence as she tris to find her way in life. The social pressure from her parents and the many family friends at the shiva is unintentional but very real. And what about the encounter with Max? I'm not going to tell you of course... Please note that this almost feels like a theater play, as the entire film plays out in one particular house in Brooklyn. Kudos to Rachel Sennott, who plays the lead character Danielle just perfectly. Bottom line: this is one of those 'little' movies that packs a wallop far greater that could be expected. Filmed on an almost non-existing budget, this is markedly better than what Hollywood delivers on a regular basis and with budgets that test the belief.""Shiva Baby"" was supposed to premiere at last year's SXSW festival, but then a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. It finally screened at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival, to immediate critical acclaim. After a release in select theaters this Spring, ""Shiva baby"" started playing on HBO recently, which is where I caught it. If you have any interest in a well-developed indie film showcasing a great character study, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it on HBO On Demand or other streaming services, or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Shiva Baby
9,andrewchristianjr,MORE LIKE SUGAR BABY.,7,7 May 2021,"So I quite liked this one.

Then it seems like she is going to tell Max's wife what's been going on. Also, she reunites with an ex-girlfriend. I'm not sure what to make of the ending--Max's wife found Danielle's phone in the bathroom, but we don't know for sure if she looked at what was on it. As they are all leaving, everything is uncertain. I was fine with this movie. I liked the lead actress and the supporting cast did well enough.",Shiva Baby

12,questl-18592,"Shiva girl, shiva",8,6 August 2021,"As a not Jewish person, I really appreciated this movie and it's attempt to give me a glimpse into the life of a modern woman trying to get by in her very traditional Jewish family. The fact that it's all condensed into one space, one day really helps build up the pressure and the tension in a way that feels fully authentic and earned. Some of the performances are a little rough around the edges, but not in a distracting way and actually serves to make this feel more like a real and authentic sort of indie piece.This feels like a worthwhile watch, it's small and concise and explores a subject that doesn't feel like it gets enough time.",Shiva Baby
13,martimusross,Acting Out At A Jewish Wake!,7,19 June 2021,"Shiva BabyWhilst quite an irritating watch that presented largely stereotypical characters in predictable scenarios this movie was well worth seeing for the central performance alone. Danielle played by Rachel Sennott dominated throughout demonstrating a nervous freneticism as her world imploded, she really was very convincing and potentially a star of the future.Several themes was explored in an albeit shallow way, these were, the lack of boundaries in family's, rivalry, rebelliousness and parental expectations. This surface exploration was quite satisfactory as this movie was a comedy after all!While niche viewing I'm going to give this a solid 7 out of 10 for the tight script and tight acting, my only criticism was the repetitive nature of some of the scenes when there was plenty of scope for variety.",Shiva Baby
14,juanmuscle,"I don't know who this person is, from the pic it looks like a cute chick...",10,15 August 2021,"But from this writing , it is evident that something much more intense and add every adjective that is beautiful and intelligent and shove into the human chasm of this sensitive artist. If you are young and beautiful and aspire to do something in film , this is the templar for a first time screenplay/director affair you so hope and desire emanates out of you , especially after long hours of lucubrating by candle-light by dint of attending some prestigious film school. This is exactly the ideal of what true fun indie film making is all about , making something out of nothing on a budget and making your stamp on the industry! I guarantee this lil' cute lady will be doing a lot more in the future to come in this industry. Just based on the writing alone rooted deep in the pathos of our human condition which extends beyond transcendent time in the nonce is astonishing but added to which her directing is fine, her editing is stellar, and her choice of thespians is grandeur! This was , IS spectacular , I can't say enough good things about this artist, when the protagonist crumbled to a heap and prostrated before those books and ordained the religion , observed its tenets, the ancillary characters watching over her so pensively like astute busts from another time whence eminent philosophers composed such canons. And the ensuing dialogue with her mother , broke my heart as we get to see the piquant survival instinct of our youth retained so boldly and yet with so much defiance, who in the hell could possibly attempt to gainsay this first time writer/director is nothing short of brilliant is , I don't know... but imo , I think we have only tapped what lil' water will later manifest into gold , alchemy is this ladies gift , cause she can and will do so much god willing!",Shiva Baby
15,Movi3DO,True horror,8,2 July 2021,"Who brings a baby to the shiva?A college girl meeting her sugar daddy at the shiva, and for an hour and a half we watched the horror played out at the shiva.The first half was pretty okay. It's just a bit of set up and I didn't know where the movie was going yet. Then the second half came and this movie became hilariously intense. The most unique aspect was for sure the use of the horror sound. You definitely hear these violin sounds in so many horror movies trailers. And they were surprisingly appropriate in this movie, where there were no horror that you would think of in a horror movie.Talking to many people while knowing your sugar daddy is in the same place was terrifying. The suffocation where you had to endure conversations and gossips that you did not want to be in was horrifying. The music along with the constant talking between characters made our main character anxious, and I even felt anxious as well.Overall, a incredibly smart usage of sounds to amplify the realism of a situation. 8.5/10.",Shiva Baby
16,SameirAli,Excellent.,9,19 September 2021,"Developed from the short film of the same name by the same writer- director, this is an interesting movie. A very small subject was very well executed in a very professional way. Film School elements can be seen everywhere like the Script, Cinematography, Direction etc. Acting is worth mentioning, everyone did an amazing natural job. Set in (almost) a single location and the events happening in a few hours. It lags occasionally here and there, but definitely a brilliant approach from an almost all female crew. A very promising team, expecting some really good future projects from Emma Seligman.",Shiva Baby
17,SoumikBanerjee25,The Most Bizarre & Offbeat Drama I Have Ever Seen In My Entire Film!,9,23 May 2021,"""Shiva Baby""; a perspicacious work of art that bluntly introspects a handful of societal paradigms! It follows a series of unfavorable events that come to pass in a Jewish congregation for the deceased. Centered around Danielle; A young Jewess, who finds it difficult to come to terms with her 'Sexual Preferences' amongst such Conservative Parents and particularly the Orthodox Community she belongs to!""Oh, you guys are at the Holocaust museum. You look so... happy!""My profound love for Movies often brings me to some of the most provocative & gutsy endeavors lying around! I simply take delight in witnessing aforesaid pieces of Cinema! And this one clearly fits the bill. In all likelihood, it might be the most bizarre & offbeat drama I have ever seen in my entire life!Much to my surprise, I took a liking to this quirky tale.Whilst reprehending purported social codes, it brashly unmasks the pretentiousness each of us protrudes when we carry ourselves publicly! Putting on fake smiles, making things up; so afraid of embarrassing our beloved ones in front of other people. Avowedly displaying grim realities of communal living amidst all the inner conflicts and bitter failures we face in our personal lives.Do exercise patience for its rather chaotic first act though, as it may appear quite disconcerting to some. You would certainly feel its weighty narration and the specific manner in which all these characters get their due introductions! But after a while, kinda unknowingly it gets you involved!On the spur of the moment; we become another guest at this gathering! All thanks to its imperiously penned Screenplay which acts as the most decisive part of this whole execution! On top of an equally effective Score that greatly intensifies the element of Tension in here.Seemingly Claustrophobic at times!Let us come down to another key aspect i.e. Performance. Now where do I even start? The full ensemble did outstanding work. And do I really have to tell how immaculate Rachel Sennot is? From her instinctual Facial Cues to occasional modifications in her demeanor in accordance with different scenes; all of it evidently connotes the raw talent she possesses!Before I conclude; Let me give you some wise words of advice. The plot has dealt with a slew of contentious topics such as Patriarchy, Feminism, Gender Norms. If you are someone who gets easily offended, keep your distance!If not, then you can find a relatively familiar coming of age story beneath all that.",Shiva Baby
18,garethcrook,Wince inducing dark comedy.,6,4 August 2021,"A shiva is often described as a Jewish wake. I've been to a few wake's and a few shiva's, they really aren't the same but that's probably not important. Nobody seems to care all that much about the deceased or the family here. The shiva is more of a vehicle to bring people together in situations they'd rather not be in. Darkly comedic situations that are wince inducing as they are funny. It's pretty trope laden, with a rather uncomfortable amount of stereotypes. Danielle (Rachel Sennott) is not the well behaved high achiever that her parents would like her to be able to boast about. She's bored, awkward and quite lost. Her parents are pushy and overly concerned about their only daughter, or concerned about her future. Danielle finds herself in the most awkward of social situations with ex girlfriends, current clients from her secret job. An endless string of reminders that Danielle's life is, if not a mess, certainly not what her parents want for her. The film isn't a mess though. It's structured pretty well and although Danielle isn't especially nice, we do start to feel a little sorry for her and Sennott plays her well. The chaotic tension swirling around her, threatening to blow its lid at any second. For all it's unlikely set ups, it's quite understated, well shot, wonderfully scored. It's good and I'm interested to see more of Sennott and feature debut director Emma Seligman who've developed this from a 2018 short. Definitely ones to watch.",Shiva Baby
19,Azanspy,One of the best Indies I have ever watched.,9,7 April 2021,"Shiva Baby is so funny, dark and thrilling at the same time. Great performances and direction. Shiva Baby correctly captures a confused Jewish girl I guess, I'm not Jewish.",Shiva Baby
20,sweidman-28016,Another Krisha!,8,10 April 2021,"""You look like Gwyneth Paltrow on food stamps- and not in a good way.""In this anxiety inducing film taking place at a Jewish funeral service (or a shiva), a college student runs into her sugar daddy and a past girlfriend all with her parents, family, and friends attending. If you've ever seen Krisha, this is very similar in how stressful of a watch it is. Shiva Baby is pure anxiety. And I really liked it. The awkwardness and offbeat comedy make it an experience like no other. I found myself laughing (mostly internally) by how uncomfortable I felt. Writer and director Emma Seligman portrayed every bit of these emotions perfectly. She adapted this from her own short film from just a few years ago, and I would love to see it if I get the chance. Returning from the short film is also the lead actress Rachel Sennott. She is going places. Her performance is phenomenal. She has to convey all of these emotions without hardly showing them. It's not necessarily like an artistic subtle performance but it's all internal.These emotions keep building up and up and up. We see this through the camera work and score. The cinematography does great with movement and focusing on what it should when. There are all these different conversations happening simultaneously so it can be difficult to pick up on what should be seen or heard, but with the cinematography and sound design it really does help. And the score is on edge like a suspenseful horror movie. Shiva Baby is horror in a unique way. The runtime is fairly short just shy of 80 minutes but you hardly feel how short it is with all that's going on. I'm glad that it wasn't prolonged into adding more than it didn't need to. It does have its highs and lows in tension. I'm glad we had a few moments to breathe for just a moment. There's not much to complain here. It has a great ensemble, a wonderful lead performance, good use in style technically, and an overall solid story. Shiva Baby is a quirky, poignant dark-comedy that will and should gain a cult following for what it all has to offer. Definitely see this if you can!",Shiva Baby

You really don't need to be Jewish to get what's going on but I guess the writer needed to convey a message that at a Shiva, it can be more than just mourning, prayers and eating going on.

23,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Seligman + Sennott - a dark comedy duo to die for,10,4 August 2021,"It's nuts how much I love this movie. It's a flawless dark comedy that gets everything right.I'm sure the strongest factor is that I am so infatuated with lead actress Rachel Sennott's presence - she has become my newest ""silver screen"" crush through this movie. She perfectly encapsulates the precise and very real type of woman that I have found myself wildly drawn to and amused by throughout this...nightmarish era we've been trudging through: a highly intelligent, seemingly nihilistic, dreamy internet sad girl in which every single thing that comes out of her mouth feels like a sarcastic tweet (& I quickly learned that this makes a lot of sense because she's totally one of those people in reality - I've just never seen it capitalized upon as brilliantly as it is in this film, ever before). Her character is just the right amount of monster - the same amount of monster that most of us are in reality, at least the ones who are unwilling to deny the greatest of truths. Every moment with her is colossally entertaining. Every word, every thought, every expression, every hesitation.But it's not JUST Sennott...the writing, directing, and editing are immaculate. Director Emma Seligman has instantly put herself on a pedestal of top notch filmmakers with this unbelievable debut. This is very much one of those films in which you feel it HAS to be taken so closely from someone's real life experience... if not, I'd be shocked, but even more impressed. In a synopsis, this story might not seem like one worth telling, but Shiva Baby knows exactly what to do - it's all about the tension of every little moment. After seeing this, I think Seligman could make a movie about 7-Eleven hot dogs cooking on those in-store roller grills and still turn it into a nail-biting masterpiece.The whole cast is phenomenal too. Molly Gordon, who I previously knew as ""that really likable Emma Stone lookalike from Good Boys"" really shines in this, and some of the stuff that goes down with her, and other characters in this movie are straight up HOT. I mean, the whole movie is super hot, to be honest. Danny Deferrari and Dianna Agron as ""the couple"" both put in super memorable, powerful performances as well - Agron is seriously intimidating, and Deferrari is just immensely believable - such a realistic portrayal. All in a house together for the entire film, and wow, do they make it work.I love the subtle, eerie music score too - it perfectly complements the overall tone of the entire film - a slow creep into pure anxiety, but in a way that you're able to thoroughly laugh at it, and enjoy it, because you're on the outside. It's really quite thrilling, always hilarious, sometimes shocking, and I feel like I could watch it over and over again.I'm digging that 2021 seems to be the year of in-your-face, femme-powered, sex-work-adjacent comedies just OWNING the scene. It all feel so RIGHT NOW and I'm here for it. This and Zola are my two favorite movies of the year so far, but I think this one has the slight edge because of it's perfect structural and thematic qualities - whereas Zola is just much, much, much more unhinged. Both seem to have fantastic replay value though, in my opinion - and hey, that's worth more than almost anything, isn't it?",Shiva Baby

27,danybur,A suffocating kafkaesque comedy,7,21 December 2020,"The film begins with little more than a teenager Danielle (Rachel Sennot) having sex with a man about 20 years older than her, until they are interrupted by a phone call, in a remarkable fixed shot. When we say goodbye we realize that love does not unite them. The call is from her mother (an interesting Polly Draper) to remind her to go to a family friend's shiva (for the Jewish creed, shiva is the period of mourning after the death of a loved one and begins with a meeting with food and drink and is prolonged in a kind of ""guard"" that lasts for seven days). Danielle finds herself in the shiva with Maya, a former friend / lover of hers (a Molly Gordon of remarkable naturalness), and with an unexpected third party, giving rise to a situation that turns the meeting into a nightmare for Danielle.We could summarize this film as a comedy of entanglements that crosses between Buñuel's Exterminating Angel with Woody Allen and some Ozon, since with Jewish New York characters in a social gathering it is impossible not to think about the second (although in this case, they are more vulgar). To the discomfort of seeing her secrets threatened, Danielle adds that of the treatment professed by the adults in the meeting. The director and screenwriter Emma Seligman indulges in some somewhat acidic (and somewhat basic and misogynistic) painting, albeit with hints of aggiornamiento, of a certain New York Jewish community.In its first segment, the film begins to stagnate since the good approach does not evolve or is repeated, but then the general tension and oppression of the main character are consolidated as more characters enter to carve and due to the change in setting and the incidence of a slightly irritating soundtrack, achieving a Kafkaesque discomfort that spreads to other characters and the viewer, in this odyssey of a post-adolescent who seeks her independence.",Shiva Baby
28,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Ehhhh,6,5 April 2021,"I felt it started off well but then just got tedious and boring to watch. And I dont feel like the story really progresses in any way or any lessons learned. And I questioned so many times why she didnt just leave. Like sure, its probably not very couth to leave a Shiva early. But we're talking about a lady that didnt even attend the funeral to begin with, doesnt go to temple anymore etc. Like, she doesnt strike me as a traditionalist so why stay and endure all that crap. And I just didnt find anyone very likable. The Jewish mothers are portrayed to be very judgy. The ex-girlfriend comes across as a mean girl. The Sugar daddy is cheating is on his wife. I guess you can feel some sympathy for Kim (Dianna Agron) as she somewhat blindsided by the affair - but then sensing something is a foot tries to embarrass and make the lead uncomfortable by insisting she hold her baby. And then theres the main girl herself. Who despite looking guilty and ashamed the movie still tries to send nudes and give a BJ to her married sugar daddy. I guess clueless dad gets the vote for only nice character.It certainly wasnt the worst movie, but I was just kind of hoping the movie would go somewhere or something would happen. Instead it ends up being like an 1 hour and 20 min of an uncomfortable get together. Nobody really learns anything and nothing really happens to any of them. Danielle and Maya getting back together at the end feels forced.",Shiva Baby
29,nidhunmoviebuff,A delightful dark comedy that doubles up as a thriller!,8,16 June 2021,"Director Emma Seligman's delightful 'Shiva Baby' is a delicate tightrope act that keeps the audience guessing, jumping genres from comedy to thriller at every turn.The Shiva in the title refers to the week-long mourning period in Judaism after the bereavement of close relatives and a funeral forms the core of the story.Rachel Sennott is terrific as young Danielle, a troubled teen who has to resort to 'unconventional' means to fund her gender studies courses while constantly having to hide her sexuality and true self from her overbearing parents.Danielle is thrown into a clutch of judgmental relatives at the funeral and how she comes to terms with the various challenges they throw at her forms the rest of this rollicking laugh riot.The tension is ramped up brilliantly with chilling music and close shots and the audience cant help by root for the highly flawed yet immensely relatable protagonist.Fred Melamed, Molly Gordon and Danny Deferrari are terrific in their supporting roles but it is Polly Draper as the fast-talking, over-intrusive mom that truly catches the eye.

Her previous relationship, much to the eye-rolling chagrin of her fast explaining parents, was with Maya. There's a lot to unpack in Danielle's bursting suitcase.As if rubbing sharp elbows with the stalking relatives wasn't enough, the shiva house welcomes Danielle's entire relationship world into a crazy jail of confinement. Wine is gulped, bagels are scarfed, eyebrows are raised, cross room glances burn. It is one simmering plot boiler. Glorious.Funny, horrific and thought-provoking in equal does, ""Shiva Baby"" is the condensed drama nightmare most scatter to avoid.Oy vey.hipCRANK.",Shiva Baby

It's simple and almost takes place in one location but it keeps getting tensional and hilarious through funny dialogues, that are full of lies and deceptions, and a beautiful intense score.

Had it been 15 minutes longer, I'd have hated it!Although this is very personal opinion and I think a lot of others people might appreciate it. But the lack of morality by the protagonist doing gender studies was a turn-down for me. The helpless-victim outlook even after being aware of your inappropriate deeds and yet reaching out to the guy is jus not making any sense to me. Maybe that was the point of them all.The only good part is the environment of chaos created with some sarcasm on the society show-off.",Shiva Baby
33,Ladiloque,Great subject,10,15 June 2021,"At times extremely funny and/or unsettling: a great subject that promises fireworks! Nice music, great acting and scene design/direction (and the poster... lol).Unfortunately I guess that in the passage from short to full length some of the focus got lost, replaced by a little too many clichees, far-fetched stuff, unsophisticated farce and dumbness. It could have been an award worthy screenplay had it found some more refined plotlines and angles.Being so fresh and undemanding it's still a must watch if you're looking for a recent comedy. Indeed I'm baffled as to why the ratings are not higher (7): I guess it's because those that watch indie stuff are more ""balanced"" in their positive votes? It's a 7 for me as well but I'll go with a 10: I'd be happy if just 20-30 a year of all the countless trashy american comedies produced were this good.",Shiva Baby

It was like watching an inescapable nightmare and the kindness and attention lavished on the protagonist feels oppressive and unconcentual.

35,varun-25071997,Weird But Interesting,7,1 January 2021,"Shiva Baby is a short coming of the age story told from a Jewish experience and perspective. The similarities to Krisha and Yes God Yes are inevitable for many reason mainly because of the runtime. Less than 80 minute feature films are supposed to be TV movies but directors are bold enough to trust their content such that they are willing to release it theatrically.The entire film takes place in a Jewish funeral home with our protagonist Danielle (Rachel Sennott), a soon to be graduate who also tends to make money by indulging in sex work secretively without the knowledge of her friends and family. The story begins when she meets a customer of hers in the funeral.

Her insufferable, but caring parents shake down a lot of the funeral guests seeking a job opportunity for Danielle. This greatly embarrasses Danielle because it shows everyone she is adrift in life with no direction.Throw in an ex lesbian lover, and a married family friend she sleeps with for money, his wife and their infant and bang... instant anxiety.Rachel Sennott , as Danielle does a very good job, but her character is like a Jewish girl version of George Costanza from Seinfeld. She makes one bad decision after another.I can't find a lot of fault with the movie. I spent most of the movie wanting Danielle to leave the reception so the embarrassment-agony would end.

46,roondogbb,Very successful movie,7,15 June 2021,"Shiva baby brings together under the unbrella of Jewish Shiva, Danielle (the young prostitute) and her sugar daddy Max, neither of whom had any idea they had social connections beyond their sexual arrangment. The film is a great character study that looks at how Danielle views herself as a young woman and who she wants to be, as opposed to the the background of people at the shiva who have an sense of very traditionalist values, (grow up be a lawyer / find a man). The claustrophic nature of her encountering not only her sugar daddy but countless other judgemental people makes for good interactions. She also encounters a past love interest which further increases the claustrophobic nature of the movie.The film is produced in such a way that the akwardness and emotions are heightened to a peak using different lighting techniques, visual techniques and good sound. Which makes the film a pleasure to watch soley from the place of being a movie lover. The movie deserves a solid 7.

47,Victor_Fallon,Cringe comedy that lacks creativity.,4,27 June 2021,"Rachel Sennot and Molly Gordon are both strong points in this otherwise ordinary film. Their interactions are a saving grace in this fairly simple one-location dialogue-driven comedy. It is rarely played for laughs and tries to squeeze humour out of uncomfortable/awkward scenes dealing with young love, secrets, lies and manipulation during a family gathering after a funeral.The rest of the cast is very poor. All of the adults are cliches you've seen a billion times before and their acting is overblown and stagey, particularly the mother, who mugs for the camera like she's in a Jim Carrey movie. All the supporting cast's dialogue is massively overwritten and interchangeable, delivered in an unchanging rapid-fire style with zero charm.The direction is dull throughout, with scenes constructed entirely from close-ups and mid-shots with no creativity or variety. It's very claustrophobic with little respite - which is thematic, I suppose, but visually boring. I found it hard to tolerate. Some promising work from the the young leads, though.",Shiva Baby

49,JoelAlexanderr,Suspenseful and hilarious film that deserves any praise it receives,9,16 April 2021,"SHIVA BABY takes the viewing audience through every single emotion known to man in its short hour and 17 minute runtime: anxiety, fear, hilarity, confusion, relief, enjoyment, etc. This is all from a film that's labeled as a comedy and that takes place in one location for the majority of the runtime. It's hard to say I've ever seen anything quite like SHIVA BABY, and I have nothing but praise to shower onto director/writer Emma Seligman's shoulders. It's wildly original and not quite like anything else being produced today, which is a rare thing to say.We follow Danielle (brilliant newcomer Rachel Sennott) as she traverses a Jewish funeral service she doesn't want to be at. Her more successful ex-girlfriend (Molly Gordon) is there, the family members constantly ask probing questions, and she ends up having to lie to everyone about how successful her life is looking. Oh, and her sugar daddy shows up and makes things worse. It isn't a pleasant experience for her to day the least, and her disposition slowly unravels as the service presses on.Not enough praise can be showered upon this film for the absolutely stellar direction from Seligman, which often makes the viewer feel as they are trapped in this funeral service with Danielle and her many insecurities. Rarely does a movie come along that simultaneously feels like a horror movie and a farce. The editing is also top-notch, with the close-ups and quick cuts delivering a suffocating feeling during the more intense scenes compared to the slowness of the more calm scenes. The way it portrays family drama is the most accurate I've seen in some time, with the probing questions from relatives (""When are you gonna get a job?"" ""What are you doing after college?"" ""Do you have a boyfriend?"") being something everyone in this generation has likely had to endure at some point.A major compliment I have for this movie is the fact that it portrays its taboo subjects with such a casual nature that it ends up normalizing them and creating space for understanding and empathy. The main character is Jewish, bisexual and a sex worker, and yet these things are all shed in a positive and normal light because this is the reality which many people in this college generation get by. The movie explores the struggles of a young woman in 2021 trying to grapple with her own self-importance, and the realistic and progressive depiction of her identity is a leap forward in terms of lending a voice to this inner dilemma.I hope more people seek SHIVA BABY out, because it is one of the most tightly written, anxiety-inducing, and awkwardly hilarious scripts of the post-pandemic world. Not one scene falls flat, and every single cast and crew member involved puts in fantastic work. Emma Seligman is a name to remember, and I will be eagerly anticipating her next project.A.",Shiva Baby

I am not religious, bisexual or have I anything to do a sugar daddy (I think?), but there are so many moments that make this chaotic Shiva so relatable and anxiety building. While are main character isn't really likable, she becomes so relatable that we start caring about her. It also builds up to tension and anxiety so naturally, that we actually feel the pressure rising. The score also really helps with that and adds something to the stress that are protagonist is feeling. That stress is also what makes the story so relatable. I'm in the same age range as are protagonist, and I'm also building up anxiety every day. Everybody has been in this time when there is so much uncertainty in your life and maybe that's why the movie resonated with me so much. The movie exaggerates a bit which definitely hurts it a little, but it's still so clever in it's writing, that it makes it so funny and anxiety akin. I probably missed about a hundred more things on why this is one of the best comedy's of the year, but I don't care, I'm going to watch it again now.",Shiva Baby

What she doesn't expect to see is her lover and her ex-girlfriend in the same place at once which sends her down a spiral of anxiety for the rest of the evening.Rachel Sennott plays Danielle with just the right amount of exhaustion, sass, and desperation. She's selfish and immature in the way most of us were at that age, but she never goes a bridge too far and takes us off her side.While Shiva Baby is incredibly funny in parts, it's always an excellent cinematic depiction of anxiety, carefully ratcheting up the tension with every scene until we, too, feel we're in Danielle's shoes.

Super subtle, which is very impressive.What I found so compelling was when the lead said Dianna Agron was so boring, and on the face of it, she was right. Nothing like the blonde bombshell the other character said. It was so confusing. So I looked her up and it clicked DA was in The Family. What an unstoppable force of nature she was in that; like, WOW! So sexy! So ... what happened with her in this? Where's her energy? What happened? And then, her character opens up.

If you enjoyed Trey Edward Schultz's ""Krisha"", and you want another story of a woman at a family gathering with an atmosphere of uncomfortable tension punctuated by a low-key score, but as a comedy, you'll probably really enjoy this movie.Maintaining a strong sense of energy/tension/discomfort/hilarity for a whole movie IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT and VERY IMPRESSIVE.From the perspective of the protagonist Danielle everyone else seems to have their lives figured out and her refusal to be honest about her uncertainty of where her life is going leads to plenty of awkward miscommunication and amusing moments. The performers' delivery of the script is great, which is a huge relief, because great scripts, particularly for comedies, can fall flat if the delivery isn't perfectly in-sync with the screenwriter's intent. Plenty of indie comedies with decent scripts lack convincing dialogue delivery.The tension builds along with the intensity of the score and the suffocating way the shots are composed. The grinning faces of Danielle's elderly relatives are occasionally framed in a way that they appear comically menacing.I'm always looking for good comedies, which can be hard to come by.

For a movie under 90 minute it felt insufferable. I understand that's the premise to an extent- but when does the audience ever have a chance to breathe? It's simply 80ish minutes of Jewish caricatures parading around a Shiva, while an unlikeable protagonist avoids her sugar daddy and annoying ex. To make matters worse our lead is both detached and unlikeable. I can't sympathize with a privileged girl who apparently has no motive for her behavior? The film should have spent more time delving into Danielle as a character. It felt as though she was merely in the background of her own story (and the audience's too). If you want to see a film repeat itself four times in the span of 80 minutes, I'd recommend this film. Yet, if you want to see a film that actually does something, or understands the allure of conflict- I'd recommend any and everything else.(Afterthought: The soundtrack was grating after twenty minutes.

85,doraburdan,Actually is rader...,7,22 September 2021,"Actually is rader a small piece of theatre and an unconventional comedy, I like it very much.For some people, this movie can be a test to try their patience.The script is a good one, they are a lot of replicas, most of them like Woody Allen's dialogues.The story is taking place in a jew's house, at one of a family member funerals....a place where gossips are on the lips of everyone.The main character is a young college graduate who feels the social pressure in order to forge her's family and to choose her's job. For becoming more financial independent, she is practicing prostitution. These posture is hard contrasting with her obedient and constientiously gal image. By the way, there is a contrast between what she seems to be and what is their real image.Their gay college experiments was evaluated throug her mother's ,,gay-radar"", who decided that were in the past. But, if is so, you may know only watch this moovie.The last scene, where the members are placed in some order in the car, has a lot of hidden messages, under the sleepy and careless aunt's look.",Shiva Baby

87,R055T,powerful indie dark comedy,8,21 June 2021,"Loved this film. I thought it was highly relatable as a gay-jewish man. Lots of family similarities. Each character was perfectly casted and realistic. Rachel Sennott was great, the audience really can empathize with her and feel her anxiety and panic rising with each scene. The way the soundtrack and music correlated with the scenes was perfect. I've been seeing some reviews compare it to a horror film, which is quite accurate, considering a family gathering can be horrific, traumatic, especially for a teenager / young-adult. I also found this film really funny, in a dark, unintentional way. Each character was just so absurd and an over-the-top caricature of what a nagging old Jewish lady could be like. The actress who played her mother was perfect as the over-bearing Jewish mother, with constant interrogation of her personal life, and crude jokes. I felt like the movie could have been a long pilot episode for a TV series. The ending was a bit abrupt, but other than that, it was an enjoyable film.",Shiva Baby

89,peterdolan11-248-225117,A Shiva worth watching,8,12 July 2021,"If you've ever been to an event whether a BBQ or a family reunion where some of the people there got on your last nerve with some funny and sometimes embarrassing moments-Then Shiva Baby is right there with you! The movie stars Rachel Sennott (Call Your Mother) as Danielle who plays a college student that runs into her sugar daddy Max (Danny Deferrai-(Madoff,Blue Bloods) at a Jewish funeral. This movie certainly had its funny moments..especially when Danielle looked like she was about to have a panic attack (or 2) from many awkward moments with the other attendees at the funeral. Molly Gordon (Good Boys) plays Maya-Danielle's arch nemesis whom also is her former lover. I enjoyed this movie and I'm sure you will too. Its still out in the theaters as well as for rental/purchase on YouTube and iTunes. It also comes out on Blu Ray at the end of July.",Shiva Baby
90,sarahdiedrich,this is not horror of any kind,5,13 July 2021,"The movie is fine (5/10 isn't bad, for me), but please don't go into this expecting horror, psychological or otherwise, just because some other reviewers tell you it's miscategorized as a comedy. Black comedy is the most fitting genre that i can think of.",Shiva Baby
91,MsBananagrabber,Uncut gems meets Fleabag kinda vibe,10,4 April 2021,"Great movie, did not expect to like it that much. Don't be fooled by a comedy tag, it's definitely not a film for everyone. Dark, awkward and cringe it's made for you to feel claustrophobic and anxious (ergo the annoying crying baby). Excellent performance and well executed movie, maybe just don't smoke w while watching, it's pretty intense.",Shiva Baby
92,oanapou,Kept waiting for something to happen,1,31 July 2021,Nothing actually happens. The entire time. None of the caracters have even one redeaming quality.,Shiva Baby
93,seniu527,Failed at dialogues,3,28 June 2021,"My biggest problem is the dialogues. The way most people speak in the film is not believable for me. Either the film did not create a ""strange"" enough environment for me not to think about it or it totally failed at dialogues. The use of music is something special. I think it's a smart choice, but definitely not enough to hold the whole film. I'm curious about the short film though.",Shiva Baby
94,xAriisa,Extremely annoying,1,4 May 2021,"This is the worst movie i've ever seen. The sounds, music and constant chatting drove me mad. It was exhausting to the point that it gave me a headache.",Shiva Baby

96,layshah-91397,Shiva Baby,8,17 June 2021,"Some things are very strange! For example, the shape of rocks on the mountains, the colour of the skies or human behaviour all around the World. There are so many proven reasons which say that we are very different from each other from our fingerprints to our DNAs. But some of the behaviour patterns, some characteristic is same no matter where are you from?Shiva baby is nothing but the family get together and like all get-togethers happen on earth even in this one old people are asking young ones What are your career choices, What are you studying, When are you getting married, Do you have a boyfriend and put them in a very awkward situation!Hey, meet this guy he is in some random business related to media ask him to get a job! Go and talk to aunty! Go and help this Uncle!I think the reason behind the family get-togethers is to torture the next generation only!These all happen with Danielle when she attends a Jewish funeral service 'Shiva' with her parents but unknown to her, her secrets were just one by unfolding in front of her. The sugar daddy and not going to law school or something with babysitting and who bought that very costly bracelet! That 1h 17min is breathtaking for her and all the watchers who are watching her handling that situation!This is one of the excellent situation comedy I have seen in many years. Where the way the camera moves in place makes you puzzled! You would ask yourself how on earth the crew choreographed the whole thing and the editor cut it in a way that actually looks like there is no cut between them. The close-ups are remarkable!",Shiva Baby
97,kirstyljones,Disappointing film that went on a bit too long,2,13 June 2021,"Wasn't your typical comedy, was expecting great things after such great reviews. First 20 mins was good then just a drawn out story that had no substance.",Shiva Baby
