0,MartinHafer,A simple plot and a lot of silliness.,7,23 September 2021,"The plot to ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is pretty simple. Two very strange rich guys, Big Enos and Little Enos, offer Bandit (Burt Reynolds) a veritable fortune to transport a semi filled with Coors beer from Texarkana, Texas to Georgia because you apparently couldn't find the beer in Georgia at that time. But they'll be transporting the beer without paying the liquor taxes and if Bandit and his friend, Cledus (Jerry Reed) are caught, they could be in big trouble. So, Bandit's job is to draw the local cops' attention by driving even faster and crazier than Cledus in his rig. Along the way, Bandit picks up a lady running away from a wedding (Sally Field)....and in pursuit is the groom and his mentally imbalanced Sheriff father (Jackie Gleason).This is a film I'd place in the category of 'turn off your brain and just enjoy it'. This is NOT meant as an insult. It's the sort of silly, undemanding film you might enjoy as a change of pace and I strongly doubt if we'll be seeing it on the Criterion Channel any time in the near future! There are some things about the film that don't make much sense (such as a sheriff chasing them from Texas to Georgia and destroying a LOT in the process)...again, just turn off your brain and enjoy it for what it is...silly fun.By the way, during the movie they say that the drive from Texarkana, Texas to Atlanta, Georgia is 900 miles. Well, it's actually about 700.",Smokey and the Bandit
1,Leofwine_draca,Hardly high art,6,23 May 2021,"SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT is the classic good ol' boy car chase adventure flick, helping to typecast Burt Reynolds in the genre but also giving stunt driver Hal Needham a chance to show off his skills as director. The whole film feels based on a single car chase in LIVE AND LET DIE, and such it's very slight and superficial, enlivened by fun photography and earnest performances from both Sally Field as the love interest and a scene-stealing Jackie Gleason as the obsessed sheriff. Hardly high art, but it entertains.",Smokey and the Bandit
2,SnoopyStyle,good ole fun,7,14 September 2013,"Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus (Jerry Reed) are southern truck drivers who accept a $80k dare from Big and Little Enos to pick up a truckload of Coors beer from Texas and return it to them in 28 hours. The trick is going east of Texas is considered bootlegging. On the way back, Bandit picks up runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field) in full wedding dress. Her groom Junior, and his father Sheriff Buford T. Justice is in hot pursuit.This is a cultural icon and Burt Reynolds at the his height of popularity. The three leads have a nice chemistry. They have some fun in this movie and it translates onto the screen. That's all that matters for me.",Smokey and the Bandit
3,gavin6942,Everything I Dreamed It Would Be and More,8,17 December 2005,"""Don't you know transporting Coors east of Texas is bootlegging?"" I think of all the movies I've been forced to watch, this one was the film I most wanted to see. And now I have, bless my lucky stars. I love this movie. I love Burt Reynolds. I love Jerry Reed. If I can find this film on DVD, it will enter my personal collection. ""What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law."" The Bandit (Reynolds) and The Snowman must bring 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana, Texas across state lines in 24 hours - illegal transport while driving much too fast. And picking up runaway brides in a sweet car... that's so Reynolds! Do you know how bad I want to watch ""Convoy"" after this? Maybe next week. Is this a good review? Of course it's not, but you're reading it anyway. All you need to know is you need to watch this movie. Refusing to do so would be a serious error and your life will never be complete. Oh, did I mention the sheriff is the father of the groom who lost his bride? Do you think Burt can handle it? (Yeah, yeah he can.) This makes ""Cannonball Run"" seem even more Reynolds appropriate, he is perfect for driving too fast and kidnapping women who were hot in the 1970s. ""Sheriff... do the letters F.O mean anything to you?"" Needless to say, highest possible recommendation. And I apologize to the kittens who will die because of Sally Field.",Smokey and the Bandit
4,lee_eisenberg,Drive forever!,10,11 February 2017,"Hal Needham's ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is one of those movies that's all about having fun. And boy is there some fun to be had here! Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed get to trash the rules as truckers transporting beer from Texas to Georgia while pursued by a sheriff. I actually thought that Sally Field's runaway bride was the most interesting character in the movie. Her high-brow preferences contrast perfectly with the truckers' rough demeanor. But like I said, the movie is all about having fun. High-speed chases with countless cars wrecked and the law enforcement officers constantly humiliated. Admittedly, it's hard to admire Jackie Gleason, knowing what we now know about him,* but the character is a riot. I suspect that they had a lot of fun making the movie.In conclusion, a lovely romp. By all means, do what they say can't get done.Yeah, Stephen Sondheim did revolutionize theater. Anyone who's seen ""Into the Woods"" will have to agree.*In the book ""Riders on the Storm"", John Densmore revealed that when Jim Morrison got prosecuted for indecency, Jackie Gleason testified against him and lied about what happened.",Smokey and the Bandit
5,jboothmillard,Smokey and the Bandit,8,28 February 2006,"This film was a big hit when it was released in the 1970s, it has been on television so many times also, so its popularity as one of the greatest road and chase movies has never waned. Basically wealthy and flamboyant Texan ""Big Enos"" Burdette (Pat McCormick) and his son Little Enos (Paul Williams) need a vast quantity of beer for a rally, but Coors the beer brand they want is not legal to transport across Mississippi, at least one shipment attempt has been intercepted by police. So to get the job done they recruit modern day moonshiner, with many previous successful exploits, legendary trucker Bo ""Bandit"" Darville (Burt Reynolds), he will be paid a handsome $80,000. The Bandit will be driving in his black Pontiac Trans Am Firebird, the ""blocker"", to distract the snooping state police, while his pal Cledus ""Snowman"" Snow (Jerry Reed) in his eighteen-wheeler truck will be hauling the 400 cases of beer from Texarkana, Texas back to Atlanta, within 28 hours, both maintaining contact, using seemingly bizarre lingo, via CB radio. The trip to Texas and the loading of beers goes without interruption, but heading back to Georgia there is a complication when the Bandit is stopped by and picks up runaway bride Carrie (Golden Globe nominated Sally Field), fleeing the forced marriage to the dimwitted son, Junior (Mike Henry), of full-of- himself Texas county sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). Sheriff Justice is in hot pursuit of his to-be daughter-in-law, but he soon also becomes aware of the illegal beer transportation and is determined to catch the Bandit, the situation soon becomes an interstate high- speed pursuit with police from four states joining the chase, but the Bandit has the intervention of varied interstate truckers aiding him and Cledus. Also starring Alfie Wise as Patrolman - Traffic Jam, George Reynolds as Sheriff Branford, Macon McCalman as Mr. B and Linda McClure as Waynette Snow. Reynolds became a big movie star thanks to his performance as the inimitable wise-cracking beer trucking ""Bandit"", Fields is beautiful and vivacious as his companion, they have a great chemistry together, Gleason gets many laughs as the easily frustrated ""Smokey"" sheriff, and Reed as the truck driving pal of the title character is good fun. The film is charming road adventure as the Bandit and his fellow drivers deliver the crates of Coors across the country, with the police doing whatever it takes to stop them, there is plenty of witty dialogue interactions and over-radio banter, fast paced car and truck chases, and a few stunts along the way also, it is a very funny and always enjoyably fun road movie comedy. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Film Editing. Burt Reynolds was number 97 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Smokey and the Bandit
6,Woodyanders,Supremely easy'n'breezy 70's car chase blast,8,10 September 2012,"Sly good ol' boy the Bandit (Burt Reynolds in peak amiable form) gets hired to haul 400 cases of beer from Texarkana to Atlanta in a mere 28 hours. Wily redneck trucker Cletus (a wonderfully spirited portrayal by Jerry Reed) helps the Bandit out while sweet runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field at her most adorable) tags along for the ride. Meanwhile, relentless and obsessive ramrod hick Sheriff Buford T. Justice (broadly played with lip-smacking brio by Jackie Gleason) gives hot pursuit. Director Hal Needham, working from a simple script by James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer, and Alan Mandel, relates the entertainingly straightforward story at a constant swift pace, maintains an engaging good-natured tone throughout (although a lot of cars get wrecked, nobody ever gets seriously hurt), and milks the pleasantly irreverent humor for plenty of enormous belly laughs. Moreover, it's acted with real zest by an enthusiastic cast: Reynolds and Field display a strong and utterly charming natural chemistry, Gleason has a ball ad-libbing almost all of his hilariously profane dialogue, plus there are sound supporting contributions from Mike Henry as Justice's dim-witted son Junior, Pat McCormick as hearty blow-hard Big Enos, and Paul Williams as the sarcastic Little Enos. Bobby Byrne's sunny cinematography provides an attractive bright look. Further galvanized by a jaunty down-home score by Bill Justis, a first-rate rousing country soundtrack, and loads of well executed vehicular carnage, this affably unpretentious escapist fare sizes up as one immensely enjoyable romp.",Smokey and the Bandit
7,ccthemovieman-1,A Perfect Fit For The '70s,6,12 August 2006,"Like a lot of the comedies of the '70s, this is funny, irreverent, profane and fun for its day but a little stupid now that I am older and, hopefully, a little more mature. When we were young in this period, Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and the rest was about as entertaining as it got for comedy-romance-adventure.Jerry Reed also added to the likability of this film, not only with his sidekick role but his catchy movie title song that I can still hum to this day.My only complaint here is my pet peeve: the usage of the Lord's name in vain which shouldn't be that prevalent in a comedy. Here it's abused more than a dozen times, mostly by Jackie Gleason. This is ""Ralph Kramden"" gone into the sewer with GDs coming out of his mouth left and right and a ridiculous insulting stereotype (Liberals love this) of southern cops. Gleason isn't funny; he's disgusting.Otherwise, the film was low-brow funny and big, big hit.",Smokey and the Bandit
8,Tweekums,A '70s classic,8,6 August 2019,"This film is centred on Bo Darville; known to one and all as 'Bandit', his CB handle. He has accepted a job that requires him to drive from Atlanta, Georgia to Texarkana, Texas and return with four hundred cases of Coors beer in exchange for $80,000. The drive itself will be hard enough but taking Coors east of Texas is considered bootlegging so he will have to avoid the law. He will drive a Trans-Am while his friend Cledus, known as Snowman, will drive the truck loaded with beer. Shortly after they start the return journey, Bandit pick up Carrie, a young woman in a wedding dress who has decided not to get married! This proves to be a problem as her intended father in law is Sheriff Buford T. Justice and he is willing to chase them across state lines to get her back.I remembered enjoying this when it was on television back in the eighties so thought I'd watch it again when I spotted it on DVD... I was pleased to find it still feels fresh and provides lots of laughs without anything really offensive. The story isn't exactly deep; it is just a good excuse for a prolonged chase; lots of stunts and some witty dialogue... and that is just fine! Burt Reynolds is on top form as The Bandit and Sally Field is a lot of fun, and very cute, as Carrie... these two have a great chemistry. Jackie Gleason also impresses as Sheriff Justice and Jerry Reed is solid as Snowman. The film contains many impressive stunts; including car jumps and numerous crashes. Overall I'd say this is good clean fun that can be enjoyed by anybody who wants a good laugh and plentiful car based action.",Smokey and the Bandit
9,moonspinner55,Ramshackle road comedy with some amusing detail...,7,31 December 2007,"Director Hal Needham hit paydirt with this box-office winner from 1977, featuring super laid-back Southern hipster and ladies' man Burt Reynolds as the Bandit, being coaxed from dozing in his hammock for a little illegal transport on the road. Reynolds doesn't have to give a performance here, he only needs to show up looking bemused; the audience was immediately on his side no matter what the plot device, yet the film is far less ambitious than many of Reynolds' previous hick comedies (perhaps that worked in its favor?). When chatty Sally Field hitches a ride (she's a runaway bride whose ex-intended is the son of sheriff Jackie Gleason), the dialogue noticeably perks up with some prickly spirit (the screenplay, written by Needham, Robert L. Levy, James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer and Alan Mandel, has obviously been worked over carefully to give the conversations some amusing give-and-take). The laughs are strictly low-brow, but the friendly country music and the sassy interplay between Reynolds and Field (and Jerry Reed as the most congenial of redneck buddies) is undeniably entertaining. Followed by a slow onslaught of variable sequels. *** from ****",Smokey and the Bandit
10,paul_haakonsen,Timeless movie...,6,9 January 2016,"I remember this movie fondly from my childhood, and must say that it was actually every bit as entertaining as I remembered it to be. And despite being from 1977, it actually holds up its own quite well even in 2016.This is definitely a typical Burt Reynolds movie, with his usual charm and spot on acting talent. And there was a great chemistry between Burt Reynolds and Sally Field.The storyline in ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is quite simple, but entertaining. The Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and The Snowman (Jerry Reed) have to drive a shipment of beers from Taxarkana to Atlanta in 48 hours. But the road is long, hard and many highway patrolmen want to stop the notorious Bandit; none more than Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason).""Smokey and the Bandit"" is an entertaining movie that can be watched by everyone in the family no matter how old or young. Cars, humor, good cast, comedy, what's not to like?",Smokey and the Bandit
11,tavm,I just rewatched Smokey and the Bandit in memory of the late Burt Reynolds,8,8 September 2018,"Growing up, I remember first watching the last 30 minutes of this movie on ABC during the '80s when Jackie Gleason said ""sumbum"" instead of that other word. I later watched it on HBO where I heard all the uncensored words. After Burt Reynolds died yesterday, I suddenly looked online for all his movies and because I knew this was perhaps his most popular, I had to watch this again! Verdict: It's more hilarious than ever! Especially whenever Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice appears! And seeing him and Reynolds in a scene at a restaurant was priceless! Oh, and this was also the first time Burt and Sally Field were paired on film and in real life. My God, they were quite a pair at the time, weren't they! And then there's Jerry Reed who not only helps The Bandit and Frog along the way but also provides the songs in the movie especially the classic ""East Bound and Down"" which is such an iconic theme for not only this movie but also Burt Reynolds' life. Oh, and director Hal Needham keeps the action going throughout, that's for sure! So that's a high recommendation of Smokey and the Bandit for anyone curious about what the appeal of Burt Reynolds was...Update: 9/12/18-Just watched this again with my movie theatre-working friend at his AMC place with a pretty good crowd though I only heard me and my friend laughing...",Smokey and the Bandit
12,BandSAboutMovies,Big fun,7,29 July 2019,"Director Hal Needham was going to make a low budget movie with a million dollar budget and Jerry Reed as the Bandit, but his friend Burt Reynolds looked over his first draft of the script, scribbled on yellow legal pads, and declared it one of the worst he'd ever read. Yet there was something there and he wanted to be the star, with Reed moving to the role of sidekick Snowman.Buford T. Justice, played by Jackie Gleason,, was the name of a real Florida Highway Patrolman who was friends with Reynolds' father and who was once Police Chief of Riviera Beach, Florida. Reynold's dad also inspired the frequent usage of the phrase sumbitch, but Gleason was also given carte blanche to pretty much do whatever he wanted.The results? A $300 million worldwide gross on a $4.3 million dollar budget, putting it in second place for all movies made in 1977. Yep, this little movie, made by someone that Hollywood only saw as a stuntman, was only beat by Star Wars.Wealthy Texans Big Enos Burdette and his son Little Enos (comedian Pat McCormick and renaissance man Paul Williams) have bet every trucker around that they can't get him Coors beer in 28 hours. Even the best have been busted. Yep, it might seem strange today, but there was a time when Coors was forbidden fruit and unavailable for sale east of Oklahoma.The type of beer in this movie - Coors Banquet Beer - was often sought it out because of its lack of stabilizers and preservatives. That also explains the 28-hour deadline the Burdettes place upon it. All manner of famous people bootlegged Coors, accoriding to a 1974 article in Time magaine: Vice President Gerald Ford hid it in his luggage, President Dwight D. Eisenhower would have it airlifted via Air Force One and baseball great Carl Yastrzemski would stash it in his team's equipment trunks. Often, it was sold in the south for four times its original value.Big Enos has sponsored a racer and wants to celebrate in style when he wins, so they hired legend Bo ""Bandit"" Darville (Reynolds) and make him a deal: $80,000 to pick up 400 cases of Coors from the closest legal place they can buy it - Texarkana, home of the Phantom Killer - and bring it back to Atlanta. That adds up to $8.33 a can, which if we adjust for inflation, is $35.20 a can. Obviously, people really loved Coors back n 1977.Needham was inspired by Coors when he worked on Reynolds' Gator. The driver captain on the set brought some Coors beer from California and stored them in Needham's room. The maid kept stealing them and he thought that bootleg running coors would make a great movie.The Burdette boys also buy Bandit a black Pontiac Trans Am to use as a blocker to divert attention from his tractor trailer, which will be driven by his friend Snowman (Reed). Needham had seen an ad for the 1977 Pontiac Trans Am and knew right away that it would be another character in the movie. That's right - not just a vehicle, but a character.Pontiac sent four of the 1976 model cars with the changed 1977 front ends and nearly all of them were destroyed by the end of filming. The epic bridge leap scene had an Evel Knievel-style rocket booster installed and Needham himself pulled off that stunt.Burt Reynolds even claimed that a Pontiac senior executive bet him a free Trans-Am if the movie was a success. It was and the 1977 T-Top Trans-Am became the hottest car around. Yet Burt never got his car. He didn't want to be a Hollywood phony begging for a handout, but one day, he called Pontiac and learned that the executive had retire and his replacement refused to honor the bet.After getting to Texarkana an hour early, the way back gets rough. Bandit meets a runaway bride named Carrie (Sally Field, who producers did not think was attractive enough to be in the film; Reynolds disagreed and they began dating). This makes Bandit the target of Sheriff Justice (Gleason), whose son Junior (former NFL player and Tarzan actor Mike Henry).Hijinks ensure, with police cars, motorcyles and helicopters chasing the Bandit and Snowman as they race the clock. Despite the help of everyone within the reach of a CB, Bandit is ready to give up when Snowman passes him and smashes through a police roadblock, allowing the boys to make it with ten minutes to spare. That said, they decide to go double or nothing with teh dare of bringing back Bostin chowder in 18 hours.Before they leave, Bandit reveals himself to Justice and allows him to chase him again in a show of respect, However, his car has been absolutely destroyed. Don't worry - the chase would continue through two sequels that we'll definitely be covering. And people still love this movie, four two years later, even celebrating it with an annual race, The Bandit Run.There were also four TV movies - Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit's Silver Angel - that ran on Universal TV with Brian Bloom playing Bandit in his younger days. Plus, the popularity of this film helped The Dukes of Hazzard on TV. Several of its stars appear here - ""Cooter"" Ben Jones, John Schneider and Sonny Shroyer (who played a police officer here and Enos on Dukes). Reynolds would later play Boss Hogg in the 2005 movie version.I really can't explain what a big deal this movie was or how many times my grandfather delighted to it. It rivals only The Car for the most watched movie of my childhood. Rewatching it, it hasn't lost any of its energy and fun.",Smokey and the Bandit
13,Coventry,The Boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer down in Texarkana!,7,7 February 2010,"I've never been much of a fan of Burt Reynolds fan, but he happens to star in many 70's and early 80's movies that are right up my alley. We're talking about movies with charismatic macho man protagonists, fast cars, trucks so large they seem to be overcompensating for something else, infantile comedy and flamboyant action stunts. Movies like ""White Lightning"", ""Hooper"", The Cannonball Run"", ""Sharky's Machine"", ""Gator"" and of course the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" trilogy and I can't help the fact they all star Burt Reynolds. ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is basically a very simplistic story and approximately three quarters of the film seems improvised at the spot, but a premise like this just can't fail. Two Texan big shots hire the notorious trucker Bandit to illegally transport a lorry of Coors Beer from Texarkana to Georgia in barely 28 hours. Bandit develops a nifty plan where his buddy Snowman drives the beer truck and he drives a Trans-Am in front to divert the attention of the coppers. During the wild and time-pressured ride, Bandit picks up the hyperactive runaway bride Carrie and becomes involved in a testosterone showdown with the fearsome Texan Sheriff Buford T. Justice. You easily forgive ""Smokey and the Bandit"" for its lack of originality and ideas, simply because everyone involved in the film seems to be so very enthusiast and cheerful. Former stuntman Hal Needham delivers a fast- paced script and taut direction (his other film ""MegaForce"", on the other hand is a terribly boring turkey) whilst all his cast members are having the time of their lives. Jerry Reed is excellent as the lesser cool sidekick Snowman and he also provides the film with a sublimely irresistible hillbilly soundtrack, including the fantastically catchy songs ""East Bound and Down"" and ""The Legend"". Sally Field and Burt Reynolds definitely have on-screen chemistry, but the show is undeniably stolen by Jackie Gleason as the persistent and downright obsessive Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Heck, even his character's name alone is awesome to write and pronounce repeatedly! He has the best lines, allegedly a large part of them were ad-libbed, like when he says to his slow and unintelligent son: ""the first thing I'm going to do when we get home, is punch your mother in the face"" (referring that the son can't possibly have inherited his stupidity from him).",Smokey and the Bandit

15,hitchcockthelegend,Pedal to the metal in this ripper of a good time.,9,11 September 2011,"Smokey and the Bandit is directed by Hal Needham and the screenplay is collectively written by James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer and Alan Mandel; from a story by Needham and Robert L. Levy. It stars Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed and Mike Henry. Music is by Bill Justis and Jerry Reed and cinematography by Bobby Byrne.He does what he does best-shows off.Bo ""Bandit"" Darville (Reynolds) accepts a, illegal job/bet offer of delivering a truck load of Coors Beer from Texas across the states to Georgia. The job must be completed within 28 hours or he will not pick up the $80,000 payment for his services. Enlisting his buddy Snowman (Reed) to drive the truck, while he acts as a decoy in his Pontiac Trans Am, the Bandit must avoid capture by the Smokey (police). When he stops to pick up runaway bride Carrie (Fields), this makes him the target for one particularly vindictive laws enforcer, Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Gleason), whose son Junior Justice (Henry) is the jilted intended of Carrie.You sumbitches couldn't close an umbrella!The best of the ""CB Radio"" movies, Smokey and the Bandit makes up for what little it has in plot, with unadulterated fun via car pursuits, stunts and wonderfully colourful characters. Essentially one long chase movie, it was a massive box office success on it release, becoming the second biggest earner in 77 behind a certain Space Opera from George Lucas. Cashing in on Burt Reynolds popularity, and the new found interest in CB radio on the highways, film went on to influence similar films and TV shows further down the line. The memory of the poor sequels and the inferior similar films of its type has somewhat led to many people forgetting just what an entertaining movie it is.There is no way, no way, that you could come from my loins. Soon as I get home, first thing I'm gonna do is punch your momma in the mouth.Hal Needham uses his knowledge as an ex-stuntman to great effect, setting up a number of inspired sequences that sees cars jumping, crashing or going for a swim! Wisely letting his actors ad-lib where possible, film has a natural flow that's hard to dislike. The chemistry between Reynolds and Fields is warming, due to the fact that it was off screen real, while Gleason steals the movie with a hilarious portray as the manic, cussing and determined Buford. The bumpkin based music is perfectly in keeping with the mood, and the various locations used make for an appealing backdrop to the carnage and speedster thrills.Not quite as Punk Rock anti-establishment now as it seemed back then, but still utterly delightful courtesy of a damn fine cast and some special motor vehicle mayhem. 8.5/10",Smokey and the Bandit
16,Scarecrow-88,Smokey and the Bandit,10,18 June 2011,"I guess when you mention a top ten regarding movies featuring car crashes and high speed cross-country pursuits between a ""bandit"" and the law, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is in the upper echelon, if not right at the front. A great deal of the movie's charm derives from Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jerry Reed, and Jackie Gleeson, a hell of a cast for what is actually a ""Southern Hick comedy"". The plot is simple, Burt Reynolds is a well recognized bandit with the ability to keep the police from commandeering a truck hauling certain illegal merchandise across state lines. His reputation catches the ear of Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams), with matching suits and plenty of cold, hard cash to pay for such a venture as they are proposing to the Bandit: the proposal, to successfully pick up and haul Coors beer across the country from Texarkana to Georgia in a certain time to score $80,000. So Bandit drags (literally) truck driving partner, Cledus (Jerry Reed, who shares scene-stealing duties with Gleason) out of bed, with the two heading on the road—Bandit, in a sweet Pontiac Trans am, Cledus driving the truck which will haul the Coors (illegal in certain states for which Bandit and Cletus will be crossing into, essentially recognized as bootlegging). Bandit picks up a runaway bride (Sally Field), once a chorus girl (!), fleeing from a dunderhead, Junior (Mike Henry) and his fiery, ill-tempered father, Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleeson), dogged in his pursuit to catch the girl who got away. Meanwhile, Bandit has to keep the ""smokies"" from pulling over Cledus' truck, not to mention, avoiding Justice, dogged and determined to catch him. The film is basically a drive-in treasure, full of police cars crashing into lakes and each other (the highlight as to be when one cop car lands in the back of a truck), and the Bandit masterfully evading an army of law enforcement through his incredible driving skills (and a little luck). Plenty of eye-opening stunts, including an epic bridge jumping by the Trans am. Reynolds' charisma is on full display, Field is a cutie who becomes his romantic interest as the two bond while trying to keep the law at bay, Gleason has an onslaught of comedy zingers (""What we got here is a complete lack of respect for the law.""), and Jerry Reed as the jovial truck driver with a pet basset hound. For a PG-rated film, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is loaded with profanity, particularly when Buford T Justice gets annoyed at his idiot son or cannot apprehend the Bandit. You can really see how much Reynolds and Field were in love during their scenes together; their chemistry is perfect. For a Mississippi hick like me, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is the gold standard of Southern car chase movies. The movie has a laid-back charm, with the kind of cast who provoke smiles from the audience because of the breezy nature of the silly material.",Smokey and the Bandit
17,poolandrews,"""It's a Kojak with a Kodak."" Silly comedy adventure, a product of it's time.",5,21 February 2010,"Smokey and the Bandit starts in Georgia where Big Enos (Pat McCormick) & Little Enos (Paul Williams) who wear blue cowboy suits that would spell social suicide these days hire a washed up trucker named the Bandit (Burt Reynolds) for $80,000 to drive to Texas & collect 400 cases of Coors beer & back again in 28 hours or less because they want want a load of it, however because of strict Coors company rules transporting large quantities of it across state lines is considered bootlegging & therefore illegal. The Bandit ropes in his mate the Snowman (Jerry Reed) to help, Bandit gets to drive a nice fast Pontiac Trans-Am to keep any local police busy while Snowman drives the truck of Coors. Unfortunately for them the police from the various states they go through all pose problems & Texas state Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) pursues them constantly across the country...Directed by Hal Needham this was amazingly the second highest grossing film of 1977 (despite an opening weekend of well less than two million dollars) after a little known film called Star Wars, I suppose Somey and the Bandit is the sort of nostalgic film that many remember seeing at the time & having fond memories but revisiting again over thirty years later after not having watched it in a while I can't say i was that impressed by it overall. The idea that you need to illegally transport beer across state lines has no relevance today & generally speaking the film is of it's time with old fashioned cars, silly stunts & a certain childishness about it. To my eye not that much really happens, it felt like scene after scene of cars just driving along with the occasional stunt thrown in which are far from spectacular. The character's are simple & the whole thing is rather predictable & plays out trying to appeal to the crows as the likable rogue of a hero the Bandit keeps getting the better of the silly police who always end up looking dumb while there's the expected romantic angle & the whole thing between the Bandit & Justice seems to be down to a personal grudge rather than the bootlegging which the police never find out. At 90 odd minutes it felt quite long too, I just thought not that much happened really & the whole stupid police against flawless hero angle was predictable & tired. The other thing that stands out is just how unfunny it is, there's plenty of supposed comedy here but I found it really dumb & it just missed the mark by a long way, the comedic antics of Sheriff Justice & his son in particular were very tiresome by the time the end credits ran.Apparently Smokey and the Bandit made a star out of the Pontiac Trans-Am & sales of the car almost doubled within a couple of years after it's release. The biggest disappointment with Smokey and the Bandit were the decidedly average action set-pieces, there's the bridge jump, a few crashing police cars & the big truck at the smashes a couple too but not much else apart from scenes of cars screeching down various roads. I just expected a little bit more & something a bit more memorable. Apparently the recent releases with a 5.1 soundtrack replace all the original sound effects which I would imagine will infuriate the purists out there while the TV versions were dubbed to replace the bad language (not so bad these days though) & is apparently pretty funny as the dubbing is very poor.Filmed largely in Georgia the film looks alright, it's bright & well shot I suppose. Burt Reynolds gives little personality to the Bandit & some might find his dress sense of tight jeans & a cowboy hat distracting on it's own, Sally Field went on to date Reynolds in real life for years & looks good I suppose while Jackie Gleason is just to over the top for me.Smokey and the Bandit is a film which I can remember enjoying at one point all those years ago but having watched it again I was less than impressed, it passes the time & moves along at a decent pace but overall I didn't think it was any better than average. Followed by two sequels Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) & Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983) as well as four made for TV films in 1994.",Smokey and the Bandit
18,utgard14,Just Plain Fun,7,6 November 2013,"What a great movie. No pretensions other than being a good fun car chase movie. Burt Reynolds is at his peak, amiable and overflowing with charm. Sally Field is as cute as a button and sexy in her way. Jackie Gleason is hilarious and has many of the movie's best lines. Jerry Reed, however, almost steals the show as the affable Snowman. I say almost because it's impossible to wrest this movie away from Burt Reynolds' grip. Whenever the Bandit is on screen the movie belongs to him and when he's not on screen you're anxious for him to show up. If you're the kind of person who can enjoy a simple fun action-comedy like this then please check it out. It's a classic of its kind.",Smokey and the Bandit

The Bandit left a trail of wrecked police vehicles in his wake as he scorched across the South in a black Trans-Am with a runaway bride. If the brain power and the competence of every officer featured was added up and squared they'd still fall short of being an idiot. In a silly plot where a butt hurt racist Texas sheriff chases after the Bandit and his son's runaway bride all across the South, I now know the impetus of Dukes of Hazard.

20,AlsExGal,A great road movie and a great product of its time,8,27 December 2018,"The plot is silly, and the audience gets that from the start as ridiculously dressed tycoon ""Big Enos"" hires ""The Bandit"" (Burt Reynolds) to bring back a truckload of Coors beer to Georgia, which was illegal to ship anywhere but regionally at that time. The Bandit enlists his trucker friend Cledus (Jerry Reed) to help him on the endeavor. The trip to Texarkana to get the beer is easy enough. But the trip back is quite harrowing and hilarious. It starts when a runaway bride (Sally Field as Carrie) stops Bandit in the middle of the road in need of a ride. What Bandit does not know is that Carrie walked out on her wedding to the department store mannequin like son (honestly, Cledus' Bassett hound Fred has more personality) of Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). So Bandit thinks he is being pursued across country because of his speeding and reckless driving, maybe because of the beer, but never does it occur to him the sheriff is after his new passenger.This is just a delightful road picture made authentic looking with tons of anonymous extras playing truckers, ladies of the evening, workers and customers at roadside diners, and teens just looking to do some mischief while listening in on their CB radios. There are also some great songs and Jerry Reed's musical talents are not wasted. About the CB radios - they were a fad in the mid 70s made that way by a 1975 hit entitled ""Convoy"", and they were the only way to communicate to other drivers on the road in the 1970s. There would not be an internet in common use for another 20 years and cell phones would not be ubiquitous for another 30.So be prepared to be transported back to a simpler time when there were not tiny cameras tied to cell phones everywhere, air bags did not exist, gas mileage was not an issue, and the era of ""zero tolerance"" had not occurred yet. Oh, and the role of profane but persistent Buford T. Justice started a bit of a film acting renaissance for Jackie Gleason, who had always had a presence on TV but had been absent from the big screen awhile.",Smokey and the Bandit

Quite intrigued, a man with the CB handle of ""Bandit"" (Burt Reynolds) convinces his friend ""Snowman"" (Jerry Reed) to take the wager. That being said, although they manage to get the beer in Texarkana, upon beginning the drive back Bandit--who is running interference in a Trans Am for Snowman's semi-truck--picks up a female hitchhiker named ""Carrie"" (Sally Field) who is wearing a wedding dress and wants to get as far away from Texarkana as fast as she can. What Bandit doesn't know is that she is trying to escape from a Texas sheriff named ""Buford T. Justice"" (Jackie Gleason) who has just spent a great amount of time and money on a wedding for his son and is determined to get her back at all costs. And if that means pursuing him all the way to Georgia then that is exactly what this ""Smokey"" will do. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie was extremely influential in kicking off a new American craze involving CB radios and films based on highway truck drivers. Although a couple of these movies were good, many have since faded into obscurity. Fortunately, this particular film has endured the ravages of time and in my opinion is perhaps the best of the bunch. Above average.",Smokey and the Bandit

Along the way, he picks up a runaway bride(Sally Field), who was engaged to the dumb son of Sheriff Buford T.

23,Aaron1375,"A bit to much Bandit, needed more Smokey.",7,16 August 2010,"This film was a bit better than ""The Cannonball Run"", but it is certainly in the same vein. Better in the fact it had more of a plot, though really not by to much. The thing that probably makes it stand out more than Cannonball is the Character of Justice played by the late Jackie Gleason who during the time of this movie was more of a television type star rather than a movie star and Mike Henry as Justice's son, Junior. These two characters were very funny, providing the biggest laughs in the film. Also funny in this one is Big and Little Enos, especially Paul Williams as Little. His exchanges with the Bandit are just great. They would be featured more in the second film which was good, but I hear they were overused in the third installment, however I have never seen that particular film. This one has Big and Little Enos needed The Snowman and the Bandit to get some beer across some state borders cause they are really thirsty. The Snowman drives a rig and is transporting said beer while the Bandit drives a Trans Am to try to get the police to focus on him rather than the speeding trucker. Well a woman is getting married, and has second thoughts thus flees the wedding of Junior whose father is a sheriff thus the feud between he and the Bandit begins. Lots of stunt driving and jokes involving the destruction of the sheriff's car ensue. So do the laughs for the most part and unlike part two we do not have to worry about Bandit blowing the bet because he has feelings for an elephant.",Smokey and the Bandit
24,Wuchakk,The quintessential good ol' boy flick?,6,30 June 2015,"In 1977's ""Smokey and the Bandit"" Burt Reynolds stars with Jerry Reed as Bandit and Cledus, two Southern truckers who take a gig hauling illegal beer from Texas to Georgia. Sally Field co-stars as Carrie, aka ""Frog,"" a hitchhiker whom Bandit picks up in his Firebird. She's a literal runaway bride and the father of the groom, Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), isn't going to let her or Bandit get away. Mike Henry, Paul Williams and Pat McCormick are also on hand.This is fun good 'ol boy movie with Burt and Sally in their prime. Reynolds is at his smiling, wisecracking best and Field is a cutie who looks great in tight pants. It's not great like Eastwood's ""Every Which Way But Loose"" (1978), but it's energetic and amusing. Anyone who likes car chases, Southern accents, trucks, CB radios, redneck cops and motorhead antics will enjoy this movie. Besides the presence of Reynolds and Field, I mainly like it because it's like going back in time to the late 70s.The female eye-candy is pretty much limited to Field, although Susie Ewing has a nice cameo as Hot Pants.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot mostly in Georgia, but with some driving locations in California (you can always tell the difference).GRADE: B-",Smokey and the Bandit
25,trashgang,classic all the way,9,15 October 2013,"I first saw this flick as a ten year old boy just when it came out and man,it changed my life for good. I was a big fan of trucks and this flick opened my eyes as did Convoy (1978). This is an instant cult classic with perfect casting and pure entertainment and so typical for the time, laughing it out loud with the stupidity of the cops. It was also my first meeting with Burt Reynolds (the Bandit) one I came across later when as a teenager I moved into horror with Deliverance (1972).But back to Smokey. Seeing it nowadays it do has a few things that were cool back then but can't be done now, the racism. When the sheriff Buford T Justice comes across another sheriff and sees that the man is black he make a statement so typical for the south but one that can't be said nowadays. But further on this is pure fun. One shot also a not done in cinema is when the bandit get rid of a police car he stops in front of the camera to have a look straight into the lens. And don't go into the story because that's written in 1 minute but the acting especially from Jackie Gleason as the sheriff is hilarious. Excellent. The soundtrack was sung by Jerry Reed who plays Cledus. Classic all the way and a flick who spawned the anti-cop genre with the Smokey franchise and Convoy or Cannonball Run (1981) but also the series The Dukes Of Hazard. The only thing that drops a bit is the love story around an hour between the Bandit and Carrie (Sally Field). Sally and Burt dated each other in real life but never got married. A must have in every collection. Made just towards the end of the exploitation genre and just before horror became the next big thing.

Oh sure, the movie might bill Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason first, but that hot rod is the real star of this thing; jumping bridges, sailing into football fields and tearing asphalt across the South. GM couldn't ask for a better commercial.Which isn't to say the sweet ride is the movie's only lasting quality. No, that's simply the icing on the cake. This stands the test of time primarily for its southern charm and enthusiasm; the kind of movie that you hang in with 'til the end whenever it's on TV (as CMT's ratings can attest).

It is as classic a chase film as ever was made with some trashed police cars littering the landscape. The special flow is achieved much because of the great Jerry Reed soundtrack that goes perfectly with the red-neck themes of this movie.Bert Reynolds fits his role in this like a glove. Sally Field is perfectly cast to. The real heart of this film is Jerry Reed. It is his soundtrack songs and character that really put the flow to this film. Jackie Gleason greatly helps the comedy.

31,OllieSuave-007,A good ol' fashion sheriff vs. bandit wild ride!,7,23 August 2015,"Smokey and the Bandit is an action comedy where a speed demon outlaw named The Bandit (Burt Reynolds) accepts a dare from wealthy big shots Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) to transport a truckload of beer from Texas in a limited time. The Bandit picks up runaway bride Carrie (Sally Ride) along the way, not knowing she was to be married to Junior (Mike Henry), son of Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). What results is a high-speed pursuit of the Bandit by the sheriffs.While there is virtually no basic plot to the movie, Hal Needham's direction really made this movie a wild ride from start to finish with the high-speed pursuit - from The Bandit dodging police cars to Jackie Gleason's hilarious portrayal of Buford T. Justice.It's a good old-fashion sheriff vs. bandit story, with a taste of classic Americana in the outskirts of Texas and, like IMDb user EmperorNortonII mentioned, it also offers the use of CB radio culture. The stunts were incredible and the acting was pretty good, especially that of Gleason, spewing his redneck humor and talking down to his poor, adult son whenever chance he could.Again, it's really a plot less movie, but it offers one wild ride in one of Burt Reynolds' most iconic roles that you will never forget.Grade B",Smokey and the Bandit

It's more or less an hour and a half of a non- stop car chase as a couple of good old boys (Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed) are pursued across four states by a red neck Texas sheriff (Jackie Gleason.) Bandit and Snowman (Reynolds & Reed) are trying to win a ton of money by transporting 400 cases of Coors illegally from Texarkana to Atlanta in no more than 28 hours. Bandit's in a black Trans-Am to throw the police off the trail and Snowman's driving the big rig. Along the way Bandit picks up Carrie (Sally Field) - a bride running away from her wedding to the son of Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Gleason), who sets himself to the task of tracking her down.It's a wild ride. It's fun and enjoyable. The cast is likable and they all work well together and there's absolutely no thought required. You just have to watch as Bandit causes havoc for Justice and among countless local cops encountered along the way. It's the very mindlessness of this movie that's both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. The never-ending chases are wild and fun for a while - but to me, they run out of steam long before the hour and a half run time of the movie. By about half way through it's actually starting to get a bit tiresome just because there's nowhere for this movie to really go; there's no particular plot or story. It's just chase, chase, chase. Interesting orientation to trucker CB lingo though! (5/10)",Smokey and the Bandit

But as I grow older, I see Smokey and the Bandit for what it really is  a nice piece of brainless fun. After all, this isn't rocket science, it's a car chase movie.The movie works for me because it is so ridiculous. The whole idea of a Texas sheriff chasing a Trans Am all the way to Georgia is completely silly.

This road-movie was a monster hit and spawned several sequels and while no-one would claim it to be a great film it is a hell of a lot of fun and it put Burt Reynolds centre-stage with a star-making role as the titular Bandit. It might not have been the kind of part that would win Reynolds an Oscar but he is surprisingly good here, helped by a very decent script from James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer and Alan Mandel.The director was former stuntman Hal Needham who certainly knew his way around these backroads and highways and the terrific supporting cast included Sally (You Really Like Me) Fields, Jackie (Minnesota Fats) Gleason and Country singer Jerry Reed as well as Pat McCormick and Paul Williams.

36,bowmanblue,The best film of 1977 (not including the other one),8,13 February 2015,"1977 was a great year for cinema, largely because it was when 'Star Wars' was released to worldwide acclaim. However, what few people seem to remember is that the 'runner up' at the Box Office was an equally fun (and just as far-fetched as an epic space opera!) little film called 'Smokey and the Bandit.' As with many of the best films, the plot is extremely simple – an outlaw driver, aka 'The Bandit' (played with perfect cool by Burt Reynolds), has to escort a truck filled with contraband across America. However, a certain 'Smokey' (slang for state trooper/lawman) is not going to make it easy for him and vows to catch him at all costs. Smokey and the Bandit is possibly the most perfect example of a 'cat and mouse' chase ever put to film.It's basically a chase movie, filled with high-speed stunts and one car chase after the other. It doesn't always have to be believable to be fun. It just has to entertain. And it does. Obviously it's Burt Reynold's flick and he carries it with charm and uber coolness. You can't help but root for him, while, at the same time, also having just a little soft spot for – technically – the 'baddie.' Perhaps what makes the relationship work is that you can root for both the 'hero' and the 'villain' (the long-suffering police officer who's desperately on Bandit's tail).The film also spawned two sequels and it's worth noting that neither are regarded as highly as the first. To really appreciate the magic of the original, you have to see what they did with the sequels. They're both overblown. The car chases cause too much damage and it's hard to believe that if any 'bandit' caused that much carnage, he wouldn't be on the FBI's 'Most Wanted' list. Also, the jokes get silly in the two sequels. Yes, even in the first film the characters are a little 'cartoonish,' but there's just enough believability in them to make them seem real. In the sequels they're either 'too dumb' or 'too cool.' But, those are problems with the sequels. If you're into car chase films, Burt Reynolds, or generally light-hearted action with plenty of comic moments, you'll do worse than riding along with the Bandit.",Smokey and the Bandit

38,lesleyharris30,Too Straight Forward with a Lack of Adventure,5,1 October 2016,"Smokey and the Bandit is a mediocre movie with a lackluster plot and a decent cast. The main thing that makes it worthwhile is Burt Reynolds, he shines as the Bandit, really embodying the role and delivering all his dialogue with pure confidence and charisma. There is no sense of excitement or adventure to the story. We are never told how much time they actually have to do this beer run and as a result of that we are not kept at the edge of our seat since it feels like they have limitless time. As well as that, there is no moment where the Sheriff has the upper hand over Reynolds. The protagonist never appears to be in any type of danger, as a result of him always being one step ahead, we never really support him. As far as comedies go, it is all too typical, you can tell the punchline to every joke from a mile away, I understand it may have been somewhat groundbreaking for 1977, today however, it is all too familiar. Modestly funny but lacking in any engagement, Smokey and the Bandit may entertain some, but I would not recommend it. In pursuit from a Sheriff, The Bandit is hired on a beer run across the county. Best Performance: Burt Reynolds / Worst Performance: Jackie Gleason",Smokey and the Bandit
39,ironhorse_iv,"It's time to race over to see Smokey & the Bandit! For me, it was just alright watch. Nothing too special, but it was fun watch.",6,15 March 2016,"As a modern viewer, it's really confusing, to see an alcohol bootlegging movie, come out in the 1970s, that wasn't based in ""prohibition era"" America. However, that's not really a fault of the film. It makes the film, a little more unique. Made during the Convey Craze of the late 1970s. Smokey & the Bandit reeks of that era cheese. That doesn't make it, a bad movie. It just a little dated. A lot of the Citizens band radio (CB radio) lingo and slangs, really goes, over my head. It's also kinda disturbing to see the main character risk innocent driver's lives on the road, for alcohol and to see random people helping him, escape from the police. Despite that, for the most part, the film was very entertaining, even if everything in the film is so over-the-top. Directed by Hal Needham, the movie tells the story of a bootlegger runner, named Bo 'Bandit' Darville (Burt Reynolds), whom is hired to run a tractor trailer full of beer over county lines. However, he has one big problem, he's always being pursuit by foul-mounted, determinate, Texan Sheriff, Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), hoping today is the day, that he will captured him and his son's runaway bride, Carrie (Sally Fields). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this film is a bit disappointing when it comes to how it over-praise Coors Beer. It felt more like a product placement commercial, than a well-rounded movie. Trust me, Coors Beers wasn't as popular, as what this movie made it seem to be. While, its truth, that many Americans in the East Coast wasn't able to get Coors, due to the item not able to be legally sold, east of the Mississippi. However, in truth, Coors wasn't that popular, to Eastern Americans, at the time, due to how they treat their workers, during the labor strike of 1976/1977 & also the fact, that beer was only sold regional, so many people never try it over other products. Added to the fact, that Coors wouldn't go nationwide distribution in the United States until the mid-1980. It's only the seventh most popular beer at the U.S. Not number one, like this movie, makes it out to be. One thing, that was popular at the time, was car chase movies. After all, the 1970s would be describe, as the last great era of the America muscle cars. Add to the fact, that the 1st oil crisis, ended years ago, in 1973, and the fact that the next one isn't until 1979. You would see, a few of these cars, speed, back in the day. While, the stunts in this film doesn't seem, too dangerous or impressive to today's viewers. Compare to the CGI ridden car chase movies of today, this movie has a lot more realistic in its stunt work. In my opinion, it was alright for the most part. Nevertheless, the best thing about this movie, has to be the comedy and the characters. Burt Reynolds really does stand out in this film as the Bandit. I can't see, anybody else, playing, this rugged, wisecracking, Southern-type ""good olé' boy, besides him. This movie really help his career, as it lead to many car comedies for him, such as 1981's Cannonball Run. I also love Jackie Gleason in this film. He's by far, the second best in this film. I love that he was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. Most of the best laughs came from him. Two characters that I felt was a bit disappointing, was Sally Fields as Frog AKA Carrie and Jerry Reed as Cletus Snow. I wouldn't say, their roles was really memorable. However, Sally Fields does have chemistry with Burt Reynolds to the point that they dated after this film was made. Despite that, most of their scenes, felt a bit, too time-wasting. I really can't believe that they were able to catch up with Snowman's truck, at all, or be around each other, to the point, that they can still hear, each other in CB radio. You would think, they wouldn't be, able to make it, due to how long, the lake scene was. While, Jerry Reed's acting was mediocre, at best. Jerry Reed's performance of theme music, ""East Bound and Down"", was catchy. Even, if the lyrics of the song, seem low brow, and bit simpleton. I also love the fact, that this movie help influence the 1979–85 TV series 'The Dukes of Hazzard', sharing many identical settings and concepts. In the end, this movie was good enough to include two sequels, 1980's Smokey and the Bandit II, and 1983's Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. None of them, as good as the original. Then, there was also a series of 1994 television films (Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit, and Bandit's Silver Angel) from original director/writer Hal Needham loosely based on the earlier version, with actor Brian Bloom now playing Bandit; that was somewhat interesting, but not worth watching. Overall: This movie was a Guilty Pleasure of director Alfred Hitchcock. So is it for me is. It's not the greatest movie, but it's entertaining enough to be watchable.

Burt Reynolds is excellently cast as the Bandit. This is probably one of the best action comedies you'll ever see; I'm inclined to call it perfect! Wow, they wrecked a lot of cars. Trust stuntman Hal Needham to bring you an unforgettable action film with great stunts. Well done, Hal!",Smokey and the Bandit

44,GOWBTW,"Funny, Funny, FUNNY!",9,14 June 2005,"This movie was funny and entertaining all the way! Burt Reynolds in his Firebird really gives the meaning of ""showing off"". Even I thought I was the showoff. But everybody who knows the Bandit, gives him a helping hand when he needs it. The law can try their best to apprehend the accomplices, but with Sheriff Buford T. Justice(the legendary Jackie Gleason), who in their right mind would help this Neanderthal? He's out of state, and out of his mind! Other law enforcement officers would ignore this clown, and catch the Bandit themselves. I liked the part where Cletus(country singer,Jerry Reed) ran over the Biker gangs' motorcycles after they rough him up, it looks like they'll be hitchhiking for a while. And hauling all the Coors' beer would be interesting. And when Sally Field's character flips the Georgia State trooper the bird, I said, ""OOOHH!"" That was funny! All the semis, the CB channels, and all the help The Bandit got, makes him the South's local hero. He can be USA's hero if he wants to. This movie is great for truckers and travelers alike. This is USA, keep on a trucking! Rating 4 out of 5 stars!",Smokey and the Bandit

The nation was a-buzz with talk of this movie when it hit the big screen, and with good reason. Jerry Reed, Burt Reynolds, and Sally Field, along with Jackie Gleason and scores of others made this a near all-star extravaganza, which could make you laugh and give you an extraordinary good time, regardless of your walk of life. Its outright irreverence for the law, the rules, and even its own morals made this one of the greatest ""road"" classics of its time.Smokey and the Bandit not only walked up to the bell, it RANG it! This is one highly entertaining bit of nostalgia, which feels like a time capsule all by itself in that it holds many elements of the American culture at the time; aptly demonstrates many of the citizen's attitudes towards the law and the rules of the day; and for those of us who were alive and old enough to love this when it first came out, it is like a walk through a memory.It is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I love it.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Smokey and the Bandit

Sally Fields is an on-the-run bride-to-be love interest who ends riding along in the Bandit's essentially indestructible 6.6 liter black Trans Am. Perusing them is indefatigable Texas sheriff (and titular 'Smokey') Buford T Justice (Jackie Gleason) and his hapless son Junior (Mike Henry), the jilted groom. The plot, which capitalises on the early '70's mysterious fascination with CB radios, is just an excuse for car stunts and cornpone-humour, some of which works, some of which don't. The budget was pretty tight, so there are endless continuity errors, especially concerning the Bandit's preternaturally durable Pontiac and his pursuer's slowly disintegrating LeMans 'gumball machine'.

(2) Jerry Reed's songs. (3) GM's Trans-Am ""Firebird"" (vrroom! vrroom!).With the exception of some pretty decent driving stunts, as well as some equally impressive car collisions (thrown in for good measure), Smokey And The Bandit's story was all just pure ""cliche-city"" (country-style, that is).Remembering that this film was made back in the late-1970s - Every American, badass, cowboy, white-trash, trucker-talking stereotype was crammed into this picture in a frantic attempt to generate some much-needed laughs. But, when it finally came down to actually delivering any genuine chuckles, they, of course, were few and far between.What also lost ""Smokey"" some serious points was the truly horrible ""romance"" that blossomed between Bandit (Reynolds) and Carrie (Fields). Boy, I'm tellin' ya - The rapport between these 2 was, without a doubt, a trite and sickening sight to behold.Directed by former stuntman, Hal Needham (in his first film sitting in the director's chair), Smokey And The Bandit (whose budget was approx. $4 million) was one of the top 4 grossing films of 1977, raking in a whopping $300 million at the box-office.",Smokey and the Bandit

He is never better than in this movie. He plays a wonderfully endearing and witty character; Sally Fields is is funny too. But the real star of this movie is Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Mr. Gleason's performance is a classic and has to rank up there with some of the greatest comic characters in Hollywood motion picture history. In this movie Jackie Gleason proves once again that he was one of the greatest American comic actors and if you don't believe it, then watch the movie and judge for yourself.

49,drqshadow-reviews,Shut Off Your Brain and Buckle Up!,7,13 April 2016,"A classic of the auto-smashup genre, with about as much depth and thought as an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard. And that's totally okay by me, as that's basically the name of the game with this type of film: enjoy the mayhem and try not to overthink anything. Burt Reynolds is at his laid-back best as a legendary bootlegger, coolly skirting the law and forging new trails in his mighty Trans Am, kicking up his feet to casually go with the flow around every obstacle. He makes the whole thing work, really, and the cavalier air of confidence he exudes soon rubs off on the rest of the cast. Jackie Gleason is loads of fun as his nemesis, a particularly persistent Texas sheriff, but he can also fly way off the handle, chewing up scenery like a tacky cartoon character. The driving is great, inventive to the end, and the carnage is satisfying without being mean-spirited. A good flick to throw on whenever you've got a spare hour to fill, though it's better if it doesn't get your undivided attention.",Smokey and the Bandit
50,iquine,No Orange Charger Yet Black Trans Am Fits The Bill,8,5 July 2018,"(Flash Review)As close as you can get to the Duke Boys spirit without the appearance of the General Lee. The movie's bootlegging plot was just an excuse to show Burt and his mustache drive fast and reckless in his rather durable Trans Am while flirting with Sally Field. Burt and partner were paid to essentially go on an illegal beer run, across multiple states, for Coors beer!!, to be accomplished in a short amount of time. The surprise bonus for me was Jackie Gleason's portrayal of the stop at nothing Sheriff from Texas who chased Burt ever since he picked up Sally, after she skipped out at her wedding, on the side of the road through multiple states. And this was the first time I'd seen Jackie Gleason on screen! He was awesome and brought some great humor. This movie was actually really funny and character driven. There were a slew of car stunt scenes yet the colorful characters were even more entertaining complimented by, of course, Burt and Sally's romantic flirting. Will Burt get the booze to its destination on time? Silly question to ask. Overall, above average 70's cars fun!",Smokey and the Bandit

It ain't exactly high art to be sure, but it is a skillfully directed bit of automotive ballet enhanced greatly by charming and energetic performances from its leads. Burt Reynolds was the biggest box office star in America at the time, and it's easy to see why. He's got an innate likability and an effortless charm that never seems forced. On top of being impossibly cute, Sally Field is Reynolds' equal in every measure, and the two share a wonderful chemistry. Joined by singer Jerry Reed (who delivers what may be the best performance of the lot), they form as likable a trio of heroes as you're ever going to meet. But a hero is only as good as his villain, and the Bandit has a doozy in the form of Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Thanks largely to a tour de force performance from the legendary Jackie Gleason, Justice steals every scene he's in and makes for a great comic foil for our heroes.Fun, fast-paced and good-natured, 'Smokey and the Bandit' is the proto Fast and Furious that easily hangs with and often exceeds its sleek 21st century progeny.",Smokey and the Bandit
52,smatysia,"""You can't drive this piece of @#!% on my highway!""",8,7 April 2002,"Not a timeless classic, but a dated one. This is a really good film, although it seems a little ridiculous seen outside the context of its time, much like, oh, say, ""Easy Rider"". The confluence of Burt Reynolds becoming the top star of the day, plus the CB craze going on at that time provide the roots of a smash success from a fairly low budget film. Reynolds, at that age, was perfect for the part, and Jerry Reed was surprisingly good for a non-actor. Sally Field never looked prettier, either. I remember how, in the '70's Coors beer was not available in Houston, either; one had to go to Dallas to get it. It seemed so good then, when it was scarce. It's funny, how ever since Coors went national, it's absolutely nothing special. The grass is always greener, I guess.",Smokey and the Bandit
53,jimbo-53-186511,An underrated gem that I've seen countless times that never fails to make me laugh - one of my personal favourites!!,10,30 April 2014,"The plot for this film is simple and basically sees Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) setting the Bandit (Burt Reynolds) with a challenge. The challenge is to collect 400 cases of beer from Texarkana, Texas and bring it back to Georgia in 28 hours. If he is successful, Big Enos and Little Enos will reward him with $80,000. The Bandit accepts the challenge and with the help of his best friend Cledus Snow 'the Snowman' (Jerry Reed) both men set to work. However, with police from every state from Texas to Georgia pursuing them, will they be successful?I have seen this film several times right from when I was a kid to this evening when I sat down and watched it and finally decided to sit down and write a review about this film. Obviously from my rating of 10 out of 10 it is clear that I loved this film and I'll explain why; The biggest factor working in the favour of Smokey and the Bandit is the chemistry between the characters - normally I'd be fairly impressed with a film if the chemistry is good between 2 people, but in this film the chemistry is good with every single double act in this film (even Cledus and Fred lol). Burt Reynolds does phone in his performance but it works due to the silly nature of the film - he has a lazy charm and charisma about him and he actually delivers a lot of his dialogue in a rather dry way which just made me burst out laughing (several times). Field's character was good and was actually very funny as well (she had some funny lines too). In the hands of poor scriptwriters her character could have come across as annoying, but the scriptwriters handled her character well and make sure that her character never crosses the line between being funny and being annoying. As a result, the shared chemistry between Reynolds and Field was brilliant. Likewise, the same can be said of the chemistry between Buford T Justice and Junior (Mike Henry) which was also top notch. Henry was only overshadowed by an incredible performance by Jackie Gleason. Genius.For me though, the star of the show is Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T Justice and if truth be told he is the main reason why I've given this film a 10 out of 10. The film would have been good without him, but with him in the film it is utterly brilliant. What he lacks in intelligence he more than makes up for in determination. His ineptness and genius one liners are truly what puts this film into a class of its own. Here are some of my favourites; Buford T Justice to Junior ""There's no way, no way that you could come from my loins. As soon as I get home the first thing I'm going to do is punch your momma in the mouth!!"" Sheriff of Arkansas to Buford T Justice ""The fact that you are a Sheriff is not germane to the situation"" Buford T Justice to Sheriff of Arkansas "" The Goddamn Germans have got nothing to do with it"" Quite simply put this is an incredibly funny film that is endlessly rewatchable with shed loads of quotable dialogue. The fact that this film only has a current IMDb rating of 6.8 is shocking. I could probably count on one hand the number of films that I've seen that have been this much fun. Smokey and the Bandit is quite simply a film that must be seen and is a film that I would recommend to everyone.",Smokey and the Bandit

55,ptb-8,Redneck rubber riot,7,15 June 2009,"Enormous good fun.. and I am flabbergasted that this film is 33 years old. In 1977 a 1944 film sure did look old but now in 2009 this 1976 production still looks fairly modern albeit super-bad 70s. In fact I really enjoyed the time-trip to this free 70s with its good natured roadside and trailer-park American fun times which echo all through SMOKEY. Burt Reynolds perfected his good ol' boy image thru DELIVERANCE in 73 then WW AND THE DIXIE DANCEKINGS in 74 via some lovably clumsy tap dancing in AT LONG LAST LOVE in 75 then rum running with doe eyed Robbie Benson and shrieking Liza Minnelli in LUCKY LADY (what a campy film!..no wonder it has never surfaced again ... yet...maybe after Stanley Donen dies)...) and then into SMOKEY which sets the scene for stunt car comedies for the next 5 years. In 1978 we got HOOPER then in 1979 THE BLUES BROTHERS and CONVOY and then more SMOKEY sequels. It was seemingly endless. SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT must be one of the most profitable films ever made. Seen thu 2009 eyes it seems to be the most simple of productions: there is not even ONE set used... every shot is taken on the road in a car or a truck, at a raceway fun-park, in a roadside diner, in a car park or in a picnic ground. It is all real .. and with real ordinary people as extras in most scenes..which was a clever way of ensuring incredible expectant word of mouth for the film to open in a big way. And it did.. one of the biggest cinema successes of the late 70s. More good fun than I remembered and evoking a wonderful nostalgia for the 70s, and with the most awful fashions imaginable.. brown pants and incredibly tight clothes.. eek! The budget must have been less than $3 million and it brought in over $100m in rentals! SMOKEY shows why everyone loved the 70s and Burt Reynolds at 42 years old hit his stride as a mega-star of the time.

56,dworldeater,"""Let's see what he's got under the hood, bye bye baby"".",8,27 May 2020,"Stuntman and stunt coordinator Hal Needum makes his directorial debut with this and is arguably his best film as director. Smokey And The Bandit was a giant hit for good reasons. Burt Reynolds became known for doing probably too many movies like this, but he was a very talented and charismatic, versetile actor who did a tremendous job here as the lead with a very natural and cool performance. He carries the film with relative ease making The Bandit extremely likeable. His real romantic chemistry with Sally Field was excellent as well. Jerry Reed is great support as The Bandit's buddy Snowman and made some great music for the film and coming from me that is a high compliment ad I normally don't like country music. ""Eastbound And Down"" is a catchy tune that even I can't deny. If that wasn't enough in hot pursuit of The Bandit is Sheriff Buford T Justice played by Jackie Gleason himself in a iconic performance. Did I mention Hal Needum was a stuntman? There is no shortage of crazy car chases and stunts here with Burt going 130 MPH in a black trans am. In summary Smokey And The Bandit is one wild ride and one crazy beer run. But, this is a really good movie that comes across as pretty authentic and fast, furious and funny. In the year this was released it went through the roof at the box office, 2nd only to Star Wars. It's easy to see why, Smokey And The Bandit is a classic and really holds up.",Smokey and the Bandit
57,aidanratesmovies,A Guilty Pleasure Joy Ride,9,19 April 2020,"An absolutely entertaining blast, Smokey and the Bandit may not be a great film, but a uniquely enjoyable, and very amusing one. Burt Reynolds and Sally Field provide some great chemistry as the films main leads, giving the film both a healthy dose of humor, sass, and fun to make things far more enjoyable than a film with this simple of a premise should have. As said, the film seems ridiculously simple, but nearly every small aspect and big aspect of the film works in a way that propels it to greater lengths than any film with this plot could. In other words, the film is wildly creative with its use of its ridiculous situation, and is able to be a fun over the top film that not only doesn't take itself seriously, but isn't too over the top either. The film can be a bit dated at times, mainly with its use of the Buford T. Justice making various remarks that would not hold up today, but besides that the film holds up its clever does of fun and fast car paced action to make for one hell of a time.

58,truemythmedia,Reflecting after Burt's passing,4,17 July 2019,"I'm to young to have seen ""Smokey and the Bandit"" in theaters, but it is one of those movies that, even if you have never seen it, you probably know what it is about. The movie is so iconic and, it seems, universally loved that it seemed like there wasn't even a point in watching it.The Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights) passed. Like the film, Burt was an actor I could recognize in a heartbeat but not one I felt like I needed to go out of my way to see. He was not a huge influence on me since I hardly saw his films but he seemed as much of an image of a certain kind of American as John Wayne was a cowboy.As such, I figured as a tribute to him, I would watch one of his most famous movies.This won't be a long review. The film is pretty simple and you either dig it or you don't. I don't.To be honest I'm really not sure why this is such an iconic film. It's just a guy in a car drawing of police officers from a Semi Truck punctuated by puns and double entendres.The film is mostly one long chase scene but it's not a good chase scene. It's not well shot so you never really know where the cars are in relation to each other or what kind of danger anyone is in. The police are cartoon characters that couldn't keep a car with a dead battery on the road and in the end, when the Bandit wins, it isn't anymore glorious of a victory than when the United States Dream Team in the 90s beat everyone in the world at basketball. Of course they did. They were playing amateurs. Similarly, the Bandit does nothing more than beat a police force which falls all over itself anytime someone says, ""look over there.""The performances are equally dreadful. Not Burt Reynolds and Sally Field (Lincoln), but everyone else, especially Jackie Gleason. If no one had told me who he was, I would have thought he was a hack.The writing is perhaps, one of this movies worst qualities. Nothing like a movie with low stakes, chases that pose no danger, and jokes ripped from a bathroom stall wall. I remember one line in the movie that I thought was good and poignant but I remember it because there was only one.Really, the best thing about this movie, at least as I watched it today, is that it put Burt's life in perspective for me. As I thought about writing this review and slamming a favorite movie of a beloved actor who has passed, I found myself wondering if it was in poor taste. It got me thinking of how I would want my movies talked about. It got me thinking about the ways that everything we do in life has a shelf life.In the end it put me in a sort of thoughtful mood, thinking about Burt Reynolds and praying that he, as I hope may be true for all, found happiness in his life and connected deeply with others because, truly, what more can one ask for when the day is coming when no one remembers this film?Someday, every copy of every movie will pass away. Every memory of every performance as well. But the smiles and joy that Burt brought to millions were real smiles, real joy, and no matter what happens in the future, no matter how many young people watch his films and think the humor is outdated, lives were happier for his presence with us.That, I believe, is worth celebrating.",Smokey and the Bandit

The only way the plot of Smokey and the Bandit could be more unabashedly American is if someone stuck a firework up their a** while singing the national anthem. Did I mention that our protagonist, the infamous Bandit is played by none other than masculinity incarnate Burt Reynolds?Bandit's main job is being the truck's blocker; i.e. the guy who scouts ahead and distract Smokeys (police) to clear a path for his reluctant partner Snowman (Reed). As such the Bandit drives a 1977 T-Top Pontiac Firebird Trans Am special edition with a painted valve covered V8 engine and a top speed of 135 miles and hour. To complete the ensemble, the Trans Am has gold rims, is painted black and features a golden firebird ascending from the top of one mean looking hood.

Justice (Gleason) a Texas sheriff whose son's bride to be has been picked up by the bristles of Burt Reynold's mustache.The events of Smokey and the Bandit play out like a live-action Road Runner (1966-1973) cartoon with Reynold's tongue firmly placed in cheek. The antics of the smooth-talking Reynolds, the rodeo clownishness of Snowman and the game-for-anything Sally Fields makes for something uniquely satisfying. Like listening to the tit-for-tat dialogue of Oscar Wilde slumming it on an episode of Dukes of Hazzard (1979-1985). It goes a long way, especially when you consider you're essentially watching a B-movie with a wafer-thin plot.Perhaps ""thin"" isn't the word to use; rather it's small and maladroit compared to cheeseball truck-centric originators like Plunder Road (1957) and Red Ball Express (1952). There's not a lot of unnecessary subplots or backstory; heck even the time-clock aspect of the film is frightfully underplayed, choosing instead to focus on mythologizing the star, the car and the CB radio. Yet largely thanks to Jackie Gleason's scenery-chewing pomposity we never get the feeling that this film is anything more than a cheap and fun carnival ride. One whose trajectory is a barrel of laughs and whose ending is surprisingly layered given the time it was released. But who cares; stuntman turned director Hal Needham certainly doesn't and neither do the throngs of fans who have made this film a populist classic.

Why, I don't know, nor do I care. I had an administrator tell me about his financing his higher education at the University of Montana by driving down to Wyoming on Friday nights, loading up the old wagon, then booking it back to Missoula to sell the cases of Coors in the dorm parking lot. It went fast, but I can't see the Bandit driving a mid-fifties station wagon.The administrator told me that the movie touched him deeply, and then he laughed at his own good luck (never got stuck in bad weather and never got busted!).Smokey and the Bandit, itself, is a really stupid movie, with forced humor, cartoonish characters, utterly unbelievable stunts, and Sally Field looking very, very good.

The chase scenes are well done and if the CB chatter was ever tacky in the new millennium it's all just cute. This is pretty much the last of the almost-humble Burt, from here on out it's asides to the camera and vanity stuff.",Smokey and the Bandit
65,IonicBreezeMachine,Burt Reynolds' and Jackie Gleason give iconic energized performances in this enjoyable chase comedy that's maybe a tad too stretched for material.,7,4 July 2021,"Set in the American South, Wealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette (Pat McCormick) and his son Little Enos (Paul Williams) make an offer to Bo Darville (Burt Reynolds) CB handle ""the Bandit"" to haul 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana (the closest place it could be legally sold at that time) to Atlanta in 28 hours for $80,000. Bandit takes up the offer enlisting his friend Cledus Snow (Jerry Reed) ""Snowman"" to drive the truck while Bandit drives a black Pontiac Trans Am to serve as ""blocker"" diverting police attention away from the truck. After the two pick up the Coors Bandit picks up hitchhiking runaway bride, Carrie (Sally Field) and is ruthlessly pursued by Texas Lawman, Bufford T. Justice (Jackie Gleasaon) father of abandoned bridegroom Junior (Mike Henry) and Justice chases Bandit and Carrie across multiple states.Released in 1977, Smokey and the Bandit marks the feature debut of Hal Needham, a veteran stuntman who'd been working in TV and movies since the 60s on a number of high profile TV sh.ows and films before becoming a stunt coordinator and action director. Initially intended as a low budget b-film with Jerry Reed as Bandit, he script caught the attention of Needham's friend and colleague, Burt Reynolds who signed for the part and with Reynolds one of the top draws of the 70s gave the film the needed traction to get of the ground after being initially rejected. With a modest budget of $5 million that was later reduced to 4 by one of Universal's ""hatchet men"" and a rushed production including the theme song ""Eastbound and Down"" that was written virtually overnight by Reed, the film became a monster success becoming the second highest grossing film of 1977 only behind Star Wars. The movie is fun, but is a little stretched for material.Burt Reynolds is absolute amazing as Bandit, with his cocksure laidback charisma that defined many of Reynolds' performances, Reynolds is effortlessly watchable and engaging with likability to spare. Jerry Reed is equally good as Bandit's exasperated reluctant partner and has some enjoyable banter with Reed. Sally Field as runaway bride, Carrie is good as she fast talks and leaps around Bandit's Trans Am and also has good chemistry with Reynolds. But easily the best performance is Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Bufford T. Justice. Gleason was given free reign to ad-lib and he goes all in on this character playing a mixture of Archie Bunker and Elmer Fudd with his hapless son who gets into all manner of humiliations that never fail to get a laugh. Justice has become an iconic performance for Gleason often quoted, parodied, and homaged and that can be attributed to Gleason's sheer dedication that makes him a more than worthy nemesis to Bandit.Being directed by a stuntman, Smokey and the Bandit serves as a showcase for all manner of stunts both vehicular, physical, or sometimes both. There's real tradecraft on display with some impactful crashes, jumps, skids, chases, and brawls with coordination and precision to spare. With that said I think the movie is a bit too reliant upon the vehicles as while they are impressive they lose some of their novelty as time goes on with not much comedy mined from them (save for maybe Sheriff Justice's deteriorating automobile).Smokey and the Bandit is lightweight entertainment that gives subtlety a punch to the face. With the lovably swaggering Bandit well situated against the vengeful but inept Sheriff Justice the movie takes that simple premise and runs with it on the back of economically produced trade craft and character and actor investment.",Smokey and the Bandit
66,Hollywood_Yoda,Eastbound and Down,9,24 October 2018,"Smokey and the Bandit was a huge success when originally released in 1977. It ended up being in the top ten grossing films list that year. It was a film that not many expected to be such a hit, but the fan base is huge. Burt Reynolds is The Bandit, and he'll always be known as such, this is his most iconic film, whether it won awards or not (which it didn't).Sally Field costars as Carrie, the Bandit's love interest on screen and later off screen. Jerry Reed also costars as Cledus Snow, cb hamdle, Snowman and Bandit's buddy. And there's also Jackie Gleason in one of his most iconic roles as well, as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Gleason had some great lines in the film and some great car chase moments.It's not a family film, but it is rated PG, but probably not suitable for young kids, those under 10 years old. There's definitely some bad language throughout, but it was the 1970s.",Smokey and the Bandit

68,eminkl,A good flick to throw on whenever you've got a spare hour to fill,7,18 April 2020,"A classic of the auto-smashup genre, with about as much depth and thought as an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard. And that's totally okay by me, as that's basically the name of the game with this type of film: enjoy the mayhem and try not to overthink anything. Burt Reynolds is at his laid-back best as a legendary bootlegger, coolly skirting the law and forging new trails in his mighty Trans Am, kicking up his feet to casually go with the flow around every obstacle. He makes the whole thing work, really, and the cavalier air of confidence he exudes soon rubs off on the rest of the cast. Jackie Gleason is loads of fun as his nemesis, a particularly persistent Texas sheriff, but he can also fly way off the handle, chewing up scenery like a tacky cartoon character. The driving is great, inventive to the end, and the carnage is satisfying without being mean-spirited. A good flick to throw on whenever you've got a spare hour to fill, though it's better if it doesn't get your undivided attention.",Smokey and the Bandit
69,gab-14712,A Smokey Good Time!,8,18 October 2017,"If you ever wanted to see what The Fast and the Furious would look like in the 1970's, look not further than this 1977 feature, Smokey and the Bandit. The movie is filled to the rim with cars, more cars, and even more cars. The movie also displays a good amount of vehicle destruction, which is common in the fore-mentioned Fast and Furious series. The cars were quite impressive to look at, even though I am not a big fan of car watching. If it has an engine and a steering wheel, that is okay by me. But seeing these 1970's models was actually pretty cool. The main car was a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am, and that is my kind of ride. So if you're into cars, then this wouldn't be a bad film to check out. When these cars are put into action.look out! I desperately wanted to hate this movie. I refused to watch the movie for years because it did not seem so appealing. But my love for the Fast and Furious franchise got me curious to check this film out. Color me surprised when the credits rolled on screen, because I was pleasantly surprised. I did not expect to be thoroughly entertained the entire film. From start to finish, I was involved with the action, and most importantly the characters. My two favorite characters were the main character named Bandit and the sheriff chasing after him, Buford T. Justice. I wouldn't call these characters likable, but definitely entertaining.Admittedly, the story is very silly. But then even silly stories can work sometimes if you have the right actors and the right material. Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus (Jerry Reed) are two truck drivers who decide to take a dare from these bigshot rich men. The dare consists of picking up beer from Texas and transporting it to Georgia. After they pick up the beer, Bandit decides to pick up a runaway bride named Carrie (Sally Field). Her husband-to-be's father happens to be the Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). When Justice realizes what is going on, they begin a pursuit of Bandit, his new lady, and his beer. Sounds silly, right? But my gosh, I was incredibly entertained. I also learned a fact, believe it or not, from this plot line. The famed Coors beer brand was actually illegal east of the Mississippi River during this time. So even high-profile people such as Dwight Eisenhower or Gerald Ford had to smuggle the beer from the West.The characters helped elevate the mediocre, silly story into something that was entertaining. At the time, Burt Reynolds was a movie superstar. I was impressed at his tough-guy performance in the 1972 drama, Deliverance. He brings more of that persona into this role, but with a sense of humor. His character was actually funny at times in the midst of the action that is occurring. He is also portrayed at times as a drunk and a womanizer, but compared to people he is dealing with, I'd consider Bandit a hero. I also loved the character of Sheriff Buford T. Justice. His high-speed pursuit ended up in failure most often, but one thing his character is known for is his foul mouth. (He actually gave credence to the term ""sumbitch"") I also thought Sally Field turned in a strong performance as Carrie. This is one of her early roles, and she gained instant fame because of this role.Smokey and the Bandit turned out to be a much better film than I could have ever anticipated. It's not an all-time favorite, but it is a solid, serviceable action film. Watching Bandit escape dozens of cops was entertaining for me. There are plenty of car chases, cool stunts, and enough characterization to give any action junkie a rush of adrenaline. There is also a good sense of humor. I particularly loved the scenes between Cledus and his dog. They were funny, but it helps there was a cute dog. I would hesitate to call the movie a classic as some people do. This movie may be silly and over-the-top at certain points, but I was incredibly entertained.My Grade: B+",Smokey and the Bandit

This is agreeable enough, with a cast of likable characters and a non-stop car chase, but at the end of the film it was clear that it didn't really entertain me.  I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did.  It distracted me very well, but I rarely laughed and a film like this wasn't made for anything but laughs.

72,qormi,It Just Clicks,10,7 December 2010,"Smokey and the Bandit is a lighthearted and funny movie that doesn't take itself seriously - and that's its genius. Jackie Gleason nearly steals the show from Burt as the stereotypical southern sheriff. Mike Henry is brilliantly cast as his dimwitted son. Henry, who can out macho Reynolds any day, deserved a better career than he got, but that's another story. Sally Field had a lot of chemistry with Reynolds. They hit it off in real life and had quite a fling together for awhile. The Trans Am scenes where they zip around the southern backroads and do some stunts were awe inspiring. Jerry Reed as Reynolds' sidekick had a lot of charisma as the dumb redneck country boy trucker. Who cares if he never got pulled over doing 90 mph in an 18-wheeler? That's Hollywood. TYhe revenge he got on the bikers was very memorable. Break out the popcorn - it's a great ride.",Smokey and the Bandit

78,willcundallreview,OK fun from a generally satisfactory movie,6,19 August 2015,"Smokey and the Bandit is an action comedy/adventure movie that takes all the seriousness of a true chase movie and throws it away, only to introduce a fun old time and even the most dangerous times are taken in leisurely by the main characters. With American muscle cars screeching at every corner, and really quite annoying police sirens everywhere, this is one movie that although flawed in places, is still very much OKBurt Reynolds is the main man around the highways playing the Bandit Bo Darville, who's reckless driving and blatant disregard for the law are seen as a good thing(but we have to support the good guys right?). Jackie Gleason as the old Sheriff Buford T.Justice is good, pretty funny and he just makes you dislike him even though you kind of want to see more of him, the partnership between him and his deputy(who also happens to be his son) is a little stupid at times, but nevertheless still kind of funny. Sally Field is OK as Carrie a bride who well doesn't want to get married and meets the Bandit, the chemistry between all involved is pretty tight, and the director does a good job on that.And on that note the director, Hal Needham, whose direction takes the film in a nice direction, fast paced and well timed but also with a few scatterings of jokes. The few times the movie is funny are probably outweighed by the poor jokes involved, I don't think it is the delivery that is off, the script just doesn't always make the joke come off right, and so your left either cringing or very mildly laughing, VERY mildly. It's basically the kind of movie to be enjoyed if you want fast pace as I say, look into too much and you'll just start to dislike it, I for one didn't take it seriously and found it alright.I mean this movie grossed into the hundreds of millions, whether it deserves that is another question but does prove to me how big this movie was and possibly still is. That said this movie is not great, I mean as I have been saying it is satisfactory but far from very good, a movie that gives off the kind of vibe that it was going for just OK from start to finish. I think Burt Reynolds is a good addition to the movie; his presence is welcome and makes the movie a little more fun too, even with his very calm demeanour. Overall the movie is as said throughout OK, never reaching the any true heights but still finishing up nicely. I would recommend this to those from the 70's, well OK not just people from the 70's, also those who enjoy good old fashioned fun and likable characters, all mixed in a barely just about funny movie. This spawned two sequels and a TV series, some could say that shows success but for me it shows a film grossing well first time around and then milking the hell out of it!",Smokey and the Bandit

It also happens to be one of my top 10 favorite comedy films of all-time! This movie fires on all cylinders! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and of course a perfect soundtrack. Burt Reynolds steals the show as the Bandit, Sally Field is brilliant as Bandit's companion, Jerry Reed is great as Bandit's friend Snowman, and Jackie Gleason is absolutely hilarious as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. All the cast members perform their characters flawlessly. As a fan of the southeastern USA, the sets and locations are beautiful. The special effects are well done and have aged well. Finally, the soundtrack is perfect and ties the film together. Probably the coolest thing about the soundtrack is that most of it was composed and performed by actor/singer/musician Jerry Reed. He really helps to make this soundtrack shine. This movie is a brilliant achievement in the aspect of comedy it's always fun to watch and it never gets old. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking for a fun and comedic road trip/racing movie, then ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is the movie for you! To end my review of this movie, let us have a moment of silence for the late, but great actors: Burt Reynolds, Jerry Reed, and Jackie Gleason. We thank you all for all your memorable performances and work in your phenomenal careers. May you all rest in peace, you will never be forgotten.

While not as bad as the later spawns of this series, this movie is one continuous car chase, so if you're looking for a great story, you're in the wrong place.  Sally Field is gives the best performance in this movie, but in a part that even Elizabeth Berkley could do.  Why she is in this movie at all is beyond me.

87,garyldibert,Great Movie,8,24 February 2007,"TITLE: SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was release in theaters on May 27 1977 and it will take you 96 minutes to watch this movie. Smokey and the Bandit is a 1977 movie starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Pat McCormick, Paul Williams, and Mike Henry. It inspired several other trucking films, including two sequels, Smokey and the Bandit II (originally known as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again in the U.K.), and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. There were also a series of 1994 television movies (Bandit Goes Country,, Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit's Silver Angel) from original director/writer Hal Needham loosely based on the earlier version, with Emmy-winning actor Brian Bloom now playing Bandit. The three original movies introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am (while the TV-movie version drives the Dodge Stealth). The film was the second highest grossing film of 1977, beaten only by Star Wars..SUMMARY: As the movie begins, rich Texan Big Enos Burdette (Pat McCormick) and his son, Little Enos (Paul Williams), are trying to find a truck driver willing to haul Coors beer to Georgia for their refreshment. Unfortunately, due to federal liquor laws and state liquor tax regulations of the time, selling and/or shipping Coors east of the Mississippi River was considered bootlegging, and the truck drivers who had taken the bet previously had been discovered and arrested by ""Smokey"" (truck driver and CB slang for highway patrolmen). At a local truck rodeo, the Texans locate legendary truck driver Bo ""Bandit"" Darville (Burt Reynolds) and offer him US$80,000 (US$270,000 in 2007 dollars), the price of a new truck, to haul 400 cases of Coors beer from Texarkana, Texas to the ""Southern Classic"" truck rodeo in Georgia— in 28 hours. Bandit accepts the bet and recruits fellow trucker Cletus ""Snowman"" Snow (Jerry Reed) to drive the truck (Snow brings along his dog, a Basset Hound named ""Fred"", for company). Bandit purchases a black Pontiac Trans Am, which he will drive himself as a ""blocker"" car to deflect attention away from the truck and its cargo. The trio reaches Texas ahead of schedule, load their truck with Coors, and immediately head back towards Georgia. Shortly thereafter, Bandit picks up professional dancer and apparent runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field), whom he nicknames ""Frog"" because she was ""always hopping around"". However, by picking up Carrie, Bo becomes the target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), whose handsome yet very simple-minded son Junior (Mike Henry) was to have been Carrie's groom. The remainder of the film is essentially one big high-speed chase, as Bandit and Frog attract continuous attention from local and state police while Snowman barrels eastward with the Coors beer. Despite leaving his home jurisdiction, Sheriff Justice and his son continue to pursue Bandit, even as various mishaps cause their squad car to disintegrate around them. Bandit and Snowman are greatly assisted by a number of colorful characters met along the way, many of whom they contact through their CB radios; these acquaintances allow them to escape police pursuit on numerous occasions.QUESTIONS: Neither Justice nor any of the other police officers are ever aware of Snowman's illegal cargo of Coors. Despite all the pursuit Sheriff Buford T Justice, how did the Bandit make it? What the bandit and snowman hauling in that truck? Why did the Bandit take a new deal instead of the money? Where did Frog come from and who was she? Why was Frog trying to escape from the sheriff in the first place?

Agile and entertaining comedy, this film made an enormous success in the whole world and it transformed Burt Reynolds into the greatest 70's movie star.

94,jrs-8,Good ole time,8,3 August 2004,"""Smokey and the Bandit"" is a simple car chase film that is loads of fun to watch. This is the type of movie that drive-ins were born to show.Burt Reynolds became a superstar with this film and it's easy to see why. You can see him having fun thus we have fun watching him. The story is simple enough. Burt and partner Jerry Reed make a bet that they can go from Georgia to Texas and back with a load of Coors beer in 28 hours. Why you might ask is the bet made? Paul Williams and Pat McCormack (as the bettors) just like to make odd bets. When Reynolds asks why they need so much beer Williams sarcastically responds ""Because he's thirsty dummy"".Sally Field plays a woman about to be married to a deputy sheriff who chickens out and leaves him at the alter. Reynolds, as the Bandit, picks her up. This doesn't sit too well with Sheriff Jackie Gleason, the intended father in law. He chases after Reynolds not knowing what Reynolds is up to.That's your story. It's one long chase that is loads of fun. Gleason seems to be having fun as the foul mouthed Smokey of the title and the action rarely lets up. Credit director Hal Needham for the pacing. On the flawed side Burt is never made aware of the connection between Sally Field and Jackie Gleason thus never figures out that Gleason is not after him for bootlegging. And we never see a clock on when the 28 hours start so the audience gets no sense of suspense as to how much time is left. We get the occasional update from Jerry Reed telling Burt (and us) whether they are ahead or behind schedule. I think it would have been more exciting to see for ourselves.All in all it's a fun picture. The best way to see it is on the big screen while sitting in your car with a beverage of your own. Perhaps with a little pretending you can experience what millions of us did in the summer of 1977.",Smokey and the Bandit
95,Pyro_Pizza,Classic American Movie,7,7 April 2021,"Burt Reynolds plays a trucker and the world's best bootlegging run in this slice of class american cinema. The story is simple, yet draws you in for a good time of high speed shenanigans, it's everything great about the USA in one movie.",Smokey and the Bandit
96,tpaladino,Crucial Americana,8,14 February 2010,"Regardless of what you think of the premise of the film itself, or the actors and its story line, I believe that this film does stand on its own as a truly important piece of Americana, every bit as significant as any of Norman Rockwell's work.It is a snapshot (albeit an idealized one) of a simpler life in America. One of a lovable outlaw folk hero and small town sheriff and county fairs and bygone car culture and life on the open road. Its a simple story to be sure, but that is the charm.As for the film itself, its of course not going to win any Oscars. The acting isn't exactly fantastic in a lot of the scenes, and nothing really groundbreaking was happening there. But the characters were developed beautifully and you genuinely care about them and their adventure. Its worthwhile viewing for sure.",Smokey and the Bandit
97,wilsonstuart-32346,Pleasant Memories,8,9 September 2018,"I watched this on an ITV channel a matter of days after the sad passing of Burt Reynolds. Although Burt was something of an underrated actor who made his share of bad careers (with a few absolute gems - kudos to Gator, Mean Machine, The Cannonball Run, The Longewt Yard, Sharkey's Machine, Boogie Nights and Deliverance) Smokey and The Bandit will probably be remembered as his signature role.Anyone expecting deep film making or character development will be disappointed. The plot is simplicity itself and almost quaint by today's standards - hotshot racing driver Burt Reynolds and trucker chum Jerry Reed are tasked with a tri-state bootlegging run (Coors beer!) from Texas to Georgia within 28 hours, Reed in an impressive rig, Reynolds running interference in the signature Black Trans-Am; the bet, set by Paul Williams and Pat McCormack, is for eighty grand; along the way, Reynolds picks up the delightful Sally Field, and an irate sheriff in the form of Jackie Gleason and his dimwit son/deputy Mike Hendry, also Fields's jilted groom.That folks, is the size of it.Perhaps it was the top notch acting, or Hal Needham's no nonsense, right to the point direction, but Smokey tapped into the zeigiest of the era so effectively - a crisp, freewheeling ride across the Midwest, unburdened by any complications, aided by the Internet of Seventies, the Citizen Band Radio (and my brother got one on the strength of this movie!).As the credits rolled IIfelt a twinge of sentiment. This is a fun, fitting tribute to the talents of Burt, Reed, Gleason, McCormack and Needham.",Smokey and the Bandit
98,maxastree,Hypertrash,3,21 April 2016,"Smokey and the Bandit was one of the top selling items of 1977 - behind Star Wars, as apologists and hype-bandits have proclaimed. Its also the inception of a crass, commercially oriented feature film style with no plot, no substance, its oddly neutered of any real bite, and its overly slick editing appears to be pulled from the world of advertising.Core plot features a sex-god redneck smooth talker driving a product-placement Pontiac TransAm like a madman all over the road, drawing police attention from a bootlegging truck convoy. Its all part of an old money wager to get illegal goods across state lines before a set deadline, however the filmmakers don't even bother concluding its premise - instead setting the action up for a sequel. Whats really wrong with Bandit, besides the relentless sexism, is its sheer lack of depth or meaning; stunt coordinator Hal Needham should have been directing a car commercial or straight-to-VHS low budget b-movie, but his friendship with bankable star Burt Reynolds put money in the project, making the car chases more insane, and the camera work more impressive. All that, however, doesn't change the fact that Needham can't direct. A key sequence involving a truck stop where Reynold's wing man gets in a bar fight illustrates his shortcomings: the scene involves a charming animal, a race relations moment, comedic misunderstandings, a barroom fight sequence, some culture war implications and a bit of nostalgic country music to boot. While a decent director could wring some weight and emotion out of the sequence, as well as some good laughs, Needhams version reads something like this: Slick set up shots. INT: Fight sequence - CUT TO - EXT - Stunt Sequence. That's about it.Basically, Hal Needham's a pre-CGI Michael Bay.I'd have given the movie a one-star rating but moved it up to three because of a) some insane car stunt moves that would have certainly impressed viewers in '77 and because b) it has nostalgic childhood value for some folks out there. (HINT: leave it in the past, Smokey and the Bandit is not really a movie, it's a car commercial.)",Smokey and the Bandit
99,ehrldawg,One Truck Drivers' Opinion,7,3 June 2013,"Two truck drivers run bootleg beer from Texas to Georgia with a Texas mounty on there tail.This is a fun ride of a movie. Jerry Reed was at the top of his game when he wrote ""East Bound And Down"". This is one of the most popular songs on Colsons Country Classics on WKZS in Covington,In. Because of this song,Jerry Reeds' Greatest Hits is a requirement to be in the cab of every truck driver. Every time I mention the subject of trucker movies,""Smokey And The Bandit"" are one of three titles that come up(the other two are ""Convoy"" and ""White Line Fever"").But I've always been troubled with the fact that every law enforcement officer is seen as incompetent boobs. Now I know what Hal Needham was trying to do. He was trying to show that Sheriff Justice was the only law enforcement officer that had the grit to pursue an outlaw trucker called Bandit. And if you call Mr Needham out on it,he will say, ""Its just a movie"". But it still bothers me.In the DVD commentary,Burt Reynolds says he wanted Sally Field to play the lead. But someone in the decision making process said that Sally Field wasn't sexy enough. Can you imagine that. Some one thought Sally Field want sexy enough. I think someone was experiencing some kinda blindness.Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed drove the Kenworth 18 wheeler.Bill Saito drove the Chevrolet big rig car hauler.Macon McCalmon drove Peterbuilt big rig tanker.Laura Lizie Sommers drove the Peterbuilt big rig.A Mickey Dolenze look-a-like drove an undetermined big rig.Hank Worton drove the Peterbuilt big rig.This is the first of at least 3 times Jerry Reed drove a big truck.Jerry Reed was a permanent AAA list actor.Burt Reynols,Laura Lizie Sommers, and the Mikey Dolenze look-a-like are permanent A list actors.Bill Saito,Macon McCakmon, and Hank Worden were permanent A list actors.Sally Field,Laura Lizie Sommers, Linda McClure,Susan McIlver, and Ingeborg Kjeldsen are hot!!erldwgstruckermovies.com",Smokey and the Bandit

He was truly great in Deliverance, in Boogie Night, and in his final film.But in that same great final film, he came to terms with his life and career. He regretted going for the easy cash in simple minded action films like this one.There was a backlash against Reynolds' films. Mother Against Drunk Drivers pointed to him as the worst example of films promoting reckless, often drunken, driving. The small town in Texas I grew up in the 70s had lots of teens trying to imitate him. That meant driving reckless when bored on the weekends.As action or comedy, it's so so anyway. Like Dukes of Hazzard, a lot of posing as rebellious. Self destructive behavior isn't being cool.",Smokey and the Bandit
102,eti55,Greatest Road Flick Ever Made,10,23 June 2013,"Why can't more movies be like this? No, there are no deep meanings to look for, no lessons to be learned, no pain or misery..just a couple of guys trying to haul some illegal beer across state lines in 28 hours..over a bet.Not only is everyone good in this movie, but you can tell they're having a really good time doing it, from Burt Reynolds (back when I liked him) as the easygoing and wisecracking Bandit, to Jerry Reed (the most underrated player in this) as Cledus, his fun loving truck driving partner-in-crime (with his faithful sidekick Fred, probably the laziest basset hound on earth..except when he wants to take a swim). There's Sally Field as the runaway bride (the back-and-forth between her and Reynolds is priceless). Then there's the straw that stirs the drink in all this: The Great One, Jackie Gleason, probably the only one who could have made the slovenly, gross, backwards redneck Sheriff Buford T. Justice so funny.The dialog is hilarious (no doubt much of it was improvised), and car chases were very well staged. But the best part about Smokey and the Bandit is that it doesn't take itself seriously...at all. In that sense it's the polar opposite of the cult road classic Vanishing Point, in which the story starts with essentially the same premise, but is dark, dreary, somber and surreal. Smokey and the Bandit is none of those things..it's just a rollicking good time. It's everything that a fun car chase movie should be. The producers of the Fast and Furious franchise should take notes.",Smokey and the Bandit

Burt Reynolds, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed and Sally Fields are perfectly cast for this film. The plot is simple. The Bandit (Reynolds) places a bet with 2 southern millionaires that he can drive from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in 28 hours with a truck full of Coors beer. Seems silly nowadays but beer laws were different in the 70's so you couldn't get Coors on the East Coast. The bandit runs point for trucker Jerry Reed and his blood hound Flash in his iconic Trans-Am. Along the way he picks up runaway bride Sally Field and gets chased by sheriff Buford T Justice (Gleason) and his son ""Junya"". Fields was all set to marry Junya. Of course they make it back with the beer in the nick of time.Gleason steals the movie with his one liners and his ""Hot Pursuit"" of the Bandit. One great scene when his is on his CB with sheriff in Arkansas who happens to be black but Justice is unaware. When he meets him face-to-face he says "" you sounded....uh...taller on the radio""Arkansas Cop ""That's not germane to the situation""
Justice: ""The Germans got nuthin' to do with it!""""Junya, no way you come from my loins.

Not to mention Sally Field and her legs. It's a good little movie that means well, but it just loses its edge after the storage unit of Coors is packed up and heading back to Georgia. I will say I did like the movie back in 1977 until by the time I was 18, it just seemed like another car chase, let's-stick-it-to-the-cops flick.Kids today may see some fun in it, but I still give it 5/10 stars...only because it seems very outdated and with all the recent Fast and Furious craze, this film is just simply another film in the early days of the genre.",Smokey and the Bandit

106,Lockout_Salties,A rip-roarin' good time,8,5 July 2021,"Smokey and the Bandit is the kind of film that everyone can enjoy. It's filled to the brim with memorable lines, great performances, and lots of fun. Perhaps what's most surprising is how well it's aged after almost 45 years: you'd expect a film that old that take place in the South to be covered in Confederate flags and slurs. And while yes, the Bandit does have a small Confederate flag on the front of his car, for the most part the film is very nice to people of color. Plus, said car is nowhere near the level of offensiveness as, say, the General Lee car from Dukes of Hazzard. There are multiple African-American characters that directly help the protagonists and move the plot along, thus not being tokens. There's even an African-American cop! How many movies today have a black cop? The antagonist even acts racist in the film, and it's portrayed as a negative! Granted, ""racism is bad"" is a low bar to jump, but many films from the days of yore struggle to, so it was refreshing to see one that passes pretty well.Of course, the film is not perfect. Most pressingly, the film's treatment of women isn't awful, but it could be much better. And the aforementioned Confederate flag is still a problem and certainly put a dent in my enjoyment of the film. But other than that, Smokey and the Badit is the perfect movie to watch if you're getting friends together and want to have some fun. It has action, romance, criticisms of racism, and lots of laughs. Put it on for a great time.Final Score: 83/100.",Smokey and the Bandit
107,hankhanks12345,I don't get it,3,13 December 2006,"I didn't care for this movie, particularly. It's considered a classic by some, of course, and I've been aware of it for years, but only recently did I get around to seeing it.It seems that about 90% of the film involves car chases, and given the time period I guess they did the best they could. But frankly the races seemed merely like an amped up version of a Dukes of Hazzard episode. I suppose in theory there could be an entertaining movie made of nothing but race scenes, but it doesn't seem to be evident here.The three leads (Reynolds, Field, Gleason) have all been excellent in other roles, and so it's particularly disappointing that they are given a story and dialog which are paper thin. Reynolds could have saved time by merely looking into the camera and saying, ""I'm going to just assume that you think I'm so charming that all I have to do is smile and you'll like my performance."" Gleason, a great comedian, is reduced to playing a cartoon which would have worn thin on a 3 minute SNL skit. And Sally Field's character is barely given a reason for existing at all.I know a lot of people love this movie and will be upset that I said anything against it, and for that I'm sorry. I suppose if you saw this movie for the firs time when you were 10 and got a jolt out of hearing grownups using profanity, then you might enjoy it and have nostalgia for it.

108,TomConnors,Doin what they say can't be done...,10,14 June 2002,"Smokey and the Bandit is one of those films that defines a generation, and along with films like, Jaws, Star Wars, and Superman changed the way we not only went to see films, but the way they were made and marketed.Although when someone talks about the said films, they'd probably leave out Smokey and the Bandit, because the film does date itself, and, although it's not Smokey's fault, hundreds of copies and retreds have ruined this film for anyone who wants to enjoy it's original humor and style.  By now, everyone has been bombarded with the same action, stunts, and gags that made Smokey and the Bandit a ""Blockbuster"", in 1977.Even through the muck of mimics and sequals this films stands alone as the crowning jewel, and should be cherished among the greats.  Sure it's no Citizen Kane, but it's a damn good time, a hell of a rush, and the Jerry Reed soundtrack was the perfect backbeat.  I rate the film a 10, and deservedly so.",Smokey and the Bandit

Justice. Dumb songs, especially ""Westbound and Down"" by Jerry Reed, and the antics on the CB radios are hokey and embarrassing. Burt Reynolds made some very bad choices when it came to making films, and even though this one made him a mint, it was terrible, making him a parody of himself. Reynolds is truly a fine actor, and deserved an Academy Award for his performance in Deliverance. Sally Field, winner of two Academy Awards, gives a portrayal that makes you want to slap her. The only positive thing to come out of this movie is the popularity it gave to the GM produced Firebird.

Its a simple little movie that is a whole lot of fun to watch, In 1977 this movie was second behind Star Wars and it grossed an impressive $126 million and it only cost $4 million to make.The one main problem is when you see it on TV today, the version that they run on every channel is the same badly edited copy that first aired in 1980 on NBC and all the great lines are badly dubbed.For those who don't remember but in the 70s Burt Reynolds was the coolest guy in movies and he ruled the big screen.

116,tatz32000,funny & great acting & Socially Significant Too,10,28 March 2006,"Yup, this is a hilarious comedy...Remember that this was released in the late 1970's, the Carter Presidency, when seemingly everything the Federal Govt did resulted in chaos at best and expansion of the Soviet Empire (Afghanistan) at worst.....in this film, the emphasis of government's silly controls is the inability to have Coors Beer in Eastern states, and especially the Federal 55MPH speed limit...Bandit and Cletus accept the challenge to bring Coors to the rich guys who like it---certainly a victimless crime at worst....and disobey the Federal 55 MPH speed limit in the process. Along the way, all kinds of everyday individual Americans help Bandit & Co. avoid the representative of Big Government--Sheriff Justice. The truckers put Bandit ""in the rockin' chair"" and watch with great delight as the police drive past for just one example....the waitress at the ""choke and puke"" AKA drivein restaurant marshalls her car loving customers to help, for another example...there are many more examples of individual Americans helping another independent American--Bandit--defeat the forces of bureaucratic big government enforcing one of the most hated regs of the time, the 55MPH speed limit (which speed limit was repealed some years later).This film with its subtle and perhaps unintended Libertarian message of individual Americans against the forces of Big Government was the second biggest box office hit of 1977.....I remember sitting in the theatre watching most of the audience members STAND & CHEER for the Bandit...............I haven't seen this spontaneous kind of audience involvement since....of course, I did see the film in California's Orange County, a very politically conservative area, chuckle....(""behind the orange curtain"", we said back then)Then barely three years later, what happened in the 1980 Presidential Election? The candidate--Ronald Reagan--who for 20 years or so had been railing against big government and its reliance on petty bureaucratic regulation, who for 20 years had been talking about the importance of each individual American's rights, who quoted Thomas Jefferson's famous ""That government governs best which governs least"", who said that it was the president and not the American people who were afflicted by ""malaise"", who said that the indomitable spirit of the American people would again make it ""morning in America"" --- overwhelmingly defeated an incumbent President Carter, and won again in 1984 in one of the greatest landslides of all time. It was that same aversion to big government adversely affecting the lives of all Americans that put Ronald Reagan in the White House twice and put ""Smokey and the Bandit"" nearly at the top of the late 70's Box Office hits.And, I submit, you don't have to like Reagan as a President to see the connection here....you may like to drive 55 in an effort to save fuel....but the film, I submit, arguably foreshadowed the massive cultural/political shift that elected President Reagan....Hope I didn't spoil the film for you liberals out there.....regardless what you think of the above, it is still one of the ALL TIME FUNNY FILMS!

I do regard this movie as my favorite of all time. Oscar material? Certainly not. But who cares.The basic premise of the movie is a simple one. The Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and The Snowman (Jerry Reed) are trying to deliver a truckload of bootlegged Coors beer in 38 hours or less for $80,000 (big money back in 1977). All this while trying to shake a bloodhound sheriff (Smokey played by Jackie Gleason) and his bonehead son, Junior. Oh, and during all of this Bandit falls in love with a hitchhiker named Carrie (Sally Field).As much as this is the movie that Burt Reynolds is known for, it's Jackie Gleason that makes this movie for me. His are my favorite lines in the movie. Don't get me wrong, Burt and his ohhh so 70's mustache do a fabulous job of smiling and laughing, but it's Gleason who has me in stitches every time I watch this movie. I received my first copy of this movie somewhere around 1986 (Christmas present). At some point I tried to figure out how many times I have viewed this movie. A conservative guess would be somewhere around 300.It's simple fun, but there is a little bit of magic in this movie that was absent in Smokey And The Bandit II. Both Burt Reynolds and Sally Field claim that the reason the movie worked so well is that you are watching two people fall in love, for real, on film.Aside from the love story and Gleason's portrayal of Bufford T. Justice, the movie has some fantastic and real (not CGI) car chases and stunts. This is a must own for anyone who loves a good car chase.",Smokey and the Bandit
118,tynesider,Burt's 'Gabby Hayes' impression,6,4 April 2012,This is a very entertaining picture despite (or maybe because of) the simple plot. The two stars Burt Reynolds and Sally Field blend well together and they gradually fall for each other on the long trip from Texas to Georgia being pursued by dogged Sheriff Jackie Gleason. I haven't read all the reviews for this film but has anyone else spotted the following: About 69 minutes into the film Burt Reynolds does a George 'Gabby' Hayes impression. Driving along with Sally Fields he twists his face in the manner used by the real Gabby when he was about to speak and says the line 'Are yuh ready Roy?' Sally Field replies 'I was born ready.' This dialogue is probably inspired by Gabby Hayes' appearances in many Roy Rogers pictures.,Smokey and the Bandit
119,stan-czerwien,The Great One saves this movie.,5,24 September 2002,"If not for the great Jackie Gleason and his portrayal of Buford T. Justice, this movie would really stink. The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is its editing. What were they thinking in the cutting room on this one? Continuity errors are so incredibly obvious that some of my kids were even able to pick out discrepancies. Doors are open, then closed, then reopened and knocked off - gun belts are on, then off, then on again - I have to admit, that as the plot wears to a thinner and thinner gruel one starts devoting his attention toward picking off errors within this one. Also - in the latter third of the movie - we are forced to suffer through the always annoying ""CB Radio User/Truck Driver Brotherhood"" effect.
All that being said, Jackie Gleason's portrayal of a Texas sheriff is worth the price of a rental, but even that starts getting a bit old by the time we wrap it up in this one.",Smokey and the Bandit

The characters aren't intended to have any great depth.So why is this a great film? Because it entertains and endures.The Bandit is cocky, can be a jerk and a loser...but he is so likable. Little Enos says that a ""Legend and an out of work bum"" look a lot alike...yet the fact is Bandit's legend is apparently known throughout the South.The Snowman is the perfect compliment to Bandit...he doesn't get the glory, but often carries the load. He doesn't mug for the camera like the Bandit, but has a dry wit that makes you laugh.What more can be said about Buford T. Justice. He steals every scene he is in. His delivery is terrific. There's no doubt that he is a commanding presence as a law enforcement official, yet he seems utterly clueless when dealing with his personal life, including the can't do anything right Junior.Forget saying ""summabit"". It's phrases like, Nice Lady, Let me have a diablo sandwich or ""Too Bad your head wasn't in it"" and ""When I get home, I'm gonna slap your mama, cause there is no way you came from my loins"" that make Buford T memorable. Even the ""you sounded much taller on the radio"" comment makes you laugh at, disdain and feel sorry for Buford T all at once.Sally Field is perfect as Frog. Big and Little Enis have great chemistry. Junior, what can you say.The story, as I said is simple. ""They've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there"". Frog jumping in the car, and the subsequent pursuit by Justice makes it that much more difficult and entertaining.Yes, its one great big car chase.Yes, the youth of today have little to no idea of the CB culture. You can get Coors beer everywhere, and its nothing special. The car stunts aren't that special considering what may be in movies today. Chuck Heston in a chariot wouldn't be anything special anymore either.As it has aged though, it is better to think of it a providing a glimpse of the past rather than merely being 'dated'.This is a movie you can watch over and over and just enjoy. That's what makes it a GREAT film.",Smokey and the Bandit
122,mrtroll2006,Smokey and the Bandit,10,24 June 2006,"I really really love this movie even though it came out 4 years before I was even born. This movie to me symbolizes simple America on top of being funny and exciting.The good ole boys Bandit (Reynolds) and Snow (Reed) must deliver a truckload of beer across several states...Beer...mmm...could there be a more better cause..*drools*...mmmmm beer. Err,never mind on to other things,lol. Carrie ""Frog"" ditches a wedding to the ever so dumb junior and who can blame her. Sure he's curer,I suppose to a females perspective,but he doesn't got smarts,charm,manners...so she ditches his ass at the alter,runs in front of the trans am gets picked up and the fun really begins.I cannot really say anything terribly bad about the film,sure it didn't have the greatest plot but the actors and action makes you forget all about the simple plot. Burt Reynolds was awesome and again a females point of view he was gorgeous. Sally Field was always funny. Reed was I have to admit surprisingly good and he sung some classic songs which after being introduced to the film years ago on VHS am a fan of his music.This film is great,a must see.",Smokey and the Bandit

However, it was a wonderful reflection of the time.I fondly remember the CB radio craze of the 70's.  I was very into that. I also enjoy tearing around in fast cars.  (Actually, I had my CB radio installed in a motorcycle, but the idea is the same.)""Smokey and the Bandit"" will stand the test of time, because it is a snapshot of the 70's.  Yes, it is silly and inane, but it wonderfully captures the spirit of that decade.  There's no deep philosophy, here, but it is a glorious romp.  The movie doesn't try to teach us anything about the human condition, but it does seek to entertain.  In that respect, it succeeds very well.Every movie has a goal.  In some cases, the movie tries to enlighten us. However, this movie sought merely to take us away from our mundane lives for a while.  It accomplished that very well indeed.",Smokey and the Bandit

125,asteffen,Bubble Gum Then And Now,7,28 September 2018,"Watched it when it came out and it was entertaining but basal and watched it again today and it didn't get any better but I learned something. To me movies in this day and age lack a certain recklessness. They are more manufactured and like clones. Smokey and The Bandit, for all of its shortcomings, was a snapshot in time. It captured the FU against the system, and the reborn innocence just after Vietnam, when everyone wanted a release. And hey, let's face it, who wouldn't want a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am like we saw in the movie. Even if it was an automatic. I'm a big fan of Burt Reynolds because he was a bad ass, self deprecating and did most of his own stunts, at great personal cost. And he had genuine comedic timing, which is very rare for a guy so attractive. So while this movie could be considered formlulamatic for the period, 40 years later it has stood the test of time. It's Burt. It's the 70's. It's Sally and the Trans Am. And it's part of our heritage, like it or not.",Smokey and the Bandit
126,AleaClint,The way movies should be made today,9,10 September 2009,"I'll never forget the first time I watched the tail end of the movie and I actually quite liked it, then a couple of months later I taped it on the KSTW channel (cable station is located in Tacoma, WA) and they got rid of that channel sometime around 1994 or 95 which was kind of unfortunate cause I grew up on that channel and that channel will always take me back to the golden days of my childhood. The movie begins as the Bandit (Burt Reynolds) takes a $80,000 bet to see whether he can haul off about 600 cases of beer from Texarkana, Texas to somewhere in Georgia within' 18 hours and he brings his buddy Cledus (Jerry Reed) to drive the semi truck so he can haul off the beer while the cops (better known as the Smokey's) can concentrate on just the Bandit and the Bandit buys a brand new Trans Am, then he meets up with a runaway bride (Sally Field) and Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) is on their tail cause she ditch Buford's dimwitted son Junior and boy wouldn't it be funny if every cop was as dumb as Junior? There are some other great moments throughout the film like Buford driving through a pole and the top of the car comes on, or when the police cars collided into each other and a trucker crashes into the open door of Buford's car and he gets all angry, if you like high speed chase movies or fast cars then you'll like Smokey and the Bandit, I wouldn't recommend watching the sequels unless if you really enjoyed watching this movie and they don't come close to how good this movie is although I do kind of like watching Smokey and the Bandit 3, if you're on a budget then I would get the Smokey and the Bandit pursuit pack which generally costs around $17-$20 and it's less expensive than buying Smokey and the Bandit 1 and 2 separately.",Smokey and the Bandit

I agree with the reviewer that the black and gold Trans Am is a really neat looking car. There's something about the black, with the gold snowflake rims, it just looks neat. I hope to show this movie to a son someday. It is also a lot more wholesome than today's movies. It is because of movies like this that I am a volunteer police officer. Burt Reynolds is a very underrated actor. He was the only person who could play the ""Bandit."" Some reviewer on here said the police cars were either Pontiac Trans Ams or Plymouth Furys. About the former, they were clearly not Trans Ams. I think he meant that they were Grand Ams.

134,PWS,A film with many great lines and just plain fun!,10,13 February 2001,"If you had the pleasure of seeing this film in 1977, chances are you appreciate it three times greater than today's young moviegoers. The plot is simple and not understood by many today as Coor's beer is available everywhere. But when it was not legal east of the Mississippi, everyone wanted it to the east. The characters were perfect. The one-liners came so fast and consistent. You couldn't wait for another especially from Gleason. The car, rare for the era, brought much attention and Trans Am sales boomed after the opening debut and after the 1st TV debut. By 1980, the TA was as common to see as a Ford Escort. It was a beautiful car from 1974-1977 and HP up the wazoo compared to today's. The CB era was in full swing and only added to the mix of cars, stars and stunts. The famous bridge jump in Riverdale, Georgia was, and has stood as the longest movie car bridge jump. Needless to say, one of the 3 other TA's used in the movie was used after that. Some of those Georgia State Patrol cruisers were not props. The studio used real GSP cruisers to wreck, buying new of course to replace. Well worth a watch or two and definitely many laughs. DO NOT bother to even glance at either of the 2 sequels, as it will only take away from the value of this original.",Smokey and the Bandit
135,Shel-7,The first movie of the '80's,9,6 March 1999,"Okay, it's 1977: post-Watergate, post-Vietnam, yet another ""energy crisis"" is on and that doesn't include the dope in the White House.  Inflation is having its way with us and our ""leaders"" are telling us it's our fault. America has lived with the 55 mph National Speed limit for 5 years now and is sick of it.  Our cars are bloated, under-powered (thanks to emission controls), unreliable nanny-state mobiles that won't start until you put your seatbelt on.  America needed a hero and Ronald Reagan was three years away.  We found it in Burt Reynolds and his black Trans Am.  Flaunting authority by bringing non-union made beer out of the West, driving oh so much over 55, and having fun while doing it.  Why, they don't even wear seatbelts!  Buford T. Justice represented the over-bearing, over-stuffed, and corrupt authority doggedly pursuing that he can not cage: the will to be free!  This movie was the first movie of the '80's: fun for fun sake and, as the Bandit said, ""mostly for the money.""  The best line in the movie: Sally Fields apparently unscripted ""I'm stuck in this CB movie and I don't even have a handle.""  This is the funniest movie to come out of a very un-fun time.  Now if they were smuggling cigarettes it would be the perfect '90's film.",Smokey and the Bandit
136,boure1952,A whole lot of fun,8,13 April 2017,"Anyone who doesn't get a kick out of this movie probably needs help. It's Burt Reynolds at his best - playing Burt Reynolds. It's Jackie Gleason. It's 1970s - CB radios, truckers, and a black Trans Am. It's fun, not at all serious.The Bandit (Burt) runs interference for Cletus Snow's (Jerry Reed) 18-wheeler who - on a bet with Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and his sidekick son Little Enos (Paul Williams) - go from Georgia to Texas to pick up 400 cases of Coors, which at the time wasn't sold in the east and was therefore illegal, and bring it back in record time. They get to Texas and get the beer, and on the way back the fun begins. Bandit is stopped in the road by a runaway bride (Sally Field) who gets in the Trans Am and she and the Bandit are then pursued - hot pursuit - by Smokey (CB radio slang for cop), Sheriff Buford T. Justice (the one and only Jackie Gleason), and his dimwit son, Junior (Mike Henry), who is the groom left at the altar. The Bandit, with the runaway bride, and Cletus have many adventures on the return trip, escaping the sheriff and Junior who are in hot pursuit all the way to Georgia in an incrementally damaged patrol car.I am confident that this movie got little critical acclaim and that it probably won no awards because it simply cannot be taken seriously.The editors who censored the movie for TV did a horrible job. Make sure you see the unedited version.",Smokey and the Bandit
137,radioannouncer,A Classic!,10,25 July 2006,"Smokey and the Bandit...an excellent Southern romp...The film introduces you to the truck-driving legend ""Bandit"", who is challenged to bring beer from Texas to Georgia. Obviously the Burdettes have more money than sense, seeing as the local convenience store is down the road to satisfy their beer needs, and they can save $80,000 in the process - but their excess gives us a unique plot and situations that could only happen on the roads of the South!Along for the ride is Jerry Reed's character Cledus Snow, ""The Snowman"" who is the reluctant running-buddy of Bandit on this beer-run. Cledus is the common sense of the two-man crew, sometimes offering that reality-check moment to the otherwise impulsive ""Bandit"".Sally Field plays ""Frog""...she gives the beauty to the film, also a middle-finger for posterity during a interstate chase, and a nice bent-over shot in the Trans-Am. (Thank you, Hal Needham) The ""Smokey"" in the title belongs to Jackie Gleason, who added the humor in the film...with some of the greatest lines ever delivered! See the movie once and you'll never say ""Son of a B*tch"" the same way thereafter...Pick up a DVD copy today, and theatrical-aspect really keeps your attention and will present itself better than the 100-or-so times that you saw it on the small screen. Also, the edited-for-TV versions never did the original justice.",Smokey and the Bandit
138,BradElvis,One of the great feel-good movies of the 1970s,7,1 May 2009,"Former Hollywood stuntman Hal Needham makes his directorial debut with ""Smokey and the Bandit"", a movie that almost makes you want to jump in a time machine and relive 1970s Americana all over again.Needham not only directed but wrote the screenplay for this flick about a well renown diesel truck driver named Bo Darville, played by Burt Reynolds. Bo, or as he is better known by his CB radio handle, ""Bandit"", accepts a bet that he can make a delivery of Coors beer, traveling from Atlanta, Georgia to Texarkana, Texas and back, all in twenty-eight hours or less. Apparently, distributing the Coors brew east of the Texas state line is considered illegal.The Bandit enlists the help of his truck-driving buddy, Cledus Snow (A.K.A. the ""Snowman""). The Snowman (played so energetically by Jerry Reed) is to drive Bandit's eighteen-wheeler while the Bandit tags along in a black Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. The Bandit will use his sleek and nimble Trans Am as a ""blocker"", distracting the numerous highway patrolmen (or ""smokeys"") along the route so Snowman can slip through any speed traps or checkpoints that might jeopardize the timely delivery of Coors.This setup makes for plenty of inevitable car chases along the way, with Bandit demonstrating his driving prowess behind the wheel, all the while leaving the smokeys behind in clouds of dust.As Bandit and Snowman are returning to Atlanta with their beer shipment, Bandit picks up a hitchhiker named Carrie (Sally Field), a young, pretty bride on the run who, at the last minute, got cold feet at her wedding ceremony. Carrie is being pursued by Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), whose dimwitted son was the very groom left standing at the alter by Carrie. Now, Bandit has two objectives: ensure Snowman and the cargo of beer make it safely to Atlanta, and escape the wrath of the pot-bellied redneck Sheriff Justice.There's really some outstanding performances to be had here. Jackie Gleason practically steals the show as the southern lawman vowing with his last breath to track down his man. Mr. Gleason plays Sheriff Justice with a comic genius right down to the southern drawl and demeanor that totally befits the part. Jerry Reed is also a joy to watch with his good ol' country boy personality, always coming up with a quip. Reed also provides a few tunes for the soundtrack, most notably ""East Bound and Down"", a hit record on the country charts in 1977. Burt Reynolds plays Bandit with a likable charm, flashing his mischievous smile for all the ladies to swoon at.""Smokey and the Bandit"" really serves as a great example of 1970s life in America. That undeniable carefree ""freedom"" feeling abounds on the screen here. Unlike other films, you don't have to get so wrapped up in the plot. Just sit back and watch the fun that everybody's having. The great mix of comedy and action helped to propel this film to be one of the top grossing blockbusters of 1977.You'll also find plenty of 70s fads demonstrated here, most notably the never-ending CB radio lingo that truckers use to converse with over the air. There's also the big hair-dos, the polyester shirts and the bell bottom pants. The folks at General Motors had to have been pleased with the movie's success, as sales of Trans Ams in the company's Pontiac division skyrocketed after getting favorable exposure in the film.If you should ever get a chance to see ""Smokey and the Bandit"", try to view the original unedited print, now available on DVD. The version released for TV broadcast is heavily edited for content, most notably dubbing over Jackie Gleason's continuous cursing and swearing in the Sheriff Justice character. The dialog just doesn't have the same impact when watered down to a ""G"" rating.",Smokey and the Bandit
139,huntersrestkid1,"""Hold onto yo ass, Fred"", cause Smokey and the Bandit is a wild ride!",10,16 December 2009,"I saw this movie when I was 8, now I'm 15. that isn't a big gap compared to some people that grew up around the time of Smokey and the Bandit in the 70s, but I am probably the movies biggest fan and loved every minute of it. Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed are awesome and there was a lot of great acting. Putting all the southern good old boy personalities into these characters were great. Here goes the plot: Two truckers, Bandit Darville (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus ""Snowman"" Snow (Jerry Reed) go on the craziest haul yet when two rich hotshots Big and Little Enos Burdette bet Bandit $80,000 that he can't run up to Texarkana Texas from Atlanta Georgia and back in 28 hours. Bandit can't pass up this good of a bet, it's too much money to pass up....""for the money, for the glory, and for the fun; but mostly for the money"". Hauling beer East of Texas out of state is completely illegal and is called ""bootlegging"", and not tolerated by the law enforcement. Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) is one of those officers out to get the Bandit. The only thing I never understood is that Buford never noticed that Bandit and Snowman were hauling beer, but in fact, Buford was chasing Bandit for speeding (I can understand that), and for ""kidnapping"" the bride that was supposed to marry Bufords completely dumb son Junior (Mike Henry). In reality, Carrie (Sally Fields), the bride, just wanted a lift from the Bandit. IT is a hilarious film and Jackie Gleasons performance being added just makes it all so much better. This film made the 70s, it was practically what that era was turning into. It was the era of the CB radio, and Smokey and the Bandit definitely defined the CB radio as cool. Great work Universal, you created a masterpiece for all truckers; a 'truckers heaven' if you will.I recommend this film times 100 to anyone who likes trucks, cars, comedy, CB radios, good actors, good acting, rocking music (East Bound and Down was a big hit, or someone in need of just a good laugh.",Smokey and the Bandit

146,blue_baron,That's a Big 10-4 Boyeeee,6,9 November 2005,"Well, every now and then comes a film like this. In fact it's something pretty rare nowadays sadly with all the soul-less big salaries special-effect ridden badly-acted Hollywood productions. But back in the 70's (and previously) movie making was made more as a love-child project than a way to make millions. Now bare in mind that this is no ""Casablanca"" or ""Godfather"" and maybe movie-critics will shun upon it seeing it solely as a dumb redneck flick. Personally though, not being a good ol' boy myself by any length I can say that this is one of the best and funniest movie I ever saw.What ""Smokey & The Bandit"" achieves is to give you a 2 hour of pure stupid fun that only makes you want to grab an old muscle car and jump over a bridge yelling ""YEEE-HAWWW"". In the same sort of fashion as the Dukes of Hazzard did on TV, this is an American classic of the days when life was simple and care-free. When you could sit in a car with your legs up on the dashboard without any safety-belt or air bags keeping you secure. In a time where CBs were the craze and everyone could just grab the mike and say things like ""lay it on me loud and clear, I'll catch you on the flip side coz it's a big 10-4 son"". Basically, this movie puts you back in that historically important era of the happy-go-lucky freedom America. A time now long gone.Burt Reynolds (with a mustache and a cowboy hat) is simply amazing playing the classical American-hero-who-gets-the-girl-at-the-end. Jerry Reed makes a surprisingly great performance as his trucking partner carrying the load of Coors beer in his Mack Truck. Sally Field does an O.K. job as the runaway bride who tags along and the ugly dog is a great addition to the team. As for the ""opponent"", Jackie Gleason makes perhaps the BEST representation of an idiot redneck southern sheriff with the dumb accent and everything. In fact, pretty much every character in this movie are caricatures of the good ol' south, and from a Canadian perspective it's always funny to laugh at this. ;p Bottom-line, if you want a no-brainer car chase movie about bootleggers trying to bring a truck-load of beers across the southern states chased by a bunch of dumb highway cops, this is the movie for you. I'd highly recommend grabbing a few beers yourself to watch it to complete fulfillment.Oh yeah, and the bluegrass music is great too!

The Fiat is hot too! and the man chasing the stairs in the mountain is very exiting and fun..But its almost too good to see the old house on Eidheim,on the Berknes in Volda Burn! BURN I TELL YA!",Smokey and the Bandit
153,james-vass,The ultimate cowboy/trucker movie,9,15 June 2005,"Worthy of adding to your personal collection. Burt Reynolds plays the part of the Bandit, a heart-throb for all white-trash trailer dwelling women, to a tee. Jackie Gleason does an impeccable job of bringing to life the role of the backwards southern sheriff, one of the finest performances of his great career. The soundtrack was an instant classic, combining folk, bluegrass and country, and leaving the viewer with an urge to recite the lyrics for days after. A must see for all serious movie watchers. Sally Field portrays a talented dancer who bails out on a marriage to the son of the stereotypical ""southern"" sheriff. The sheriff takes this as a personal insult and a dishonor to his authority. He then treks across the south in ""hot pursuit"" of the runaway bride and along the way encounters his arch-nemesis, The Bandit, resulting in non-stop laughs throughout the movie. This film combines sexuality (two of the hottest stars of the '70s and '80s), laughter (Jackie Gleason, need I say more), and a great feel-good script. I almost forgot this movie's greatest contribution to humanity, the introduction of a natural star, Fred the dog.",Smokey and the Bandit

157,The Boss-5,The most American of films,10,14 February 1999,"This movie is so blatant and good humored about its own ridiculousness that one cannot help liking it.  Burt Reynolds was still young enough to be believable as the Bandit, and Sally Fields was, of course, adorable.  The one thing that really stands out is the sheer Americanness of the movie, it took America to make road trips cool in the first place, and add to that a good natured rebel, and a mission to smuggle a load of Coors beer (in the 70's not allowed in the East), and what's not to love?",Smokey and the Bandit

Beyond the cool factor of the car, in my opinion possibly the coolest car ever, and Burt Reynolds as the Bandit Buford T. Justice is amazing. The fact that anyone could not like this movie is simply insane to me. There is so many lines many people to this day I hear say, and everyone laughs. Burt Reynolds is forever the Bandit, and Gleason to me will always be Smokey lol. But seriously the movies is light hearted and funny. It's not t be taken seriously, and that's why it's a classic, and to me an all time top 10 comedy movie.",Smokey and the Bandit

I also used to drive 18 wheelers in my previous life and this movie and the actors / actresses show nicely how it plays on road ( mostly ). So - not a great movie art but fun if you take it that way. Also already said but CB's can be useful, todays rigs have cell phones, satellite phones, GPS, etc.. but at that time it was who you know and know where you are. Sally Fields is always a delight, Burt Reynolds, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, etc.. very fun acting. This movie has some old fashioned touch that is missing from too many ( assumed fun ) action movies today - also the effects are not as bad as in many todays movies, tire noise on gravel doesn't sound like tires on asphalt, stunts don't look like computer simulations and so on.

Everyone were in their role in exactly the right way they should be. I found a lot of original humor, like when Sheriff Justice loose the roof of his patrol car and his son must hold the hat for him while he drives.Although it's a bit unrealistic, it's still a good movie because producers have a good sense for humor. It's a 1977 film which requires you to get back in time a little bit to get everything right.If you like cars, chasing and good laugh, this is a good choice.",Smokey and the Bandit
169,jurai-emperor,A fast paced good time...,9,11 January 2020,"I was 9 years old when this movie hit theaters, the same year as Star Wars. I must say it made little impact on me whereas Star Wars and later sci-fi movies became a way of life. Now, being older and watching classic films back into the 30's and modern films as well, I happened upon Smokey and the Bandit on STARZ. I have to admit, this film is fun. It's a great glimpse into the '70's and CB Radio culture and Burt Reynolds and Sally Fields were at their best. I'm not a country music fan and I even enjoyed it. There are plenty of terrible movies in this genre, perhaps even it's own sequels, but the OG Smokey and the Bandit is a good humored, fast moving good time. A guilty pleasure. I grew up in Texarkana, Texas until shortly after this movie came out and, aside from the Texas side of town being an alcohol ""dry"" area, I have no complaints about this fun movie.",Smokey and the Bandit

It is one of the first movies I can remember seeing at the drive-in theater while I was a small child. By the time I was 8 or 9 years old I could recite you the movie word for word. It is a virtual cornucopia of smashed cars and big rigs. Maybe part of the reason I love it so is it was filmed right here within a 30 mile radius of where I live. Or maybe it is because I have messed around with big rigs for about the last 12 years. Whatever the reason, it is a great movie in my opinion. If you have never seen Smokey and the Bandit, then I say you must not be an American. Go get it today and watch it!",Smokey and the Bandit
172,hostak1026,Every Boyhood dream,10,16 January 2005,Smokey and the Bandit is every man's dream. To mess around with the law and get away with it! The vehicle of choice for the movie had to be something flashy to capture a young man's eye to purchase such as in the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious where the vehicle of choice in that particular movie was a Mistubishi Lancer Evolution 8. Over all I thought the movie was better than excellent for it's time. It also gave the public something to laugh about. As for the 2nd movie it should have been a continuation of the first movie where The three of them were seen heading up to New England to get the Clam Chowder. Over all I absolutely loved it!,Smokey and the Bandit

174,grantsfalcon,Smokey and the Bandit,10,8 March 2021,"Through the years Hollywood has produced its fair share of outlandish car movies, from ""Bullitt"" starring Steve McQueen, ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" starring Parnelli Jones, and of course the unfortunate ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise starring 'who cares.' ""Smokey and the Bandit"" stands alone as a testament to the ultimate car guy movie. It possesses several key elements that draw the audience in and holds our attention until the end. First off it features a cool car, secondly the writers created truly one-of-a-kind characters, and finally, what car movie is complete without a good old fashioned car chase.
The car is a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am T/A 6.6 Liter with jet black paint, gold trim and a big ""screaming eagle' decal right on the hood. The car also sports T-Tops for a million miles of headroom and ambient wind to blow any 1970's mullet around. Director Hal Needham went back and forth on a few ideas for the Bandit's car. ""Once he saw the 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, his mind was made up. He saw the car in an advertisement and knew he had to have it for his movie. He felt so strongly about the car that he often referred to it as one of the movie's star characters"" (Bryant Motors). Burt Reynolds is seen tearing the tires off of the car (well perceivably) throughout the whole movie. The fact is that these cars really didn't have that much performance as this movie is from the late 70's and no car manufacturers were producing the fire breathing V8 muscles cars like they were back in the 60's. But that doesn't stop certain people from loving this car and its iconic piece of automotive history.
There are some amazing characters in this film. The main star is none other than the late Burt Reynolds, who plays a man named Bandit, a southern truck driver, daredevil, and semi-outlaw. He is viewed as a man of great mystery and wonderment, and everyone seems to know the legend of the Bandit. Critic Priscilla Page from Hagerty media describes this character as such... ""Bandit was mythic, a folk tale legend, yet he also felt familiar, like someone you knew, like a pal or a brother. Like so many of Burt Reynolds's characters in the 1970s, Bandit made the south a kinder, freer, friendlier place"" (Page, Hagerty Media). Sally Fields plays the female lead of Carrie, a woman on the run from her wedding. At the last minute she realizes that she did not want to marry the ""man of her dreams,"" who happens to be the son of the local Sheriff. She plays a fiery girl that happens to get involved with Bandit as he is running from the law. Last but most definitely not least, there is Jackie Gleason, who portrays Sheriff Buford T Justice of Texas! Without a doubt he is the most entertaining character in the film. He is in ""hot pursuit"" of Bandit through the movie and has so many hilarious lines in the film. His character gives the movie some well deserved comedic relief, as well as relating the character to a crazy relative that we surely all know.
Buford T. Justice: (driving through wind) Hold my hat for me!
[Junior, his son, obliges, but loses his own hat in the process]
Junior: My hat blew off Daddy.
Buford T Justice: I hope your goddamn head was in it.
The entire movie is basically one massive car chase, so it without a doubt has the viewers' attention as far as the excitement and danger aspect is concerned. There are multiple small car chases where the Bandit quickly evades cops from Georgia to Texas in the first half of the movie, but on his trip from Texas back to Georgia it is a whole different deal altogether. He has a run-in with the Sheriff who pursues him for the remainder of the film. Evading roadblocks and close calls, even jumping over an old dismantled bridge, the Bandit is just too good at evading the old ""County Mounty.""
This film will forever continue to be a classic and will always hold a special spot in someone's ""VHS tapes to save,"" even though nobody has a VHS player anymore. The famous car and ones like it are very sought after today and have skyrocketed in price dramatically in the past couple of years since Burt Reynolds passed away back in 2018, but we will always remember his legacy through this amazing movie.",Smokey and the Bandit

I remember seeing the movie as a kid but when I saw it again when i was older I liked it a whole lot. I wish I could outrun the police and bang fine hoes like in the movie. Its one of my favorite movies and it always will be. In part two he doesn't burn out as much and he doesn'1 pull any more hoes but its good. Part 3 is OK but not the real Smokey and the Bandit.

Burt Reynolds is my idol, the best actor since along time and cant wait to see his roll in the dukes of HAzzard hes a driving legend.

177,DaveKearney1989,Guilty Pleasures,8,13 October 2015,"I remember first watching this movie as a kid with my father. What's not to love? Action, comedy, and romance. Best of all, fast cars. I had never really seen the appeal of Burt Reynolds until I recently re-watched this film recently. I can definitely see why people loved him. It definitely is one of my biggest guilty pleasures.Gleason's portrayal of Sheriff Bufford T. Justice is brilliant. He has some of the best lines in the whole movie. Sally Fields makes a great run away bride. I love it when a movie comes together with a great comedy and doesn't take themselves too serious. A great guilty pleasure in life. Don't miss it.",Smokey and the Bandit
178,steelcurtain-39988,Complete Lack of for the law,10,4 December 2015,"In the very beginning of Smokey and the Bandit, Sheriff Buford T. Justice makes it clear what the problem is: ""What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law!"" The main character in the movie goes by the name Bandit (Burt Reynolds), he is the one Sheriff Buford T. Justice is referring to about the lack of respect for the law. Many would argue that is what makes a good cop chase, but in this case Bandit never gets caught or punished for anything he does. Which is a problem because the whole movie consists of him breaking the law. Bandit is a very prideful person and is very well known in the south. It is clear that the fame has gone straight to his head. He even says in the movie that ""showing off"" is what he does best. At first Bandit is a little too cocky for some to like, but as the movie progresses Bandit slowly finds himself and realizes that everything isn't about him. Buford is presented in an authoritative position from the beginning of the movie. As we are introduced to Buford there is music being played that almost makes you scared to be on his bad side. He constantly gets frustrated with his son, Junior, and always makes him feel like an idiot. Buford also consistently tries to talk to Bandit on his CB radio. When asked by Bandit where he is, Buford replies ""My handle's Smokey Bear and I'm tail grabbing your ass right now!"" What Sheriff Buford T. Justice doesn't know is Bandit and his friend, Cledus (Jerry Reed), are attempting to transport a truckload of Coors beer from Texarkana, Texas to Atlanta, Georgia in under 28 hours. It was thought impossible to do this trip in 28 hours so as you can guess, they had to go pretty fast. While Sheriff Buford T. Justice is chasing Bandit he fails to notice Cledus in the semi- truck right behind him. The reason Bandit is in a fast car (a 1977 Pontiac Trans-am) is to keep the cops, or as they call them ""Smokey's"", away from the truckload of beer. Throughout the movie Bandit averages a speed of over 100 miles per hour. Somehow Sheriff Buford T. Justice always catches up to him, despite having a car that realistically would never keep up with Bandit's Trans-am. As this cross country police chase continues, Sheriff Buford T. Justice picks up some unwanted help along the way from other police officers in the areas he travels through. While the other police officers' crash or can't keep up with Bandit, Sheriff Buford T. Justice never loses sight of his trail. Bandit is a living legend and he gets help along the way from locals. Some of the locals even trash a few cop cars and never get in trouble and once again ""we are dealing with a complete lack of respect for the law!"" This only emphasizes how much the producers of the movie want the audience to like Bandit. All of the police officers in this movie seem to hurt each other more than help each other, but that is what makes for some of the comedy in this film. Even though Bandit never gets caught and gets away with everything it wouldn't be a movie worth watching if there wasn't stupid cops or if the cops caught him in the beginning and arrested him. This is a very good movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants a good laugh, but to solve the problem of the ""complete lack of respect for the law!"" and getting away with it, there should be some sort of resolution in the end that could lead into the sequel.",Smokey and the Bandit
179,ffcreagh,Classic movie and always worth a watch,9,13 April 2017,"Smokey and the Bandit is and always will be a classic movie that deserves to be held in high regard. The movies' lack of conventional movie components is what keeps this wonderful film from falling into the same banal cycle that every action film tends to do. For those who generally do not enjoy the film, its mainly do to the fact that they crave unrealistic action, and a hard line, drawn out, easy to follow plot, like the Fast and Furious films. Smokey and the Bandit tackles race barriers, disobedience of the law, and sexual misconduct in a manner that keeps viewers from changing the channel. Movies like Smokey and the Bandit are not successful because they are ""overhyped"" and do not become a classic just because it did well in box office sales in 1977. The film is great because it dared to be different. The rebellious protagonist of the film, Burt Reynolds A.K.A the bandit, was always a step ahead of ""the Smokey's"" and rightfully so, for it only added to and developed his character as the baddest cowboy om the road.

Many people forget that this was the 2nd biggest movie of '77 after star wars. It also has something else newer car movies don't have anymore actor's actually driving the car for real not behind some green screen, who can forget the part where they fly onto the football field or the car chase near the end which i think is sheer automotive pornography, and sally field in those skin tight pants.This movie deserves its place as the number one car movie of all time period.",Smokey and the Bandit
