0,TheLittleSongbird,"Miraculous true story, not so miraculous, albeit still very impressive, film",7,7 October 2017,"The story of Chelsey ""Sully"" Sullenberger landing a passenger plane in the Hudson River on 15th January 2009 is one that fascinates and inspires, it's a remarkable story and makes one show a lot of respect for a man rightly regarded as a hero.'Sully' may not be a high point of either director Clint Eastwood or star Tom Hanks's careers (both having very highly regarded careers with great films and performances), it didn't blow me away and may have been better as a documentary. It is nonetheless very impressively done and on the most part is still a good film, with a lot of great elements as well as a few not so convincing ones, and its honesty and understatement are to be admired. It takes a remarkable story and mostly does do it justice, though it is not hard to see why not everybody will like it.As well done the understated mood is, occasionally 'Sully' feels a little too muted even for what it's trying to portray. Other than the air, landing and rescue scenes, which are riveting and nail-biting, it does lack tension and some scenes are more compelling than others (the aforementioned air, landing and rescue scenes, Hanks in the bar and Hanks and Eckhart together for instances are more involving than any scene with the NTSB and Sully's wife).Laura Linney does very well as Lorraine and handles the character with dignity and empathy, but the role is thankless and underwritten, on top of that her screen time is pretty limited, Linney deserves better than this. More of a problem was the stock villain portrayal of the NTSB, far too extreme and very heavy-handed. The ending does satisfy for all that roots for Sully at the start, though the outcome was very much foreseeable for anybody familiar with the story and compared to the more sombre understated feel of the rest of the film it felt somewhat pat.Production values however are high. It is beautifully photographed with good use of locations and above average effects. The recreation scenes don't look too cheap either. Eastwood's direction is intelligent and admirably restrained. The music score is not the most unforgettable of ones, but it is still very well suited to the film's tone and wisely doesn't go over the top or feel anaemic.It's a very thoughtfully written film too and treats its audience and subject matter with sensitivity and respect. The subtle dry humour from Eckhart's character is well judged and not misplaced as it could easily have been. The story is not a tense or exciting one, but it's dealt with honesty and deep humanity with some inspiring and powerful moments.Hanks gives a master-class in grace, dignity and subtlety, holding everything together with great composure and telling a lot even with just his eyes. One really believes how much of an emotional toll being hailed as a hero but also being investigated has on Sully. Eckhart is sympathetic and provides some never overdone or too frequent dry humour that leavens things up. Linney does much with little and the rest of the cast do very well.Overall, very impressive if not miraculous. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Sully
1,Leofwine_draca,Rather average,5,31 January 2019,"The story of the pilot who successfully landed his damaged passenger plane into the Hudson river in New York, saving the lives of every person on board, is a great one. It's made good books and good documentaries, I'm sure. As for a feature film, I'm still not convinced, having just watched SULLY. This is a Clint Eastwood movie in which Eastwood seems on autopilot and largely disinterested in the material; there's none of the heart of LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA here. Tom Hanks does his usual nice-serious-authoritative role as the hero of the hour, making the best of it as only he can; the film's fragmented narrative doesn't work all that well, and the use of dream sequences and the like is a bit of a cheat. There's also some surprisingly sloppy CGI work that had me feeling like I was watching an Asylum film at times.",Sully
2,SnoopyStyle,Hanks is Sully,7,21 July 2017,"It's a cold morning on Jan 15, 2009. Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his first officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) survive bird strikes and the lost of both engines to safely land the US Airways Flight 1549 in the middle of the Hudson River. All 155 aboard are rescued. Despite being almost universally herald as a hero, the NTSB investigation starts raising questions and Sully is haunted by the incident.Hanks is Sully. He embodies the easy natural goodness the role entails. The recreation of the incident is compelling. Eastwood should be more careful about doing the incident twice. The second time needs to be sufficiently different from the first. Then there is the clunky NTSB villainy. The flawed computer simulations need to be expanded. Otherwise, it's hard to buy the dangers to Sully. I wonder if a straight docu-style recreation would be more compelling.",Sully
3,Hitchcoc,Somewhat Inaccurate but Captivating,8,16 September 2016,"It's not easy to present recent history in film. The rescue of 155 souls in an airplane who were diverted to the Hudson River is still in our memories (I remember them standing on the wings). Tom Hanks does a cool, underplayed version of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who will live in the annals of heroism for as long as we talk about heroes. I was wondering how one takes a two minute event and turns it into a bracing film. But they do. By including the events in the investigation of the landing, they are able to keep our attention. Sullenberger's actions came under tight scrutiny because the airline ""lost a plane."" As it turns out, the lead investigator for the NTSB wasn't played quite accurately. Of course, we are in need of a villain, and the geese that flew into the engines wouldn't make good witnesses. I'm used to filmmakers playing a bit fast and loose with events, but let's face it, everyday things don't draw much attention. Hanks is good. The pacing is good. The recreation of the landing is quite apt. A good film.",Sully
4,Prismark10,Sully,5,20 September 2020,"The real life Sully show heroism and professionalism in 2009. He was the airline captain who landed his plane on New York's Hudson river after geese flew into both his engines. All the passengers survived.Bars named a drink after Sully. Grey Goose with a splash of water.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the focus of the movie is on the aftermath. Whether Sully (Tom Hanks) needed to dive into the river or could he had somehow got to an airstrip.There is a solid performance from Tom Hanks as Sully, who suffers from some form of PTSD after the incident.Eastwood's direction is efficient but the story is plodding with a lot of underwritten characters and wasted actors. The clue is the short running time with a threat that had to be manufactured regarding the post crash investigation.It ends up like Microsoft Flight Simulator as you watch certain scenarios as to whether the flight could had made it back to the airport.Aaron Eckhart who plays the co pilot Jeff Skiles keeps things a little lighthearted starting with his moustache.",Sully

Sully is claimed a hero by the press and public; however the official investigation reports that one of the left engines was running at idle and not damaged. And the flight simulator indicates that it would be possible to land at LaGuardia or Teterboro. Sully has to defend himself to the commission; otherwise Sully has to defend his reputation and career showing new evidences of the incident. Will he succeed?""Sully"" is another great film directed by Clint Eastwood with Tom Hanks in the lead role. These two names would be enough to show the quality of this movie. But the story is excellent, based on the biography of Sully and the screenplay keeps the attention of the viewer until the credits. In addition, there are Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney in a support role. In the end, ""Sully"" is a great tribute to the hero of the Hudson River.

6,nogodnomasters,No one dies today,10,2 October 2017,"This is a dramatization of Flight 1549 US Air on January 15, 2009 when Captain Chesley Sullenberger successfully landed the plane in the Hudson River. The film opens after the incident as the NTSB conducts an investigation, which was more like the blame game. The crash is told as a flashback, and in case you missed the first viewing, they repeat it.It is a powerful story when no one on the plane reaches their destination and are over joyed, thanking the pilot. The film showed the professionalism of the crew, the passengers, and New York city's response team (maybe even a few Jersey folk) to the incident to save everyone on board. Sullenberger had to prove the computers wrong. What the film glosses over was Sullenberger's efforts to challenge the current system, requiring more flight hours, more simulation, and training of new pilots which he considered substandard.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Sully
7,kosmasp,Sully my name,8,15 May 2017,"I remember when I listened to the news of this hero pilot, who made a really tough landing on water. That might be putting it lightly of course. Then again, there were people who said he took too big a risk and could've gone to an airport instead. Did he do something wrong? Computer simulations seemed to indicate there was another solution, a much safer one for everyone involved.And that is what this movie is about. It's a human story, about someone who though he did the right thing. But suddenly has doubts. You can't really compare this to the movie Denzel Washington did (which was also very powerful, one could argue even more powerful overall). These are different characters and different situations overall. If you like Drama and suspense combined you could do much worse ...",Sully
8,classicsoncall,"""Thank you Captain, thank you, thank you"".",9,17 September 2016,"One of the picture's most valuable contributions to the saga of the 'Miracle on the Hudson' is that the event was not a plane crash, but a successful forced water landing. Captain Chesley Sullenburger (Tom Hanks) appropriately called for that distinction more than once during his insightful soul searching and more significantly, in front of the NTSB review board. That's where the real drama took place, separate and apart from the tense moments on board the ill fated United Airways Flight 1549.Anyone who recalls watching the drama of the real life event back in 2009 will certainly describe Captain Sully a hero, even if he was rather self consciously proclaiming that he was just doing his job. What virtually no one is aware of was the intense pressure he and his co-pilot Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were subjected to, in order to convince the review board that dealing with human lives in a life or death situation can't conceivably be relived using computer simulations. That's one of the main gripes I've always had when it comes to corporate 'logic' and defending principles before a committee that never walked the walk but expect others to be in lock step with expected behavior based on a computer model.As always, Tom Hanks performs at a professional best level as Captain Sully, effectively portraying the real captain's physical presence and demeanor. It was gratifying to see that director Eastwood paid tribute to the real life hero by including a clip at the end of the picture with some of the passengers who successfully came through the ordeal. One note of caution to prospective viewers regarding Sully's nightmarish visions while reliving the tragedy in his own mind - the scenes are poignantly similar to footage resembling the events of 9/11 and have the same kind of harrowing impact.",Sully
9,lee_eisenberg,never forget the human factor (uh oh: Steve Mnuchin participated),8,16 July 2017,"On 15 January 2009, something never before achieved in aviation occurred. A pilot landed his plane on the Hudson River after a flock of geese struck the plane, causing it to lose engine power. The pilot, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger - called Sully for short - earned ample praise for his landing of US Airways Flight 1549 and saving all the crew and passengers. But the story had only just begun.Clint Eastwood's ""Sully"" looks not only at the landing, but at the investigation. The NTSB thought that Sully hadn't done what he should have and held several hearings about it. But Sully knew something that they didn't.Admittedly, the audience knows what the outcome is, so it's not that suspenseful. But even so, the movie reminds us that the human factor is one of the most important things in any decision. Tom Hanks does his usual outstanding job as the pilot whose sudden celebrity risks getting overshadowed by the investigation. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as the co-pilot, and Mike O'Malley (Burt on ""Glee"") as one of the investigators. I thought that Laura Linney as Sully's wife didn't get enough screen time. It would've been interesting to see how the event affected their relationship.Anyway, it's not a masterpiece - not Eastwood's best by any stretch - but I still recommend it. I guess that a slight downside is that Steve Mnuchin was involved in the production (I guess that he invested in it).",Sully
10,jboothmillard,Sully: Miracle on the Hudson,6,30 January 2021,"I first found out about the true story when it was mentioned on the Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2009, then the real-life hero had a cameo in Daddy's Home 2, so I was looking forward to watching this film all about why he became famous, directed by Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, J. Edgar, Richard Jewell). Based on the true story, on January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and First Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 ft (850 m), a flock of Canada geese strike and disable both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach either LaGuardia or Teterboro Airport, Sully sees no choice but to crash land on the Hudson River. All 155 crew and passengers survive the crash, some with minor injuries. The plane is evacuated as its slowly fills with water, onto the plane's floatation devices and onto the wings. The water is freezing, making it near impossible for passengers to attempt swimming to New York City. Eventually though, the passengers and crew are rescued by nearby boats. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident haunts, and he experiences a dream in which the plane crashes into a building. Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) suggest that the left engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. Furthermore, the National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerised simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that both engines were lost, leaving him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport. Sully realises that the Board believes the accident may have pilot error, which would end his career. The simulations are rerun with live pilots and seen at the public hearing, both resulting in successful landings each either airport. Sully argues however that these simulations are unrealistic as the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face, the emergency action and practises the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to divert the plane. Both simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time with a 35-second delay before the plane is diverted. The LaGuardia simulation ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and Teterboro simulation ends with the plane crashing into buildings before the airport. The board then hear the voices of Sullenburger and Skiles when making the emergency announcements. Later, analysis reveals that the port engine, recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best option available to him, which saved the lives of everyone aboard. Also starring Laura Linney as Lorrie Sullenberger, Mike O'Malley as Charles Porter, Breaking Bad's Anna Gunn as Elizabeth Davis, True Blood's Chris Bauer as Larry Rooney, Ann Cusack (John's sister) as Donna Dent, and Sam Huntington as Jeff Kolodjay. Hanks gives an interesting, composed performance as mostly calm ordinary man who made a remarkable decision, I agree that this is a somewhat understated way to portray this story, but we all know it is a disaster with a happy ending. The film goes backwards and forwards in time to tell the story, which is a little distracting, the crash and rescue scenes are well done, and the board hearing does get your attention, everything else in between is alright, overall, it is a worthwhile biographical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing. Good!",Sully
11,rmax304823,Brace For A Slight Impact.,6,30 May 2017,"What can you say about a mild-mannered elderly pilot who in 128 seconds diagnosed the problem with his US Airways passenger jet, reviewed his options, and chose the only one available which, despite the dangers, was overcome by the mild-mannered elderly pilot's skill as a flier? Not a hell of a lot. You need to build a full-length feature film around a few minutes of extreme stress and ultimate catharsis. Captain Sullenberger was a hero who ditched his huge airplane in the middle of the Hudson River with none of his 153 passengers suffering more than a scratch or two. That was January of 2009, which prompts me to observe that time is beginning to fly almost as fast as an L-1011 these days.But how do you fill up the movie? In classical narratives you require a protagonist who's trying to accomplish something and an antagonist who's trying to stop him from getting it done, but there's nothing like that in Sully's story. Everyone did was he was supposed to do -- not just the captain but the co-pilot, the flight attendants, the passengers, and the first and second responders. Given the circumstances -- the loss of power over both engines because of a bird strike -- it could hardly have turned out better.In such circumstances you need to provide the audience with enough information to infer the non-existent antagonist. In this case, the targets were easy: the ""suits."" That would be the National Transportation Safety Board and the insurance companies who stand to lose a great deal of money. So the modest and unassuming Sully must be called before a board of inquiry that looks exactly like the setting of an appellate courtroom. The judges sit up there at the long bench, full of evidence, pomposity, cynicism, and authority, while looking down at Sully and the other prisoners, I mean witnesses, below. The judges aren't chosen for their beauty either. They frown a lot and use tones of voice that are ripe with innuendo.Does Sully come through this and all the stresses associated with celebrity victorious -- in one piece? Are you kidding? If he hadn't, there would be no movie. So the film fakes its heavies. It also lacks sufficient technical detail so that the audience can't follow with any accuracy just what it is that Sully and his first officer are doing during the emergency. The procedures aren't that complicated. The emergencies described in a TV series like ""Mayday"" (""Air Crash"") are laid out so that even a non-techie can follow them flawlessly. But that would require a narrator, and this isn't a story about technology. It's a story about one man -- Captain Chesley Sullenberger and his behavior under stress. The other characters, his first officer and even his wife, Laura Linney, are strictly ancillary. It's a character study and it's well played.On the surface it doesn't give star Tom Hanks much to do because Sully was quiet and always controlled. But there's the challenge. Hanks has to convey emotions with the slightest changes of his facial expressions, a slight squint, a barely perceptible smile, the blankness of a focused attention. As for his voice it never changes except for a few second while the airplane is gliding earthward, or rather waterward, and he has to speak to the Air Traffic Controllers because a shortage of time demands it.There's nothing spectacular about the film. The CGIs are modest. Nobody shrieks with anger or with terror. Everyone is respectful and polite. Hardly anyone sobs. And nobody's head gets wrenched out of its socket. Even the suits, sitting up there in all their grandeur, come around at the end and freely, apologetically, admit that Sully did exactly the right thing under existing conditions. He really DID too. The Airbus A-320 that he was flying was definitely not built with the prospect of a ditching in mind. The airplane has two big jet engines, one hanging low under each wing. The object in landing on water is to keep the airplane as level as possible because if it touches tail down, the nose will pitch forward forcefully and the stop will be abrupt and destructive. And of course if the pilot lands nose down, he's humped. But a smooth, level landing on water us almost impossible with two huge objects hanging from the wings. If the airplane isn't kept almost exactly level, one engine with catch the water sooner than the other, the airplane will spin around in the direction of the lowest engine and possibly disintegrate. Sully was lucky he was over the smooth Hudson River and not the open sea.Clint Eastwood has chosen to show the emergency landing in several disjointed flashbacks but we never lose track of events or of where we are. Sully is a very intelligent man, a highly skilled pilot and deserves his celebrity, however much he may or may not have wanted it. Generally, a nice job, a full-length film built around a few minutes of extreme danger that doesn't lose the viewer's interest.",Sully
12,moonspinner55,A masterful recreation of a recent aviation event,7,27 November 2016,"A US Airways jet with 155 passengers plus crew leaves LaGuardia Airport Jan. 15, 2009 in the early morning hours, experiencing trouble after just three minutes in the air: dual-engine failure due to bird strike. The pilot, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot, Jeffrey Skiles remarkably manage to land the plane on the Hudson River with no causalities, although the National Transportation Safety Board isn't quick to call ""Sully"" a hero. Director-co-producer Clint Eastwood does superb technical work, and no expense has been spared to make us feel we are in that plane as it splashes down in the freezing water. However, the investigation by the NTSB (portrayed as a bunch of sniveling villains) into Sullenberger's quick actions are heavy-handed, while the segues to Sullenberger's worried wife back home are equally dim (she isn't turned on by the media excitement, she can't sleep and she's worried about money). Eastwood certainly does well by his leading actors: Tom Hanks (with white hair as Sully) and Aaron Eckhart are both terrific, as is the intense, realistic action taking place on Flight 1549. An uneven film overall, though most often a powerful and emotional adventure. *** from ****",Sully
13,paul_haakonsen,"Nice filmed, but a documentary is sufficient for the events...",4,14 August 2017,"I was already familiar with the story of the plane that landed on the Hudson River prior to sitting down to watch this movie. And it was primarily because of Tom Hanks that I decided to sit down to watch it.""Sully"" was nicely filmed and edited, but it was also a very unnecessary movie, and you might as well just watch a documentary about the incident. I watched a documentary about this plane accident some years ago on National Geographic, and I must say that having watched that documentary made the making of this movie very unnecessary in my opinion. And was this a story worth putting to the big screen? Well, I would say no, but that is only because I already saw the documentary. However, if you haven't seen the documentary or if you are somewhat unfamiliar with the actual events, then I would say that you would find the movie enjoyable. And in that case, then sure, the movie was worth putting to the big screen.The cast in ""Sully"" was good, and it was rather interesting and somewhat fun to watch both Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as pilots with fancy mustaches. And the people were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters.This is not a disaster movie in the traditional sense, where things have deadly consequences and there is one major disaster after the other taking place. No, this is a more realistic and down to earth, pardon the pun, type of disaster movie as it is based on actual events and because it resulted in no loss of life.What surprised me was the way that the accident committee were hellbent on blaming captain Sullenberger and co-pilot Skiles for their actions which saved all the lives of crew and passengers, and how adamant they were on relying on their flight simulation of the events. Corporate rigid thinking and ways of doing business, I guess.Personally, I didn't care much for seeing this on the big screen, as the documentary more than sufficed back in the day.",Sully
14,blanche-2,"""I've flown for 42 years. I'm being judged on 208 seconds.""",7,30 December 2016,"""Sully"" from 2016 is based on the true story of pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's dramatic landing of a plane carrying 155 people in the Hudson River when birds attacked his engines in 2009. I can still see the photos of the passengers standing on the wings waiting to be picked up. Naturally Hollywood grabbed the story immediately.Sully (Tom Hanks) is hailed as a hero. He doesn't seem to be one born for the spotlight -- he's a quiet person who really felt like he was just doing his job. But behind the scenes and the pictures of him as a hero, Sully's actions become the subject of a tense NTSB investigation.When the plane had to make an emergency landing, he was told to head for LaGuardia, but Sully said that the plane would not make it. The NTSB disputes this by performing simulations, and also states that one of the engines was still working. Sully felt he had no choice but to make his landing strip the Hudson River.Sully demands to see the simulations and also insists the second engine, so far lost at sea, was not working. His copilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) backs him up, and more importantly, no one was seriously injured. Very good film, if on the slow side, and it's not very exciting. It is, however, interesting and absorbing as we watch Sully attempt to prove that he was right, and insisting that the simulations are done in the same time frame as he had piloting the plane.Tom Hanks gives a good, reserved performance of someone whom greatness was thrust upon, a man who loved his work and was proud of it. Laura Linney has a small part as his wife. If Hanks' performance is subtle, so is Eastwood's direction, emphasizing the humanity of the story rather than going for over the top moments or big music. Truly an excellent job.",Sully
15,Quinoa1984,everything's good about it except for its reason for being (as a movie),6,13 September 2016,"So here's the deal: in the English classes I teach, I like to bring up the Rhetorical Triangle, which was originally by Aristotle or one of those Greek fellas, and what this consists of are three things in any decent piece, fiction or otherwise that is meant to convince us of its worth (obviously): Logos, Pathos and Ethos. Logos is the use of logic, facts, or truth; Pathos is the appeal to a reader or just an audience's emotions; Ethos is the speaker or writer's character, credibility, and authority.I thought of this when I was walking out at the end of Sully, the new film by the 86 years old(ass) block of American grit known as Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as the pilots who landed the plane without any loss of life in the Hudson river in January 2009. Surely the film has the logos and ethos down - it doesn't fudge any facts (far as I or most can tell), and it's made by a filmmaker who has gone around the block already when it comes to depicting figures who may be called heroes but they simply (in that Howard Hawks tradition) see themselves as professionals (think of the soldiers from Flags of Our Fathers or American Sniper, the former made for dull viewing, the latter more engaging but troubling at times). But the pathos? I'm not so sure.Sully was a man who was and remains beyond reproach: he *did* do his job and did it well, and despite the doubt that may be planted to the flight committee/board who are investigating the landing in the river (basically the closest this movie has to antagonists), where's the conflict? There may be some interior struggle I may have missed, but in such a short run time I'm not so sure Eastwood and the screenwriters leave much room for any troubling character signs or things that can put this story in flux (especially as it's one that is relatively recent and more in the public eye than Chris Kyle even was by comparison). This isn't to say that from that ethos/logos perspective the filmmakers and cast don't do their job - this may be one of Eastwood's better directed films in a while, and Hanks and Eckhart (mostly Hanks as it's his guy at the top of the bill) so as good as they can in portraying these men.But, and it's not too small a but, what else is there to this story? If one thinks back to two of the intense films that involve plane crashes from the past ten years, United 93 and Flight, they each had a) something that was intensely significant that made it a story worth telling and utilized pathos to the Nth degree, or b) gave us a character (Denzel in Flight) who was troubled and flawed and made it a little more difficult to see the story as black and white. Sully doesn't dance too far into the gray areas, and it's not really because Eastwood or his filmmaking team avoided them. They're just not there to begin with: a plane had a major problem, the pilots were both professional *and* human in their duties (the one interesting factor to me is that), and then there was an investigation. Oh, and Sully's wife or girlfriend (Laura Linney) had trouble selling their other property or something. Shrug.In other words, aside from the centerpiece of the film, where we see the crash happen from the perspectives of the pilots, the passengers (including three who were separated due to arriving at the last moment to the gate), the attendants, the airline traffic controllers, the coast guard, and which is an incredible piece of filmmaking and performance unto itself, there is not too much 'there' there emotionally speaking. That may be part of the point, that this was a case that showed the best in people and the fact that no one died was something of a miraculous event. Is that enough to make it worth rushing out immediately to plunk down the how many dollars it costs to see it in a theater? I'm not totally convinced.",Sully
16,tavm,"Sully was a fine drama about a good man who happened to be a hero, whether he likes it or not",10,13 October 2016,"I finally watched this after several weeks of it playing with my movie theatre-working friend yesterday. He had watched this before but was willing to watch with me as I hadn't. It was quite a touching true story of Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played here by Tom Hanks. The drama took its time in telling how the plane ended up where it ended up and why he was being investigated despite being called a hero because none of the passengers suffered badly during the crisis. Clint Eastwood did a good directing job, as usual. Going back and forth during some sequences, I managed to not be confused at all while watching which is a good sign of a fine drama based on something that actually happened. So on that note, I highly recommend Sully.",Sully

They would still maintain that he didn't have to land the plane where he did.Tom Hanks is faithful to the part and I like the way the story unfolded with the actual plane incident being shown not at the very beginning of the film.

It was purely underwhelming.Before I explain further,let me first describe what ""Sully"" is all about.It was January 15,2009.The US Airways Flight 1549 piloted by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles are coming from LaGuardia Airport towards Charlotte Douglas International Airport.But three minutes into the flight when the plane was at an altitude of 2,800 feet hit a flock of birds that disabled both engines of the plane.Without engine power and realizing that there are no airports around,Captain Sully decided to land the plane on Hudson River.Everyone hails the Captain as a hero.But the National Transportation Safety Board claims that Sully should have landed the plane at a nearby airport instead of putting the plane on the river.Now Sully must defend what he did at the Safety Board that he indeed acted correctly.The End.And knowing Hollywood being penchant for happy endings,the viewer would likely know what is going to happen.They know that Sully will definitely end as a hero and acted correctly or did movie would not have been made.The story was simple as that.In fact,the movie was short for it lasted only 90 minutes.It could have been interesting but it wasn't.The film was totally underwhelming as the viewer would probably not really get involved in Hanks' character nor the tension of the story as everything just happened without emotion.That includes the landing of the plane and the scenes at the Safety Board when Sully and Skiles were defending themselves.What saved it from disaster is definitely both Hanks and Eastwood.Tom Hanks provided a good performance as Sully.Eastwood's direction was decent.But it wasn't enough to have an interesting story.Overall,the movie just went to the motions of telling the story as it lacks tension,characterization and emotion.Truly underwhelming.",Sully

There are those who would argue that dramatic tension is unavailable in so recent an event in which the outcome is known virtually universally but, as I seem to never tire of saying, it's all in the wrist and by now Clint Eastwood's wrist in equal to anyone's in the business and as we have come to expect he delivers a fine film with sterling work from all concerned.",Sully
21,zardoz-13,Another Clint Masterpiece!!!,9,17 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood likes to depict real-life Americans under pressure who save the day. Notorious FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover saved the day in Eastwood's biopic ""J. Edgar"" (2011) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and Eastwood portrayed an individual toiling under significant pressure to defend the United States against the scourge of Communism. Similarly, in 2014's ""American Sniper,"" Eastwood presented heroic Navy S.E.A.L. Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) as he put everything on the line to keep as many of his fellow soldiers alive with his superb marksmanship skills. In Eastwood's 35th film as a director, the two-time Oscar-winning helmer pays tribute to Sullenberger as a professional who felt that he was only doing his job. As the eponymous hero, Tom Hanks makes a sympathetic but effective protagonist, much as he did in the earlier 2013 seafaring hostage thriller ""Captain Phillips."" Mind you, the notion of suspense is a foregone conclusion. Everybody knows Sully was a genuine hero who executed one of the most incredible forced water landings of a commercial passenger aircraft in history when he glided US Airways Flight 1549 into the chilly waters of New York City's Hudson River in 2009 without a single fatality. Not only did Sully perform an act of unparalleled bravery, but also the first responders displayed comparable gallantry in rescuing Sully, his crew, and his passengers. Nevertheless, beneath the surface of his icy demeanor, Tom Hanks never lets us forget that Sully was made of flesh & blood, was racked by doubts and fears, and principally about what might have happened had he not followed his instincts and experience.Despite the fact that we know Captain Sullenberger survived the river landing in real life, director Clint Eastwood opens ""Sully"" with an audacious scene. Sully's aircraft crashes into Manhattan, and fireball explosions galore erupt with horrific consequences. Sully (Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"") awakens from this nightmare in a Big Apple motel. Throughout the rest of the film, he ponders what else that he could have done, and later has another nightmare wherein Katie Couric calls him a ""fraud"" on network television. As Eastwood's account of the incident shows, trouble struck US Airways Flight 1549 on its New York to Charlotte, North Carolina flight, about three minutes after the aircraft had lifted off from La Guardia. A flock of Canadian geese crossed the flight path of the Airbus A320 as it was ascending to 3000 feet, collided with its two powerful GE turbofan engines, and were churned in an aviary slush. If you read Sullenberger's autobiography ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" he describes the birds as ""slurry"" after the engines ground them up, and the smell of charred fowls filtered into the cabin. The aircraft lost both engines and neither could be brought back into service. The veteran pilot ""eyeballed"" his options and decided to ditch in the drink. ""Brace for impact,"" Sully warned his crew and passengers about a minute and a half before he glided the 70-ton jet into Hudson. Miraculously, the plane neither blew up nor sank. Sully, his First Office Jake Skiles (Aaron Eckhart of ""The Dark Knight""), and their three flight attendants evacuated the aircraft before water rose above the seats in the single-aisle cabin. First responders and scuba cops appeared on the scene, and everybody was bundled in jackets and carried to either side of the Hudson. One mild subplot involves a family of three grown-ups who are separated during the multi-vessel rescue operation. Ironically enough, these three had scrambled to get aboard Flight 1549 before it took off. Meanwhile, Sully was desperate to know if all passengers had been accounted for. Eventually, after a hospital check-up later during the day, he received confirmation that everybody had been located. ""Perfect Stranger"" scenarist Todd Komarnicki's screenplay divides the incident into three stories: Sully and his encounters with an adversial National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), several telephone conversations with his anxious wife Lorraine (Laura Linney of ""Mr. Holmes""), and the actual incident in the Hudson itself. One amusing episode has a restless Sully jog from his motel to a Manhattan bar for a drink. Pete, the bartender (Michael Rapaport of ""True Romance""), brags about their new alcoholic concoction named the Sully. According to Pete, the libation consists of Grey Goose vodka and a splash of water. Meantime, each time that Sully and Jeff deal with the NTSB, the board is contentiously brusque, and Sully worries about his career, largely because he wants to see the flight simulations of the incident. Basically, the NTSB emerges as the villains until fade-out.Suffice to say, ""Sully"" is about as succinct as a mainstream Hollywood film can be. Eastwood has delivered one of the more focused films of his 45-year career clocking in at 96 trim minutes. Despite its austere brevity, you will never feel like you have been slighted. You get to experience the forced water landing at least twice along with some other exciting aerial shenanigans. Aside from another show-stopper of a performance by Hanks, Eastwood has surrounded him with a first-class cast, right down to minor roles. Jamey Sheridan, Mike O'Malley, and Anna Gunn comprise the NTSB panel, and they make classic villains. Recently, the actual NTSB has complained that they weren't anywhere as dastardly has Eastwood and company have portrayed them. Nevertheless, good, solid, dramatic films require the presence of a villain, and they fit the bill adequately because our hero has to answer to them. The water landing looks about as real as you might imagine it, and Eastwood shows it from the perspective of several observers who happened to spot the plane as it went down. However, don't go to ""Sully"" searching for melodramatic heroics like the John Wayne classic ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954) because you will walk out definitely disappointed. ""Sully"" celebrates not only an American, but it also celebrates American character in general, and Eastwood's epic may rank as the best feel-good picture to illuminate screens in a long time.",Sully
22,grantss,Great dramatization of an amazing event,8,18 June 2017,"On 15 January 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 lost both engines shortly after takeoff. Thanks to the experience and skill of its captain, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, all 155 passengers and crew survived when the plane landed on the Hudson River. This is the story of that incident, and its aftermath.Great dramatization of an amazing event. While the the events and skill involved therein are pretty incredible I was skeptical that this could be made into an engaging, entertaining movie. I need not have worried. Director Clint Eastwood turns a story that could easily have ended up as a boring linear docudrama into something very interesting. Through starting the movie AFTER the climactic event, the use of back-and-forth time jumps and focusing as much on the aftermath as the event itself, Eastwood has made something very engaging and intriguing.There is a degree of dramatic license involved, especially with regard to the NTSB hearings, but Eastwood and writer Todd Komarnicki needed a way to introduce an element of uncertainty and drama into a story with a known outcome, and that was it.",Sully

In his masterful, ROSHOMON-like hit movie SULLY, Eastwood examines the title character from every angle. Though Trump University's B.S. in Aviation REQUIRES would-be airline pilots to study John Wayne's example in THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY, as well as Leslie Nielsen's character in AIRPLANE!, Eastwood portrays a Chesley Sullenberger who jogs around in front of taxis, whiles away the hours at bars, and NEVER sees a flick! Wayne's ""Whistling Dan"" co-pilot has to slap around his boss Robert Stack to prevent a mid-flight water ditching when Stack goes all SULLY on him (in a scene which is later famously reprised--18 times--in AIRPLANE!). But since Chesley skips Trump U., he and his culturally illiterate cohorts have no one to slap THEM around! The only silver lining is that just a trashy Airbus is lost by SULLY. Leader Trump has pledged to outlaw this sort of cheap foreign vehicle, unable to withstand encounters with rugged American Wild Life.

While the screenplay by Todd Komarnicki - based on Sully's book with Jeffrey Zaslow - is streamlined to a fault, director Clint Eastwood's economic, lean and straightforward helmsmanship is not unlike his protagonist's own accord - clear-eyed and on-target.

25,view_and_review,Solid Movie,7,30 October 2017,"It's not very hard to get behind Tom Hanks in just about anything he does. Even still, I was wondering just how they would do this movie. Would it be a life story, an extended telling of the fateful event or something different entirely.""Sully"" was a dramatic retelling of the miraculous water landing accomplished by Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks). It was done very well with just the right touch of drama. It's an American hero movie where the hero this time is not a soldier or a cop but an airline pilot. I enjoyed the movie from a professional standpoint. I'm not a pilot but in my line of work I'm very familiar with investigations of accidents and events and the Monday-Morning-Quarterbacking that goes along with it. It was very interesting to see how procedures and guidelines come into play and how skilled human beings have to implement them in crunch time.""Sully"" was a solid movie throughout.",Sully
26,neil-476,Good but padded,7,16 May 2018,"In January 2009, Captain Chesley Sullenbeger, aka Sully, successfully ditches a powerless jet airliner in the Hudson River, resulting in the full complement of 155 passengers and crew surviving. The event happens in full view of numerous cameras, and becomes known as Miracle On The Hudson: Sully is a hero. But the subsequent enquiry seeks to establish the landing as pilot error by proving that Sully could have successfully landed back at La Guardia.This dramatisation of real-life events is not unsuccessful, but is nonetheless a little odd.Director Clint Eastwood reconstructs the moment from the bird striking the jet engine to the ditching extremely well. The trouble is that, as in real-life, this took only a few minutes (it was less than half an hour until everyone was safely on boats), so we get to see it twice from start to finish, several more times in fragments, and from a variety of angles.And there is no suspense to it: we already know everyone survived.So the thrust of this movie is the enquiry. Popular opinion has, to his embarrassment, labelled the self-effacing Sully as a hero, whereas the enquiry seeks to blame him for endangering lives, which will end his career.There is actually some decent drama here: one, I didn't know how the enquiry had gone so, for me, the outcome was in doubt and, two, the public hearing at the conclusion of the enquiry is an excellent bit of theatre.Tom Hanks is, as usual, a class act, especially playing an ordinary man displaying extraordinary qualities, but Aaron Eckhart as his co-pilot is as good. Laura Linney as Mrs Sullenberger is wasted, her role being simply to take part in distressed telephone calls.If there is a problem here it is that the only real drama is the hearing, and there is perhaps insufficient meat on those particular bones to sustain a feature without adding a fair amount of inconsequential padding.I'm still glad to have seen it, though.",Sully
27,AlsExGal,"Terrifically detailed work directed by a living legend, and starring one too!",9,19 September 2016,"This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteran pilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYC and with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for ""Cast Away"", Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning ""Mystic River"" in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended.",Sully
28,ferguson-6,He's the Captain now,7,8 September 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger has experienced both. On January 15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of US Airways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled ""Miracle on the Hudson"".Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the best of human nature.Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book ""Highest Duty"", co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is given to the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review. The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by the ultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his career and reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse than yours and mine.Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing. Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks the hysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, this re-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendants repeated instructions of ""Heads down. Stay down"". Even the cockpit chatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom are real life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-fact manner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as he desperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit 155.Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorable scenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wife of Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully's background with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texas private airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanks is the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewart just fine if it were the 1940's.The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computer simulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, we get the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding human error – naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their ""lost"" plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doing their job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, and the first responders were.This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but are glued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handles the cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camera work avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one of the best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intense scrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. The closing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivor would agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life  something that could have gone to the other extreme.",Sully

He is seen as a hero to the 100 percent surviving passengers yet placed under scrutiny by the powers that be who question whether he made the proper choice of action. He was a family man who was devoted to flying but is not prepared for the media frenzy that follows. This brings the first time collaboration of director Clint Eastwood and star Tom Hanks. Eastwood focuses on the frenzy and the reactions of both sides. One major drawback is the over the top reactions of those who view Sully as a hero. He is hugged, kissed, worshipped, and it is all pathetically corny. Hanks effectively brings out the exhausted state of Sully's being as he becomes more unsure of himself. Aaron Eckhart plays his supportive co-pilot Jeff Skiles who feels victimized by the whole investigation. Laura Linney plays Sully's wife whose daily routine wait for her husband becomes an event on the local news. Other characters are cardboard with some performances going into overacting. Eastwood has tackled true accounts before and here presents an impressive vision of a plane landing in the Hudson through flashbacks. Sully's integrity is questioned but those who was there view him as a heroic man of action. Score: 8 ½ / 10 / Writing: 100% / Themes: 66% / Acting: 60% / Directing: 100% / Visual: 100%",Sully
30,FlashCallahan,Hudson we have a problem........,7,1 December 2016,"On January 15. 2009, flight 1549 left New York but shortly after taking off an accident wrecks the plane's engines. The titular Captain decides that the plane won't make it to the airport so he chooses to land in the Hudson River. And even though none of the passengers were seriously injured, Sully finds himself under intense scrutiny by governing bodies, whose investigation reveals that the plane could have made it to the airport and one of the engines was still working. Sully still maintains the engines were out and if they tried to go to the airport they would have crashed........When you have an amazingly talented director like Eastwood, who rarely puts a foot wrong, and an amazingly talented actor like Hanks, who rarely puts a foot wrong when he isn't portraying a Dan Brown character, you would be forgiven for thinking that this would be one of the films of the year.But even though Sulley is a gripping film, and has excellent performances from all, the high expectations this film has been carrying since it was green lit, leaves you with the feeling that this could have been so much better than the finished product.Hanks' portrayal of Sulley is more about his physical attributes and facial expressions rather than his delivery of the script, he's at this strongest when he is silent, assessing situations, for example, when he goes into a bar and his face is all over the television.It's proof that Hanks is a bonafide legend, and one of the greatest actors living today, and he embodies Sulley so much, you forget that you are watching Hanks.But where the film falters is the money shot of the whole film, the landing and what precedes it. It just isn't as thrilling and as tense as it should be, and the fact that some of the CGI is amazingly flat, doesn't help the proceedings.But the film is solid, and there are some scenes involving aircraft that must have. Been a risk for the studio, but their decision to allow the, in the film really pays off.It's not the masterpiece many were expecting, but it's a solid enough biopic, with tremendous performances.",Sully
31,phd_travel,Well done recreation of the event but too much about the investigation,8,9 September 2016,"Bottom line is this movie about good luck and heroism is a unique and rare true story that is worth watching and deserves a grand big screen portrayal. It shows everything you want to see about the water landing and rescue in painstaking detail. Tom Hanks is right for the role of modest hero. The production values are good and the content is interesting. Liked the way he imagined the alternatives to the water landing and the way the flight and passengers were portrayed quite realistically with middle aged stewardesses and cramped seats.The flaws in this movie are the structure and focus. Firstly the jumping back and forth in time breaks up the impact. Better if the story had been told chronologically with maybe just one flashback. The right way to do it would have been the whole flight and landing, then the investigation.Secondly the focus was more on the NTSB investigation which should have been maybe a 15 minute part of the movie. It was terrible that he had to justify his actions and you feel righteous indignation at the NTSB investigators etc who questioned his judgement. The exoneration could have been faster. So it was right they had all this in the movie but this aspect was dragged out and left a bitter aftertaste.Tom Hanks looks old here with his white hair and a little less lean than the real person. But he does a restrained and effective job. Aaron Eckhart is a good co pilot. Anna Gunn is good at playing the hateful character - here the villains are the investigators.There aren't many happy endings in events like this so it's good it was made into a movie. Worth watching.",Sully

The manner of telling the story on film is at times a bit disconcerting because of the manner in which the screenplay jolts between after the event, dreams by Sully, and the even and the final 'trial'. But in the end it works – largely in part due to the reliable Tom Hanks as assisted by Aaron Eckhart.Captain Chesley B.

However, even as Sully was being heralded as a hero by the survivors and the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career. Further tension is provided by Sully's frightened telephone calls with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney).

But, 'Sully', moves back and forth from the incident, and delves deeper into Sully's psychological & physical journey, once after the moment was over. It explores the side when his life is invaded by reporters and investigators, who force Sully to put his job, family, and reputation on the line. 'Sully' is a human-drama, treated with a tense touch. Also, the nerve-wracking airplane mission on the Hudson River, is repeated many times, but from different perspectives. Its first shown as a nightmare following Sully, and later, seen from the moment the birds hit the engines, and then from the some of the passengers & finally on how Sully & First Officer Jeffery Skiles, achieved the near-impossible. And not for once, does it feel repetitive, in fact, the narrative digs deeper into that day & offers a wholesome view. Even the sequences where Sully & Skiies are questioned by the investigators, are engrossing. In short, 'Sully' works from start to finish.Todd Komarnicki's Adapted Screenplay is Top-Notch. The Writing is super-strong & delivers Sully's heroic story, with genuine drama & affecting human-conflict. There is not a single dull moment in the film & although there isn't much to think of the story behind a few instances, the Writer keeps the narrative straight to the point & razor-crisp. And Director Clint Eastwood is at top of his game! The Legend handles 'Sully' with detail & passion. He's bought out the best from its terrific cast & also allows his crew to soar, in every department. 'Sully' is amongst his most accomplished works to date! Tom Stern's Cinematography is excellent. The entire airplane incident (Shot in IMAX), is brilliantly shot & executed. Even otherwise, Stern's Camera-Work extracts the core emotions of its characters, at all times. Blu Murray's Editing is superb, as 'Sully' runs for a crisp 96-minutes. Art & Production Design are flawless. Christian Jacob & The Tierney Sutton Ban's Score is good. Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks Soars as 'Sully'. Hanks delivers a masterclass in subtlety, offering a personal & compelling performance of a man, who is haunted by something, he didn't let go horribly wrong. He plays 'Sully' with a beating heart! Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, is fantastic. Its such a joy to see this talented, underrated actor in such great form. Hanks & Eckhart share an infectious on-screen camaraderie & are the backbone of this solid film. Laura Linney as Lorraine, Sully's wife, is restrained. Anna Gunn as Dr. Elizabeth Davis, is brilliant.

It opens with a nightmare by Sully crashing his plane, then it winds back into the aftermath of the crash, then it winds back to the crash, and then winds up to the aftermath, then back to the crash, and then finally to the hearing after the crash. It does so flawlessly like peeling back that onion and exposing more and more about the story.Sully's relationship with his co-pilot is the most exposed part of this. Sully's relationship with his wife and family, is told smartly though it is more just between him and his wife. It mentions the daughters but that is all. The most difficult thing it does well is the recreation of the crash. Sully puts in just enough about the passengers to make it feel real but not more than is needed. It dramatizes the relations between Sully and the NTSB investigation a bit more for dramatic effect, but is just the right touch. The hero's on the river who got to the plane quickly so that everyone is saved is done just right.Tom Hanks is very effective, which is almost always true, as Sully. The film does actually get over the feeling of how Sully was treated as a hero by everyone after the crash, not an easy thing to do, brings the hero feeling into reality.This film makes a point about computer information which is very relevant here. Any computer information is only a good as what is programmed into it. When a computer is used to simulate anything, it must have real data put into it to get real data out. That piece of drama dominates the closing of this one.This film makes a point about computer information which is very relevant here. Any computer information is only a good as what is programmed into it. When a computer is used to simulate anything, it must have real data put into it to get real data out. That piece of drama dominates the closing of this one. I can not emphasize this enough. In an era where a lot of political issues are being supported by conclusions reached strictly by data in computers that has no real factual basis, there are the problems with that being pointed out in this movie.Is it worth seeing? This movie makes my day, punks, but I leave it up to you to decide if I have fired enough data into this to make your day, too.",Sully
37,KineticSeoul,A stand out factual movie about a stand up guy,7,12 January 2017,"This is based on the true incident where a disabled plane full of passengers was landed on the Hudson River by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. Because a flock of birds disabled the engines by flying into it. And the core of the story revolves around if Sully is really a hero when it came to his decision making. Or is there other factors that play a part in this, which would make his decision at that moment to be the wrong choice. Maybe he is a scapegoat and the fall guy to point the finger at so companies wouldn't have to take full responsibility for the damages. Now what I liked about this movie is how Clint Eastwood didn't try to make a pretentious and over dramatic movie. But just show the facts and what Sully was going through during before, during and after the accident. The most interesting parts was during the investigation after the Hudson landing. And the inner turmoil and anxiety that Sully was going through. Now Tom Hanks is the actor that really brought the emotions of the pilot in a very engaging manner. Overall, this is one of those movies that is based mostly on facts that the audiences will get the most out of if they care to know about the aftermath.7/10",Sully
38,sddavis63,After A Slow Start This Becomes A Superb Story,8,11 August 2018,"I thought ""Sully"" got off to a bit of a slow start. I remember the incident well from news reports - Captain Sullenberger landing the massive Airbus A320 in the Hudson River just a few minutes after takeoff because of dual engine failures - and everyone surviving the incident. It sounds like an exciting story, but it's made pretty clear from the start that this is going to be far more about the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board than about the incident itself. Which, I suppose, is understandable. As is pointed out several times in the movie, the entire incident lasted about 208 seconds. You can't really make a movie about a 208 second incident. And, indeed, for the first little while this movie had me a bit disoriented, wondering what really was going on. But the story picks up its pace well, and in the end director Clint Eastwood did a magnificent job of moving back and forth from the narrative about the investigation to what actually happened in the cockpit - and the cockpit scenes were dramatic and seemingly (to me, admittedly a non-pilot) meticulously recreated - as was the ultimate evacuation of the plane afterward. It really was a tribute not just to Sully, but to all of the flight crew, who acted professionally and calmly and ensured the survival of their passengers.The NTSB didn't come across quite as well. Sullenberger became (understandably) a hero almost from the moment this happened. After all, it happened in broad daylight in one of the world's largest cities - lots of people saw it. The depiction of the NTSB investigators was that they were antagonistic toward Sully, perhaps either disturbed or jealous that his media acclaim was getting way ahead of their work, and they came across as people looking to place blame for the incident rather than people who were looking for the truth. The actual investigators disputed how they were portrayed, and my understanding is that even Sullenberger disagreed with the liberties that the writers and Eastwood took with this part of the story. I suppose there was a feeling that a movie has to have a ""bad guy"" to create dramatic tension - and the NTSB filled that role perfectly, even if the portrayal was unfair.Tom Hanks is obviously the star of this movie. Aaron Eckhart is along for the ride as Scully's co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, but everything in this movie focuses on Hanks. His performance, I thought, was predictably excellent. It's an understated performance - not high on typical drama or excitement, but portraying Sully as a naturally humble man who finds himself thrust into the spotlight and tormented by the thought that he could have done something different - something safer - although it's made clear that for all his thoughts about alternatives in the end he's confident that he made the right decision - the evidence for that being that all 155 people on the plane survived.Ultimately, after that slow start that lasted for maybe 15 or 20 minutes when the movie seemed a bit off focus, this turned out to be an excellent story of a man who is, indeed, a real hero.

39,Hellmant,"A well made crowd-pleaser, that's for sure!",9,15 September 2016,"'SULLY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic based on the story of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger; the pilots Captain who heroically landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River (in January of 2009), and saved all 155 people on board. The movie stars Tom Hanks, as Captain Sully, and it costars Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Mike O'Malley and Jamey Sheridan. It was directed by Clint Eastwood, marking his 35th theatrical film as a director, and it was written by Todd Komarnicki. The script is based on the 2009 memoir 'Highest Duty' (written by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow). The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a hit at the Box Office. I found it to be very intense, and involving!On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 hit a flock of Canada geese (shortly after departing LaGuardia airport), which disabled both it's engines. With no airports in safe landing distance, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Hanks), and First Officer Jeffery Skiles (Eckhart), were forced to land the plane on the Hudson River. All 155 passengers on board (miraculously) survived the emergency water landing. The media and public praised the pilots as heroes; but the National Transportation Safety Board was beginning an investigation which could discredit the men, and possibly destroy Sully's career. I knew nothing about the investigation into pilot negligence, by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), so this movie was very interesting to me. I also enjoyed seeing the epic events of the 'Miracle on the Hudson', recreated for the big screen (they're intense). The film is very inspiring, and involving. I love seeing a story where the little guy takes on the establishment too; in this instance it was definitely self defense, but it's still incredibly moving! Eastwood is great at directing this type of movie, and I actually think it's one of his better films. Hanks is also spectacular in the lead. It's a well made crowd-pleaser, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFMQ3xbt9g",Sully
40,thesar-2,Waterplane Down,5,18 December 2016,"""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Wow. Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent said that one year prior to this movie's events and was onto something!For the most part of Sully, it was heart-warming, tear-jerking and up- lifting. Intentionally, of course, but I bit, was enthralled and actively participated in how they wanted me to act during it. Now, that said, I don't know how much of this is true – I mean NOT EVERY SINGLE CHANNEL is on the same story for weeks. Unless, of course, a plane dives into something less wet in the same city this takes place in.I ask about the authenticity because, I guess there are real-life assholes who try to question a hero's actions. Hell, let's pull that back quite a bit and just say someone in authority is questioning another's ""good actions"" and I know that to be true from my ten years in call centers. But, to this degree, they piled on the vileness of the villainous committee determined to prove this pilot who saved 155 souls could've saved some bucks by landing on concrete than water. The only scenario the committee wasn't shown doing was tying Sully up on a railroad track while twirling their long mustaches as the train approached. By the third act, I might have actually bought that in this realm.Regardless of the ""need"" for suspense outside the actual heroism and plane going down two dozen times (in various shots,) it was a well-made, quick (thank you!) and as said above, completely inspiring from the point of view of the humble, straight-up Sully. The movie circles (literally) around a plane taking off from LaGuardia only to be immediately met by a mid-January bird convention and, though the movie says there were no casualties, I beg to differ with how many birds survived being shredded in the plane's engines. Anyhoo, Pilot Sully and his Co-Pilot, Mustache, have to make a quick decision to land on the Hudson when all other options were absolutely out of reach. Of course, enter our committee of haters who thought, ""Eh, really? That would've been a piece of cake!""Director Clint Eastwood did a great job of taking a water landing that lasted minutes – thanks to multiple heroes and wonderful coincidences, and NOT stretching it out past two hours adding needless added dramatic moments, characters that didn't exist or even more shots of what happened that disastrous morning. I thank you, Clint. Most directors, cough, cough, Michael ""Pearl Harbor"" Bay, would've milked this to the bone. Instead, we get all we need and probably feel more moved than if we spent 3+ hours on some strange and fictional love triangle between two of the flight attendants and one of their dogs left at home.***Final thoughts: Funny. Using that Batman quote in my opening was just a coincidence since Aaron Eckhart said that as Dent in The Dark Knight and played Co-Pilot Mustache here. But, even he has to see the irony.",Sully
41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A competent enough, but still flawed biopic",7,22 December 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning On January 15th 2009, airline pilot Chelsey 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) was forced to take drastic action when the passenger airline he was commandeering ran into turbine trouble and began to nosedive down towards New York. Sully took evasive action, and glided the plane down toward the Hudson river, saving the lives of all the passengers on board. However, in the aftermath, his airline tried to hang him out to dry in order to avert blame for the disaster from themselves, and he and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were forced to do a round of publicity to defend themselves.Nothing produces better human drama than a real life drama, and plenty of them occur every day for Hollywood to bang out for the big screen (what with this and, for example, the up-coming Patriot's Day with Mark Wahlberg.) Clint Eastwood's latest dramatization has a really glossy, ready made feel to it, another Malpaso company production with none other than Tom Hanks in the lead role. Running at a far more condensed length of just over an hour and a half (rather than the two hours or so it would have ten/twenty years ago), it zips by and is a generally fine and polished piece, but sadly it's undeniably pretty flawed.I didn't know much about this event, but in early 2009 it must have been something that took America by storm, and with 9/11 still fresh in everyone's minds, it undoubtedly must have caused some fear and panic. It was a tale that was indeed begging to be told, but sadly Eastwood's execution is a little disjointed, and the dramatization and the flashbacks to what happened are too blurred together to enjoy the story properly, whilst other strands, such as a scene where Sully's fascination with flying began as a child, is never explored any further. It's never sensationalist or sentimental, but it's still a bit flawed as a film.Performances wise, in the lead, this is a role Hanks was pretty much born to play, and a role he can pretty much do in his sleep, portraying a reserved, dignified man whilst also quietly conveying his softer side in some private, emotional scenes. His presence adds to the overall smooth, glossed over feel to the film, though, while Eckahrt provides similar sturdy support along with Laura Linney as Sully's wife. It's an aesthetically pleasing film that is just a little too flawed to be perfect. ***",Sully
42,ElMaruecan82,"Likable film about an admirable man, but the material was better suited for a documentary...",7,24 June 2018,"""On January 15, 2009. More than 1.200 first responders and 7 ferry boats carrying 130 commuters rescued the passengers and crew of flight 1349. The best of New York came together. It took them 24 minutes""Surely an inspiring conclusion, but I admit my immediate reaction was ""who are you kidding?"". I'm not cynically negating the fact that the 155 passengers of the fateful flight were rescued by competent and dedicated New Yorkers, but it's Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger aka Sully who definitely saved them. And that's why he's got the lion-share of praises, that's why he got the film.I worked in an airline company for more than three years, this film is about January 15, 2009 but I mostly remember June 1 of the same year. It was the day I started working and when -in a tragic irony- the Airbus flight from Rio to Paris crashed. My immersion into the flight world coincided with that event and for some metaphysical reason, I read every single article about that crash, which -according to the investigation- was tragic because avoidable. Basically, if it wasn't for the pilot letting the co-pilot in command, for the co-pilot taking the wrong indications, for several ""if"" factors, two hundreds of people wouldn't have perished in one of Airbus' deadliest accidents.But ""Sully"" made me relativize all these computer-generated inquiries that end up pointing a posthumous accusation against the pilots. Indeed, it doesn't take a NTSB expert to know that accidents are the result of equations featuring many parameters among them human factor, there's never one sole cause of accident. This is why planes are still statistically the safest travelling ways, and this is why it doesn't say much about how stressful a flight plane is. This is why, on a personal note, I think my last hour is coming whenever turbulences start. This is why I take my chances with buses, boats and cars. Hell, this is why people still applaud the pilot when he lands.Why should they? Isn't it part of their job? In the short documentary-feature about Sully, he reminds us that pilots have to fly well every time, it's a job that doesn't allow one hazardous move or uncertainty. I worked in the freight business where everything was processed and pre-planned from A to Z, freight isn't living people, but lives are always at stakes during a flight. That's why pilot is an ace job, when you have hundreds of lives depending on you every day, you can't afford a mistake... but as Sully also says this time in the film ""everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time"".Clint Eastwood shows us a man confronted to such situation with only 208 seconds to react. In what should have been a routine flight, birds are sucked into the two engines making both unusable, and the only solution is an emergency landing on the closest runway. The altitude is low, he can't reach an airport without flying over New York City and he's got less than a minute to make up his mind. Of course, there's not much suspense since we know he made the right choice by landing on the Hudson river. But suspense isn't Eastwood's concern, he doesn't care about the 208 seconds but the 24 minutes.Indeed, after his ""Invictus"" and ""American Sniper"" and before the ""15:17 to Paris"" Eastwood seemed to have grown a cinematic fondness on real-life heroes. I guess it's a generational appreciation of men who were capable of taking the right decision at the right time and inspire the best out of the people. Mandela in ""Invictus"" took unpopular decisions that eventually united South-Africans. Chris Kyle might have been blinded by his patriotism but became an inspiration to his companions. Sully is made in the same Eastwoodian vein, he wouldn't call himself a hero, but don't ever tell him he made the wrong decision.The problem with ""Sully"" though is that the film takes a situation of a few minutes and needlessly stretches it for the sake of cinematic viability. In a non-linear narrative, it switches back and forth between moments where he's hailed as a hero and where he's criticized by the NTSBC investigation. Moments where he seems to go through a PTSD phase and moments where he reminisces about his past. The investigation is perhaps the best part of the film and it makes everything else feel as ""fillers"", Laura Linney is not being given the most grateful role of her career as the long-suffering wife and the film could have done without Katie Couric calling Sully a fraud in an imagination sequence. Why would he be a fraud if he never pretended to be a hero?The not-so subtle point of Eastwood is betrayed by that ""best of New York"" disclaimer. The film opens with a nightmarish vision of ""what could have been"" had Sully followed the instructions by the book instead of his precious instinct and it ends with a needlessly graphic recreation of September 11. Maybe the opening and ending elevate Sully as a heroic figure because he could inspire the best of New York like the terrorist attacks did, but by saving lives instead. An Egyptian taxi driver praises him for having restored his faith in humanity in a year that started with the crisis, Madoff and Middle-East wars. It wasn't just the perfect timing but the perfect time.Now, I enjoy a good inspirational film like anyone but I can't say the film captivated me as ""Invictus"" did or elicited a reaction as strong as ""American Sniper"" (even though it was a negative one). The film struck me as a poor man's ""Apollo 13"" or a film Steven Spielberg could have made between two blockbusters. I liked it for its informative value but I enjoyed the real smiling Sully more than Hanks' grim all-serious performance... so maybe the story was better suited for a documentary?",Sully
43,MOscarbradley,Magnificent,10,8 December 2016,"I have always maintained that Clint Eastwood may be the last of the great 'classical' directors still working in Hollywood, despite the fact that he has only been making films since the 1970's. Like Hawks and Wyler and, to a large extent his mentor Don Siegel before him, there is nothing ostentatious or showy about his films, preferring instead to rely on narrative and casting. His films are usually about strong, almost silent, men who prove themselves capable of almost superhuman displays of strength, if not in any literal sense, certainly of character. In the past he often took on that role himself but he's 86 now and is unlikely to appear in front of the camera again anytime soon.In ""Sully"" the central character is played by that most unassuming of actors Tom Hanks in what may be a career-best performance. He is, of course, Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River on 15th January, 2009 with no loss of life. Hailed instantly as a hero by the world at large, Sully had still to clear his name with the aviation authority who initially claimed he could have safely returned the plane to La Guardia; Sully argued otherwise.For a film where the outcome is already known it remains both incredibly exciting as well as deeply moving, testament to both Eastwood's direction and Hank's acting. He is the lynch-pin of a first-rate ensemble that includes Aaron Eckhart at his very best as his co-pilot and Laura Linney as Sully's wife. She literally phones in her performance, appearing on the phone in everyone of her scenes. She's still superb, proving yet again just how good an actress she is. When, I kept asking myself, is someone going to write a great role for Linney the way they do with a certain Miss Streep. As for the real Sully, I can't think of a more fitting tribute to the man than this. Eastwood's magnificent direction and Hank's magnificent performance do him proud.",Sully
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Though its competently constructed, the film places more emphasis on the uninteresting aftermath than the actual 'miracle landing' itself.",5,2 December 2017,"Though the source story makes for an interesting anecdote and the real life 'Sully' certainly deserves the praise being thrown his way, this move adaptation feels entirely unnecessary given that the true events it is based upon can be wholly recapped in about three minutes primarily because that's just about how long they actually took. Where 'Sully (2016)' makes its first misstep is in placing more emphasis on the ensuing investigation than the actual 'miracle landing' itself, assuming that its audience will actually doubt for a second whether or not the protagonist pilot made the right call when he chose to (totally successfully, I might add) place the lives of his passengers above the monetary value of the plane he was flying. So, what you end up with is a piece that gets its main event over with within the first few minutes and then revisits it a number of tension-less times, including once more in full during the finale with no new information added seemingly to stretch the runtime to that all important 90-minute mark, before battering you over the head with a corporate investigation which couldn't mean less in terms of emotional investment. This is simply competent film-making but nothing more, thanks mainly due to the fact that its story isn't really as suited to this medium as it is to filling a lull in conversation, but even then it's perhaps a little too late to be bringing it up now. 5/10.",Sully
45,dromasca,Clint's Heroes A-changin',6,29 December 2016,"It's interesting to watch the evolution of the heroes that Clint Eastwood brought to screen in his acting and directing career. His first serious impact was with the spaghetti western style heroes of the 60s, followed by the sometimes rotten, sometimes idealistic cops in the action movies of the 70s. Later as he turned to directing and built a solid career as an accomplished director his heroes were polarized in super-achievers or rhetoric failures. Some of them continued to use their fists or guns. Other were inspiring leaders or great inspiring movers. They never were conventional. Which is the main problem with Sully. The hero of this film is so predictable. Even his dilemmas and the way they are solved are predictable.You will tell me that this is a true story, we know the ending, it happens to be a happy one, this also happens in life. Maybe so. Reality however does not always provide the best promises for great art, and realism is just one of the possible styles in cinema (and not necessarily the one I prefer). Good movies were made based on true stories and biographies of real heroes. They succeeded however because they could find new dimensions to the stories and the characters, not because they followed the beaten tracks. Even in Sully the best parts are the ones that describe, almost as against the story the conflict between self confidence and doubts. Should we trust the heroes that become overnight media sensations. The instinctual answer is 'no - be cautions' but this is not the obvious answer here. The problem is that the envelope is so conventional, full of platitudes and melodrama, of small and insignificant side threads (the calls with the wife) that add nothing to the substance of a story that is quite thin already.It is interesting as well to watch the evolution of the heroes that Tom Hanks acted on screen. If there is one thing that made his career exceptional it's the fact that he never made the expected, his next role was an exception, a different character that built himself as a live and true character on screen, no matter if he was playing a Central Asia refugee or an American astronaut. This is not the case here. If there is one performance that director Eastwood succeeded in this film, it was making actor Hanks look bored and boring for the first time in his career.'Landing on the Hudson - The Movie' (my personal title) is not the best film of either Clint Eastwood (as director) or Tom Hanks. It brings however some interesting questions about the careers of the two exceptional film personalities in the film industry and America of 2016.",Sully
46,ThomasDrufke,Power of the Human Spirit,9,9 September 2016,"If there's one thing you can count on Clint Eastwood doing well, it's directing an emotionally heartfelt story. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.""The miracle on the Hudson"" is the subject of this Eastwood drama, starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and Laura Linney. There will be plenty of obstacles with any film based on a true story, but with a film based on an event that lasted a mere 208 seconds, it's extra difficult. But Eastwood manages to pull a great story out of these unbelievable events that comes in just under 2 hours. Of course, the flight itself isn't the only hurdle that captain Sully went through, as he dealt with reporters, investigators, and the National Transportation Safety Board determined to diminish his heroic efforts.Who could possibly be better to play Captain Sully than the great Tom Hanks. Having wonderfully played another ""controversial"" captain back in 2013 as Captain Phillips, there was no doubt he could pull off a somewhat similar role. Boy does Hanks deliver. He always effortlessly pulls out the big speeches and powerful dialogue well, but I often find his more subtle acting to be more impressive. It's the moments when Sully is reacting to the big moments with only his facial expressions and body languages that give me goosebumps. Not many actors are able to bring me to the verge of tears just by a facial expression, but Hanks is one of them.Eastwood and his editors also deserve tons of credit for their work here. Much like Hanks' subtle acting, I love when Eastwood holds back the bombastic music (that can sometimes take you out of a story like this) and lets the audience choose how to feel by watching gorgeous cinematography and poignant acting and directing. This may be Eastwood's best directorial work since Million Dollar Baby. He understood exactly the moments to use and not music in order to pull the emotion out of his audience.Most of all, this film is a great display of the power of the human spirit. Everything about this film is grounded with humanity. No one seems fake. So often Hollywood is flooded with over-the-top filmmaking that can easily dilute the power of the film's message. Sully knows exactly what it's going for, and it does it to near perfection.+Eastwood back at the top+Hanks subtle acting+Power of human spirit91/100",Sully

The emotion and trauma these must have underwent is beautifully captured by Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, their chemistry on screen is fantastic, it is the highlight of the movie for me. However, the story seemed to be too straight forward to make in to a full blown film, they experimented with this by not showing scenes in chronological order and showing the plane crash from different perspectives, but it ends up feeling like they were merely filling time.I found the last scene to be very disappointing. It is anti-climatic and drags on significantly, consisting of us watching various flight simulations of what Sully should have done, it becomes very tedious by this stage. It is certainly flawed, but Sully boasts terrific performances and an engaging story, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama, just do not go out of your way to see it.

Of course, we all know the ending to the crash part of things. And we think we know what happens to the other plot, the investigation of the crash. So this is a movie without surprises, and is mostly about recreating the events in a moving way.Done.Kudos also go to Tom Hanks, who pulls of a nuanced version of the pilot that seems convincing and sympathetic. A star playing a hero. The re-creation of the crash itself, and of the simulations afterward, are also first rate stuff—gripping, scary stuff.All of this said, it's also true that this is a formula movie. It does little to get to actual depths or surprises. It includes a couple of short dream sequences that are manipulative (for those of us who remember 9/11, at least). It concludes with a two-minute wrap up where everyone says golly and a huge room full of people jot a few things onto pads of paper. And with a very funny joke, which ends the movie with a laugh.Could more have been done? Of course. But then it wouldn't have been a simple re- presentation of the facts.

51,A_Different_Drummer,Sully -- a slightly ESOTERIC review,8,13 September 2016,"First, the film itself: * technically perfect. What Clint Eastwood shares with Ron Howard is that they are both actors-turned-directors who consistently make technically perfect films. (Howard, on the other hand, was never voted ""sexiest man alive"" in his acting career. Just a trivia point...) * what they also share is a penchant for taking larger-than-life people and literally making them much-larger-than-life on the big screen. After this, you will feel like you have known Sully as long as his family.* in the presence of such directorial talent, it is easy to overlook the casting choices. In this case, I suggest that Hanks may not get the credit he is due. This may be the best performance of his career. He sets a deer-in-the-headlights tone early; and by mid-movie, the viewer starts to feel as paranoid as his character. Amazing performance.* recommended for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that it is one of the best films of the year.And now the esoteric part of the review: * have a friend, a university professor, who once explained to me, at some length, that the #1 most ""unnatural"" event in life is an MRI scan.

54,inkblot11,"Excellent, harrowing film about a true American hero",8,28 September 2016,"Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) has been flying since he was a teenage crop duster. Now after a gazillion flights, he takes the controls again with his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) on a cold January day. But, alas, almost immediately after takeoff, a flock of geese fly into the engines, disabling both of them. As experienced pilots, both know how far a plane can fly to land. The air traffic controller offers a return to LaGuardia and a nearby Jersey airport. But, within a few seconds, Sully deems these choices impossible. The glorious Hudson river stretches out in front of them and Sully makes a MIRACULOUS landing in the water. Then, at once, the plane is taking water and the 155 passengers have to be rushed to the inflatable lifeboats and wait to be rescued by the Coast Guard. They are, all of them. Yet, Sully and Skiles must spend a few days in New York while the NSA begins to question their judgments on landing in the water. While Sully is a hero to the passengers, crew, and the whole world, the NSA bigwigs try to tell him he should have headed for the airports. Simulations show they could have made it. Aghast, Sully and Jeff counter that it was impossible. Further tests are ordered while Sully's wife (Laura Linney) is waiting for him, anxious and afraid his career will be over. Will it? This fine, 90 minute film is exciting and maddening. Hanks gives a great performance, making you forget everything but that he is Sully. Eckhart, Linney, and all of the others support him wonderfully. When Eastwood recreates the water landing, it is terrifying and amazing. But, how annoying it is that the NSA is slow to thank this great pilot and quick to doubt his abilities and decisions. Its probably routine but it sure doesn't seem like it. Audiences will like the NYC setting with lots of great views from the air, too. Inventive, also, is the director's choice to unfold the film, not chronologically, but in jumps between past and present. All in all, this is another masterful film by Ms. Clint Eastwood.

58,tabuno,An Invigoratingly Compelling Pre and Post Jet Landing Experience,9,12 January 2019,9 September 2016. Director Clint Eastwood has created a compelling and refreshing look at both the mental and the physical experience of a national event of an aborted passenger jetliner takeoff and its aftermath occurring in one of the most populated place on earth. Both the director's incorporation of humanly personal touches and some wonderfully new camera shot perspectives reveal an exciting movie-going experience this heroic incident that is inspiration in its entirety.The editing and use of flashbacks to maintain the pacing and captivating questions move the storyline along at a wonderful pace. This is one of those movies where the director's keen talent is required to finesse and flesh out a written recollection by the heroic pilot himself onto the big screen. The small shots of the secondary but just as important humans involved in the rescue and personally touched by this major bird hit informs the public of a community coming together and the teamwork involved in saving the lives of both passengers and crew.Clint Eastwood offers up this singular event as in important redemptive experience of Americans in light of the tragedy and turmoil that took place in this country in the early part of the last decade of the 21st Century. This movie is a great follow up to Ralph Nelson's 1964 fictional airliner investigation thriller Fate is the Hunter or the more haunting supernatural thriller of Rodrigo Garcia's Passengers (2008) and complements the television series Air Disasters (2011) with a fuller personalized background story.,Sully
59,ironhorse_iv,"Sully soar high with me. Yet, there were some engine problems.",8,15 December 2016,"Hailed as a national hero in the United States, Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) successfully executed an emergency water landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River off Manhattan, New York City, on January 15, 2009, after the aircraft was disabled by striking a flock of geese during its climb out from LaGuardia Airport. This movie directed by Clint Eastwood, tells about the real-life account of the aftermath of the 'Miracle on the Hudson', in which Sullenberger was challenge by National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) if the water landing was really necessary, as it would endangered the passengers lives. Without spoiling the movie, too much, when fact-checking this movie, I found the film based on Sullenberger's autobiography ""Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters"" to be very accurate. However, there was one big problem. In order to give his film some sort of friction, beyond the short, but intense water landing, Eastwood reportedly made antagonists out of the US federal agency responsible for investigating major transit accidents. That means a lot of scenes, them, being exaggerating too hostile to Captain Sullenberger and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). In my opinion, there were way too many of that. The deliberately stink eye and 'out to get him' dialogue, really got heavy handedly, and felt a bit annoying to watch. The reasons why, is because, in truth, the NTSB was far from blaming or criticizing the captain for his actions. Reports as early as 2009, has stated that they always supported the narrative of Sullenberger's heroism. I know, Eastwood just wanted to add some melodrama to the story, but they wasn't no need to make the NTSB to look like comical villains. Another thing, I found annoying, was the direction of the film. It was too sentimental and sappy at times. The music and patriotic visuals, only added to the cheesiest. Also, the decision to show bits and pieces of the crash several times throughout the film was not a good choice. It made the film feel repetitive. It really does takes away from what could have been a really hard hitting piece of filmmaking with the entire recreation of Flight 1549 in real time. Something, very similar to what is portray in director Paul Greengrass' 2006 biographical drama-thriller film, 'United 93'. There's no question that Eastwood's movie is still harrowing and gripping, but it really starts to lose its luster after knowing that there is barely any different, between each flashback to that day; no matter, whom vantage point, the movie is being told. Because of this, the pacing is somewhat slow. It really took forever to get to what really, did happened. For a 96 minutes, it's the shortest film, Eastwood had ever directed; yet, it felt long. Then, there is the fact that some parts of the movie was somewhat boring. Much of this, come from the fact that the main character is just not that interest in the film, besides the fact that he save people that day. Don't get me wrong, I have to say, for the most part, Hanks gives the quiet, monotone Sullenberger, an alright performance that worth seeing, but nothing about Sully in the film is that memorable. In the end, he was somewhat forgettable. It's sad, because there were some parts of Sully's life that could had been entertaining to watch, more. Yet, Eastwood really made, his past seem really boring and short. I really don't get, how that was possible, seeing that Sully once flew McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II for a living and help investigation other aviation disaster, such as Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 and USAir Flight 1493. It would be really nice to see, more of the past, rather than repetitive fake looking CGI shots of the same plane crash. Nevertheless, I do like how this movie show the other heroes that day, like Ferry Captain Vincent Lombardi, who was the captain of the first ferry to reach the plane, who played himself in the movie & the New York Scuba Divers. Yet, I felt that adding the story of some of the passengers, was a bit distracting; seeing how their stories, don't really add much to the rest of the film. You would think, their viewpoints of the crash, would play more into the plot. Yet, it didn't. The same goes with having Laura Linney as Lorraine Sullenberger, Sully's wife. The script barely had anything for her to do. Surprising, Hanks and her don't even share, any scenes together. It's really pathetic. How are we supposed to believe that, they have a connection with each other, if we don't see them, embrace!? Added to that insult is the fact that some supporting characters such as Aaron Eckhart & Kate Couric kinda plays their roles, a little bit too over the top to the point, that I found their performance to be a bit distracting. Despite that, I have to say, Eckhart does bring this movie, some really needed charm. However, I don't think, it was right decision to end the movie so abruptly after a tacky joke from his character. It felt so anticlimax. Nor did I like how film's release date coincide with the 15th anniversary of the 9/11/01 attacks. Yes, the film show New York in one of its best moment, but it a very blatant attempt to cash in on people's emotions. Still, if Sullenberger says he supported your movie about him. Then, you're doing something right. I have to agree with that. Overall: As much as I torn, through this movie and show it's faults; it still was somewhat enjoyable good-nature movie. Since, the director was involved in an emergency water landing in the past. You see that, Clint Eastwood put a lot of heart into making this film and it shows. In the end, Sully is worth flying over and go see, but it does need to leave a few things on the tarmac to be a masterpiece.",Sully
60,Reno-Rangan,When a real human bravery wasn't appreciated till the computers confirmed it.,8,14 December 2016,"Another excellent biographical drama for Tom Hanks in the title role. He has transformed from captain Phillips to captain Sully. Another great addition to Clint Eastwood's filmography as well, he never disappoints us. This film was based on the real event of the January 15, 2009. When a US passenger plane got hit by birds just after the take off, losing both the engines, landed on the New York's Hudson river. So the film reveals the heroic event, as well as followed by the investigation of the crash landing.As it is a Hollywood film what should I expect, another American bravery? Yep, but still a good film, very engaging plot. It's not all about the plane event, because I thought one of the film poster is a spoiler. So the film covers more story, about the drama surrounding the main event. Especially saving the lives, that inspires even for the outside Americans. The entire narration is about two-three day affair, but most of the film was about the crash landing. From the actors to the visuals, all were top class.

61,sol-,Flight,6,6 January 2017,"Aiming to tell the ""untold story behind the Miracle on the Hudson"", this true story drama from Clint Eastwood documents Chesley Sullenberger's safe landing of a damaged plane on a river and how the National Transportation Safety Board sought to scrutinise his actions rather than celebrate him saving the lives of everyone on board. ""In the end, I'm going be judged on 208 seconds"" laments Sully, played by Tom Hanks here, and this is the most fascinating aspect of the film: the verdict will determine how everyone will always perceive him, all other merits aside. The film only engages in this dilemma occasionally though, and it is only in the final half hour in which the National Transportation Safety Board put Sully on trial that the film takes off. The first hour of is not worthless, but it is certainly uneven. Clint's decision to leave the real crash until midway through works well as it places doubt in our own minds as to what transpired, but since Hanks does not have a deeply flawed character like Denzel Washington in the similarly themed 'Flight', it is only so interesting to watch him wallow in self-doubt. The inclusion of extraneous flashbacks, like a father and two sons almost missing the flight, also feels like a poor attempt to beef the running time up to feature length. Indeed, the story here is slim for a standard length motion picture with (again) none of the plot complexities of 'Flight'. As always, Clint directs the film in a classy manner and if one avoids thinking about the Washington film in the same breath, it is a solidly assembled piece, if one that could have been much more.",Sully
62,tomgillespie2002,Solidly made but badly paced,6,21 December 2016,"The miraculous events of January 15th, 2009, when veteran pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger was forced to make an emergency landing in New York's Hudson River after a flock of birds flew by and took out both of the plane's engines, were reported widely here in the UK, with the media quite rightly branding the feel-good story as an act of heroism by a humble man who had dedicated 42 years of his life to his job. Almost as if the decision-makers felt like the people in the UK were too ignorant to recall a famous and extremely recent incident from the U.S., Sully has received the distracting subtitle of Miracle on the Hudson, making it sound like a TV movie aired by Channel 5 in the process. But this is directed by Clint Eastwood, and with the screen legend behind the camera and one of its most celebrated talents in front of it, Tom Hanks, Sully can only mean one thing - the arrival of awards season.While the title may suggest a hastily-made cash-in for bored housewives and the unemployed to consume during a weekday afternoon in front of the TV, Sully has Eastwood at his most accomplished, delivering a solidly-made, well-acted tale of heroism in his usual clinical fashion of shooting quickly and without fuss. If you know the story, which you likely do, the opening scene may seem predictable as Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) buckle in and take off, until disaster strikes. Rather than heading to the Hudson, the plane takes a left turn and is soon flying dangerously close to skyscrapers, eventually clipping one and going down in a ball of flames. This turns out to be Sully's nightmare, as he struggles with the overwhelming media attention and the questions posed by the National Transportation Security Board (NTSB). The latter are investigating Sully's actions, and whether the data secured after the landing indicates that it was possible to steer the plane safely back to LaGuardia airport or to nearby New Jersey.Sully's inability to quite comprehend the sudden mass media coverage and the spontaneous hugs and kisses he receives by the adoring public forms the crux of Eastwood's film, which is, after all, based on an action that lasted a mere 208 seconds. Hanks plays the role with a quiet, dignified humanity, something the actor has mastered in more recent years, despite not receiving an Oscar nomination since 2000's Cast Away. He is so humane in fact, that he needs to remind the NTSB that the very thing they're investigating - human error - is just that; human. Regardless of how many data checks are carried out or simulations are conducted, the human factor cannot be replicated. This was a decision made in a split second, with the knowledge that the lives of hundreds of people are in his hands weighing down on him and decades of experience guiding his hands. Hanks may not get award recognition once again here, but it is undoubtedly a terrific, understated performance.Sully ultimately struggles with deciding how to pace itself, frequently jumping back and forth in time between the events before, during and after the landing, as well as a couple of brief scenes depicting the pilot's early days learning to conquer the skies. The events itself is also shown multiple times from different perspectives, including an air-traffic controller who believes the plane to have surely crashed after disappearing off the radar, with unnecessary focus on a collection of passengers whose stories quickly descend into sentiment and cliché. It all seems like padding for a film that would have surely worked better telling a straight- forward story of a man's act of heroism and the emotional after- effects, rather than trying to juice up the tale by turning the ones investigating the incident into little more than snarling suits. When Sully simply lets Hanks do his thing, it's great drama, and the re-enactment itself is as equally terrifying as it is thrilling, but the moments in between drag the film down into tedious waters.",Sully
63,zkonedog,"Well-Made Movie, But A Complete Lack Of Conflict Keeps It From Greatness",5,27 February 2017,"There is no doubt that ""Sully"" is a well-made film. I don't think Clint Eastwood (director) could do anything less at this point in his career. The tone is proper, the acting is fine, and the story is an inspiring one. It's just missing that one thing any film needs in order to have any dramatic purpose: conflict.""Sully"" tells the story of Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), the pilot of a passenger jet who, along with co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), experiences dual-engine failure shortly after takeoff. With seemingly no other resort, Sully guides the plan down into the icy Hudson River, and all 155 passengers and crew are rescued safely.Here's the problem with ""Sully"", flat-out: It doesn't have any conflict. Eastwood is a master at telling two sides of a story, but in this case only one side exists. No matter how evil Eastwood makes the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) look for questioning Sully, or the couple scenes where Sully beings to doubt himself, the audience is never given plausible evidence to believe that Sully is anything but a hero. It makes for a good feel-good story, sure, but not necessarily up on the big screen where some drama needs to be present.All that being said, there is nothing technically wrong with the film. The airplane scenes are thrilling, the acting is solid all the way through, and Eastwood's tone (set by the real-life visuals and simple music) is right. If you perhaps know nothing about Sully's story, you might be completely drawn in.To me, this is the type of film that might actually work better 5-10 years down the road, being watched by audiences that don't have any knowledge of the events. Since they won't know the details like current audiences do, future watchers might be able to get more invested.As it stands, however, ""Sully"" is a film that is very well-made but just doesn't have the greatest dramatic story to tell. One would think it would be, but instead it just lacks that central conflict that any great movie needs. As such, I can't really give it the highest of marks (even if it is little fault of the film's own). At this point in his career, Eastwood can do any project he wants...and he's earned that. But some will be better/more interesting than others, and I felt ""Sully"" feel somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.",Sully
64,eddie_baggins,Eastwoods best film in years and a likely Oscar player,8,12 September 2016,"A refreshingly traditional true life tale directed by a traditionally old school director, Sully has delivered Clint Eastwood his best film in a number of years after a string of disappointments in the form of films like Hereafter, J.Edgar and Invictus while the financially successful American Sniper was far from Eastwood's best and it's an audience pleasing experience that will likely see it play some type of part in next year's Academy Awards.Taking a look at both the happenings and closely followed aftermath of the Miracle On The Hudson that saw pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles land an American Airlines flight with 155 passengers on board on New York's Hudson river after a flock of birds caused engine failures on the plane, Eastwood has within this tale of human courage and lifesaving actions found a vehicle to not only showcase an incredible tale of survival but a thrilling experience that will have you holding onto your cinema seat with a vice like grip.The initial trailers for Sully barely scratched the surface of the ability Eastwood has enacted upon here as we are thrust between the fateful flight and Sully's fight to prove his decision was warranted and the actual incident itself that is shown in numerous forms over the films 90 minute run time, each time offering us another point of view to the occurrence on January 15th 2009. These scenes are Sully's best and some of the most gripping scenes Eastwood has ever directed and while the outings outside of the doomed flight might not work to the same level, Eastwood balances out the thrills with heart in outstanding fashion that often allows fellow veteran of the industry Tom Hanks time to shine as well.Whilst appearing in great thrillers like Captain Philips and last year's magnificent Bridge of Spies, Hanks has had a rather topsy-turvey decade or so with his projects that has seen some fairly forgettable experiences like Ithaca and Larry Crowne, but Sully provides the esteemed actor with a low-key yet worthy character that he makes his own.Ably supported by his off-sider Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot Jeff Skiles, Hanks does some of his very best work as Captain Sully, who quickly becomes a likable and relatable figure who after years of fine work in the cockpit had to make a life and death decision in mere minutes that for various reasons become a scrutinised and publicly huge event. It would not be at all surprising to see Hanks figure as a major part of Sully's awards campaign.While it may be to slight for some and sections of the film veer somewhat towards the over dramatic (including a script that could've done with a little extra polish), Sully feels like a the type of big Hollywood film this year's movie event calendar has been sadly bereft of and marks another career win for the evergreen Eastwood and Hanks who here get to show the upstarts how a big budgeted drama is done, both in a set piece and storytelling point of view.4 Gran Torino billboards out of 5",Sully

All 155 people on board were rescued.Tom Hanks portrays Sully very well, and the re-enactment of the events are depicted superbly.

He portrays it as more of an inquisition than a review. That may or may not be the case, but we all know that Captain Sullenberger emerged a hero, so there's no real suspense.I would have concentrated on the stories of the people on board.

66,howard.schumann,Real heroism does not always mean glory and parades,8,4 October 2016,"Real heroism does not always mean glory and parades. Sometimes it consists of simply doing what works – getting the job done in a way that those affected will always be grateful. Such a hero is Chesley Sullenberger, a US Airways pilot whose presence of mind, competence and good judgment saved the lives of 155 passengers and crew when he landed his stricken plane in New York's Hudson River in 2009, an episode known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" This miracle is celebrated in 86-year-old director Clint Eastwood's Sully, based on Sullenberger's memoir Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters. Written by Todd Komarnicki, the film stars Tom Hanks (""A Hologram for the King"") as the calm, unflappable Sully and Aaron Eckhart (""Courage"") as his supportive co-pilot Jeff Skiles.Eastwood and cinematographer Tom Stern establish the tension early. We see the Captain and co-pilot go through their pre-takeoff checklist and witness the takeoff and the passengers on US Airways Flight 1549, en route from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Charlotte, North Carolina, settling back for a long flight. Six minutes after takeoff, however, the plane is hit by a flock of geese, crippling both of its engines at an altitude of only 2,800 feet. While we know the eventual outcome, Sully's agonizing decision to land the plane in the frigid Hudson River after realizing he could not make it to the nearest airport is a heart-pounding sequence.While Eastwood succumbs to some disaster clichés with frightened parents holding onto their screaming children, the evacuation, for the most part, is done with restraint and the rescue by boas and ferries in the vicinity is expertly handled. The crash sequence (shown several times during the film) is interspersed with flashbacks to Sully's early life, his present-day nightmares, and phone calls to his anxiety-ridden wife Lorraine (Laura Linney, ""Mr. Holmes""). Much of the film's drama centers around the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hearing in which board members played by Mike O'Malley (""Concussion""), Jamey Sheridan (""Spotlight""), and Anna Gunn (""Equity"") question Sully's decision to land in the river, suggesting that the second engine was still functional enough for him to bring the plane back to LaGuardia or fly to nearby Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. If their assessment is the correct one, it would lead to a damaging verdict of ""pilot error.""The NTSB uses computer simulations to try to prove their case but Sully tells them that, ""Simulations take all humanity out of the cockpit."" On questioning, Sully learns that the ""sim"" pilots needed as many as seventeen practice sessions and he asks that 35 seconds be entered into the calculations to reflect the human equation. It is no secret that the real NTSB has disputed the prosecutorial manner in which the hearings are portrayed, saying that they were only seeking information in an objective, professional manner, a description that incidentally Sully Has agreed with. Tom Hanks is the perfect choice to play Sully. Though beleaguered with stress, self-doubt, and media hounds, his humanity and strength of character come through, allowing the film to deliver a believable message of human resourcefulness in the face of sudden crisis.Though Sully is portrayed as a conventional, solid-citizen type, in reality he had the courage to step up at the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's subcommittee on aviation on February 24, 2009, telling them that, after flying almost 20,000 hours for 29 years, his decision to remain as a professional airline pilot came at a significant financial cost. His pay, he said, ""has been cut 40 percent, my pension, like most airline pensions, has been terminated and replaced by a PBGC guarantee worth only pennies on the dollar."" ""I am worried,"" he went on, ""that the airline piloting profession will not be able to continue to attract that best and the brightest.  If we do not sufficiently value the airline piloting profession and future pilots are less experienced and less skilled, it logically follows that we will see negative consequences to the flying public––and to our country."" Telling the truth is another attribute of a true hero.",Sully
67,TheMovieDiorama,Lands comfortably as a captivating yet short biopic.,7,3 December 2016,"Another biographical disaster movie, Sully is about Captain Chesley Sullenberger and the landing on the Hudson river in January 2009 and the media frenzy and investigation that followed those events. I remember this news story when I was in school, I did not read too much into it (was probably a bit too young at the time to fully understand it). Originally I thought they would struggle to make the film enthralling enough, but with Clint Eastwood directing it was bound to be good. Firstly Tom Hanks yet again shines, it's safe to say that he is one of the ultimate Hollywood bankable stars. It was quite an understated performance as Sully himself is rather reserved and hides his emotions, I thought Hanks did well. It's good to see Aaron Eckhart as one of the main roles, I find him to be rather underrated and so was pleasantly surprised to find out he was in this. Acting aside, the main star as with all of his films is Clint Eastwood. His directing style is very simple yet effective, nothing fancy just clean realistic camera work. You can tell that the actors in his films appreciate him as a director and work well with him. The scenes of the plane landing in the Hudson river were excellently shot and yet somehow, even though we know what happens, it is still mesmerising and tense to watch. I like how the story played out with the fact that Sully could have landed at an airport and actually the more intense scenes are when the flight simulators are playing...it did raise the question: could Sully have prevented an emergency landing on the Hudson? This brings me to the negatives of the film, and that is the runtime is ridiculously short. 88 minutes for a biographical film!? Nonsense! If you can't make a biopic more than 2 hours long then you do not have enough source material. I appreciate that the film was not longed out for the sake of it, but it was far too short for us to be invested in the characters completely and that is a massive shame. There were scenes regarding Sully's past, but even them did not add anything to the story or any emotional impact. An extra 10 minutes on the investigation or maybe the survivors could have made the film more investing. Overall, Sully was an interesting biographical film about a recent news story with great performances and direction, but the extremely short runtime hinders the character and story investment.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Sully
68,matthewssilverhammer,"""Because Grandparents Wanna Go To The Movies Too""",6,17 September 2016,"Eastwood's directorial efforts are undeniably skillful dramas full of human resilience. Sully is no different, and may be his best in years. For some, that may be great news; for me, that's not saying much. Completely lacking in dramatic subtlety, Sully still somehow feels oddly distant and cold. On the other hand, its non-scifi-action-superhero-franchise thrills and intrigue are definitely a welcome reprieve after a long summer. Like an airline bag of peanuts, Sully's far from a delicious meal, yet it certainly helps pass the time. It's the harrowing true-story of a commercial-pilot-turned-national-hero successfully landing a plane on the Hudson River, saving everyone on board and potentially hundreds of NYC citizens. It's a stoic movie about a stoic man who is thrust into excitement. Playing the titular ""Stoic""uh, I mean ""Sully""is Hanks, who has taken a step-down in intensity, complexity and effectiveness from his other real-life-hero-on-the-water role in Captain Phillips. Instead of studying the psychology of an every-man experiencing sudden stardom through immense trauma, it hits fairly predictable biopic beats with on-the-nose and corny dialogue and performances. Luckily, the centerpiece plane crash and subsequent rescue is pretty fantastic. The great mixture of high thrills and drama told with grounded realism gives it a surprisingly honest and non-glorified portrayal. It's no accident this was released on 9/11, as that horrendous day played such an integral part in what made Sully such a beloved figure. People in NY buildings watching a plane fly low through their city, followed by the familiar humanity in the rescue boats, it's hard not to be moved. Those beautiful moments propel an otherwise bland movie that your grandparents will surely love.",Sully
69,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Hanks and Eastwood make a very good film where there arguably isn't one,8,25 October 2016,"In 2009, America got a rare hero in the form of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who safely landed a commercial plane with two blown engines on the Hudson River without losing a single passenger. Clint Eastwood, as he did with ""American Sniper,"" takes a closer look at that heroism in ""Sully,"" which follows the immediate and little- known aftermath of the event, chronicling Sully's (Tom Hanks) fame amid an investigation by the National Transportation Security Board into his decision-making.Hanks is the film's linchpin. Nobody does ""everyday hero"" like Hanks. His moments of uncertainty and brooding that project reluctant heroism are not only expertly delivered on screen, but critical to the drama and lifeblood of the film.That's because ""Sully"" is really a 90-minute exercise in how to make a feature film out of a story that doesn't really have enough material for a feature film. Somehow, Eastwood and screenwriter Todd Komarnicki turn the plot of an NTSB investigation into the most riveting product one could possibly create from an NTSB investigation.The compliment here is not meant to be so back-handed. No, ""Sully"" doesn't manage to completely disguise how little it has to work with and some of the techniques that it uses to mold that story into a serviceable drama, but Eastwood and Hanks get more mileage out of all that than they seemingly should. The truth is that it works.In a nutshell, while Americans were enchanted by ""The Miracle on the Hudson,"" Sully and co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were worried about losing their wings if an investigation revealed that they could have safely returned and landed the plane at LaGuardia. So, amid his press appearances on Letterman and with Katie Couric, Sully is doubting himself and wondering if he needlessly put all 155 passengers' lives at risk.Sully's inner quarrel and the unfolding investigation are the only sources of conflict in the film, and that's why Hanks covering that first half as well as he does makes the film. He lends such credence to the notion that Sully would have any self-doubt that it weighs on the audience too. As for the other half, Komarnicki paints the NTSB officials, which includes actors Mike O'Malley and Anna Gunn among others, as out to get Sully, when the likelihood was that they were just doing their jobs, albeit coldly, perhaps.When the climax of your movie is a room full of suits watching flight simulation videos recreating the conditions of the incident multiple times, you've put its fate in the hands of how well the rest of the film was executed. That's where the sure eye of Eastwood makes a difference. It becomes more about the details, and he captures the right ones. ""Sully"" doesn't get that emotionally evocative, but it hits enough of those notes with Eastwood's guidance.What it comes down to is that ""Sully"" landed in the right hands with Hanks, Eastwood and even Komarnicki for weaving a strong story where arguably there isn't one. ""Sully"" isn't a surefire awards contender, but it's the kind of film that can be if there aren't other great options. Either way, it's a really solid watch.~Steven CThanks for reading!

70,imseeg,Fairytales do come true,6,15 April 2018,"This true story is well known: plane crashes in river, everybody survives. Despite this miraculous succes the pilot Sully gets accused of reckless behaviour.No riveting actionscenes to be found in ""Sully"". No big drama's either. Director Clint Eastwood's movie is a slow burner, with good but not excellent acting. There are some touching emotional moments when everybody gets rescued and ofcourse it has got a feel good ending. All in all a warm nice movie depicting a fairytale of a true story.I must confess however, that I was constantly longing for the drama that ""Flight"" with Denzel Washington DID have, and ""Sully"" did NOT have. There could have been made a more intense and gripping movie about this wonderful story. Clint Eastwood played it too safe unfortunately. It certainly wont offend anyone, but it wont thrill either. It is just average feelgood stuff.Last detail worth mentioning is that in real life, pilot Sully revealed that a lot of pilots nowadays are in constant debt, while some of them even have to resort to foodstamps! When you fly what do YOU want? A rookie pilot with money problems or an experienced flightcaptain like Sully with a good salary? Flight companies are now testing planes WITHOUT any pilots at all. Bigger profits for sure. Better safety too?",Sully
71,lisafordeay,Excellent movie starring Tom Hanks,9,23 April 2017,"Sully is a 2016 biography film based on the true story of a pilot named Chelsey Sullenberger who saved the lives of 115 people by landing on the River Hudson on the 15th of January 2009. Tom Hanks plays the heroic pilot who is being hailed a hero yet some news reporters think that his a fraud because they don't believe for a second that the engines were at fault and that he couldn't have saved all those people at the time it happened. Chelsey(Hanks)must prove to the members of the public that he is telling the truth of what happened(which is told in flashbacks from when he got into piloting and the time it happened in January 2009). Since the crash,Chelsey keeps getting nightmares of what if the plane crashed in one of the buildings and never landed in the River Hudson. So will he tell the news reporters what really happened and will they believe him?Also starring Aaron Eckhart as Hanks Co.Pilot and directed by legendary film star Clint Eastwood this hour and a half film is definitely worth watching. As for me I was always a fan of Tom Hanks,as you could say his my favourite actor of all time. His been on the go since the 80's having starred in the likes of Big,Splash,all the Toy Story films,the list goes on and on. Packed with suspense and thriller this film Sully is the kind of film to watch if you love plane crashes or true life stories. 9/10",Sully
72,subxerogravity,Clint Eastwood masters doing a lot with the bare minimum.,8,9 September 2016,"What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tell itself.Specifically real with the water landing itself. Nothing is really taken out of content in the way Hollywood thinks and usually takes it.The event was dramatic enough without anything needed to be added to enhance that.Tom Hanks is a fine actor. Not the greatest performance, but it was cool that Hanks and Eastwood did a movie together.Sully gives us an in depth look at the miracle of the Hudson. Though the title does state that the we focus on Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger who did an amazing water landing on the Hudson in January of 2009, and got his 15 mins because of it, Eastwood shows us that even one man can see things in many different ways, as Eastwood goes through all those angles.I love Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, the co pilot who supported greatly the pilots decision. He was a great supporting actor for Tom Hanks.In the end this movie is about heroes, not just Sully but everyone involved in the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing. From the well trained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Its about the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen. It's about how sometimes we forget how to treat a hero, but true heroes will always shine though, and Eastwood tells the story as real as possible knowing that he has an incredible story here.",Sully
73,jtindahouse,"Flawed, but inspiring nonetheless",7,7 February 2017,"Whether or not Captin Sullenberger was genuinely an American hero has been a much discussed topic ever since January 15, 2009. Some say what we did was incredible and certainly heroic, others will argue that he was simply doing his job (by the sounds of it he may even argue for the latter himself). Regardless of where you stand, no one could argue that he did his job fantastically well that day.'Sully' is actually a film I can relate to on a personal level. I was a flight attendant for a couple of years and during my time we had a flight that was showing signals of a possible internal fire. We had to return to the nearest airport and I (as the sole flight attendant on board) had to evacuate 50 passengers mid-runway. I can confirm that that is a harrowing experience that sticks with you for a long time afterwards. What these people did, both the pilots and flight attendants, will never be easy for them to forget.The film itself isn't perfect. The biggest flaw it has it that structurally it's a bit of a mess. A 3 minute event doesn't exactly lend itself to a film. The scenes of the actual crash are brilliant. They're captivating to watch and are filmed brilliantly. It's the filler that doesn't really sit that well. The board room scenes feel overacted and unnecessarily harsh. They are purely that way to add some conflict to the story. It was needed, but it feels far from natural.'Sully' is a film that could have been a complete mess without a competent director. Luckily, Clint Eastwood was up the task. I imagine his job was more a case of paving over the cracks in the script than anything else. He did his job effectively though and the end result is a good, if somewhat forgettable, tribute to some people who did their job fantastically on that particular day.",Sully
74,Turfseer,Casting NTSB investigators as bogeyman is a cheap shot but Eastwood and Hanks still pull off the feel good film of the year,6,9 October 2016,"As far as films about air disasters go, ""Sully"" is a difficult one to pull off. The flight itself lasted only five minutes—so how does director Clint Eastwood manage to keep our interest for the 96 minute length of the film? The introduction is certainly gripping—Eastwood imagines what would happen if Sully decided not to ditch the plane in the Hudson. The imaginary sequence of events depicts a disastrous crash into skyscrapers reminiscent of what happened on 9/11. Instead of taking us to the airport right before the miraculous flight, Eastwood flash forwards to the beginning of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation where Sully's decision to ditch the plane is questioned by Board investigators. The first part of the investigation and its conclusion are book-ended into Acts One and Three of the film's narrative. Act Two is a recapitulation of the flight itself and the subsequent attendant rescue efforts.The actual crash is quite gripping, chronicling exactly how the plane went down after a huge flock of geese took out both the plane's engines. Tom Hanks as the expert pilot doesn't quite exude the gravitas of the real Captain Sully but once the geese hit, the A-list actor manages to more than ably convey the machinations of a genius of the skies on autopilot.For those who want more of the crash from different angles, the five minute anomaly is recapitulated in the third act through a series of flight simulations served up during the NSTB investigation. At first, it's posited that Sully had enough time to return to either LaGuardia or Teterboro airports. But once the human factor is added in, the additional seconds added into the simulation prove that the flight would have been doomed.Sully only fails in its rather unconvincing attempt to create villains out of the NTSB investigators. In real-life, the investigation took 15 months; here it's condensed to a very short time. While the investigators were just ""doing their job,"" here their aggressive probing suggests that they were out to ""get"" the intrepid Sully. The NSTB's statement regarding the film speaks volumes about Eastwood's attempt to make them the bad guys: ""we were not afforded an opportunity to ensure our actions and words were portrayed with accurate context or reflected our perspective.""Sully probably should be probably nominated and declared winner of the ""feel good"" film of the year. In another sense, it can be viewed as the perfect ""anti-9/11"" film, as it depicts a happy ending involving an air crash. Eastwood has done a good job crafting a narrative with limited potential for drama. Casting the NTSB investigators as the bogeyman here was somewhat of a cheap shot, but necessary to ensure that the film had some kind of antagonist.",Sully
75,DarkVulcan29,Almost nothing is impossible,10,20 September 2016,"in 2009 pilot Chesley Sullenberger(Tom Hanks) saved 155 passengers, by landing a damaged airplane in the Hudson River, so it would not crash. While the media is making Sully out to be a hero, but an investigation is done on Sully, on whether he made the right decision, now Sully feels if being called a hero comes to a big ?.Clint Eastwood's direction is brilliant has we the audience really get into Sully's head, and also we also feel like we are there during the plane crash scene. Plays it like we are there and it's happening for the first time. Tom Hanks really gives a great Oscar worthy performance as Sully.

This is part of what makes them so attention grabbing. You are seeing what did happen and what could have happened, not just where the budget went.If there is a wrong note in the movie, it's Sully's wife, played by Laura Linney, an immensely gifted actress given nothing to do here but look concerned. You recognise her as an uninteresting staple character immediately: the realisation that it is Linney comes as a shock.""Sully"" does boast a tremendous performance from Hanks, however.

77,freemantle_uk,Don't watch if you're going on a flight,7,7 December 2016,"Back in 2009 US Airways pilot Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger pulled off an amazing feat, landing a passenger plane into the Hudson River after both engines were damaged by a bird strike. His story became international news and which led to Sully writing a book and been adapted into a Hollywood film.Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart start as Sully and First Officer Jeff Skiles, the pilots on that fateful day, looking at how they handled the disaster and the aftermath, being investigated by the federal authorities and the media attention whilst Sully shows signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.Sully is told in the space of a few days and has usual structure, starting with the investigation already taking place and the incident is shown in flashbacks. The advantage of using this framing device is it prevent the film from showing its best scenes, the crash - a mistake that 2012's Flight did. But the film adaptation also just jumps around from event to event, repeating some of the same moments. The framing device of all the investigation does not make the most compelling of drama, especially when we know the actual outcome.The film has been criticised for making the investigators too aggressive and trying to blame the pilots for the incident, considering them reckless and putting lives in danger. The worst moment is at the end of the film so this is a spoiler warning: the investigators reveal the left engine lifted from the river and verifies the pilots claims that both engines failed - leading to question why wasn't that revealed earlier? Tom Hanks is brilliant as the lead role, adding to his recent run of real live roles. With Eckhart they had a calm authority to them as they face a crisis. They never lose their cool as they handle their job with absolute professionalism. As Sully Hanks has celebrity thrust upon them, being a adored by random strangers he meets and carries on with a stoic attitude. It's refreshing to Eckhart in a serious film, instead of being a stuck in subpar genre films.The best scene in the film is the plane crash as the pilots have to land the plane safely whilst keeping their cool. We get glimpses of some of the passengers on the plane, like an older Jewish woman, a man and his adult sons and a woman with a baby and also show people like air traffic control and witnesses in the buildings. It gave the film a slight air of Paul Greengrass' United 93. The film has the line that it has been a long time since New York had any good news, especially involving a plane and Sully suffers visions of what could have happened and the plane crashes into the city - the imaginary being like 9/11.Sully is a perfectly solid true life story and has some terrific moments - but as a whole fairly middle of the road.",Sully
78,PWNYCNY,The quintessential hero.,10,12 September 2016,"This is a great movie. It's about a regular working-class guy who does something heroic. The movie is also about New York City. It showcases New York City at its best. Sully is the kind of movie that is so good that it can't help but put you in a good mood, and make you believe that decent, caring people are still out there. A pilot is flying a plane and when confronted with impending disaster maintains his self-control resulting in a lot of lives being saved. Yet, what makes the movie even more enjoyable are the qualities of the hero himself - modest, caring, loyal, and professional. The movie manages to make you care about him as a person and in the process come to appreciate who he is and what he did. Tom Hanks warrants accolades for his fine performance has Chessley Sullenberger. The rest of the cast is excellent too. But as the title indicates, the story centers around one man who showed the world true heroism in the fullest sense of the world.",Sully

Now you may be familiar with the story but this movie is based on the book 'Highest Duty', written by Sullenberger and tells the behind the scenes story, you may not know. It's directed by Clint Eastwood-I think this is something like his 35th movie to direct. Tom plays Sully-Sullenberger's nickname-the man who became a hero to New York and most of the country after his heroic landing. Laura plays his wife and Aaron plays the co-pilot. The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation almost immediately-the chairman is played by Mike. They were concerned with any human error that may have caused the forced water landing; had Tom or Aaron been drinking? Drugs? Family problems? They ran computer simulations trying to see if the plane could have made a safe landing or not. Tom & Aaron were just doing their jobs-not to mention that they saved everyone on board-and now they were having to worry about their reputations and the possibility of even losing their careers. It is an interesting story. It's rated ""PG-13"" for peril and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed it-it's hard for Tom Hanks to make a bad movie-but it's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine. It would make a great rental, though.",Sully
80,alindsay-al,A great interesting film,8,9 December 2016,"With tom hanks in a film depicting a true event I was excited to see him hopefully deliver a great performance in an interesting film and I got what I wanted. The premise of this film sees a pilot crash land his plane on the river and saves everyone on the plane. But the plane authorities are looking into if he made the right decision. Tom hanks plays sully the pilot and he is absolutely incredible in this film, he gives such a great performance and you are totally invested in his character. His character is very interesting and you are incredibly sympathetic to the situation h I put in when h just thought he was doing his job. I suspect hanks will be in contention for the Oscar when the time comes. Also giving a fantastic possible Oscar worthy performance is Aaron Eckhart who gives his best performance since the dark knight. Him and hanks have great chemistry together and you buy there friendship as they both try and get through the situation. He also adds allot of humour to this film which was desperately needed to add levity to the characters. Laura linney plays hanks wife and she does a really good job especially when you consider her and hanks have limited screen time together and I fully bought into their relationship and cared about how it develops. The rest of the supporting cast all feel like real people and they add allot of depth to the scenes that don't involve hanks. The story is incredibly interesting as you see this normal guy get overcome by the pressure that he is put under an you see him cracking under this investigation and you really do care. But I felt like this film could have been a little longer to complete some story arcs also this ending is pretty abrupt. The script is fantastic and adds to the humanity of these characters with great dramatic and humorous dialogue that truly helps you care about these people in the film. The style of this film is a bit of a mixed bag, I love all the scenes involving the actual crash as you truly feel the drama that is going on And care about every person that is on the plane. But there are certain aspects of this film just feel out of place such as some flashbacks. Overall though I really enjoyed this film and recommend that everybody sees it that is interested in it.",Sully
81,CubsandCulture,The script is overcooked but wonderfully understated film otherwise,8,25 August 2019,"The script's treatment of the aviation safety board is a significant problem in the film. For whatever reason the writer decided to play up the antagonistic angle; this cast the review committee as hostile. This is not supported the historical record. More the point this sort of tension building is unneeded. The script adds a mystery and validation element that the story simply could have done without. I am sure Eastwood's libertarian sensibilities played a role in this poor decisions. Eastwood tends to distrust big structures and sympathize with the every man on the ground.Sully, the character especially as played by Hanks, is the quintessential Eastwood hero. He has an independent mind, an expert, is calm ,collected. He shows emotional only when he is alone and the danger is resolved. The film is at its best when it is dealing with the aftermath of the crash and how it effects the mental state of Sully. It is rare to have a director, an actor and a character so in sync but while everyone involved had finer moments this film just fits all involved.Good late Eastwood",Sully

84,jimbo-53-186511,Brace for impact,6,18 September 2017,"Chesley Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) get into difficulties with their aircraft shortly after take-off when a flock of birds fly head on at the aircraft resulting in damage to both engines. Sully makes the difficult decision to land the plane on the Hudson river as he does not believe that he will make it back to the airport (despite air traffic control advising him to head back to LaGuardia). Sully is branded a hero for his actions by the public, but his superiors don't see things this way and begin trying to build a case against Sully...I remember hearing about this case on the news but was shocked that it happened as long ago as 2009 - I thought it happened more recently than that. My how time flies (no pun intended). On that basis and due to what little knowledge I had of the incident, I did find Sully to be interesting and fairly informative and it was also nicely balanced with enough exposition to get a reasonable understanding of the events and the aftermath (without ever getting boring) and it also had a few sequences showing the plane getting into difficulties which made it quite nervy and tense at times. These things serve the film well and make it worth watching, but for me despite these big positives I just felt as though something was missing..Whilst it is informative and tense, the film is also quite cold and the film never seems to do much to draw me into Sully and Skiles' world; considering how often the word 'human' is used I couldn't help but feel that rather ironically the film lacked something in the way of a 'human' touch. Sully and Skiles aren't given much development and at no point do we seem to get any insight or understanding of how they are feeling or what thoughts are going through their heads?? This meant that the film lacked a bit of depth and felt a bit superficial at times. The film also clumsily throws in a scene where Sully and Skiles are both appearing on David Letterman which not only served no real purpose but it also felt oddly out of sink with the rest of the film. The same could be said for the scenes showing Sully in his early days as a pilot which added very little to the story and seemed to only exist as filler.Despite some weaknesses, Sully is still worth watching as it has an interesting story and at just a shade over 90 minutes long it gets the job done fairly painlessly. For me though its cold delivery and the rather poor character development offered up here prevents it from being as great as it could have been.",Sully

The plot is told in a way that I personally enjoyed, I liked seeing the different snippets of time.Though no-one is on the same level as Hanks in this, there are a few other good performers. Aaron Eckhart (Jeff) does well, while there are less important roles for people like Anna Gunn (Elizabeth) and Michael Rapaport (Pete). I have no issues with the casting, that's for sure.It's a crazy true story, mad that it happened way back in 2009 - feels more recent, strangely.

87,kirbylee70-599-526179,Defining A Hero,9,18 February 2017,"The amount of effort that goes into painting a negative world these days is amazing. News stories tend to follow the old adage of ""if it bleeds it leads"". Both Trump and Obama are painted in the most negative light by those who disagree with them. The trust of congress is at an all-time low. And yet on the rare occasion we are given the chance to glimpse the possibilities of man. We get to learn of someone who steps up at the worst possible moment and know that deep down each of us possesses that ability.SULLY is the latest film directed by Clint Eastwood, a man known to play fictional heroes, and tells the real life story of Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed his passenger plane on the Hudson River in New York City and saved the lives of 155 passengers on board. A film made about what happened wouldn't make a feature but a great short film. The bare facts laid out start to finish. But this movie is about more than just those facts.Without giving us a detailed in depth look into the past life of ""Sully"", the movie does give us a glimpse behind the man through a few flashbacks and various insights into the days following the water landing. The flashbacks don't take much screen time but show both Sully's passion for flying and his mindfulness when it came to safety. When all of the notoriety was going on he was setting himself up to go into business with just that in mind, safety.The film chooses to focus more on what happened after the water landing. The scrutiny that came down on both Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) was intense. While an incident like this would immediately call for an investigation was to be expected, the vehemence with which the investigators took to the job as displayed here went beyond what was expected. At every turn it seems they were more intent on finding a way to blame Sullenberger than to find out what actually happened.With each question posed to Sullenberger the clarity of what actually happened comes into question. Not just in the minds of those asking the questions but in Sully's mind as well. Did he make a mistake? Could he have landed at LaGuardia or Teterboro instead? Was landing on the water the safest route possible? The movie moves back and forth in time from the questioning faced by both pilots to their moments alone trying to recall exactly what happened. Time flows freely here and in such a way as to not be confusing. We're taken back to the passengers boarding and get a glimpse at just who these people were in snippets. We see both pilots going through the day to day work of making sure they're ready for takeoff. We see them dealing with the issues that cause the problems that day, a bird strike in mid-air. And we see why Sullenberger made the choice he did and discover if it was the right one or not.Webster defines the word hero as ""a person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities"". Chesley Sullenberger qualifies on all of these counts. His is a name that should not be forgotten. He didn't act out of self-promotion, he didn't do what he did to avoid getting in trouble, he did what he did to save lives, to serve his fellow man. These are qualities that seem lacking in many of those we call hero these days.The movie is so well crafted that you never find yourself checking the time to see how much longer it will go on and by the time the final credits roll you don't feel like it should last longer. The story is so well told it's enough, not too little or too much. It flows seamlessly even when going back and forth in time. Eastwood shows why he's such a gifted director here. Not only does he show what a hero Sullenberger was he shows how the city of New York were a part of the story as well.While watching the film I was reminded of how far Tom Hanks has come. First fame for him was as a man dressed in drag to save money on a TV series and now he's among the finest actors of our time. I'd place him in the top five any day of the week. He rarely claims the limelight or use his celebrity status to push political agendas. Instead he works and does so incredibly well. Those abilities are on display here as he uses the most subtle of maneuvers to present a man forced into the role of hero publicly but who did so for his own reasons.With so many movies to choose from these days my biggest fear is that this one will be overlooked. I noticed it was easily available at the local Redbox's while other big name fare wasn't. While those movies are few and worth watching I hope this one doesn't disappear soon. It's a movie that everyone should see. And stick around for the credits as a reunion of Sullenberger and the passengers is in the credits as well. This is what a real hero looks like.",Sully
88,juneebuggy,A bit dry if I'm honest,7,25 October 2019,"This wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, kind of dry actually. Clint Eastwood directed this bio pic about airline pilot Sully Sullenberger depicting his successful emergency landing of a disabled airbus on the Hudson river in Jan. 2009 .In the aftermath, that takes up most of the movie Sully must endure sudden, unwanted fame and the FCC trying to prove fault with his decision even though he saved everyone on board. Insurance companies right?! The viewer spends a lot of time following the inquest and watching what if scenarios on flight simulators. Tom Hanks is fantastic throughout, there's a good back up cast with Aaron Eckhart as the copilot and Laura Linney but after the actual landing the rest of the movie was dry, a bit jumpy and even repetitive.",Sully
89,davispittman,All about Hanks's performance really,7,22 April 2017,"Sully is a movie based off the true events where captain sullenberger landed the plane he was flying from New York to Charlotte on the Hudson River. Just after taking off from LaGuardia airport, US Airways Flight 1549's engines had a huge flock of birds fly straight into their engines and had both taken out upon impact. The pilot and co-pilot had to scramble to figure out what the hell they could do to land safely and ensure every passengers survival. Tom Hanks and his acting really is what makes this movie worth a watch. It's a relatively short film and it feels short because of the crash sequences and the scenes showing what actually happened during the whole terrifying ordeal. I really liked those scenes that focused on what actually happened because that makes it all real and it puts actual human faces to this true event. Aaron Eckhart does a good job with his role too, he plays the co-pilot that assisted captain sullenberger in pulling off the ""miracle on the Hudson"". I bought both all of the performances in the film and I thought the scenes showing what happened were done well. Other than that the other scenes don't really carry much weight, that's why it's not like a 9 or a 10. With all factors considered, I think a 7 out of 10 is fair for sully.",Sully
90,myriamlenys,a mixed bag,7,21 November 2017,"The good news : Eastwood wisely refrained from cheap melodramatics. Sadly the movie veers too much in the other direction (pardon the pun), causing the story to lose much of what made it so remarkable in the first place. ""Sully"" does not contain much in the way of epic grandeur, white-knuckle tension, unbearable suspense or trenchant comment. There's not even much dramatic conflict or contrast ; even the various aviation experts and inspectors grilling Captain Sullenberger are just hard-working people trying to do an ungrateful job.To continue with the good, the landing in the river is superbly filmed, from a technical viewpoint, and there is a fine performance by Hanks. It's a pity that Mr. Hanks has played this kind of role - competent and decent man rises to the challenge - so many times before : it is not a case of Captain Sullenberger being played by Tom Hanks, it is a case of Tom Hanks playing Captain Sullenberger, which is lethal to the suspension of disbelief. And yes, I do realize that there's an injustice involved,since Hanks only became a world-famous actor thanks to his hard work and stellar talent - but that's Art for you, she devours her own darlings.One also wonders at the way some of the characters were conceived. I do not know Mrs. Sullenberger - I've never even met her - and as a result it would be hugely presumptuous of me to write anything about her nature and temper. For all I know, or don't know, she may be one of the most delightful and enchanting persons living in the USA. Mrs. Sullenberger the character, however, is seriously annoying : dull, shallow, whining and ungrateful. One gets why her husband (again, I'm talking about the character) travels the world - anything to put 200 miles between him and boredom personified. It is less clear why he neglects to engineer a sad accident where his spouse falls out of an airplane.If I were real-life Mrs. Sullenberger, I'd go and consult a good lawyer with a background in libel cases.",Sully

94,aharmas,Demonstrating Integrity,10,18 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood is still going strong in his 80's, and Tom Hanks has high standards for performing. Having those two legends together is always a treat, and Hanks' portrayal of the modern hero is among his best work. Everyone knows about the captain who saved the lives of his crew and the entire passenger load. He achieved the impossible by landing a plane in the middle of winter on water that could have easily resulted in drowning or freezing to death. He became and hero, and most mortals were grateful he had saved many from certain death. There was still an element out there who wasn't looking for the positive and tried really hard to discredit Sully.The film is designed in a very interesting way, showing snippets of the day when the landing took place. There are also alternate scenarios; some created by the anxiety in Sully's mind after the event took place. Then, we have simulations ordered by the investigative body to show that Sully's choice might have not been the wisest. It didn't seem to matter that he was successful. It feels vindictive and irrational, and the movement almost succeeds in dragging our hero into a big mess.Hanks' Sully is a quiet and a bit of a surly character. One doesn't seem to see much of an extrovert there. He does his job, the best he can, and he displays plenty of heart and integrity, a quality that comes in full display when he faces the investigative panel. He's sure to remind them that there is more to the aviation industry than relying on machines. He reminds us of the stars of the past, and if you think it's impossible to show another Hanks' character who shows what it means to show the best of humanity.The film is short but packs plenty of emotions. We see the torture and self-doubt, the aftermath and the trauma that Sully undergoes. The slow revelation of who his character really is. We see his exchanges with his family, with his colleagues, and with his opponents. We see subtle changes, but all of them are just facets of a complete person.The technical moments of the film are perfect reproductions of the event. We see the moments before, during, and the crucial rescue moments after the landing. We become completely aware of the pain, the fear, and the horror that the impending threat of death feels like. It's Eastwood's at his best, showing a drama, a thriller, and a character study, all in one.",Sully
95,peterp-450-298716,Another plane crash ... this time the pilot wasn't drunk.,5,22 December 2016,"""There was no time for calculating. I had relied on my experience of managing the altitude and speed of thousand of flights over four decades. I eyeballed it.""Respect for the pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger who set down an Airbus in the middle of the Hudson River in 2009 and miraculously managed to ensure the safety of the 155 passengers. A true feat which was only possible due to his years of experience as a pilot. Otherwise, this almost impossible maneuver would never have happened. With all its consequences. And all this because of a flock of geese, who didn't know about the traffic rule involving vehicles coming from the right, and who were massively sucked into the turbine engines. As a result those engines stopped working. And that's when the sh*t hit the fan. But thanks to the pilot Sully (Tom Hanks) who could stay calm under such stressful circumstances and who took the ultimate right decision, worse could be avoided. Though he couldn't control the media storm and criticism he had to endure afterwards. Despite his years of experience as a pilot. But he manages to save his reputation by an inspiring thought at the last minute.Again, all respect for the pilot. But surf around a bit on the internet and you'll find a whole range of films in which a pilot needs to do all kind of stunts to land his plane safely. The world seems to be littered with strategically bad placed runways. Every time a pilot approaches it he breaks out into a cold sweat. Or you'll see a Boeing landing almost sideways because of strong crosswinds. I'm convinced there were numerous heroic landings carried out anywhere in the world where a decision was made on a whim. Hopefully there won't be a movie in the future of each incident. You feel already which way I'm heading? Despite a top cast, with as always a magnificent Tom Hanks, a living legend in the director's chair (Clint Eastwood of course) and some spectacular images of the emergency landing, this film still is a bit ordinary. It's not really so impressive in terms of content. Plane in trouble. The pilot decides to land it in an unconventional place. Experts and insurance companies suggest he made an error of judgment. And finally it's waiting for the verdict of this committee. Nothing that special.Luckily they showed the forced landing multiple times out of different perspectives. Otherwise ""Sully"" would be a high-quality short film. The images of the disaster are scattered throughout the film. So you can expect a whole series of flashbacks. Not only flashbacks of the real situation but also some of Sully's nightmares with a more destructive outcome. Besides these images we see an old-timer who starts to doubt the correctness of his decision. And an arsenal of experts who are only too happy to prove that he made a professional mistake. Of course the main motivation for this research is that no insurance claims need to be payed. Actually, it's rather pathetic and shameful how they are trying to discredit a reliable pilot who had an error-free and honorable career, by using thoughtless allegations. A reflection of the disrespectful nature of today's society. I found it strange that a man like Sully ,after a successful career, apparently still would have financial difficulties because of this incident.It's no effort for Tom Hanks to play a perfect role. And with the right props and make-up he looks exactly like the real Sullenberger. But honestly, Hanks acts on autopilot (which in turn is very appropriate for this film). In other words, sublime, but in safe mode. I thought the inquiry committee was an extremely interesting group of actors. In real they are just a bunch of nitpickers without a shred of respect. It felt as if it was a mixture of people from other sectors, who had no knowledge about aviation and they didn't have the ingenuity to think about that single key factor which undermined their whole theory. Consequently, I was annoyed by their arrogance and felt a malicious delight after their defeat. Aaron Eckhart, Sully's co-pilot, also played a modest and fairly calm role (with an impressive mustache). ""Sully"" isn't really a spectacle film. And in terms of drama, it's also not quite overwhelming. That's probably why they portrayed the crash several times. But Sully being a hero, is beyond dispute. However, his heroic deed was more heroic than making this standard documentary-like film.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Sully
96,AudioFileZ,This Time An American Hero That's Hard To Fault,8,15 September 2016,"Once more Clint Eastwood turns his lens on a unique American whose actions put him in a category of one. Like American Sniper's protagonist Chris Kyle, Sully's Chesley Sullenberger has steely nerves that enable him to make accurate decisions. This time the accolades won't be tied to controversy...or will they? In the early going we see the aftermath that ensued for Sullenberger as Eastwood chooses to segue ahead of the ""miracle"" forced landing. Tom Hanks, as Captain Sullenberger, ably portrays a man who believes in himself even as he is suffering from the trauma of an unbelievably risky nigh perfect water landing. The fact that he saved all 155 souls aboard may be the only thing that really matters to a man like Sullenberger, but he's a family man with a career to also protect. Still, Sully knows that even as he saved lives his own professional one will shortly be on the line. Honestly I did not realize how there were forces playing that would have liked to vilify such a, seemingly great, life saving captain. I get it now, as Eastwood has woven this other darker plot immediately into the otherwise upbeat story. By introducing this the way Eastwood has I realize that this is just as big as the actual landing. It's pretty clear that many factions stand to gain something by hanging fault on Sullenberger. Really? What's wrong with people. Here were have a horrendous disaster averted and someone is worrying about if the plane could have been saved along with the passengers? I guess that's life in the litigation lane?After this excellent setup the movie segues back to the the flight itself. For many of us this is what we've wanted to experience and it's pretty good even if the sheer terror of the passengers is not as palpable as I expected. The focus on the cockpit management is intense and revealing. You'll see shortly why Sully's decision was the only possible way an actual ""human"" could have managed the situation for a favorable outcome. The writers and Eastwood did an exceptional job here of recreating the hearing where things could have easily went against a lesser man than Chesley Sullenberger. If not for him it's likely all on board would have perished and if not for his sheer determination to prove the experts wrong he would have been hung out to dry living a shameful existence. You'll see why 38-secons a computer can't understand, but a human actually must have (this is the minimum the board allowed and its actually shy of the real decision time of almost 1 and a half minutes) 's the hinge on which everything turns. This is a brilliantly revealed error in the flight simulation of the plane: multiple failures only a seasoned pilot can manage to which the computerized simulator can't accurately process.I think this is a great look at the only successful (i.e. everyone on board lived) forced water landing of a wide body passenger jet. I think this kind of stuff is not easy to blend the humanity and the cold analytics together into a homogeneous whole. Clint Eastwood has managed this and it's possible he'll get a nod for the best director Academy Award even as these kind of stories seldom do. Tom Hanks, well, he's his usual amazing chameleon self. He eschews all Hollywood bombast and any kind of over-acting. He plays it close and tight to a man who is a very serious type with the skills to match. He is, for an hour and a half, Chesley Sullenberger, not Tom Hanks. That's a high compliment and it's easy to miss as he inhabits the character without interjecting any Hank-isms. He probably won't get the nomination for best actor simply because he is so controlled, like an exceptionally intuitive and disciplined man...like Captian Chesley Sullenberger.See the film and then see it again to soak in more of the gravity of what actually happened. It was called ""The Miracle On The Hudson"" to which this movie makes it clear that wasn't any news writer;s hyperbole. Just an amazing man who under the worst circumstance made the best outcome happen. I think this movie this point made well, plus it's truly uplifting.",Sully

We all know this is a compelling story and the actors involved have amazing acting clops but this comes off as a frat boy movie or something. You have Tom Hanks playing the straight laced, by the book dude and Aaron Eckhart playing his party animal side kick or something. What should have been a drama turns into the wacky adventures of an old goat and his crazy wingman bro with an epic mustache. But yeah, they really dropped the ball concerning the real story of Sully Sullenberger. After the whole ""miracle on the Hudson"" deal Sully heavily advocated for pilots rights and fare pay.

100,jadepietro,Hero Worship,8,10 September 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A bio-pic that tells its story concisely but lacks a real  emotional lift-off.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: The true story of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's emergency  water landing and its aftermath.   JIM'S REVIEW: Everyone needs a hero and Sully is the latest bio-pic  about an American idol. The story is well known, as is the outcome, but  as directed by Clint Eastwood, the film immerses the moviegoer in a  behind-the-scenes glimpse of Sully's saga. In January 2009, this  ordinary man successfully crash-landed his plane into the Hudson River,  saving all 155 lives on board. We witness this ""Miracle on the Hudson"",  and view the event both before and after the crash, or as Sully called  it, ""an emergency water landing"". Although the filmmakers smartly stage  the crash in multiple scenes via flashbacks and dream sequences, it  lands squarely on the dramatic after-effects that haunt this aviator.  As Sully and his crew are subjected to a thorough investigation by the  Federal Transportation Safety Board, who become the film heavies in  this movie, the film takes flight, even if it treads too lightly on its  subject.   Played by Tom Hanks, in common man mode, the film aligns us to our hero  from the start. From a competent screenplay by Todd Komarnick, which is  based on Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's own autobiography, there is an  imbalance of the facts by Mr. Eastwood that biases our judgment and  places the moviegoer in direct support of Sully and his actions,  without naturally questioning his decision-making process. (One wonders  if many passengers were injured or died during this crash if the same  public reaction would have happened. So to paint the FTSB as the fall  guys isn't very fair or logical. It is, after all, the procedure that  occurs with any aviation incident. However the doubt factor, flight  simulations, and conjecture of the inquiry does make for good conflict  and compelling personal drama.)  Solidly directed by Mr. Eastwood, the film is very well-crafted. The  CGI is effectively done. The acting by Mr. Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as  Sully's co-pilot, is strong. Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan, Mike O'Malley,  and an underused Laura Linney as Sully's wife are all fine in their  supporting roles.  Yet, emotionally, the film seemed to be stuck in auto-pilot for this  reviewer, a disconnect with the characters' traumatic circumstances.  The narrative structure doesn't follow a linear structure and has  issues with a choppiness as it jumps from the aftermath to the accident  itself and then back to Sully's past life. The episodic script never  quite lands, causing an aloofness in its clinical retelling. The many  plane crash sequences, shown from varying points of view, are overdone,  serving as pure filler.   While the film successfully establishes the personal tension of the  investigation quite effectively, it underplays the dramatic gravitas.  Were more of the screen time spent on this conflict, the film could  have been more directly involving. Less time spent on the actual impact  (of the plane) and more time spent on the personal stakes from the  results of plane crash would have been more powerful for this  moviegoer.  Still, Sully shows a vivid portrait of a nice guy, humble to a fault,  who was thrust into a dire life-and-death situation and survived to  tell his tale. Mr. Eastwood honors him and the first emergency  responders admirably. But depicting the man as less of a saint and more  of a human being could have made this film more believable and  thoroughly engaging. Yes it's a riveting and uplifting story but the  film plays it too safe, looking for that soft place to land.  NOTE: There is a lovely song written by Mr. Eastwood, called Flying  Home, during the end credits. Stay and have a listen.",Sully
101,rgkarim,Don't Sulk at Sully,8,9 September 2016,"It's a new weekend and that means a new wave of movies to flood the local theaters. Robbie K here starting the round with the latest drama based on real life events that centers on an American Hero named Captain Sullenberger. Yes, I'm talking about Sully, the film that once again delves into whether or not the pilot who landed on the husband is indeed a hero or a delusional zero. So fasten your seatbelts, make sure your trays are in the upright position, and cell phones off as we take flight into my review.LIKES:  The Realism  The insight into Sully's mind  Tom Hanks actingWhen you look into a movie based on true events you hope there is more truth than Hollywood fiction. Fortunately, this is one movie that puts reality before fantasy. Sully's 96 minute run time is a recreation of the treacherous nightmare that plagued the skies in 2009. Audience members will be wowed as they are dropped into the cockpit of the US airline flight as it soars into the Hudson. The combination of camera-work and modern computer technology will immerse you into the full experience, perhaps fooling you into thinking you are a passenger on the plane. In addition, the team manages to give you multiple perspectives of the flight, not only advancing the realism, but also adding more pieces to the proverbial puzzle. Yet, the other component that brings the realism is the airplane jargon that fills a majority of the dialogue. According to the retired pilot sitting next to me, Sully's writers were very accurate in the technology and maneuvers used to land the plane. Will most care about this component? Probably not, but this reviewer appreciated the extra effort to make this movie real. What helps provide more answers to the mystery though is getting a visualization of Sully's internal thoughts. Much like a book, our team was able to illustrate the dark fears that plagued our captain as he waits for the investigation to finish. These memories are well placed into the story, helping to develop Sully while also helping advance the plot in a timely manner. Those who have read the tale and hoping the movie will mirror it are certain to enjoy this presentation, and those who choose a less literature based approach will find this method entertaining and engaging. But of course the headliner of the movie is by far the legendary Tom Hanks playing Captain Sully. No surprise that Hanks is capable of bringing this role to life. Hanks certainly commits to his role and manages to mirror the reported personality of the Sully. His lines are delivered with grade A accuracy, and yours truly gives the actor props for handling the lead role with such a powerful performance that will most likely net him an Oscar. While most of the other cast certainly plays a hand in recreating this story, Hanks is by far bearing the brunt of the load and handles that responsibility quite well. DISLIKES:  The Drama Flare Added  Some perspectives not neededAs I sated, seldom is a movie safe from getting the dramatic touch added to the tale. Sully is no exception as some components take on that Hollywood magic to spice things up and make them more ""entertaining."" Some of this editing is in the nature of the crash itself, the dragged out drop to the river, support personnel going into near break downs to add a touch of sympathy, and even the rather stretched portrayal of Sully's wife. Yet all those moments are nothing compared to the direction they took the lead investigator Charles Porter. Instead of playing an agent just looking into the entire scenario, Porter's character was like the lead marauder in a witch hunt with a single-minded goal to bring Sully down. This could have been fine if this was the true character, or even if they mystery was deeper. Unfortunately, neither of these cases seem true, and Porter's stubborn as a mule attitude inspired nothing more than anger and eye rolling for me. The second dislike comes in the form of editing and the director's decisions to split the incident into so many perspectives. While I appreciate the integrated approach to fully envelop you into the moment, there were some components that really weren't necessary. One major moment was from the civilian perspective watching the plane come to land, or the random passenger trying to swim the cold waters due to their panic. I appreciate the realism in all manners of this flight, but these moments added little to me other than trying to expand the movie out to a longer run time. A minor error sure, but the editing could have been tapered down a bit to remove some of these pointless moments.The VERDICTWhen it comes to Sully, this reviewer has to give props to this movie. A realistic portrayal of the hero with fantastic acting and attention to detail are sure to attract the nonfiction lovers to the theaters for this one. Sure it could have found a home on Netflix or PBS as a 1 hour special, but I have to admit that this movie was one of the better productions I've seen in a while. So is it worth a trip to the theater? I would say yes, especially to pay tribute to Hanks' wonderful performance. The recommended audience is anyone in love with nonfiction/true stories, Tom Hanks fans, or those looking for another tale of a trip gone wrong (with Hanks again being the captain. Guess I won't be traveling with him anytime soon.)My scores are: Biography/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",Sully

It tells the story of a good man who tries his hardest to do what is right, only to be blindsided by a bureaucratic establishment that is more interested in rules and the bottom line than human welfare - which those rules should have been created to protect.

But in this movie, I felt that there was way too much filler until the last 15 minutes or so, the hearing, where things finally began to hold me.I blame the script. Granted, there is not a lot to this story, but still, it could have been paced and developed much better. Why do the man and the woman leading the investigation seem so hostile, only at the end to become in awe of Sullenberger's truly remarkable achievement? We see snippets of the lives of many of the passengers, the air traffic controller, some of the rescue crew, etc., but not enough to make any of them come alive as people. Is there a story behind the co-pilot? A few characters better developed would have been more interesting, to me, that many characters just hinted at.The acting here is all fine to very fine.

103,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Sully,8,11 September 2016,"Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood. What a winning combination. Hanks as usual, is Hanksian. Clint is of course, the Man With No Name. Together they give us the audience, a PG-13 version of 2012's Flight minus the notions of alcoholism and vapid drug use. Their film is titled Sully and excitedly, it is my latest review.Sully starts out mid-plot, starts out as non-linear, and feels a little draggy (no pun intended). It then turns to aviation while switching into high gear. So far it is one of this year's best films, a harrowing technical achievement, a fascinating recreation of events in the weakest of our economic times.Now unless you've been living in a cave for the last seven years, you'd know that Sully is based on a true story. Director Eastwood puts forth the behind the scenes stuff, the info you didn't get even though you might have watched all the news coverage back in January of 2009. So yeah, you probably know Sully's premise (a US Airways flight lands in the Hudson River), you probably know its outcome (155 passengers survive), and yes, you probably know the protagonist's fate (Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger is a hero, duh). It doesn't matter though. You're still riveted for much of the way.In terms of overseeing the vision and being faithful to Sully's fact- based material, well Clint Eastwood looks more and more like an aging genius everyday. He shoots this flick with a sense of lewd craft, a sense of realism, and a numbing sense of profound proficiency. He puts you the moviegoer, right in the middle of ""The Miracle on the Hudson"" (and I mean literally in the middle of it). You wonder how he was able to re-imagine two plane landing sequences (from two different points of view) with such authenticity, such panache. It's powerful stuff whether you figure it out or not. Also in Sully, he effectively includes scenes of aircraft simulation that are part of Sullenberger's character's public hearing. Again he's adroit and seamlessly technological. He's that kind of filmmaker.Add the veritable Tom Hanks as the essential everyman playing Chesley Sullenberger (Sullenberger is a more upper echelon everyman but still an everyman) and you have a total winner with Sully. Yup, I plan on seeing it again. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",Sully

But from another point of view, the story of the film is very simple, it can be said that the plot has no depth, especially reflected in the final hearing, a sentence to achieve a big turnaround. After watching it, there was even a feeling that it was a documentary rather than a commercial movie.",Sully
105,vengeance20,Impressive!,9,3 December 2016,"I was sort of mixed to excited about this film. Usually when it's a based-off-a-true story type I like it, but when it's directed by the likes of Clint Eastwood or Martin Scorsese you can't help but think that it's going to be overrated & more suited to older people or just a boring film that wins awards & aims to be boring in order to be great. But this film was actually really good!The film is about a pilot who lands a plane into the Hudson River in New York City after both turbine engines are destroyed when a flock full of birds fly directly into them shortly after take off on the 15th January 2009. The film then follows onto the court case Sully went through as they question why he chose to land the plane in the river & not fly back to the airport as instructed. The film goes through ups & downs but Sully succeeds in the end!Like I said, I really liked this film! It was really good & explained the story well, though it was a bit confusing at first & at some other points. I wanted to watch this film anyway as it was: A. Something new (I'm a cinema goer) & B. Because I heard good things about it, though was thinking & sort of predicting it was going to be overrated as films like this usually are. But this wasn't.I found the film to be quite good & very moving! It also locked you & kept you engrossed! I also liked the way Sully delivered the explanation of the flight simulation being invalid at the end of the film! It came out well & was exactly what I was also thinking as I was watching!It was surprisingly good & not something I'd say about a film of this calibre as I usually either write them off as overrated or crap! But this one was a pleasant surprise! And for once, I'm not being sarcastic!I overall would give this a film 9/10, it was well put together & really great watch! Go see it! It's great!",Sully
106,bkrauser-81-311064,Nuts-and-Bolts Filmmaking,7,9 September 2016,"Sully is based on what has popularly become known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson"". For those in need of a refresher, on January 15, 2009, flight 1549 from New York City's LaGuardia airport to Charlotte, hit a flock of birds during its ascent, losing both of its engines. Finding little recourse, pilot Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles made the fateful decision to make an emergency water landing. They glided their A320 Airbus into the frigid waters of the Hudson River. There were 5 serious injuries but thankfully all 155 passengers survived. Sully for his efforts was treated to a heroes welcome.Much like the protagonist, the film is a lean, workman-like movie that does it job, and does it amicably. The narrative bounces between POV recollections of the crash and the immediate aftermath which includes Sully (Hanks) and the rest of the crew shuttled between investigations and press junkets. To up the psychological stakes, Sully is coerced into second guessing himself by a National Transportation Safety Board investigation (which act as the default bad guys) all while exhibiting light symptoms of PTSD.Tom Hanks as our hero is yet again stellar playing a similar riff off the Captain Phillips (2013) playbook. At this point, the man playing personable everyday heroes has made him a movie genre onto himself. He's not so much a born madcap swashbuckler but rather a working stiff who always seems to be at the wrong place at the right time and relies on training and a breadth of experience to carry him through. As Sully, his inner turmoil as a guy more-or-less being blamed for doing the right thing, feels frightfully real.Director Clint Eastwood seems to take particular relish in conveying stories of this nature. Sully is a pulse-pounding story of a red- blooded modern American hero. One who became lionized for doing his job. Yet instead of gravitating towards the limelight, Sullenberger humbly accepted his newfound hero pilot status while quietly but assuredly backing up his decision-making. Likewise the film doesn't take victory laps or pounds its chest like some other Clint Eastwood directed film I can think of. Instead it lets the smart editing, clear and concise camera-work and nuts-and-bolts directing speak for itself.Unfortunately being a film resembling the clever terseness of Joe Friday can be a double-edged sword. Since it doesn't reach for the dramatic acme of Mystic River (2003) or the mythic majesty of Unforgiven (1992), Sully does have the propensity to feel second- rate. Additionally the NTSB board push-back, which pits the gutsy pilot against simulations, reeks less of John Henry populism and more of a veiled criticism of egg-heads and their darn computers. I suppose most films should have a villain and including Anna Gunn as the silently condescending adult in the room is a stroke of genius. But Sully's visions mixed with the largely unspoken but always present specter of 9/11 should have been enough to convey the stakes were plenty high on January 15, 2009.Sully is a taut, well made B-movie that is occasionally tense and always interesting. While it never reaches as high as it arguably should, it nevertheless makes for a fun time at the movies. The film ends with the real Captain Sully walking up to the plane fuselage which sits at the Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. He embraces a bunch of real 1549 passengers while centered on the screen and lighted like a canonized saint. Any other true-life character I'd say Clint's laying it on a bit thick, but this time I think I'll let it slide.",Sully
107,mike48128,"""Poetic license"" in the story takes it down one star. Tom Hanks is great.",9,11 February 2018,"Tom Hanks in Chesley Sullenburger. He becomes the character. What could have been a long drawn-out movie with only 10 minutes of serious action becomes a masterpiece under the watchful eye of Director Clint Eastwood. Some of the biographical details may seem like filler, but it's nice to know a little bit about the man after all the hype about the hero. An attempt is made to discredit the magnificent deed of saving all 155 on board the aircraft, by the National Safety Board. Apparently, the movie ruffled a few feathers high up, as it was claimed that the inquest ""did not exactly happen that way"". Indeed! That's because it all had to be compressed into a mere 96 minutes. That's in far less time that even one board hearing, I am sure. Spellbinding. Great storytelling. I ""believed"" that I was aboard the aircraft. The re-enactment was superb. ""Not a movie for those with a fear of flying""-says The New York Times Review.",Sully
108,Screen_Blitz,Tom Hanks is the revelation of this Clint Eastwood-driven biopic,8,2 January 2017,"Tom Hanks has soared as one of the most versatile actors in last few decades while Clint Eastwood on the other hand, has contributed as a major icon not only to Hollywood but American entertainment. So it is pretty easy to understand why many would have speculated a product of an actor like Tom Hanks and an ingenious filmmaker like Clint Eastwood. That is where this riveting drama centered on the major 2009 event known as ""The Miracle on The Hudson"" comes into place. Clint Eastwood conducts the astonishing story of commercial pilot Chelsey Sullenberger who made a daunting decision to land an airplane on Lake Hudson following a failure of plane engine, a decision that many would expect lead to tragedy but instead ended with unexpected triumph. A gray-haired Tom Hank stars as pilot Chelsey Sullenberger (nicknamed ""Sully"") in Clint Eastwood's retelling of January 15, 2009 when Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (played by Aaron Eckhart) were forced to make an emergency landing on the Lake Hudson after their plane engine was maliciously destroyed by a flock of geese in the air. When this fearsome stunt miraculously saves the lives of all 155 passengers on board, he is almost instantly held as a hero by the national public. However, Sullenberger also becomes a target of an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board that unexpectedly jeopardizes his career as well as his newly earned reputation.Clint Eastwood has a sense of livelihood in storytelling which he has best exhibited in his previous few entities. This one is almost equally as riveting as you could come to expect from a Clint Eastwood entry, though it follows a slightly odd story structure. This biopic opens with the titular man immediately in the plane in a jarring flashback of the aforementioned disaster, then the story strolls through the aftermath of the harrowing debacle as the man is almost senselessly falls under scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board. It is not until around the halfway point when we witness the mid-air catastrophe which is done realistically. With writer Todd Komarnicki providing a hefty hand for the script, the film paints a mesmerizing portrait of the heroism that defined Chelsey Sullenberger on that fateful day while shining clear light on how heroic actions don't always come without a cost. And without the need to villainize the National Board (at least not in an over-the-top way), Eastwood provides us with a sensible look at both legal and psychological repercussions that threaten to tear Sullenberger apart as the person the public deeply admired him as. As the story moves on, Clint Eastwood accomplishes the essential task of pushing depth of the lead character including the psychological aftermath that disturbs his inner being. On top of it all, the real revelation in the mix is Tom Hanks. Now pushing his sixties, Hanks strives with a powerful performance as the spirited lead character, a role that allows him to shine like gold. Though this does not mark the first time Hanks has ignited the role of a real-life tragic figure as he portrayed the titular role in Paul Greengrass's 'Captain Phillips' in 2013, he provides just enough emotional gravitas to make for a memorable role. Even if he doesn't quite pack the same visceral energy he did the 2013 biopic, his performance still demands for admiration.Sully is a riveting biographical drama blooming with the likeliness of Clint Eastwood's solid direction and Tom Hanks' blissful talent in the performance department. It is a moving picture that unfortunately doesn't quite fall in the crowd of Eastwood's most masterful features. But in the end, the film paints a smart, triumphant tribute to the heroic Chelsey Sullenberger, a man that many still admire to this day.",Sully

That's about all there is to this with a bit of a twist and a little up-close-and-personal B.S. In the end it was the damn birds. Birds are almost always the problem.I'm not much of a fan of Clint Eastwood movies but this is an example of doing a heck of a lot with very little. It has all the makings of an after-school special and a story that could have been adequately covered in 20 minutes. Eastwood was able to draw this out to an hour and a half group hug and tear-fest. It's a really, really good story but turning a few minutes of drama in the air and on the water into a feature film was a big stretch.

111,RNMorton,Hanks with just another home run,9,12 September 2016,"Who else to pick to play US Airlines hero pilot Sullivan other than Tom Hanks, the theatrical Everyman of our generation? Henry Fonda did this sort of thing when I was a kid, but I was never a big Fonda guy. Hanks is fine as the modest but competent pilot excelling under extreme pressure. This was a short movie, and rightfully so. The real drama is in the reenactment of the forced water landing (don't use the ""c"" word) which takes all of about 3 minutes in real time. But don't be surprised when you don't see all the excitement up front. The screenplay, artfully done, doles out the thrills throughout the movie. So Hanks and Eckhart are great as the pilots, the persons playing the NTSB officials investigating the near-crash do a nice job although their attitude is a little over the top. Even before reading a recent article about NTSB response to the movie, I was wondering if the NTSB's attitude was a bit overplayed. This movie needed a couple of important lines to express NTSB concern, including ""we are mandated to look at everything when a forced landing occurs, and discount the possibility of pilot error""; along with ""landing on the Hudson is a last choice, we have to fully explore whether the plane could have returned safely to the airport"". You don't get quite enough of that here. There is a difference between a complete and thorough investigation and a witch-hunt; and we need to look at possible pilot error not just for evaluating the pilots in question but as a learning experience for all pilots going forward. But the movie as it is plays out nicely, all the bells and whistles are out, and the scenes through the credits of the actual pilot and passengers were much appreciated.",Sully

113,areatw,Great story but the film left me cold,6,10 December 2017,"True stories are always the best stories and Chesley Sullenberger's is certainly an extraordinary one. The film tells the story of the pilot of a doomed flight, whose skills and quick thinking saved all lives onboard. It's a remarkable story, though I do feel the film didn't do it full justice. It felt more like a quick fix rather than a proper account of the events that occurred. Too much of the film is set in the aftermath and as a result, it isn't the heart in mouth drama that it should have been.Tom Hanks is excellent, as he always is, though I much preferred him in the similar 'Captain Phillips'. His character was a lot more vulnerable in that film and it also did a much better job at building tension. While there is certainly tension in 'Sully', it is restricted to only a few scenes and the cutting back and forth doesn't help at all.

114,proud_luddite,Eastwood and Hanks are a great combo,7,29 March 2018,"Based on the true story of the 2009 emergency airplane landing in New York's Hudson River: the events following the rescue include a hearing at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) which claims that the plane might have landed safely at a nearby airport and avoided endangering those on board.""Sully"" was based on the book ""Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters"" by Chesley Sullenberger (aka Sully, the flight's captain) and Jeffrey Zaslow.The choice of narrative structure was wisely chosen. Instead of beginning with the main event itself, the film starts with the beginning of the NTSB hearings and later shows the emergency landing in flashback. This sets up an unexpected focus: instead of highlighting heroism, the film concentrates on the problems the event triggered and the inner turmoil of Sully himself.This movie works mainly because it is in the hands of two very able and trusted stalwarts: director Clint Eastwood and lead actor Tom Hanks. The simulation of the emergency landing is as thrilling as expected but there is just as much tension in the NTSB hearings. Here, the viewer is able to see the character behind someone (Sully) who can be extraordinary as he fights back but in a calm way; someone who thinks well and quickly; and also shows humility to acknowledge everyone's participation in the successful rescue rather than letting himself be singled out. Only someone with the depth and experience of Hanks could pull this off so well.The closing credits add a special bonus to this fine film. As it has already been mentioned: during that infamous decade, New Yorkers needed good news like this - especially news involving an airplane. - dbamateurcritic",Sully
115,blott2319-1,"Good storytelling, but nothing really special",7,28 September 2021,"I like that Sully took a somewhat different approach to retelling the story of ""The Miracle on the Hudson."" Rather than walking us through the events one-by-one, they instead start you with the inkling that mistakes might have been made. Allowing us as the audience to discover the truth of that short flight through the process of the investigation into the pilot, and the decisions he made, is quite interesting. The movie does fall a little too deep into idolizing Sully, but I still felt they were fair in presenting why some people might have doubts about what he did at the time. The entire film is shot well, and I quite liked how they handled the actual reenactment of the water landing. At this point in time we are so overwhelmed by the quality of CGI effects that the great ones don't stand out all that much, but I have to say that these were seamless for me. It was cool to see the retelling of this well-publicized event, and I appreciated that they showed the actual people at the end, so you knew about all the lives that were impacted by Sully. It's a heartwarming film, and while it may not have anything to make it truly outstanding, it was well worth watching. I could easily see myself watching Sully again for some good comfort-viewing.",Sully
116,maurice_yacowar,Sully lands plane on Hudson River and satisfies cynical committee,7,8 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood's take on the Disaster film incidentally explains why he has endorsed Donald Trump for president.The film has the usual air disaster film conventions: the cross-section passenger list, the heroic captain, the beautiful and helpful stewardi, the crash threat, experience and survival. But Eastwood makes four radical changes. As usual, the meaning lies in how the director inflects the genre conventions.One, he puts the crash and survival at the beginning. The suspense is therefore not rooted in the passengers' experience when Canada Geese choke and knock out both engines, necessitating an emergency landing. Instead the suspense lies in the government committee's ensuing enquiry into whether Captain Chesley Sullenberger made the right decision when he opted to land his 155 passengers on the chilly Hudson River instead of trying to get back to LaGuardia. Two, instead of the usual tensions and even spats that usually erupt in a threatened flight film, this one depicts a harmonious community. It explicitly pays homage to New York City, its efficient and effective response teams, the community spirit not just on the plane but beyond, in the city-wide celebration of Captain Sully and his amazing landing. A bartender gives him the drink, The Sully, he invented: two shots of Grey Goose and a splash of water. Three, the central focus is not on any passenger but on the captain. The 2009 events are intercut with memories of Sully's earlier experiences, nightmares of what might have happened on that fateful flight, and hallucinations of the plane searing through Manhattan buildings. Instead of showing the passengers' faith being tested here it's the captain's, as the formal investigation into his conduct threatens his family's security, his 40-year career, and his own faith in his judgment.Four, the film revives the spirit of Eastwood's Dirty Harry in a sanitized manner. As Clint's Callahan tossed away the law book to operate on his own instincts, Tom Hanks's Sully eschews the operations manual in the 206 seconds he has to make his decision. He instead ""eyeballs"" the problem and follows his instincts. And that's where the film coheres with Eastwood's endorsement of Donald Trump. The villains here are the government's investigating committee that goes by the book, that uses fancy high falutin' stuff like computer simulations, pilot re-enactments, estimations of lost machinery, and the la-dee-dah like to cast aspersions on the ""hero"" who simply followed his ""instincts."" In Eastwood's (and little Donnie's) book, government committees, checks and regulations only interfere in people's lives and keep a Good Man from Doing the Right Thing by following his gut. That's why Eastwood ran for mayor of Carmel — to get rid of all the red tape in municipal admin — and that's why the ostensibly successful multiple bankruptcy blatantly lying Trump gets Eastwood's vote. As Trump ""loves the uneducated people"" Eastwood bets on the man of instinct. It's a very personal story for Clint. Hence his closing song: ""You tell me your story, I'll tell you mine."" It's Sully's but also Clint's.",Sully

Plane accidents rarely end up well at all and recreating them would be a downer. Alive comes to mind but it was survival story after the crash and does not end up well for most of them. Sully is basically the story of what can happen when the best of them comes together and are in the right place to do so. A great occasion to be bright and heroic. In the dvd extras, they mention the contrast with the market crash and the greed normally prevalent in NY city, causing it.

I did the best I could."" His wife knows he did. We do as well. On January 15, 2009 Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed the crippled US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew. Director Clint Eastwood tells the hero's story in ""Sully"", one of his best movies. Eastwood's direction and Tom Hanks as Sully are stark and powerful in understatement. They honor all the heroes of the US Airways Flight. ""Sully"" is lean, clean, and inspiring—much like Eastwood. The conflict in ""Sully"" centers upon the investigation of whether Sully made the right choice. Hanks's authenticity and humility evoke Sully's strength and compassion. He reminds us that Sully did his best, and he got it right. ""Sully"" is one of the best movies of the year. ""Sully"" follows the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the airplane landing on the Hudson River. Todd Komarnicki's screenplay based on the book by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow seamlessly intertwines flashbacks from the water landing, and the NTSB proceedings. Eastwood effortlessly orchestrates the narrative of the startling images of the landing and the irony of the investigation. The visual effects of the plane landing on the Hudson are spectacular. Cinematographer Tom Stern captures the impact on a very personal scale. Water flooding the cabin. Sully and crew racing into action getting the passengers to safety. We see the fear in everyone's face, and the courage to get through. We are in awe. Eastwood and Komarnicki graciously acknowledge the community of heroes: from the ferry boat crew at the scene, the Coast Guard divers, to all the first responders and the police. And it starts with Sully. He has his anchors of support. Aaron Eckhart is loyal and solid as First Officer Jeff Skiles. He was his invaluable right hand during the unthinkable, and during the investigation. Just minutes into the flight, birds collide with the plane's engines. Sully notices that they lost thrust in both engines, forcing them to choose an emergency landing. Eckhart is smart and subtle in his unwavering support of Hank's Sully through it all. Laura Linney amazes as Sully's wife Lorraine, his emotional rock. Sully has his doubts, and she is always there for him. Linney is relegated by the story to phone conversations with Sully. She beautifully accentuates that what Sully does sources from their profound relationship. That also goes for Eckhart. They all see the best in each other. At the story arc Hanks as Sully graciously acknowledges all the heroes involved. We are also present to that he is catalyst for heroes emerging. Everyone involved was grateful to Sully. Eastwood is succinct in the irony of it all. Sully did his best, and saved 155 people. The NTSB scrutinized whether there were other viable alternatives. What Sully did worked in an unprecedented crisis. Period.The music in ""Sully"" both eloquently highlights and undercuts the range of emotions. Christian Jacob and the Tierney Sutton Band composed the score from Clint Eastwood's musical theme. The music's clarity and simplicity embody the movie's quiet heroism.""Sully"" is beautiful simplicity and power. Eastwood and Hanks celebrate people selflessly doing their best to make a difference. One of the measures of a hero is that he or she acknowledges and inspires other heroes. ""Sully"" does all that and more. It is one of the best movies of the year.",Sully
119,RforFilm,"The story of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" is interestingly recreated with grace in Sully",7,28 September 2016,"People often forget that when their riding an airplane (specifically, a commercial airliner), their sitting on top of a major carrier of fuel that it were to crash, would likely explode. This shouldn't discourage people from flying as such a profession requires finding everything that could go wrong and making sure nothing can happen. Aside from terrorists that have tragically used them as weapons, most plane crashes tend to be mechanical. Engineers before the takeoff can find most of these glitches. In the case of something going wrong in the air, most planes can simply head back to their original airport and try to land at a nearby one. If all of the above is available, then the people on the plane better hope that the pilot can find a place to land. Though these things rarely happen, most of these forced landings or crashes tend to end badly. Though there is the occasional miracle.In 2009, a US Airways plane was forced to make a water landing when their engine was struck by birds. Not only did the plane land alright, but Captain Chesley Sullenberger managed to save everyone on board. The story of that crash and the aftermath are the subject of Sully.As history is recreated, we see Captain Chesley Sullenberger (played by Tom Hanks) and his first Officer Jeffrey Skiles (played by Aaron Eckhart) getting ready to depart from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina. For Sully, this is just another routine flight in his thirty years of flying experience. He's discussed retirement soon so that he can spend more time with his wife Lorraine (played by Laura Linney) and his two daughters. Just as his flight is ascending, both engines are struck by a flock of birds, rendering them broken with the plane unable to restart them.He makes the decision to water land after deciding that trying to get back to LaGuardia or another airport was not doable. Though the crew and passengers are frightened, Sully manages to get them all out safely. Sully is seen as a hero by the press and get's several bookings to talk about it from Katie Couric to David Lettermen. Though suffering post traumatic stress and experiencing nightmares, he seems to be pulling through. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating whether Sully had made the right call and even holds a large meeting to determine whether his decision was correct or he should give up his wings (doing so would prevent retirement pension).Sully sounds straightforward and it pretty much is the kind of reenactment one would expect. Given the Hollywood budget, they manage give us a pretty good sequence of the plane landing in the water and the rescue of the people. Though a good part of the movie is about that crash, the real focus of the story is surrounding Sully's aftermath and the investigation he was under. With the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" story surrounding the press, I had no idea that Sully was questioned about his actions. Director Clint Eastwood brings the same dark style that he brought to Gran Torino and Jersey Boys and I think he finally understands that too much of it makes the experience unpleasant. The story is short at only an hour and a half, but it's the right length. Though it's story is good, the editing is very odd. There are several moments where it chooses to sporadically cut to Sully's youth or of the crash. Some are short, but some are very long, which makes you question just what the intention of the flow was. I think this would have been better had it been shown straightforward without the time jumps.I'll give this seven airline captains hats out of ten. In the end, I was glad that I saw this miracle on the Hudson story to life. While not necessarily a strong commentary about the airline industry nor a dive into captain psyche, Sully is an engaging story about one man's decision. Plus with Tom Hanks, you know you're gonna get a good performance. I'd say check it out if you heard about the story and wanted to know more. Board on and hope for the best.",Sully

121,bankofmarquis,Solidly and Professionally made and acted film,8,13 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks throws the first punches in the 2016 Oscar battle with this very good drama about hero pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger who successfully landed his US Airways plane in the Hudson river after both engines were taken out by birds.Professionally and economically directed by Eastwood, this film focuses on the NTSB investigation into the landing and could Sully have flown the plane to a nearby airport?The answer is never really in doubt as we all know what happened and Eastwood casts ""Mr. Trustworthy"" Tom Hanks in the title role, so when the NTSB questions Sully's instincts and decisions, Hanks/Sully responds that he KNEW he did the right thing, we - as the audience - never doubt him as well.This movie shows a director and an actor in lockstep with each other and both showing that they ""still have it"". Let's start with Hanks (and the other actors). The whole cast is excellent. Hanks, of course, takes us along for the ride and he says more with a look of determination and a squint of his eye than most actors can with a thousand words and gestures. His Sullenberg is a real human being, with doubts and troubles, but strong and in command. Hanks is ably assisted by Aaron Eckhardt as co-pilot Jeff Skiles. To be honest, I find Eckhardt's acting to be pedestrian - not bad, not great, pretty middle of the road - but he is as good as I have seen him in this role. I think it is because he has to elevate his game in riding side saddle to Hanks, and step up he does. Laura Linney (as Sully's wife) and Holt McCallany (as Sully and Skiles Union Rep) also give strong, solid performances. Only the trio of NTSB investigators - Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn and Jamie Sheridan - fair poorly, but I think that is because the script really draws them with heavy, villainous lines - lines that need to be drawn to give the film some dramatic tension - but lines that do turn these three into caricatures, not human beings.But that small quibble can be forgiven because of the solid, workmanlike direction of Eastwood. This movie is short, compact and solid - nary a scene too long or extraneous word of dialogue in the film. Eastwood, wisely, knows that the tension in this film is NOT whether or net Sully is cleared by the NTSB, but by the 208 seconds of the flight from the bird strike to landing and Eastwood films this so well and so precisely that I was glued to my seat, even though I knew what happened and how it ended. For good measure, Eastwood goes through that 208 seconds a 2nd time and I was just as glued to my seat that time as well!A strong effort from Eastwood and Hanks, one that you will enjoy viewing.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Sully
122,Anurag-Shetty,A remarkable movie about a real-life hero.,10,14 September 2016,"Sully is a biopic about, pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger(Tom Hanks). Sully & his First Officer Jeff Skiles(Aaron Eckhart) have no choice but, to land US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson river. This is due to a dual engine failure. Despite all of this, Captain Sully & First Officer Skiles saved the lives of all 155 passengers on-board the aircraft. This is due to Sully's last-minute unorthodox decision, to land the aircraft on the Hudson river. However, the aviation authorities question his decision. Sully is a sensational film. Clint Eastwood has directed yet another masterpiece, after American Sniper(2014). The most fascinating aspect of this movie is that, it is based on a true story. The visual effects department has flawlessly depicted, how Captain Sully & First Officer Skiles made a successful emergency landing on the Hudson river. The fact that they shot several scenes at the actual locations, definitely solidifies the authenticity of the film. The background score by Christian Jacob & Tierney Sutton Band is subtle yet memorable. The performances are the highlight of the film. Tom Hanks steals the show as Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger. Hanks portrays Sully's subtle change in emotions throughout the movie, effortlessly. Aaron Eckhart is fantastic as Jeff Skiles. Eckhart adds a little bit of much needed wit to the film. Laura Linney is spectacular as Lorraine Sullenberger. Mike O'Malley, Jamey Sheridan & Anna Gunn are great as Charles Porter, Ben Edwards & Elizabeth Davis, respectively. The actors that played the passengers & crew of Flight 1539, are brilliant as well. Sully is a feel-good film. Go for it, immediately!",Sully
123,rbrb,A Real Hero....vs. little paper pushing people......,8,9 September 2016,"This movie is engrossing and deserves a high vote.It is based on true events, when a passenger plane needed to make an emergency landing in a city lake. Without doubt the hero of the event was the planes captain.Believe it or not there are a lot of people especially world wide who never heard of the events portrayed in the movie as at the time it was a sensation all over the planet.At first I was puzzled as to why the movie makers instead of putting the attempted plane landing at the center of the picture, concentrated on the awful bureaucrats from the airline safety board who were it seems trying perhaps unfairly to find the captain at fault.However my research suggests that from the perspective of both the captain and co-pilot they felt they were being investigated in such a way that if they could be blamed for what happened, they would be; hence the movie takes the point of view of the captain and co-pilot.Both the attempted landing and the investigation are certainly compelling viewing.The lead actor gives a fine yet restrained performance.Even if the decision to land on the lake was not the only alternative the captain is a Real Hero.All in all, I give this picture 7 and a half, rounded up so:8/10.",Sully
124,dave-mcclain,"National treasures Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood tell the story of another national treasure, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger.",8,13 September 2016,"Many people remember, or have at least heard of, the ""Miracle on the Hudson"", the 2009 landing of a disabled passenger jet on the Hudson River by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, resulting in the survival of all of the plane's passengers and crew. But how much do we really know about the incident? In most cases, probably not much more than what was in that first sentence. That's what makes the story such a great idea for a movie. With Todd Komarnicki's adaptation of Sullenburger's 2009 memoir ""Highest Duty"" as their guide, director Clint Eastwood and star Tom Hanks bring us the behind-the-scenes story of this incredible water landing and its aftermath in the drama ""Sully"" (PG-13, 1:35).The film opens with a plane crash scene. It's a literal nightmare of Captain Sullenberger (Hanks), who is haunted by his experience of landing his airliner on the Hudson River – and what might have happened if things had gone differently. Different scenarios play out in Sully's head as he sleeps – and also while he's awake, forced to relive the incident by NTSB investigators. Their questions and the facts about the ""crash"" (as they call it, ""forced water landing"", as Sully calls it) lead Sully to second-guess himself and his actions, even as he is being hailed in the media and in person as a hero and he is being wholeheartedly supported by his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (Laura Linney), via telephone from their California home.As the investigators (played by Mike O'Malley, Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn) repeatedly interview Sully and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), we hear information and arguments which will make most Movie Fans question whether Sully made the right call and whether he really is a hero. As Sully alternately struggles with those same issues and reaffirms his version of events for the skeptical investigators, we also see that short flight reenacted, from different perspectives and with more and more of the story coming to light. We also get a taste of the media frenzy which surrounded Sully and his family, and see flashback scenes of Sully's earlier experiences flying as a teenager and in the military.The combination of the vast movie-making experience of Eastwood (directing his 35th feature) and Hanks (with over 30 years' worth of films on his resume) has resulted in an interesting and well-conceived telling of Sully's experiences. Much like the NTSB investigation at the center of the story, the film uses what most of us didn't know about the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" to dramatic effect, telling the untold story as if peeling back the layers of an onion. Besides a more complete picture of this incredible incident (and another reminder of how talented Eastwood and Hanks are), the film also gives us a subtle but profound reminder that there is, and never will be, a substitute for human experience, intuition and guts. ""Sully"" may not be a thrill-a-minute movie, but it uses every one of its 95 minutes very well. ""A-""",Sully
125,agmoldham,Hanks is so watchable,6,8 December 2016,"There aren't that many actors around at the moment who are guaranteed to swell the box office, but Tom Hanks is certainly one of them. Regardless of the role Hanks is just so watchable.Sully tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger who captained the US Airways flight that landed on the Hudson. There is always an issue with a movie based on a real event (especially when it's so recent) as everyone knows what is going to happen. I wasn't certain exactly about the length of the flight, but was pretty sure beforehand that it was less than 10 minutes. The obvious question is how can this be stretched out into a feature movie. This is achieved by basing the movie on the 'crash' investigation. Whilst this is a little clunky at time it mostly works. As ever Hanks is excellent in the lead role and it's nice that the real life people had a little cameo at the end of the movie. If you like Hanks you'll enjoy the movie.",Sully
126,swilliky,Sully is a great movie about an extraordinary event,8,10 September 2016,"Fall movie season kicks off with the extraordinary recounting of the true event known as the Miracle on the Hudson. Sully recounts the water landing through flashbacks and memories of Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks). Clint Eastwood directs this surprisingly entertaining and emotionally movie film that will be tough competition as we transfer into Oscar territory. Hanks is brilliant as the calm, yet self-doubting pilot, and gives Sully a charisma that this American hero deserves, especially in such troubling times.The visuals of the plan soaring over New York City with two engines smoking. Eastwood puts audiences on the plane or as pedestrian onlookers as the plane declines reminding everyone of the tragic events that happened nearly 8 years before. The timing of the release seems planned to pull at the heartstrings of American audiences and help us realize the disaster that was avoided because of the quick thinking of the captain and the emergency crews in New York.I was unsure of how this movie would fill two hours and though it is a little shorter than usual awards bait, every scene is important and at no point was I bored and found myself blinking away tears or on the edge of my seat for plenty of scenes throughout. The hearings pit computers versus man and Sullenberger is unyielding in his certainty that he made the right decision, at least in public though he shows doubts in his conversations with his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (Laura Linney).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Sully
127,Rob-O-Cop,"Hanks delivers quality, Eastwood delivers old man Hollywood clichés",6,30 March 2017,"This is a great story and Hanks and Ekhart deliver strong performances, and that really should be enough to make a great movie but sprinkled throughout it are cliché shot after cliché dialog. Sully jogs, and 'thinks', almost getting hit by a cab driver who delivers a cliché cab driver line. Lot's of cliché 'thinking' shots cos we've got to know that Sully is 'thinking'. It just comes across as uninspired obvious film making and we should be seeing better from Eastwood and whoever wrote the script. Eastwood and script writer also choose to manufacture confrontation when in the original story it wasn't there, showing they fell short on the skill and ability to tell an exciting story about decent good people doing good things in difficult situations without making stuff up. Artistic license is in how you tell the story, not the details of it. Maybe it's time Eastwood retired to day time telly making,",Sully
128,bob-the-movie-man,"No, not ""Monsters Inc 3""",7,8 December 2016,"Chesley Sullenberger was just a very experienced US Airways pilot starting an everyday job flying from LaGuardia airport in New York to Charlotte when fate stepped in. Following an extensive bird strike and the loss of both engines, 'Sully' achieved worldwide fame by landing his aircraft and all 151 passengers and crew safely on the Hudson river. Sully is immediately acclaimed by the public as a hero; US Airways, and their insurers, however, are not necessarily as impressed given that their plane has got rather soggy when the flight data suggests it might have actually been able to make it to a landing at a number of nearby airports. So a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) inquiry is called, where a decision against Sully could see him facing the fastest fall from grace since Icarus.This film is obviously based on this real-life 'Miracle on the Hudson' and to a large extent the recreation of the crash. sorry ""forced water landing"" is both vivid and gripping. The film is certainly unlikely to make the regular list of in-flight movies for nervous passengers, but it does serve as a good training film for all of those regular airline passengers who don't ""put down their reading materials"" to listen to the aircraft safety announcement. Director Clint Eastwood has delivered a highly watchable action sequence showcasing the undisputed acting talents of Tom Hanks (playing Sully) and his Aaron Eckhard (""Olympus Has Fallen"", playing the co-pilot Jeff Skiles). This makes for a great 45 minute film. The problem is the other 51 minutes. Where the film works well – aside from the actual recreation itself – is in representing the post-traumatic stress experienced by Sully, with his insomnia and regular flashbacks of 'what might have happened' (anyone still strongly affected by 9/11 will struggle with these scenes). The final NTSB hearing scenes are also well-done and suitably gripping: particularly for viewers outside of the UK where we wouldn't have heard the outcome of the affair once the news cycle had moved on from the 'gee- whizz' headline event. Where the film aquaplanes somewhat is in the padding achieved through multiple (MULTIPLE!) scenes of New Yorkers back-slapping Sully. Some of this is needed to establish the pedestal that Sully is set upon: the bar scene, for example, is well done. But all the rest of the references become just plain tiresome. There is also a back-story focused on Sully's financial problems and rather scratchy marriage (as portrayed) to Lorraine (Laura Linney). Linney is normally a highly-watchable actress, but here her character is just so irritating that the mood of the film plummets every time she reappears on screen.The key problem that screenwriter Todd Komarnicki (""Elf""!!) had here is the obvious one: that as a real-event (based on Sullenberger's own book ""Highest Duty"") he would have had more scope to build tension if the flight had lasted more than 208 seconds! We end up with little visibility into the back-stories of the passengers. We get to see a father and two grown-up sons who – as fate would have it – just manage to catch the doomed plane: and we end up caring what happens to them. But this approach could have perhaps been usefully extended to feature more of the passenger back-stories (without getting the full ""Airport"" soap treatment).Clint Eastwood is also clearly an All-American patriot, and in common with some of his other films he can't help himself from putting up rather soupy statements about the self-sacrifice of New Yorkers (""the best of New York came together""): when actually the rescue teams did what they were paid to do and Ferry captains did what you or I would do if we stumbled on the scene! These sentiments might go down well in the States: in the cynical UK they tend to generate snorts of irritation.What IS nice are a couple of scenes during the closing credits where the real Sully, Skiles, cabin-crew and passengers appear together in a celebration of continued life against all the odds. And just so you are aware, this is done as two separate segments during the titles, so if you don't want to be one of those people standing in the aisles with your coat half on, then wait for the second one!A curate's egg of a film: great in places, but overall not as well executed as it could have been.

130,bryank-04844,I'd ride with 'Sully' anytime.,7,23 January 2017,"We all remember what took place in New York on January 15th, 2009. Pilots Captain Chelsey 'Sully' Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles took an Airbus A320 with 155 passengers aboard out of LaGuardia Airport to their destination. However, a couple of minutes after takeoff, a freak accident with a flock of birds took out both engines of the airplane, leaving the Airbus without any power and no airport immediately in range to land. Making a calculated decision to save everyone's life, Sully was forced to land the plane in the very cold waters of the Hudson River.Nobody was seriously hurt or injured and everyone survived and escaped the sinking plane with Sully and Skiles being the last off the plane, making sure everyone was safely rescued. Sully became a national and world hero for his calm and collected demeanor and quick thinking to save everyone's life. That actually happened almost eight years ago. A character in the film says, ""It's been a while since New York had news this good, especially with airplane in it"", which is the overall feel of the film. Directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and a river of cameos, this docu-drama is a feel good film about a man who emulates the golden age of Hollywood heroes in film, but in real life in this case. Captain Sully is ""just doing his job"", and doesn't see himself as a hero.He is good at his job, is a good family man, and always does the right thing, which is something we used to see in the old Hollywood films. He is always calm, collected, and polite, no matter the issue or obstacle, which is one of the main reasons this true story turned out the way it did. And that is how Eastwood tells this story. 'Sully' has a lot of similarities tot he Denzel Washington film 'Flight', in that both films have a forced airplane landing shortly after takeoff where there are a ton of survivors. Both films have investigations into the pilots on their decisions, but 'Sully' is basically the complete opposite of 'Flight' in that Denzel's character was dealing with some strong personal issues after the first ten minutes of the film where we see the forced landing.In 'Sully', Captain Sullenberger (Hanks) is basically the perfect man and we don't have to see him deal with his demons, other than his long jogs at night around Mnahattan, as the press hounds him and his family at home about being a hero, as well as if his decisions were the right ones. This is Eastwood's shortest film, running in at 96 minutes. The story is straight and to the point and doesn't lollygag with any side tangents. Eastwood shows us the forced water landing in the Hudson twice from different perspectives throughout the film, which gives the movie a great pace, instead of showing the whole thing in the first few minutes, followed by 85 minutes of an investigation.The forced landing sequences itself are shot very well with every detail getting on screen. The suspense and tension are at an all-time high, even though you know everything and everyone turn out okay. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are both excellent in their roles and every cameo does a great job too. Eastwood shows again that he is a master at his craft and is showing no sign of slowing down with 'Sully'. Stay tuned for the credits for a recent reunion with the real Sullenberger and survivors that might call on some tears.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Sully

From the well trained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Its about the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen.

They are followed by a brief video with real people from that day including the passengers and Captain Sullenburger. As the credits roll, there is a reuniting scene with the passengers and crew. Another scene follows shortly with Sully's wife talking briefly about what has been going on at their home since the miraculous landing on the Hudson River What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tell itself. when a hero comes along and flies a plane and to land on water a miracle Specifically real with the water landing itself.

All 155 passengers survive but the airplane is lost and the film depicts the investigation and the hearing where they try to prove that Sully was the cause of the accident to avoid insurance losses. Several computer simulations indicate that Sully could have returned safely to the airport. Needless to say Sully was able to argue, present his own perspective and prove his innocence.

So there are these little sub plots throughout the film that kinda go nowhere. And the main storyline of the trial doesn't feel all that fleshed out. And lastly, the timeline felt very stiched together. It felt like they originally wanted to start with the crash scene.

134,virek213,Human Heroism Done Right,10,9 September 2016,"It was an aviation event the likes of which few, if any, in the world could ever recall happening. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549, bound from New York's LaGuardia International Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina, was hit by a large flock of birds just thirty seconds after takeoff. The bird strike disabled and damaged both of the jet's engines; and though it managed to keep flight for another three minutes, there was no way it could return to LaGuardia, or make any attempts at an emergency landing at either JFK, Newark, or nearby Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. The flight's captain, Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, made the split-second decision to ditch the aircraft in the Hudson River, rather than risk flying into any buildings. Incredibly, the aircraft, though damaged by the bird strikes and the water landing, stayed afloat long enough for rescue personnel to save the lives of all 155 people on that flight, an operation that took only twenty-four minutes in all. The incident has been into the highly engaging cinematic docudrama SULLY.Based on the book ""Highest Duty"" by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow, the film, as directed by Clint Eastwood (who some time back traded his acting career for one focused solely on direction, though he had been doing both on and off since 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME), focuses in on the pressures that Sullenberger, excellently played by Tom Hanks (as always), underwent in the months following the crash. The media attention was enormous, but it was also highly scrutinizing as well. And in those months, Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) went before a seemingly endless battery of hearings conducted by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transpiration Safety Board as to whether Sullenberger's judgment on that day was sound, given that flight simulations supposedly had shown that the plane could have accomplished either one of the four scenarios (return to LaGuardia; landing at JFK; Newark; or Teterboro) while achieving the same result that Hanks and Eckhart had achieved. But in the testimony the two men give, Hanks argues that the basic human element was totally left out of those scenarios. From the moment the bird strikes happened until US Airways 1549 ditched into the Hudson River, there were only 208 seconds (three minutes and twenty-eight seconds); and in that time, trying to fly the disabled craft onto a dry runway was totally unrealistic and could have resulted in the deaths of all onboard and even more on the ground.Since restaging the actual saga of Flight 1549 would be a matter of getting all the details right, helped out by Sullenberger's own book and his four decades worth of flight experience, it was really up to Eastwood's direction, and Hanks' ability to underplay, to get into the mindset of ""Sully"" as he dealt with all the media and government attention that he, his wife (Laura Linney), and Eckhart went through in those months following what the media had deemed the ""Miracle On The Hudson."" Hanks deftly shows the struggles that Sullenberger faced, via flashbacks to that cold wintry day in the skies over the Big Apple, with respect to what he could have done differently (or what both the media and the government investigators think he could have done differently). But at no time during the actual FAA/NTSB hearings did Sully ever lose his cool and his composure. He merely pointed out that the human element needed to be taken into consideration, not just what some alternate computer simulation said could have been done, to facilitate the saving of everyone on Flight 1549; and the playback of the flight voice recorders clears up any questions as to the judgment and veracity behind Sully's decisions.That this saga, which, like 1995's APOLLO 13 (which also starred Hanks) and 2015's THE 33, had a hugely successful outcome, should have been made into a movie probably shouldn't surprise anyone. But just as importantly, and also just like those films, SULLY, thanks to Hanks' usual great Everyman portrayal of Sullenberger, the kind of heroism on display is that of common people, including Hanks, his crew, his wife, the passengers, and the rescue personnel of New York City, and not just some comic-book, super-patriotic depiction of heroism that too much of Hollywood has been about in the 21st century. Nothing about the saga of US Airways Flight 1549, or the resulting Miracle On The Hudson, was cut-and-dried; it was reality, and Eastwood and Hanks should both be commended for making it that way, and successfully so.",Sully
135,griffolyon12,Another Success for Eastwood,9,8 November 2016,"Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, Sully, is a movie worthy of the accolades it has received. Detailing the true story of the Miracle on the Hudson and the NTSB investigation that followed for pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (played with extreme likability by Tom Hanks), Sully is another strong movie in a string of recent hits for Mr. Eastwood. While it would be very easy to wonder how a 90-minute drama could be created detailing an event that occurred in about two minutes of real time, screenwriter Todd Komarnicki tells the story non-linearly to keep a sense of momentum. One way that Komarnicki and Eastwood help keep the story fresh is they revisit the crash at multiple intervals and detail it from a different perspective -- similar to Akira Kursoawa's classic, Rashomon -- by doing this in parallel with the NTSB investigation, Sully maintains a sense of white knuckle suspense for the entirety of the movie. That is the true brilliance of this movie. While we already know how the story ends, Clint Eastwood manages to keep our stomach tied up knots because of his smart directorial choices, using minimal music and not overplaying the actual crash but showing it as it harrowingly happened in real life.I give Sully a 9 out of 10!",Sully
136,Imdbidia,"Great story, decent movie",6,13 May 2017,"I was living in Australia when I watched this story, soon after it had happened. It was all over the news. I remember, still today, Sully's apparent calmness when talking about the event. This is one of those stories that one believes to be fiction and part of a feel-good Christmas film, but it was real, it was great, it warmed my heart, and it renewed my respect for pilots, who certainly are not just cool dudes in pretty uniforms.Knowing the end of the story is a tricky thing for a film that is not documentary and intends to build tension and interest in the viewer. Eastwood achieved that in different ways: 1-by just playing a non-linear story that does go back and forward in time; 2-by making us see Sully behind doors (his personal background with aviation, his emotional self with PSD after the events on the Hudson unfolded, his worries about his family future); 3-by creating a set of villains (in this case the NTSB investigators), and 4-by creating a situation that builds tension (the investigation on whether Sully's act of heroism was on the contrary a lack of judgment.To me, the main problem with the film is not what is in the film, but with what's not there. Sully is based on Captain Sullenberg's own memoir and, therefore, we see just one color. I would have loved knowing more about the co-pilot and his PDS, of which he also suffered, get to know some of the passengers flying on the film, seeing more about Sully's daughters' reaction to the events, seeing more details about the NTSB behind-doors investigation going on, and building a bit of more tension around that.The acting is good overall, especially on Hanks' part, who is able to convey Sully's real mix of his usual external calmness and the inner turmoil that he experienced after the event. I also liked Eckhart as his co-pilot,and Linney as his wife.I loved the special effects that reproduce the events on the Hudson as the landing on the river looks totally real not just special effects.Overall, this is a very enjoyable feel-good movie and story. Yet, the events being so well-documented and internationally well known, and so close in time, it is difficult to get overly wowed by a story that was, indeed, wow.",Sully
137,RussHog,It's a good thing Tom Hanks was on that plane,7,13 May 2017,This movie is based on the true story of how Tom Hanks piloted a plane when it was going to crash - but he perfectly completed a water landing in the Hudson river and nobody was killed. But then - some haters who worked for the airport tried to hurt Tom Hanks feelings - and Tom Hanks was sad. Then he learned to overcome - because he is Tom Hanks. I did not know that Tom Hanks was a pilot. But he is good at acting - and good in this film when he plays himself. The scene where the plane lands in the Hudson is pretty well made. Apparently - Clint Eastwood was there too - because he directed this film. Two Face is also in this movie - but this was before he was Two-Face - and so he still had just one face. I liked this movie. Tom Hanks is a great person. He should hopefully win his fourth Oscar for this film.,Sully
138,meydiana-65242,"Terrifically detailed work directed by a living legend, and starring one too!",10,7 November 2020,"This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteran pilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYC and with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for ""Cast Away"", Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning ""Mystic River"" in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended.",Sully
139,MrDHWong,An interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero,8,8 September 2016,"Sully is a biographical drama film starring Tom Hanks and directed by Clint Eastwood. Based on the true story of veteran airline pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the film is a nice tribute to its title character and the people he saved.Late in the afternoon on January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 departs from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. Three minutes into the flight, the plane is struck by a large flock of birds, which seriously damages both its engines. The quick thinking of pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) results in the plane landing in the middle of the freezing cold Hudson River. All 155 passengers and crew survive the crash landing and Sully is hailed as a hero by the media. However, Sully feels overwhelmed by the sudden fame he has received and to make matters worse, an official investigation is opened over whether or not Sully should have acted as he did or if he recklessly endangered the lives of his passengers.Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It just seemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance the character development of Sully himself rather than to bring a different perspective to the story.I rate it 7.5/10",Sully
140,CANpatbuck3664,"Eastwood, Hanks, Eckhart and the Visual Effects Buoy a Decent Movie Struggling With a Really Thin Plot",6,17 December 2016,"I feel bad for not loving this movie. Cpt. Chelsea ""Sully"" Sullenberger is a hero and deserves credit along with his co-pilot Jeff Skiles for performing the Miracle on the Hudson. You would think the story would be ripe for a great movie. Throw in Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood and you can almost picture people reading their names off the envelopes at the Academy Awards. The problem is that the while the subject matter of the story is interesting, the movie isn't very plot heavy and has to rely on the big budget special effects and reliving the crash over and over again to fill out the run time.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Captain Chelsea ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) are the co-pilots of U.S. Airways Flight 1549. Due to birds flying into and then destroying 2 of their engines, they're forced to make an emergency landing. They're unable to manoeuvre the plane and they crash into the building in a fiery explosion. Sully then wakes up, the whole thing having been a nightmare. He's still reliving the incident, the crash having happened less than a week ago. While the media is celebrating the incident as a miracle and everyone loves Sully, he's facing upcoming hearings with the National Board of Transportation. They intend to prove that instead of landing in the Hudson River, he could have made it back to LaGuardia or neighbouring Teterboro Airport.Instead of attacking the movie right away, lets talk about what I did like. You see the recreation of the landing several times (with different results because several of them are dreams) and the special effects are pretty impressive. A plane crash is a pretty dramatic event and the movie never fails to show how impressive of a feat The Miracle on the Hudson was. The effects never failed to be convincing and this movie needed them to be excellent.Almost every performance from Tom Hanks in a dramatic role will get recognition come award season. The simple reason is that he's one of the best if not the best actor of his generation, he's just that good. I thought he was good in this but it was more of a workmanlike job. He's very stone-faced and serious (rightfully so) and he brings an intensity and fear to Cpt. Sullivan. I thought Aaron Eckhart was just as good as Skiles. He acts almost like a cheerleader for Sully but he's strong and his loyalty to Sully comes through in his acting. Laura Linney is okay as Lorraine, she's not given much to do but act concerned over the phone. Mike O'Malley, Anna Gun and the rest of the review board weren't very subtle but I think that was the fault of the writing. Sully paints them as sneering, one-dimensional jerks who have no idea what impartiality is.Speaking of the review board, I feel like they could have explored that further. That would have been interesting but the investigation around Sully is so one-sided and with the board members being so poorly drawn, I couldn't get into it. I don't enjoy watching movies about decent people getting railroaded for little to no reason. I get that it's supposed to get your blood boiling but that doesn't make it anymore enjoyable to watch.My problem with this movie is that the story behind what Cpt. Sullenberger did was amazing but there isn't enough plot in this movie. The movie is stretched so thin that they need the re-enactments just to hit the 1hr 30min mark. Take those out and the phone calls to his wife and I really don't know if you would have enough material for a movie. I got annoyed by the 3rd time they redo the plane crash including the dream fake-out at the beginning. I just found it irritating and while I respect them for wanting to tell this story, just focusing it over this small time period is a mistake. I also thought the flashbacks to previous times in Sully's life were pretty well filmed but they would be kind of jarring and the movie seemed a little choppy in the editing.I didn't think this was a bad movie but I think this subject deserved a better one. It just ended up being kind of mediocre and I honestly would rather watch Flight before watching this again. A group of people this talented coming together should have made something fantastic and although I didn't hate it, I couldn't help being disappointed when Sully was done.",Sully
141,Laakbaar,Quiet movie about Flight 1549 and its pilot,8,26 June 2017,"The heart of this movie is the spectacle -- beautifully staged and filmed -- of a passenger airplane landing on a river in the middle of a large city in the winter and all its passengers getting rescued. By anyone's standards, this is remarkable thing and the worthy subject of a 96-minute movie. Realizing this, Eastwood presents a realistic, appropriate and detailed film depiction of the crash. It was fascinating to watch, even though the viewer already knows how it ends.The rest of the movie is a populist ""little guy v. the man"" kind of film, with the airline, the investigating committee and the insurers cast in the role of ""the man"", and the pilot (Tom Hanks) and co-pilot (Aaron Eckhart) in the role of the ""little guy"". In the end, the heroism is not just in landing the plane, but in being able to face with dignity and confidence the bureaucratic/financial firestorm that comes afterwards .Hanks and Eastwood also engage in a sort of ""portrait of heroism"". They show us more about Sully and what kind of man he is. The pilot was just a man doing his job, but he did it well and he survived (in many ways) a life-changing accident that could have destroyed him. Is he a genuine hero? This movie makes that argument. America needs heroes; the movie industry loves making films about heroes. The movie was restrained in its flag-waving, thankfully.I thought this was a good film, although maybe a little on the pensive side. It's worth about 7.5, but I'll round it up.",Sully
142,oOoBarracuda,Sully,7,19 September 2016,"Since around the year 2000, I've adopted a rule to see any film Clint Eastwood has been involved with, and largely that is a rule that has proved fruitful. Sully, the 2016 film directed by Eastwood, was another shining example of the mastery of Eastwood behind the lens. Starring Tom Hanks in the titular role, along with Aaron Eckhart as the co- pilot no one knows, Sully tells the story of the miraculous landing of a US Airways flight on the Hudson River in 2009. Audiences everywhere remember that fateful day, and can recall being captivated by the newsreel footage that overtook American TV screens; what we didn't know, however, was the tumult Captain Sullenberger endured with the National Transportation Safety Board. Exposing this untold aspect of the story, and delving deeper into the psyche of the veteran pilot after his difficult landing, makes Sully a film not to be missed.Thursday, January 15th, 2009, is a day that started off like any other workday for Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Sully) (Tom Hanks) the 42-year veteran pilot. After settling into the cockpit for another flight, Sully performs all of his pre-flight checklist with first officer, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). When all systems are go, Sully and the crew take off with 155 total people on board the plane. Moments after takeoff, a flight of Canadian geese fly straight towards the plane disabling both engines. As everything begins to fail, Sully makes the decision to reroute back to LaGuardia where the plane departed from. When the plane loses thrust and altitude at an alarming rate, Sully decides they will not be able to make it back to the airport, and is now faced with how to execute an emergency landing and save as many people on board as he possibly can. The only option that seems available to Sully is to attempt a landing on the Hudson River. An unprecedented water landing is, by no means, an easy undertaking, especially on a frigid 20-degree day. Sully did the unthinkable, not only successfully landing the aircraft, but doing so with no loss of life. Remaining on board until the last possible moment, making sure all passengers were off the plane, then taking the flight manifest with him to be able to account for all the passengers, Sully acted as a true captain to every soul who happened to board U.S. Airways flight 1549. That's the part of the story the audience knows, what we didn't know was the tumult Sullenberger went through with the National Transportation Safety Board, who was dealing with the insurance fallout following such an emergency landing. The ensuing investigation threatened to ruin Sullenberger's career and his burgeoning aviation safety consulting business. The investigation threatened Sully's lifework, and pension, all while being touted as a national hero. Sullenberger fought for his livelihood while dealing with the debilitating fallout of the traumatic experience he endured. It is easy to think about the passengers onboard the flight and the harrowing experience they went through, but it is easy to forget that Captain Sullenberger went through the same traumatic experience, with the added stress of being responsible for every life on board, as well. An amazing insight to the man who captivated a nation, Sully is sure to gain some Oscar buzz, and one not to be missed. Clint Eastwood attempts the incredibly difficult task of taking a story that everyone knows and telling it in a captivating way. Eastwood definitely achieves this feat, as the audience is on the edge of their seat, even though they already know the outcome of the story. Eastwood, choosing to inject the following NTSB investigation into Captain Sullenberger's actions was a stroke of brilliance, allowing the audience to become engrossed and possibly enraged with another aspect of his heroic story, that we may not otherwise have known. I am no fan of Tom Hanks, I actually prefer to only watch him in a movie if I can forget that he is the actor I am watching on screen; that being said, Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Captain Sullenberger. He embodies the extremely focused, almost militant Sullenberger in a fantastic way. Aaron Eckhart was also a brilliant selection for the strong supporting role of the first officer who was a necessity to Sullenberger's unprecedented landing. Sound acting choices and the brilliance of Clint Eastwood behind the camera create a wonderful story of one man's heroic feat that gave New York some much needed plane-related good news.",Sully
143,JoelChamp85,Keeps It Real,9,5 April 2021,"A simple story of a big event. Hanks does a good job as Sully, playing the calm and collected pilot who did the impossible by saving 155 people with a water landing. I like the way his subconscious begins doubting himself with the dreams and what-not. The hearing scene really finishes the film strong. Eastwood knows how to handle these stories well.",Sully
144,crumpytv,Good Film - Poor Audio,7,21 September 2020,"In view of Clint Eastwood producing and directing, I can't understand why this film was so audibly poor.
There were long passages where I just could not understand what was being said. The boarding of passengers on the plane, the cockpit dialogue and worst of all the jet fighter scene.
It detracted from an interesting and otherwise well made drama.",Sully
145,PyroSikTh,Repetitive and Lacks Urgency,6,14 December 2016,"I'm not a massive fan of Tom Hanks, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a Clint Eastwood-directed movie, but I figured what the hell and went to see it anyway, it's a story I'm interested in learning a little more about. But if there's one thing the movie taught me, it's that I already knew pretty much the whole story already. Sully and his co-pilot lose both engines from a sing bird strike, start losing altitude fast, and quickly decide an unprecedented water landing on the nearby river is a safer option than attempting to make a ditch for a nearby airport. Through an unmatched amount of skill and luck, the landing goes as smoothly as can be, all the passengers survived with minor injuries, and Captain Sully is hailed a hero. The main narrative follows the investigation afterwards from the NTSB, as Sully attempts to convince the board that there was no other option, in the face of both computer and human simulations that tell them otherwise.I have two really big issues with this movie. The first is how repetitive it is. We see the incident at least three times, almost from beginning to end each time, just with slightly different perspectives; air traffic control, passengers, and cabin. It takes a while for these flashbacks to begin, instead offered nightmares of how it could've happened and gone catastrophically wrong, but once they start, we keep revisiting it over and over, and I'll be honest, it gets boring. These flashbacks become harder and harder to separate from the main narrative as we go on as well. There's a scene late in the movie where Sully is hugged by a hotel manager, but it's not immediately obvious when this scene actually takes place. It's only when his co-pilot asks why he's still in his uniform that it clicks that it's actually still part of the flashback, post-incident.My second issue, and this is a biggie, is that every time we see the incident, it lacks urgency, it lacks drama, it lacks suspense. At no point are we shown the gravity of the situation, only told how it was a miracle, how it was unprecedented, how it could've gone so much worse. As I understand it, the whole rescue operation took about twenty-four minutes, and I guess in the name of authenticity, Eastwood decided to show it in near enough to realtime, which slows everything down, loses all momentum of the accident and takes away the much needed urgency that lives could be at stake. We're told by news reporters that the passengers ""have minutes to live"" but we're never given any indication that this is actually the case from watching the rescue itself. I don't know, maybe that was the point; to show how the media over-inflates everything to make it sound more dramatic and interesting? But then, wouldn't that just completely undermine the heroism Eastwood is simultaneously attempting to portray?It's not a complete failure of a movie though. Even though I haven't enjoyed a single Eastwood- directed movie I've seen, he's still reasonably talented on the more technical aspects. The film does look great, and what effects work there was is flawless (genuinely thought the David Letterman scene was re-enacted rather than just had Hanks et al's faces super-imposed). As off- putting as it was to see a reporters face large and centre in front of a blurred background, it did at least have the resemblance of artistry behind it.Tom Hanks' work is admirable, of course. He isn't such a celebrated and high-demanded actor for no reason, and his Sully is likable and empathetic, but rightly conflicted and affected by the incident. Aaron Eckhart's Skiles is more down-to-earth and jokey, but not entirely without effect. Laura Linney doesn't get a whole lot to do, spending a hundred percent of her screen time on the phone, but she manages to serve as the emotional backbone to the movie, as annoyingly insignificant as her role may be. Anna Gunn probably impressed me the most, as NTSB investigator Elizabeth Davis. In a way she's the sympathetic investigator on the board, without undermining the authority of her position. The break in her voice during the hearing as the NTSB's agenda is brought down is powerful. She also gets bonus points for almost making me forget how annoying Skyler was in Breaking Bad.Sully clocks in at a relatively short ninety minutes, but that's still too long, and the film still feels like it was padded out with filler, overly slow-moments, and repetitive flashbacks. It somehow manages to drag along, and then concludes abruptly on weird joke. It lacks urgency, which in the retelling of a real-life emergency is a big oversight, and I'll be honest, I was actually kind of bored by the movie's end. I give it a meandering and over-sentimental 6/10.",Sully
146,pilot1009,Dirty harry meets ntsb,3,23 December 2016,"Not a very appealing movie, lacking finesse and fitness, not even particularly entertaining. Firstly -factually incorrect, ntsb does not do open hearings without first reviewing the evidence. Next the whole movie is focused on the theme that ntsb are out to ""get"" the pilots,just not the case. No character development anywhere to be seen.No background development on the story or anyone in it. Just a pathetic attempt to stir up a story where there was non.

147,ethanbresnett,A well executed film but it felt limited by the source material,7,17 March 2021,"The story of Captain Sully's impressive water landing on the Hudson is nothing short of remarkable, and it was all very well executed in this film adaptation.Hanks was very solid in his role as Sully. It wasn't particularly a standout performance, but I don't think the script ever really allowed him to be at his best. It was a very well measured and spot on performance, drawing us into the film and character like only Hanks can.The direction from Eastwood was very good. There were some fantastic shots, an inspired decision to opt for non-linear story telling, and a great tone that overlay the whole film. He also made the great decision to make the film no longer than it needed to be. There was very little unnecessary fat on the bones of the story. Every scene was relevant and had a distinct purpose, bringing the picture in at a crisp 90 minute runtime.The only real reason I haven't scored Sully higher is that I felt the story was always quite limited. As mentioned, it was a truly remarkable feat and the film does a great job of explaining just why, but the story didn't always have legs. There were attempts to inject tension with the proceedings that followed the 'forced water landing' (not crash), but these never felt that real or serious. In terms of the landing, the scenes were genuinely quite emotional and moving, but as its based on a real story there wasn't much jeopardy as we knew the outcome.Therefore while there is nothing particularly wrong with Sully, in fact it does a great job of capturing the moment, I just felt like it didn't have enough. Not enough to intrigue, excite, impact or move me.A good film and definitely worth watching, but always somewhat limited with the story it was telling.",Sully
148,CineMuseFilms,masterful storytelling and a thoroughly riveting film,8,11 September 2016,"True story bio-pics based on real disasters have little room for creativity because a major aviation incident like landing in the Hudson River is so forensically documented. However, the real disaster in Sully (2016) is not landing a plane in a freezing river, but the hysteria of the media, airlines, insurance companies and safety investigators, who all voraciously pursued their own vested interests by undermining the professionalism of a modest pilot who saved the lives of everyone on board.The central incident unfolds only minutes after take-off on 19 January 2009 when Captain Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) realises that his Airbus A320-214 has lost both engines on hitting a massive flock of Canada geese. His options were to glide back for an airport landing while losing altitude over a densely populated city, or go for an unprecedented water landing onto the Hudson. His decision made history and he was immediately lauded as a hero until the media's appetite for the dark side of humanity turned the incident into a witch-hunt. Asking was he a ""hero or fraud"", the really big doubters were those with most to gain if human error could be established. While aviation interests quickly pitted computer simulations against real world decision making, Sully remained focused on cockpit logic. The film spends most of its 93 minutes exploring the incident from different perspectives and director Clint Eastwood's masterful storytelling is a perfect mix of facts and human insight.It is hard to imagine any actor who could fill this role as well as Tom Hanks. He captures the understated gravitas of a modest hero whose job exists at the fleeting intersection between saving and losing lives. The filming style draws you into its vortex while being mercifully light on CGI effects. We watch over Sully's shoulder at the controls then study his face during the critical minutes, before switching to panoptic views from the clouds. The most outstanding feature of this film is the way it frames the narrative and its aftermath, with flashbacks and parallel sub-plots that piece the story together like an elaborate jigsaw puzzle. Disaster films are usually just action dramas, but this one is much more than that. It has the intensity of a psychological thriller as we watch Sully's own confidence being undermined in the battle between sterile computer algorithms and the kind of intuitive judgement that comes from four decades of flying. This is a thoroughly riveting film.",Sully

It's a great real life story, I just wished they hadn't fixed the story to something that really didn't happen, which was the treatment of Sully by the airlines. That was added for dramatic purposes and not needed. Also it was a bit repetitive. They didn't need to show the crash 4 or more times. Once would have been enough and they should have focused more on the relationships, especially the Sully and his wife which was reduced to phone calls. And Jeff and Sully, they should have added how they met and didn't know each other.Also, the ending meeting was too much Hollywood drama and some bad acting/direction. They spent too little time on the passengers/flight attendants. A few moments here and there isn't enough to care for them.Having said that it's worth the watch.",Sully
150,rdoyle29,Pretty okay film,7,10 August 2017,"This is a fairly solid film that has, as it's centerpiece, a fairly incredible feat of aviation and an impressive rescue operation. The problem is that a feature film needs to be built around that, and you feel the film straining to pad itself out. Hanks is really good in a role that pretty much tailor made for him. Aaron Eckhart provides solid support. As always, Eastwood crafts a well-made, no-nonsense film. But the film strains to create drama out of an National Transportation Safety Board investigation that never manages to feel like anything more than people doing the job they are supposed to do. Yes, there's some evidence that maybe Sully made the wrong decision, but that's fairly easily dismissed and nobody really fights it when a reasonable argument is made. It ends up feeling like a great 15 minute short wrapped up in a mediocre film.",Sully
151,LloydBayer,Sully is one of the Years' best from a legendary director at his no-nonsense best.,9,26 September 2016,"Many people think of Clint Eastwood as a legend. Myself included. At an age when most Hollywood personalities are turning senile, Eastwood is still churning out auteur stuff. At its heart, Sully is a modest celebration of an All American hero, much like Eastwood's previous film American Sniper. Modest and celebration go hand-in-hand, like an oxymoron, because in reality, the message in this film is much larger than it appears on screen.Consider the fact that Captain Sullenberger (again, Hanks at his brilliant yet modest best) had decades of experience as a pilot before the incident. Not a blemish in his career having flown over a million passengers safely in 42 years as a commercial pilot. That's an extraordinary feat for anyone in the aviation industry. But all that was almost instantly tarnished when bigwigs from the NTSB took over the investigation. They wanted to blame someone. Somehow his years of devotion to the job didn't matter. In their books Sullenberger didn't follow procedure. Herein lies the crux of the film based on the real incident that occurred on 15 Jan 2009 - instinct versus experience versus procedure. Could Sullenberger have saved the lives of all 155 souls on board that day had he followed procedure? The answer to that question is almost terrifying, not only in the film, but also to anyone confined to the nitty-gritties of hardcore airport and flight ops. And that's probably why the incident has been dubbed the 'Miracle on the Hudson'.There's a lot of liberty compressing months of investigation into a short 95 minutes of screen time. But that also means there's not a single minute wasted in telling this remarkable story. Apart from a couple of stock scenes showing panic stricken passengers, Sully is as remarkable as the story it depicts. This is not only Eastwood at his no-nonsense best, it's a steadfast salute to professionalism, both on screen and in reality. It's a director's film through and through so I won't be surprised if Sully gets a nod for a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. And then some.",Sully

Anyone like me with a strong urge for aviation will heartily take this movie important which salutes the professionalism brought to the screen by the flight crew.Clint Eastwood, one of the revered actors and directors of all time, does it again drifting from his usual genre of fictitious stories, to capture the prompt decision the cockpit crew take. The film is based on real statistics and investigation which avoids sentimentality or drama unlike Denzil Washington's ""Flight"" (a good thriller) which fictionalized the real life accident into a heroic survival game receiving Oscar accolades. In that case, the film remains subdued with yet an another revered performance as a controlled captain of Airbus A320 showing the patience, diligence, and dedication of a senior captain equally supported by Aaron Eckhart as the first officer. Don't worry if the film didn't sweep major Oscar nominations, it's a sincere film on a heroic deed worth watching.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",Sully

156,James_De_Bello,7/10,7,2 December 2016,"""Sully"" is the real life story centering around the event that came to be called ""The Miracle on the Hudson"". Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were two airline pilots who on the 15th of January 2009 found themselves at loss of both engines at a record low altitude. Thankfully to their committed professionalism they managed to land the plane on the Hudson just 208 seconds after the incident without the loss of any lives both inside and outside the plane. Unfortunately, both the airline officials had to face tough times in the aftermath of the incident, during an investigation that mistakenly led to believe the two pilots hadn't done their job properly.The ever so prolific Clint Eastwood is back with another real life picture and yet another time he delivers a story that is well told and filled with great performances, even if there might be not that interesting of a story to tell, the efficiency of Eastwood in the use of the cinematic medium makes for nevertheless a worthy 90 minute watch.By saying that the story to tell here might not be interesting I am in no way, shape or form belittling the amazing feat that Sully and Skiles pulled off, nor denying their heroism in doing so, what I am saying is that the overall dramatic content that the situation and the story entail isn't exactly structured in a way that that brings an audience to feel naturally moved or emotional. The archs are pretty straight forward and predictable, the resolution really anticlimactic and overall there isn't any thematic content that gives the story a cinematic effect. The run-time of the film is reflective of how, even in real life, no matter how extraordinary the events, this was a pretty self contained and short spanning occurrence.Yet, if on one side we have to recognize the cinematic limitations this film has and how this reflects on the overall experience, on the other the effect to which Eastwood manages to bring it to the screen and make it as cinematic as possible. To me he actually showed in the film a self-consciousness about everything mentioned above and managed to play towards that at different moments, giving the picture a sense of realism and everyday life that is remarkable. The calm of the pilots during the incident, the offbeat disorientation of the passengers during the situation, the strange tranquillity with which the rescuers approach the plane and ultimately the way in which the characters cope with the situation in the immediate aftermath, everything contributed into giving the film a real sense of the situation that was incredibly surprising and fresh to see and better not, it gave the film its moments of greatest dramatic effect.Of course, one couldn't go about reviewing the film without mentioning Tom Hanks, that seems to be the standard with all of his movies. I think that even in the very short span of time I have been doing it I have already run out of words to describe him: ""Saving Mr. Banks"", ""Captain Philips"", ""Cloud Atlas"", ""Bridge of Spies"" and now this. It is baffling to see how he still cannot manage to turn ion a performance that is less than amazing, he is a real authentic actor, when you see him on screen there is no filter to his performance, you see how he is really living the moment and it is always a pleasure to experience. Aaron Eckhart is great too and definitely the standout in the rest of the cast, he is someone that infidelity deserves to be seen more in these kind of supporting roles as he always excels in them.Overall ""Sully"" won't give the audience any kind of gut wrenching, white-knuckle experience because of its limited content, but the picture that Eastwood presents us with is as good of what we could have asked from it.",Sully
157,scottshak_111,An incredible biopic of Sully's Miracle on Hudson,8,24 October 2016,"Sully took my breath away. I was rendered speechless by Chesley Sullenberger's humanly impossible act, unbeatable acumen, extraordinary decision making and his unrivalled acuity that saw him through. How humbly does he put it?""I was just doing my job."" The gargantuan magnitude of the paranoia that engulfed him in those split seconds of life and death, the way he came out of it, a victor, it is something that you can never forget. A feat that is so rare in our mundane that you can't help but call him a real life superhero.What Chesley Sullenberger accomplished on January 15th 2009 was simply incomprehensible. One could only shudder at the thought of having lived the horror firsthand, that too from the nose of death itself. One wrong move and you are talking head-on with it. Sully managed to land the plane to save every single soul onboard. All 155 of them! That just leaves your jaw wide open.PLOT OF SULLY (SPOILERS AHEAD) Clint Eastwood's biopic does in every way justice to Sully's magnanimous nature. Caught between a trillion could-haves and aftermath-thoughts, Sully hasn't even yet recovered from the shocker that shook him up good, that we have dour faces knocking at his door. The unfeeling NTSB board begins pressing up hard trying to prove his human error. Their unvarying attempt is to disprove the choice Sully made when he decided to land US Airways Flight 1549 on Hudson River.The movie rides to and fro showing us different timelines through Sully's recalling. What it also does is try to depict us the real incident from different vantages. The fact that it is exhilarating to watch every single time even though from different pedestals, makes you marvel at Sully's heroism even more.TOM HANKS AS CHESLEY SULLENBERGER If there was an actor who could have done Chesley Sulley Sullenberger justice, it was none other than Tom Hanks himself. The constant apprehension in his eyes as he tries to put meaning into things is havocing.There is this moment where he is worried about the numbers, the count, whether everybody made it safe, and is asked:""Are you okay?"" To that he replies:""I will answer that once I know everybody is safe."" That flicker of doubt or that tumult of incredulity when he gets to know he has saved all 155 souls aboard on the plane, is literally going to melt you. He stays in a perfect aura of agitation as he talks to her wife to tell her he is fine.There is this expressive impassioned face that he puts on as the world showers him in a tub of adulation, but he is polite enough to refuse. There are so many times that he apologizes at odd hours that you can't overlook how civil and deferential amidst all of it.Sully's final lines will tell you how modest he stays in reality, not taking the credit of having pulled off the landing. He shares his accolade with the people who were on board and those who rushed to rescue when he hit the waters.CLINT EASTWOOD'S DIRECTION Even though chopping off frames to time-travel us toward memories from the past was a tad baffling, it worked nevertheless. If it weren't for the music that rang up Sully's head, it would have been hard to guess for some which timeline one was in.Clint Eastwood nevertheless remains one of the most thoughtful directors of our time. The way he glides alongside the plane to show minuscule details about the sojourn that went kaput is worth commendable. He makes even conversations riveting.Todd Komarnicki's screenplay ices it up with witty one liners, most of them escaping the mouth of Jeff Skiles played by Aaron Eckhart. Talks with Laura Linney are directed to make you feel good. She does a fine Lorraine Sullenberger.BEST MOMENTS The most satisfying moment in the movie is when Sully proves NTSB wrong. All that colossal turmoil in Sully's eyes vanishes in a jiffy. For the first time you see those clouds of doubt disappear for good. He takes a short break just to talk to Skiles to tell him how proud he feels; how relieved he was of his decision to land 1549 on Hudson.If we focus on other crucial movie moments, there are many actually. The movie shows how when people are hit by a conundrum they react differently. One of those survivors thought he could swim all the way in the freezing cold towards the land. Whilst there was one lady who thought it was a gas leakage, and that the Jet might explode, and so she jumps into the water panicking.THE FINAL VERDICT It goes without saying that those lives he saved will stay indebted to him forever. Whilst there are people who are decimating lives, we have this silent modest hero at one end, who is concerned about saving them all. You can't applaud Chesley Sullenberger enough.Stories need to be told. I am glad I got to know about Sully through such a beautiful movie.",Sully
158,coreyjdenford,Miraculous Heroes,8,2 December 2016,"This review of Sully: Miracle on the Hudson is spoiler free**** (4/5)ON 9TH November the headlines and Social Media sites were riddled with images and headlines of Donald Trump winning the Presidential Election, and in our media saturated world where we are bombarded by images of heroes and villains overtaking the news. That seems like one of the more normal stories. However, if you go back seven years to January 2009 we were introduced to an unlikely hero when the headlines read ""Miracle on the Hudson"" the image was of a passenger jet (Airbus A320) floating on the Hudson River, the plane had all 155 passengers stood on the wings. On the cold afternoon of January 15th 2009 Captain Chesley Burnett Sullenberger III nicknamed 'Sully' was doing his normal duty of flying a full capacity passenger jet from LaGuardia Airport in New York until his flight path was interrupted by a flock of Canadian geese, a couple of those geese landed in the engine. In the cockpit Chesley and his co pilot/best friend Jeff Skiles were thinking of a rather bizarre scenario of how they could land the jet, they spent 209 seconds thinking about how they could pull it off, without harming any passenger. Everyone on board was panicking while the disabled jet went gliding towards New York's Hudson River until it landed all 155 passengers and crew were saved; Sully was hailed as a national hero. Based on Sully's best selling memoirs Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters, Clint Eastwood's Sully explores the untold story of this unlikely hero and how he went from being heralded by everyone he walked past to being constantly investigated, in many seemingly never ending court hearings where he is sat with his best friend/co pilot who is in the form of a witness as he is worried about losing his pilot license. It seems hard to find an actor who can sell this look very convincingly but Eastwood seemed to have his mind set on Tom Hanks who is transformed into the exact doppelganger of Sully, and Hanks' performance as our hero is electrifying. The movie opens around a year after the miraculous incident with Sully envisioning his own demise by having a dream of the event happening differently, with the plane he was piloting ending up in a building killing and injuring everyone in the immediate vicinity of the explosion, stepping into the territorial recreation of 9/11. When he wakes the people around him are constantly worried even his wife Lorrie Sullenberger (Laura Linney), thinks that her husband isn't the same anymore. His best friend Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) seems to be the only one who can bring him back as he is always there with him as someone to rely on for help. Director Eastwood made this story in his own typical style with the story telling itself as the film unfolds, there are many slow moments were nothing much happens Hanks' charisma manages to pull us through the film's slower moments were the narrative is sadly left empty. Though when we get to the showing of the event we it becomes a lot faster showing the panicking passengers and the cockpit with Skiles and Sully taking charge of the jet which is hurtling out of control. It's a clever use of editing that's on show as the story manages to hold all these things together with some gripping but sadly limited drama. The event itself is beautifully done filled with tense moments and thrilling camera pans showing the inside and around the outside of the jet; though granted the familiarity with other air disaster movies takes a giant chunk out of the story but Hanks and Eckhart manage to keep the film going and try to strive away from the overall familiarity. There are two moments when the narrative of the story's history takes a hold of Sully's life told in little snippet type flashbacks both of them are set around the time when he is in training, the first when he is just a child aged around 13 when he lands a bi plane successfully, the second shows him flying a damaged fighter jet in the air force, it's another moment that's added to the overall premise making it slightly more human. The scenes after the incident mainly contain of never ending court hearings donned by Mike O'Malley's Charles Porter, who is always in constant disbelief at when Sully says that he had no choice as he could feel the plane go, he's more annoying to put up with. Eastwood's retelling of the air disaster itself is the strongest part of this story helped by his camera transitions panning the outside, the panicking passengers screaming, inside the cockpit and back again which are all wonderfully adept and gives the film a bit of a Hollywood feel but its impressive nonetheless. The sheer sense of speed of the gliding jet attempting a landing on the frigid waters, the attention to detail the pacing of each disaster scene and sense of overall verisimilitude its all Paul Greengrass level stuff and shouldn't be a problem for Eastwood. Though the premise oddly feels familiar with other real life air disasters, the sense of heroism in this story takes a gripping hold and just the recreation of history repeating itself is nicely done with brutal beauty,. Altogether Sully is a beautiful depiction of history repeating itself, buoyed by powerful performances that are nothing less than Oscar-worthy. VERDICT Hanks takes flight in yet another powerful Oscar-worthy title role performance, which is gripping, thrilling and certainly one of the best air disaster movies ever.8/10 thrilling.",Sully
159,eagandersongil,The Human Factor,8,17 December 2016,"1338/5000 Clint Eastwood had everything to do a titanic film or Rescue of soldier Ryan, because the story of Captain Sully is fantastic, but no, Clint chose to make a film almost technical, short and almost scarce of feelings, but contrary to everything, The film was really cool so I started to suspect that the film would not have a dramatic content when I saw that it was an hour and a half in duration, and I was sure in the first ten minutes of film. ""Sully"" is a film that has nothing to impress but also has nothing to disappoint, and it is able to leave the viewer completely glazed in the cinema, because it is fast and dynamic, mixing time lines and not caring much about Explain to the public what is happening. With almost no soundtrack and a very clear photograph, be it day or night, with cuts and very good sound editions and remarkable dialogues and very successful performances (nothing special), hardly Tom Hanks will disappoint, and Aaron Eckhart too It's OK. The screenplay is basic, cold and fast, he tries to pinpoint dramatic tones with Sully's dreams and anguish, but he can not, and in the great dramatic moment of the movie, pofff, you do not feel anything, but you leave the movie happy, A great and efficient story with a direction that fulfills the role.",Sully
160,kgprophet,Fact is less interesting than Fiction,6,10 February 2017,"""Spoilers"" in this review.I put the word spoilers in quotes for two reasons. First, of course, we all know about this high profile incident and the outcome. Second, the other 'revelation' that occurs in the third act never actually occurred in reality. The filmmakers explained when the movie came out that because there was no controversy to wrap the story around, they made one up. This kind of reminds me of my reaction to ""Argo"". One reason why the audience will invest their time into a movie is knowing that the stakes are real. ""Sully"" shows that sometimes fact is not as exciting as fiction. So I have the same reaction to ""Argo"", which is ""why am I watching a fake story?"" In this case you get into groan territory as Sully faces a review board. Characters playing aviation officials look accusatory as they confront him with the idea he should have tried to land the plane at a runway close by. All be damned that he successfully saved all the passengers, he should have saved the plane! Spoiler Sully acts like John Wayne and publicly shames all the officials as he points out that human reaction time was not factored in. The hang dog reaction on the officials faces is so over-the-top it feels like a farce. This ""oh we feel so terrible, let me lick your toes"" response felt just dumb. Spoiler finishedEastwood handled the material otherwise very appropriately. Finding momentum by reviewing the moment via flight control and passengers midway through the film (instead having it as the finale) helped feed the story. Otherwise, we all know that the pilot was a hero, had no dark secrets, and was completely exonerated. Compare that to the Academy nominated ""Flight"". This fictional story was wrapped around a hero pilot that had dark secrets. That fictional story also allowed for a more dramatic crash landing. To 'sully' the material with any fictional personal problems or what not (wife can't deal with, other crew members think the captain is taking all the credit) would have turned this fact-based movie into something it wasn't. Sully the character is a straight arrow, nothing to hide. Nothing terribly exciting either. Thankfully Eastwood also knows the limitations of the material, with the film clocking in at a thankful 96 minutes. I suppose the big draw to see this on the big screen was to watch the special effects sequences of the miraculous water landing. I chose to wait until the DVD came out because I felt I might not be invested in this movie beyond the special effects. Tom Hanks is always charismatic, even more his sidekick Aaron Eckhart (proudly sporting a 70's moustache). His co-pilot character is allowed to be more engaging. I expect my reaction if I saw this in a theatre would be neutral, not a waste of money but not an award winner. I usually declare ""wait for the DVD"", however I am writing this review long after the big screen release, and the new phrase needs to change to ""wait for DVD/On Demand"" for this day and age.",Sully

164,gavinp9,"Well-made, well-acted true story",8,2 January 2018,"'Sully' is the biopic of Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Hanks) and his First Officer, Jeff Skiles (Eckhart) who had to land their plane in New York's Hudson River in 2009, after both engines failed directly after take-off. Even though it was all over within five minutes, the film does a great job of exploring a bit of what happened before, a lot of what happened directly after and plenty of the investigation. It's edited well, so it's not all chronological.Surprisingly, this is Eastwood & Hanks' first collaboration, and they're both in good touch here - Hanks is the no-nonsense, but relatable soon-to-be-retired pilot, Eckhart is the slightly-younger and more enthusiastic co-pilot and Eastwood keeps the narrative flowing and never allows it to get too boring, technical or bogged down in the passenger's experiences. Linney is sparingly used as Sully's wife Lorraine, and Porter (O'Malley) is head of the NTSB investigation - essentially the 'bad guy'.The film works as an investigation/mystery, casting some doubt, but also has plenty of tension and action showing the actual crash and aftermath. While it's not sad per se, it did almost bring a tear to my eye in some parts, as it is a feel-good film at its heart, with ""this is some good news that New York really needed - especially when involving a plane"" really hitting home.",Sully

166,Figgy66-915-598470,Brilliant portrayal of a potentially catastrophic event,10,9 December 2016,"9 December 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Sully. It's a strange experience to write about a film based on true events, even more so when you can remember the actual event occurring in real time. The landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River in New York was testament to the skill and experience of Captain Chelsey Sullenberger and his Co-pilot Jeff Skiles as he brought the bird to an almost unheard of safe, yet watery landing which saved all 155 souls on board. Immediately hailed a hero by the media and pretty much the whole of the TV watching, social media connected world, Sully's bravery and heroism was quickly brought into doubt by the NTSB enquiry which seemed to suggest that he needn't have landed on the river at all. The cast was very cleverly assembled, bringing together a group of officials who were smugly sanctimonious and utterly sure they were bringing an airline pilot to task for a sure fire mistake which had almost cost people their lives. History tells us they were wrong but the film had me wanting to put these people in their place as I was itching to shout at the screen and remind them what a hero Sully really was. A first collaboration for director Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, it was superbly shot and CGI has come on a long way enabling us to really believe the plane on our screens was hitting the water. Tom Hanks is a consummate professional, an actor who assumes the character of every role he plays with a flair you don't find in many other actors, and he brought the personality of Sully to the screen with skill and compassion which made us really believe we could read the thoughts and feel the emotions of the man he was portraying. This was one of the rare films where I didn't move in my seat until it had ended. A definite watch!!!!",Sully
167,Rendanlovell,Structural issues abound.,6,16 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood is back with yet another true story film. Unlike his last based on a true story flick, 'American Sniper', 'Sully' actually works pretty well. And it makes for a surprisingly gripping story at that. If you're unaware, the story is about an airline pilot. The same one that landed an airbus in the Hudson river in 2009. Naturally, this is his story. But it's told slightly differently than you'd expect. 60% of the film actually takes place after the incident and the other 40 is told through flashbacks that are triggered in some way. This was the aspect of the film that really suffered the most. There are so many flashbacks in this movie. There are so many that this otherwise engaging story starts to feel disjointed. There are one or two that feel genuine and work fairly well, but the majority are just crammed in where ever they could fit them. It felt a lot like 'Suicide Squad' in that, these flashbacks didn't really serve much purpose. They almost felt like they had too much footage and decided to just stick it in somewhere.The worst offender happens about twenty minutes in. The film opens after the water landing, of which we don't see. We see that Sully is being put on trial for endangering the lives of his passengers and crew. This plays out for about twenty minutes and is shockingly gripping I might add, and then it suddenly flashes to directly before the flight occurs. But it doesn't just end there. No, we sit for about twenty more minutes as we watch the entire accident occur.This scene, and many other flashbacks like it, come out of nowhere and overstay their welcome. This one, in particular, does nothing for the film other than blatantly show you exactly what happened. And that isn't really a bad thing, but when the first twenty minutes of your movie is board meetings, it feels out place to jump to this plane scene. We all know the story, and the film does a great job of showing it subtly.Yet, for some reason it stills shows the full event to you. It doesn't help push the story forward, nor does it build character. And, to make things worse, this very scene is shown again later in the film. With this second time actually feeling like it belonged there. When you tell a story like this through flashbacks, they have to drive things forward. A good example of this is 'Incendies'. But 'Sully' just pushes in random footage that rarely helps the film in any way. This effects the pacing drastically. Watching these engaging trail sequences to only flip to a flashback makes this movie more of a lame roller coaster ride. Where you'll be exhilarated sometimes and just bored the rest of the time. It doesn't help that the shooting style is rather bland. The visual style of the film is very mute and stationary. Which can work, but here it just looks boring.By now you are probably thinking that I hated this movie, but I didn't. In fact, I thought it was decent. This mainly has to do with the non-flashbacks aspects of this movie. When the film plays out uninterrupted it works very well. It's very restrained and subtle actually. The scenes that take place after the crash all felt like they served a purpose. Each one helped flesh out our main character or forward the plot with interesting new information that caused conflict.Conflict that actually felt like it had weight to it. Each new piece of info that Sully receives is almost always something bad. And each time you can see him sink a little more into himself. And watching this kind of hurts. You know that he's a genuine guy and saved hundreds of lives, but there's always consequences. So when you throw consequences in a film like this they actually carry weight.You don't want to see him put on trial because he just saved hundreds of people. But that's what happens, and it works very well. Of course, this couldn't have been accomplished without Tom Hanks. Who is typically great. The entire cast is actually pretty great. They all take on their character in interesting ways even if their character translates to nothing more than a line on a paper.However, 'Sully' is ultimately a frustrating watch. That mainly has to do with the fact that this could have been great and just wasn't. There's an excellent movie in there and it's ruined by jumbled storytelling. Excessive flashbacks grind the film to a halt nearly every time they surface and never really help the film move along. This along with a boring look and bizarrely abrupt scene changes really hurt an overall good movie. The cast, crew and investigation aspects of the film are definitely its saving graces. Without them, we'd be left with another True Story flick to throw by the wayside.",Sully

I will say tom hanks did a great job in the title role, since scully is not certain if he considers himself a hero but rather someone doing his job.

Although you can't say the film drags, it doesn't go anywhere either, and it can be dull instead of gripping to see something only possible to perform without human emotion.

This depiction is nonsense on its face. I'm not naïve, and well aware that Federal authorities are not angels. You should be wary of their motives and conclusions.But as a simple matter of fact, the NTSB does not throw around accusations in the days following an accident. They WILL ask questions like ""why didn't you return to La Guardia"" because that's a valid question that needs a direct answer, and that direct answer is ""I didn't believe we could make it."" There's noting accusatory about the question itself, and you're not staring down Skylar White.It's just unfortunate they went there. There is quite ample drama in the actual event.

Writing, editing and emotional directing crafts the portrait of this modern day modest hero with bravo. The storytelling choices, non-chronological order, details, scenes and people portrayed all add the the tension and depth of this fascinating, and familiar to some, story. Laura Linney who is always seen only on the phone gives a credible (incredible!) performance, while Aaron Eckhart and his co-pilot character are well utilized.Clint Eastwood ultimately nails it with the right choice of music he also contributes to, like in low-key but grandiose Gran Torino (2008), along with the flashbacks-flashforwards and figments of Sully's imagination to tell the story and inner feelings the best way, and the sheer thrill of a serious and spectacular life and death situation.Everything unfolds perfectly, ends on a high and comical note and feels like hours because of its intensity instead of the taut 96 minutes in actuality, like the only 24 minutes rescue. Thirteen years after the acclaimed Mystic River (2003), Eastwood and ""Sully"" safely and improbably land on the river.Like Sully who thanks his co-pilot and crew, the passengers and first respondents for this amazing team effort rescue, Eastwood has many people on his team to thank, including long time contributor but first time real lead editor Blu Murray, for all putting in the pieces together to this cinematic masterpiece.",Sully
172,jb_campo,Good depiction of heroism,7,15 January 2017,"Sully features a strong performance by Tom Hanks as the Captain of a fateful US Airways flight that skirted death by a miraculous successful water landing in the Hudson River after taking off from Laguardia airport in NYC. This reminded me a bit of the fictitious movie Flight, where the pilot did something heroic, then was questioned every which way about why it happened. In this case, why could you not get back safely to an airport.We know the ending of the event, but Sully gives you a behind the scenes feeler into what happened afterwards.The weakness of the film is that there was that one point (the takeoff incident) that was the focus, nothing else. Eastwood as director tried to bring in other events in Sully's life about his love of flying, his youth, his relationship with his wife, but those added really very little to the story. I would have liked to see more info about the co-pilot, excellently played by Aaron Eckhert. That might have helped support the story better. But maybe there was no drama there to build on. Eastwood tried to build some supporting drama, but his only real focus was the crew's reaction after the poop hit the fans, literally. That left very little to excite the viewer.The film takes some swipes at bureaucracy, and the often times idiocy of people who were not there taking judgment. It's unclear if the FAA questioned ANY of the passengers who had survived, or whether they just investigated based on black box data.The flight scenes are terrifically realistic, and the heroism of the entire crew under fire was just incredible. I recommend Sully as a very good depiction of a real life event. It's a film that is worth seeing in spite of the short focus of the plot. Enjoy.",Sully
173,eshwarmail,A crackling performance by Tom Hanks dealing a powerful incident with operational efficiency,7,26 January 2017,"It is difficult to forget the positivity and heartwarming end to some powerful events that we come across in our daily life or through the media and 'Sully' covers one such event which consoled the world that not every bad incident would end in a tragedy. While the incident is still powerfully etched in our minds due to its coverage, this movie tries to cover the human aspect and behind-the-scenes events from the perspective of the man who made this possible - Captain Chesley Sullenberger.On 15th January, 2009 US Airways Flight 1549 (Airbus 320-214) took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport with the experienced and sure-handed Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) at the helm along with his First Officer Jeffrey B. Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). Three minutes into take-off, the flight was hit by a flock of Canada geese leading to the shutdown of its engines and flight losing its thrust. Using all his experience as a flight safety expert, glider pilot as well as his instincts, Sully landed the plane on the River Hudson without any casualties despite instructions to return to the source airport or the other nearby options. An inquiry was ordered by NTSB whose initial evaluation through flight simulators suggested that it would have been possible for the flight to have made it back to LaGuardia airport. With evidence mounting against him, can Sully come out of this serious accusation of endangering lives of all the passengers and crew aboard the flight.It is impossible to not draw comparisons with a similarly themed Robert Zemeckis's movie 'Flight' which also deals with a freak and impossible crash landing followed by an investigation. The major difference apart from one being fiction is the melodrama quotient. 'Sully' deals the entire episode with operational efficiency without bringing in emotion where it was not necessary. The surprising and overwhelming nature of the situation that doesn't have a precedence is well countered by the experience, maturity and confidence of the Captain who is a veteran of thousands of flight hours and air-crash investigations - aptly portrayed by Tom Hanks. The way Sully is shown to conduct himself in this extraordinary situation makes you respect the real man even more. While the focus is mostly on Sully, Aaron Eckhart shows his quality by making his presence felt without actually having to force it in. One more interesting segment is how Sully deals with the situation on the personal front with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) while speculating possible outcomes from the impending investigation.Apart from the leads, Anna Gunn (Breaking Bad fame) also gives a nuanced performance as Elizabeth Davis, an NTSB panel member who was heading the investigation. Rest of the cast gives an apt performance despite just being in the background. Coming to the technical departments - the visual effects of the crash looks natural, the screenplay makes the events more interesting by non-linear flip-flopping between the incident and the investigation. However the final hearing of the investigation is hurried to bring the revelations hastily in a day which in reality would have taken weeks to conclude. Despite its short runtime, it sometimes felt repetitive and dragging occasionally. Age seems to be just a number for director Clint Eastwood who has maintained relevance and quality in his second innings (last 10-15 years) which is a stark contrast of the genre for which he was a superstar for decades previously.A crackling performance by Tom Hanks dealing a powerful incident with operational efficiency.",Sully

These people neither inhabit the roles they have nor seem to appreciate what it is to be in a crisis scenario.

175,nicolechan916,Slightly suspenseful,8,25 September 2016,"The trailer does a good job at adding suspense to the film, and while it is exciting at times, the film overall has a feel of an educational video. Because it centers around a specific event, the film concentrates on showing us the before, during, and after scenes of that pivotal decision. Sully is a good watch, however, you might come out not thinking you watched a movie. Hanks and Eckhart do great together. Both totally embody their characters, so much so, that I did not even recognize them. More specifically Eckhart, because Hanks is recognizable anywhere. The emotions, especially that of intense thought from Hanks, is well done. Not only does Hanks portray his character's emotions well, but the film- making overall, does an incredible job at magnifying those emotions. Eastwood has done well in directing this film. In most cases, frequently jumping between the past, the event, and the present, can be confusing. However, it worked well for this movie. By not giving us all the details of one timeline at once, it adds more suspense to the movie. Also, the crafting of certain words and scenes makes the audience think in different directions. So, while the story is based on a true story, and seems to be quite accurate, it is rather thrilling the way in which it insinuates different outcomes. Overall, a well made film that was educational as well as a little thrilling. On the down side, I watched this in AVX (my first time), and was quite disappointed. It was not worth the extra money.",Sully
176,doorsscorpywag,Fine film of an extraordinary day in New York.,8,4 December 2016,"One of the questions asked of this film is was Sullenberger a hero? Most of us have travelled by plane and I doubt many ever take any notice of the pilot or crew. Unless he was Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden I never pay much attention and we only hear them during announcements of the weather and such like. They dutifully stand there and wish us a good day as we depart but I can never remember their names or what they looked like by the time I get to baggage claim.And that's fine as we don't burn the face and name of a taxi or bus driver into our memory and probably never see the train driver.But they all have one thing in common. They take responsibility for our lives during the journey. I doubt many passengers ever consider this when they start the journey or care after they finish.But what happens when something goes wrong?We all saw the news and were astounded that this man managed to save ALL on board by doing the unthinkable. Landing a passenger jet on a busy river. I have been on the Hudson around Manhattan and there is a lot of traffic.Clint Eastwood tells the story of that day and the subsequent investigation quite well. The acting is fine too. I am not a Tom Hanks fan myself but he manages a superb performance as Chesley Sullenberger and the supporting cast is good as well.Some have questioned if this deserved a film but if something this incredible does not then frankly what does?The story of that day is quite astonishing. The film shows how ordinary the time before the actual flight was. Passengers get ready to board and three rush to the gate and have to talk their way onboard after the gate was closed. We see the take off and then the disaster of the bird strike. Aaron Eckhart and Hanks portray the calmness that pilots need to work the problem when most of us would be screaming wrecks. The cabin crew, who we only notice when we need a drink, also show their professionalism at a time of crisis.The river landing sequence is also rather impressive but I wager not as impressive as it was on the actual day.Clint tells this segment rather well.But sadly as in films of this type he saw the need to have a protagonist as all Clint's movies have a bad guy. He chose to sully (pun intended) the NTSB investigation who seemed to be looking for scapegoats and had their sights set on the two pilots. Sully brilliantly defeats the bad guys by turning their evidence on it's head and saving his reputation. These scenes were well acted but a rather stupid portrayal of professionals who do their job under the worst circumstances in order to learn what happened and what could be in turn learned for the future. One profound comment from one of the panel is that it was unusual to conduct these types of inquiry with both pilots present. That makes you think how hard it is for these people to do this job. They deserved better than Eastwood's slighting their integrity. So the next time you set foot on a plane remember that these people not only take your lives in their hands for the duration of the flight but if anything goes wrong take the responsibility for that.So was Sully a hero? Probably not by the strict definition of what a hero is! But he and his crew did something exceptional that day and showed tremendous courage. But without his contribution we probably would not remember them.",Sully
177,higherall7,Genius and Self Control,9,10 September 2020,"The success of genius has as much to do with context as it has to do with anything else. What Thomas Edison said about perspiration and inspiration still goes. When it works to insure and promote the safety and well-being of others it is often displayed at its best. The film story of SULLY (2016), directed by Clint Eastwood, with Tom Hanks playing the titular role, is an example of this.Genius represented in professionalism is a subject treated in film not nearly enough. I think men particularly value and treasure the ability to do the right thing at the right time under stress. You may recall that Hemingway was often quoted as calling it grace under pressure. Yes, even a Novelist and Big Game Hunter has been known to run into it from time to time. The ability to think sanely and intelligently in extraordinary circumstances is an essential component of real life heroism and the bedrock of most success stories. It can take the exercise of self control tempered and refined and qualified with training and practice to exercise this quality.There is nothing like encountering an emergency situation and feeling duly prepared to confront and handle it. Reading about John Glenn in Thomas Wolfe's THE RIGHT STUFF and remembering the homey way he shared his adventure in orbit with all of us on Earth while handling the forces of velocity and a loose heat shield readily comes to mind. But facing danger to advance human knowledge isn't quite the same kettle of fish as saving the bacon for 155 souls. It was wonderful to see a trained professional save lives with his expertise and be able to utter with or without shrugging that he was just doing his job.Real life isn't the movies, but then, you already knew that. The truth is genius and heroism are far more commonplace than might be imagined, but in this Brave New World of Public Relations and Spin and Superheroes, we tend to focus more on the showy and glamorous aspects of it, rather than presenting it in all its work-a-day details. Parents who raise their children to continually rise above their flaws and imperfections to successfully face life are heroes. Artists and Scientists and Inventors who hold fast to the values of their visions and dreams of universes teeming with joy in creation and in life are heroes, too. But then there are your everyday heroes like the quick-witted Crosstown Bus Driver, who closes the back door on a gang member seconds after he has snatched a woman's purse out of her lap and runs down the aisle to hop out of the exit, driving off while the rest of the gang at the curb explode the windows with rocks and jagged pieces of concrete.I would venture to guess Chesley Sullenberger is not much different from this colored Bus Driver. He trained to do a job and he did it. He was prepared to do the right thing no matter what circumstances dictated. This reminds me of what one of the Black Belts said when he was quoting our Master Instructor Sang Kyu Shim in Tae Kwon Do class. ""When preparation is complete, execution is guaranteed.""We could all hazard to understand this a little better. This particular case might be an excellent example to study.Naturally, I am waxing rhapsodic about this because of the workmanlike job Clint Eastwood accomplished in bringing the story of Chesley Sullenberger to Life. I have read that we live in a world of Public Relationships, but I believe this world will fast give way to the movement towards an era of TECHNOLOGICAL CLASSISM where we become less concerned with the beauty of appearances and more concerned with the beauty of how things work. I personally think Clint Eastwood's SULLY is a valuable contribution to this movement. It even makes me want to go and learn to drill how to break down my bike better in case I should ever have a flat.Tom Hanks was never more the Every Man Hero than in this movie. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Styles and Laura Linney as Lorraine Sullenburger, along with the rest of the supporting characters, handle their roles with realism and restraint. But this has been an Eastwood hallmark for awhile now.A lot of us remember Eastwood from the early days, when he played Rowdy Yates on RAWHIDE, and the Wagon Master would have to go into town to get him out of jail or his latest trouble. We were rooting for him when he went to Italy to do those THE MAN WITH NO NAME Spaghetti Westerns to cultivate a screen persona he could grow and evolve. As the years went on, I marveled at how he had broken out of the pack of the television leading men of the fifties and sixies; guys like Ty Hardin, Adam West, Clint Walker, Steve McQueen, even James Garner, to became an acclaimed director and filmmaker in his own right. Since making his directorial debut with PLAY MISTY FOR ME (1971), it seems to me he has never looked back.The script, written by Todd Komarnicki, is technically meticulous and tightly crafted. I would quibble that more of a back story in flashbacks for a handful of the passengers might have been better for the authenticity of the narrative. This, rather than focusing on the drama with the National Transportation Safety Board, a portion of which, from all accounts, is somewhat contrived. But there is no denying that Eastwood and crew have captured what it is like for a working man to answer the call of his Highest Duty.",Sully
178,FallenEye,A Sullied NTSB.,6,25 August 2017,"When Captain Sullenberger delivered his speech, during the ""hearing"", a speech which by the way was so tranquil and true, the NTSB's reaction was of defeat, as if their role is to convict, rather than find what is the truth. Either that area of the movie was directed badly, misrepresented by this film or, the NTSB is 100% unethical. Which ever reason it may be, sadly for me, it took away from the movie.Dr. Elizabeth Davis's apology meant little, to nothing at all. That entire panel seemed as if they were just ""caught out/caught red handed"" when Sully delivered his rationale, almost suggesting that, that piece of knowledge Sully brought to light, they already knew, but were hoping would fly under the radar, so they could condemn an innocent man... And because this is based on true events, it makes it especially disgusting to fathom.Beyond that, Sully is a good movie, just, good. The direction, photography, acting and score, just good all around... Nothing really stood out, but everything came together in a, good way. 6.5/10.",Sully
179,Aly200,Doing the Right Thing,8,17 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks come together in this powerful true story about the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" and it truly is a miraculous movie. From Eastwood's deft camera-work to the subtle acting and music and the limited use of special effects all in an amazing tale of heroic endeavor in midair.Tom Hanks is perfectly in the titular role of Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. Hanks aptly portrays the wisdom of Sullenberger's 40+ years of piloting experience with ever breaking his calm demeanor. Maintaining his position on the course of action he undertook on the fateful day of January 15, 2009, Sully ultimately proved his actions were justified in saving 155 passengers. This is a tour de force performance by the legendary Oscar winner and his chemistry with fellow actor Aaron Eckhart (as First Officer Jeff Skilles) is spot-on.The narrative is straightforward in telling of Captain Sully's heroic maneuver after a bird strike destroyed his plane's engines. The investigation of the crash portion of the film is really condensed (due to time constraint obviously) in order to keep the film's run-time short. What is kept in the film is still golden material and does not dumb down the amazing feat that Captain Sully achieved. Truly one of Clint Eastwood's best films to date.",Sully
180,austin0731,the miracle on the Hudson,8,18 September 2016,"Sully is an emotional film with amazing performances. Tom Hanks as always was brilliant, this man could not fail to embody a role. I thought that it was very interesting that instead of reciting the events of the water landing we also got to see the aftermaths and outcomes of the event. This is one of Clint Eastwood's shortest films and I think this sort of length is much better as the long run times sometimes really makes the film drag for quite a bit, so that is one good thing that came out of the film.One of my favourite parts of the movie was that we were not given one side to root for throughout the film, we got both sides of the argument and at times either sides to the argument seemed very plausible and made a lot of sense. This really got audiences thinking, 'was it captain Sully making everyone at risk by performing a water landing? Could he really have made it back to the airport under the conditions?' It was very interesting to get to see and analyze for yourself instead of the film shoving it in your face.This film really captures the best qualities of people, how when facing a common threat people would band together and collaborate and support each other. All 155 passengers and crew were saved and have survived the landing, not only due to captain Sully's landing and experiences but is really this joint effort of policeman, fireman and all the people who came together in the light of need. This could be a very powerful message and imagery that is very empowering and a very important part of the real life event that the film captures impeccably.",Sully

182,FelipeCarrillo,"Clint Eastwood Synthesizes His Ambitions With ""Sully""",8,17 December 2016,"Great feat or miracle on the Hudson took place on January 15, 2009, in extensive waters (503 km) of the river (national heritage), which serves as the borderline between New York and Jersey City. US Airways Flight 1549 (AWE1549) to Charlotte Airport - CLT (North Carolina); which would go to Seattle Airport (SEA) - SeaTac, took off from New York City exactly at local time 3:11 p.m. EST with 150 passengers and 5 crew members aboard. The huge aircraft ditched safely in the icy waters after a Canada geese flock struck on aircraft engines. Without any relation to terrorism events, the domestic commercial passenger flight was floated near Circle Line at local time 4:00 p.m. EST, where were numerous ferries and tugboats of the NY Waterway, which took part in the rescue. The expertise of the pair of pilots was honored and praised around the globe as ""the water landing most successful in the history of aeronautic"", a prevented misadventure, which become engraved in mostly American heads forever. Knowledgeable (and retired) airline captain Chesley Burnett ""Sully"" Sullenberger was socially deified— and rightly—for his heroic and unique wonder in Yankee history. It was a matter of time for a dramatization on the big screen was released in worldwide movie theaters, the trouble seemed to be the final amount of material for building a solid narrative (and homage) for the blessed survivors and demanding audience. As Sully argues, the answer is ""yes,"" although just barely.With a surprisingly measured budget, keeping in mind that it is director's first motion picture shooted with IMAX cameras in its entirety and there is big visual responsibility, 60 million dollars of production were swiftly recovered—notably, American spectators dominated sale of movie tickets due to it was a shocking event into the country and besides, it is no secret that U.S.A presents the highest commercial demand in the industry—in its first days in movie listings, earning a whopping $26,820,803 DD in its second day of American projections. Although its highest grossing was thanks to Yankees' billfolds, multiplex cinemas beyond its borders providing— still producing money at the box office and it is necessary to deposit the gross from its digital, Blu-ray, and DVD release—a considerable sum of money ($94,000,000 DD), which added with American numbers generate nearly $218,779,510 DD, a resounding success in economic reception. As movie itself, the powerful alliance between Aaron Eckhart & Tom Hanks, crew of writers, Clint Eastwood and Warner Bros. is a simple and reflexive tribute for that brave action, with a usual powerful performance by the main leads, realistic special effects, and a correct direction. This one will portray through the passaging of years what happened exactly on January 15, 2009, and in its later hours.Based on the autobiographical book ""Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters"", director Eastwood and his team focus more on the nature of the character than in the event itself, even so, this is the major attraction of the full-length film. Rather than presenting events of early 2009 in a chronological order, they decided to employ an anachronistic narrative that relies—in large part—on layered, prolonged, and captivating flashbacks. While it tells the story in three periods interspersed with the reinterpretation of the water landing, which concludes with suffocating (and sometimes laughable) investigation by NTSB.Tom Hanks as Sully is a fervent proof of the complicated control that the veteran actor has for portraying masterfully to ordinary people in extraordinary situations, and precisely that is what we wished, and for better or for worse, the decision to discern of giving more theatricality to the accident and limit themselves to psychology of characters gave more opportunities to shine.As I mentioned previously, fragmented (and occasionally repetitive) water landing scenes are the ring of film. Projected from three different perspectives: outside of the passenger airplane, with passengers, and with pilots, their efficacy and efficiency around the reconstruction of events are visually stunning and CGI quality is almost complete. Perhaps, many would prefer giving more prominence to that moment, nevertheless, directors as Eastwood decide to put visual excitement aside to emphasize and delve into the life of their heroes: heroes and tragic facts will always be present in their films.Simplicity and modesty in ""Sully"" by Clint Eastwood affect to the motion picture, comparing it with the most iconic works of the director, however, it delivers a correct level of solvency, a spectacular performance by Tom Hanks and an emotional, satisfying and faithful homage for rescued crew members and passengers.",Sully

The film is about Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who managed to land a plane in the Hudson River. But I gave it a shot. This is a low-key film, and the events are not made in chronological order. But this actually makes the film work better than expected. Clint Eastwood uses good actors like Tom Hanks, to tell the story from different angles. Tom Hanks manages to give Hero Sully depth and insight on several levels. Including how it is to suddenly come into focus for the whole world. I thought the film was a little unexciting the first half hour, but Eastwood manages to tell this story thoroughly. And the film picked up and I was engaged by it. Do not expect great action scenes, the film the film is actually a good drama about a man and his great accomplishment.",Sully
185,PetarNeo,Fascinating story,9,5 December 2016,"Miracle on Hudson told from many different perspectives and how it affected pilots lives. Movie gradually builds up story even there isn't much to tell but it gives more focus on Sully and how he dealt with situation that was not going as everyone would expect. It was truly brave and exceptional thing to do knowingly and for that Sully deserved movie that will also try to give us picture of him and Hanks did a wonderful job. Hanks and Eastwood are trying to create feeling of how Sully felt and what he was going through all that time and it was spectacular. Hanks gives a strong performance as he is emotional, mentally distracted and goes through tough times but with support that he receives mostly from Jeff and then his family and friends. Aaron Eckhart played Jeff and he was also amazing with his whole trust and believe but also gratitude for saving everybody but also him. Clint Eastwood once more proves that there are stories to be told and that it's never to late for them to reach their top.

Not believable but would have an attorney present if true.The sequencing of this film was disjointed and was in need of just a couple of sub-titles to let us know the time frame, location, and relative significance. I was never confused but those that did not consume main stream media during this event may need some help with connecting the dots.I would highly recommend that the flight attendants come up with something more instructional and less elusive than the term Brace! What the hell does that mean, who even uses that terminology, and other than feel scared as F it does not help at all to assist frantic scared passengers. I live very close to LAX and sometimes late at night they change the flight path directly over my head and is so loud my windows vibrate. Seeing this film makes me even more worried that something like this could happen right in my neighborhood. Good Grief!I have adored Tom Hanks since ""Big"" and imho he can do no wrong. Seeing interviews with the real Sully makes me think he did a perfect capture of his calm, cool, and collected nature. Bravo my friend! I felt most proud of this accomplishment by a seasoned pilot, who else could have pulled this off, Gordon Cooper?High recommend for Clint's attempt to recreate the entire rescue scene, amazing! And the lovely sense that GOD exists and whatever force that is, protected 155 lives on the Hudson. AMEN",Sully
187,Lewis_Heather787,"A Good all round film, with good performances and directing",8,3 October 2016,"Having already known the full extent of US Airways flight 1549, by watching numerous documentaries i.e. Air crash investigation, I was interested to see with a bigger budget how the reenactment of the flight would go. The signs were very good going into this film, firstly the director say what you will about American Sniper, Clint Eastwood is a very talented director. The cast Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are the two main draws of the film to entice people to watch it. Now the film itself, the positives are what I thought they might be, firstly the directing. I believe that directing wise this is an improvement from American Sniper for Clint Eastwood. Some camera positions were very interesting and also the perfect blend of CGI of the plane itself with the backdrop of New York worked really well.The jumps back in time throughout the film also really worked and didn't feel forced in at any point, especially the ""nightmares"" the captain is having, very powerful images. Next positive is the acting which is not a surprise to say is very good, which I think we as an audience have come to expect from Tom hanks these days. He once again knocked it out of the park and gave a really emotional heart to the film as well as the vehicle moving it forward through the story. Aaron Eckhart also was very solid in this film even when his character jokes and the end of the film, very we timed and shows that he is able to ""compete"" with the very best actors in the business. All in all this is a good film with solid performances and directing with an interesting story at the heart of it, well it should be considering this is a true story. The only negative I can think of is the middle part of the film starts to drag just little but I am only nitpicking. Finally I would give this film a 7.8 or 7.9 out of 10 not just good enough for an 8 but a damn good film.",Sully

189,heisenberg12,"Why? A run of the mill, predictable, done before bore-fest, but not bad.",6,4 December 2016,"Who cares? That's the question I asked about halfway through Sully. First off, it's as predictable a story there is. It only occurred a few years ago and in the first ten minutes, it's confirmed the story is going exactly where you thought: there's no surprises. For entertainment's sake, Eastwood effectively has to throw in a dream sequence where the plane crashes into a building before Hanks wakes up. Plane crash movies have also been overdone. Wasn't Flight just a few years ago? It was much more compelling and more unpredictable. But then there's just been so many flight films. The one with Liam Neeson, the Grey where the plane crashes, and too many more to name. The thing about them though is at least they were about more than a predictable plane landing. Hanks is, well, Hanks. He's not Sully, and is far removed from his Oscar caliber wins for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia. Wow, look at him jog in those scenes! He's decent, but no way should he beat out Andrew Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge. Speaking of Hacksaw Ridge, another biopic true story this year, it actually has something to say and a reason behind it. There's no way Sully should win a nomination over it in any competing category (voters take note). It's not a bad film, but is incredibly ""run on the mill"", and like I thought before watching it, I still don't know why this was made into a big movie. It would've worked fine on Lifetime.

193,ctowyi,an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger,8,12 September 2016,"Running at a lean and spry 96min, Clint Eastwood's Sully isn't so much a clinical bio-pic in the traditional sense, but an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger. On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, the world witnessed the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" when Captain Chesley Sullenburger (Tom Hanks) glided his disabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard. However, even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career.Tom Hanks underplays Sullenburger but in so doing he brings out the multi-layered human qualities in the man. This is about a man who has 42 years of flying experience and he knows the aircraft like it is the back of his hand. Here is a man who does his job to the best of his abilities and he does it well. He will tell you he is not a hero but simply a man who is just doing his job. From a man with no time he becomes the man of all time. However, he is shaken to his very core when the doubts start to set in as the NTSB rips apart his heroic maneuver. Is Sullenburger a hero or a fraud? The story rests on Tom Hank's abled shoulders who has built a reputation playing understated and reluctant heroes in Bridge of Spies and Captain Phillips. On first look Hank didn't seem to put on his acting hat, but after a night of rumination his character continues to stay with me. His sullenly insular and taciturn manner displays a fully functioning problem-solver's mind, calculating the probability of survival in that instance when the birds hit the plane engines. Thank goodness he trusts his instincts rather than the computer. Hank isn't the only star in the story. At 86, Eastwood has meticulously crafted an honest story we thought we already knew into a tense drama with little bell and whistle. His unfazed skill in storytelling is assured and Sully definitely belongs to the top tier of his pantheon of good movies that include Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. In Eastwood's hands, the film flies above the usual biopic tropes and it feels like a homage to a modest man who rose to an extraordinary occasion and a salute to professionalism. It is a wonder the story doesn't carry an ounce of jingoism and it is a superb amalgam of the loud and the silence and the human elements of a near air disaster. The final star is definitely the plane crash. For a home-theatre enthusiast, the visuals and sonics are a feast for the senses. We get to see the crash and its aftermath from every physical and emotional angle. I can't remember the last time I see a reenactment of a plane crash so visceral and real. This is the closest you will get to experience one without actually being in one. I didn't care much for Eastwood's last directorial effort American Sniper because it carried too many skull-numbing and blatant embellishments, but with Sully he has redeemed himself. This may feel like a straight-forward story but the use of Rashomon-resque plot manipulation transcends the film above the usual biopics that you would forget after a night's sleep. I didn't forget this one today.",Sully

196,j_forbesy,Sully Review,8,28 September 2016,"I am a sucker for true story movies. I just love them. There is something about learning about an event or someone's life that is just interesting to me. Sully is no different. As I don't live in America, I had known about the plane landing in the river however my knowledge of the event stopped there. I really enjoyed this movie. I'll admit, it was a little different to how I thought it was going to be but it was different in a good way. Eastwood found a way to bring this movie to a human level. By this I mean he was able to tell the story of the crash and the events that followed through they eyes of multiple people involved. This made the film really relatable being able to see the point of view from Sully himself, the passengers and the crew on board the plane as well as the serve crew that were apart of the rescue.Another this Eastwood does is that I really enjoyed was the way this film was complied. He does something interesting where the film jumps back and forth between the crash itself, the investigation afterwards and past life experiences of Sully. I think this really kept the movie interesting because we got to see how there is so many factors that play into the movie. What was surprising about this was it didn't feel repetitive in anyway. When you see the plane crash for the third or fourth time, each time you feel like you are seeing something different. This is because you get the same event from multiple points of view like I mentioned before.Credit also has to be given to Tom Hanks. I thought his really nailed the emotional side this is film surprisingly has. The way he portrays the character during the immediate events after the crash was really fantastic and he had your full attention every scene he was in.8/10",Sully

I love Clint Eastwood's direction and this movie is not an exception. He created a film that is vital, intense, thoughtful and emotional. Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn.

198,Semisonic,When too much glorification is not a good thing,6,5 January 2017,"I'm sure that every one of you knows the story behind this film. A passenger plane dies in the air above NYC, and the captain pulls off a tricky save by landing the machine on the Hudson. A great job indeed. And one way too appealing to make a movie about.But it's just too boring to tell a story about a person who did his job right and saved a lot of lives. Or that's what the cinema bosses might be thinking. So let's bring in some less genuine or relevant conflict about the corporate pigs who always aim to blame the little man, or about the confused wife and financial struggle back at home. Yeah, that's so much better, now we can actually root for our guy even more and see that even if you're a hero for the whole nation you still have severe issues to fix. And what would be better than seeing the little man prevail and beat the evil system fair and square for all the world to see?Well, I don't know how exactly it was in reality, but the one created by Clint Eastwood was a bit too cloying to be appealing. Of course, it's impossible to criticize the work of one of the most esteemed actors-turned-director of late, featuring one of the most esteemed actors of the last decades, especially when it is about a true heroic story America could wholeheartedly call its own. So it's just easier to ignore the general lack of a true drama in this film and let yourself be tricked into spending a few bucks to watch something that would at last make you feel proud to be an American. After all, it's not just New York that was in a desperate need of good news, especially those about an airplane.I'm not an American. Still, it's no problem for me to admit that what the real Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger did was extraordinary. What the movie industry did with this story, however, is much farther from 'extraordinary' and much closer to 'sentiment exploiting and money grabbing'. Which of course is a form of art as well, just not as fine and noble as saving lives on board of a plane doing down.",Sully

There are many scenes such as the flashbacks to Young Sully and the scenes meeting the different passengers at the airport that could be cut out entirely

200,SpoilerAlertReviews,"A good tribute, but not Eastwood's or Hanks best work.",6,10 December 2016,"Clint Eastwood gives us the untold story of Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who successfully crash landed an Airbus A320 onto the Hudson River when it suffered dual engine failure from being hit by a gaggle of geese. Now some of us might expect a long, drawn out picture of what happened on that day, especially with it being from Eastwood who's known for doing films that would last much longer than the flight itself. But no, it's Eastwood's shortest film to date with a flight time of only 96mins. It's not about the passengers or the families relating to, nor is it about the flight crew or the other people involved in the rescue, however all these people are played out in the film; it's just very focused on Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and details the events after the incident. Rightly so. We know, or should know the details of the incredible emergency water landing that happened back in January 2009. Sully flying a routine US Airways flight 1549 from New York to Charlotte but lost power to both engines shortly after taking off and being at a considered low altitude. What does one do in that situation? What makes up the bulk of the story is how Sully is treated in the wake of the event by the press, the general public and most importantly coming under scrutiny from the National Transport Safety Board who, I suppose are just doing their job, but to question a seasoned pilot with 20,000hrs over a 40yr flying career who saved the lives of everyone on board hardly makes sense. There's quite a bit of turbulence in the structure of the film, jumping about with flashbacks and interviews, though this doesn't make it hard to follow, not at all. It's actually better that it's a not direct, linear film working towards the conclusion. I couldn't decide if this wanted to be a courtroom drama, because I don't think it's intended to be one. It's interesting to see the questions and emotional impact of those questions on Sully, was he a hero or did he actually endanger the lives of everyone on board. it's just a film about how ordinary people who do extraordinary things to then get questioned. He's a real life avenger made to question and doubt his actions. As expected, strong performance for Hanks and Eckhart is good as co-pilot Skiles, but everything else is a little disjointed. The re-enactment of the crash landing is impressive and is probably the stand out image piece of the film, the rest made up of script. A different and interesting score/soundtrack provided by Christian Jacob and The Tierney Sutton Band in collaboration with Eastwood, as he tends to do his own scores as well. (Mystic River being a personal fave.) It's soft, easy-listening and embellished by spiritual jazz songs. On a side note, not that it appears on the soundtrack, not suiting the film, but the song ""A Real Hero"" by College and Electric Youth was actually inspired by this event, well know for featuring on the Drive soundtrack. It's a good story and tribute to Sully, otherwise known as the miracle on the Hudson but it's missing something, maybe not aiming to be such a spectacle, but it's feels rushed, almost like a part-time film, complete but if not for flying scenes, it could be mistaken as a TV movie, certainly not either Eastwood's or Hank's best work.

The beginning of the movie shows a dream sequence by Sully when Flt 1549 crashes into New York buildings, then he wakes up.Later the movie shows the beginning of an investigation by the NTSB of what happened to Sully and flight 1549 on the Hudson River and as we watch we see this committee try to destroy Sully's reputation as it tries to persuade Sully and co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) that there were other options. They claim the computer simulations show they could have made it to Idlewild Airport. They claim the simulations also show the left engine was still idling. Sully says there was no way it could do that. This was hailed the Miracle on the Hudson, but the NTSB didn't see it that way. We see flashbacks of what happens in the cockpit and with the passengers as well just prior to the landing in freezing water. When Flight 1549 hits the water the CGI kicks in and we are most impressed and we let out a ""Wow!"" There is no other expression.We are privy to some of the things the public never sees as the NTSB makes its case. Sully demands to be allowed to see the simulations without waiting for the usual time duration that would be imposed. Sully believes the human factor was not considered in these simulations. He knows he did the right thing. Acting and action sequences all around were perfect. And yes I would give Tom Hanks the Oscar for Best Actor and let's not forget Clint Eastwood as Best Director. Kudos. Notables: Jamey Sheridan as Ben Edwards a NTSB member; Laura Linney as Lorraine, Sully's wife.The next best line in here was when NTSB member Anna Gunn as Elizabeth Davis asks co-pilot Skiles what would he have done different if he had it to do all over again. He says, ""I'd do it in July."" Over 300 New York police and fire rescue men and women helped rescue all 155 "" souls"" that were on Flight 1549.Stay tuned after some credits run to see clips of the real Capt Sully and many of the rescued passengers.

202,quinimdb,Sully,7,11 September 2016,"MINOR SPOILERSWhen most people hear the name Captain Sully, they probably think ""hero"", but ask him, or his family, and they'd describe him as a regular man. This film delves into his true feelings after the flight, and shows that for as much as he did for those people, he still felt as if he didn't deserve his praise. He felt that maybe the lawyers he was fighting against were right, and he actually endangered the people on that plane.We see that before the flight, Sully has has nightmares of almost the same thing happening before, but in those dreams, he crashes into buildings and dies, bringing many of the people on board with him. He constantly fears this loss of control in his plane, since it seems it is all he can truly control in his life. What does he say just before the engines go out in the real life incident? ""Life is better in the air"". He has probably thought about this many times, and this is probably why he maintains such a calm attitude about it as it is happening, as we see when we see the crash from the pilots' point of view. But still, he doesn't want the fame, because part of him feels he doesn't deserve it, no matter what everyone tells him. There is a great shot of Sully jogging through the streets, as his shadow grows in the smoke in front of him, and news reports of the crash can be heard in the background, showing Sully running from this false image of himself portrayed in the media.The film's structure revolves around his life after the flight, and his struggles with an insurance company working for the plane that was landed into the river. There are many flashbacks and flash forwards, and we are able to see Sully as who he is: A man. We also get to see the crash from first the point of view of the passengers, then the pilots. Some of the passengers are introduced swiftly to us, as the camera glides from person to person, getting us to care just enough for each one. Despite already knowing exactly what happens, these scenes of the planes crash are very intense. Since we know these people now, it is nerve wracking to see them put into such a near death experience. The camera gets shakier than usual, and you can tell the people don't think they are going to make it out alive. This makes it all the more alarming when we see how calm and collected Captain Sully is through all of this. Also, for a film that should be inherently predictable, it somehow remains unpredictable, specifically during the human flight simulations.In the end, we realize that we place all of the credit for everyone coming out OK on Sully, but in truth, it was everyone involved. If one person simply hadn't done their job, one person or more could've died. This includes the passengers, if they hadn't been smart, and stayed relatively calm while listening to what they were told to do, they would be dead. It was a miracle across the board that everyone turned out alright.",Sully
203,iantrader,Class act all round,8,22 December 2016,"Most folks will have forgotten about this real life event by the time they see this movie. I confess I was not aware of the underpinning investigation - thanks media guys! - which is what the movie is essentially about. Hero or not? That's what we discover.Superb writing and script and excellent direction from Clint Eastwood as you'd expect. Tom Hanks is sublime as always. Aaron Eckhart plays a bit of a second fiddle role but is superbly supportive. One of the underlying aspects of the movie is the matter-of-factness with which the characters portray their roles and go about their business - much as you'd expect an airline pilot to do.The slightly unsettling investigation shows big business looking for a scapegoat - no surprise there, then...!There are a few interesting quotes such as ""It's a long time since New York had news this good - especially with an airplane in it."" Although one thing I don't understand is how passengers could talk to each other on mobile phones after they'd been in the water. Definitely not iPhones, then...All in all this is an excellent movie with a class director and actors and well worth your time.",Sully

You just know.. I was reluctant myself to go to the movies and watch it cause it seemed more of a pay-per-view film to watch at home. It's not.It's masterfully made, keeps the sense of suspense high and although the movie is not revolving around the specific time that the accident took place, but goes beyond that point in time, it's still amazing. I loved all the flashbacks and leaps in time. Tom Hanks seems to be raising the bar over and over again and it won't be a surprise to see him get an Oscar for this. He depicted a determined, professional but deeply human pilot that managed to do what no one thought could be done. This movie is all about surpassing human limits and living up and beyond expectations. It's a movie about the real world and a real movie at the same time. It's a high-quality, high-fidelity and high- standard one. It's the best movie I've seen so far within 2016.",Sully
206,cdjh-81125,A Fantastic Examination of A Forced Hero,8,5 January 2017,"When I first heard about a film being made about the proclaimed ""Miracle on The Hudson"" I wasn't really sure how much of a watch it was going to be compelling or even an event capable of making into a feature film but after watching the final product I was extremely impressed and I would consider watching this film again. From the first few scenes I quickly realised that Tom Hanks was a fantastic choice for the role of Chelsey Sullenberger he perfectly embodies his reluctance to accept the title that has been hoist upon him and his characters experience as a pilot. In my opinion Aaron Eckhart gives his greatest performance since The Dark Knight like Hanks he embodies his characters experience and knowledge but unlike Hanks he seems more hot headed and light hearted making him the perfect person to stand next to Hanks. As I previously said I was worried about this film being compelling otherwise it could slip into a tedious bore but thankfully it isn't mainly due to the fantastic structuring of this film, the film doesn't open with the plane crash but instead is gradually cut back to and seen from different perspectives and it was the best way to do this film as it gave weight to the situation and its aftermath, I think if it was done in chronological order it would have made the film slow down and drag after that pivotal moment. Clint Eastwood did such a good job of directing this film but it really shows in the plane crash he makes it intense and lifelike. However my biggest issue with Sully is its lack of subtlety in certain places, places such as the flashbacks to Sully's career in it felt extremely on the nose and came across as forced exposition that was already being perfectly covered with the investigation into the crash. Another area that fell flat was Sullys family drama it just wasn't done well and in the end just came across as a series of phone conversations that didn't really add anything to this film. Sully is a fantastic film, definitely one of Eastwoods better efforts, both central performances from Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart at brilliant, it manages to turn this event into a compelling and riveting experience and I easily one of the best Aviator films I've ever seen. 82%/A-",Sully

After watching it, you might just wonder if you find that need too. Barely clocking in at 90 minutes, Eastwood prosaically rushes and stifles whatever material there is to transpose and work with, as Tom Hanks, playing another Tom Hanks' default role (who else could have played it anyway), does whatever he can with a by-the-numbers basic ""script"". When in such a short film a director and a screenwriter are required to repeatedly relapse into dream sequences of the could-had-been, you know you're in for a (figurative) crash landing. In the end Sully is nothing more than harmless, forgettable and ironically uneventful.

211,contactmaz,Overrated but watchable,4,3 December 2016,"The film started off OK but as the story developed, if was very slow and boring. I did watch it to the end because I always likes to see how the underdog beats the powerful opposition which, in this case, were investigators who had already made up their minds that the two pilots were 'guilty'. However, in the final part of the film, I found that the woman investigator's actions wrong and, IMO, she and her colleagues should have been investigated for ignorance and contempt. Why??? Well had Sully not questioned the number of times the pilots practiced their run, the investigation would have found them guilty. However, because Sully did question this, the simulator was rerun with new parameters and the pilots were then found to have acted correctly.... WHICH brings to me to my point. The investigator (Anna Gunn) then had the nerve and audacity to say that she had never met a pilot like Sully, his actions were heroic and so on. So either her views changed within about 30 seconds (which I severely doubt), or she knew he was heroic from the beginning but continued along her path of scapegoating etc. with her other investigator colleagues. So if the did indeed say those words then she/they should be investigated and if it was just artistic Hollywood licence, then it was really OTT.",Sully

Very, very good!An out of the ordinary movie, as it is a true story that gives it a feel good touch.Highly recommended!

It is about when Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed U.S. Airways flight 1549 onto the Hudson River. Many people called this ""Miracle on the Hudson"" but the maximum of them do not know what actually happened. Mr. Sully, this national hero was also being investigated for his actions on that day which put his career in peril. this movie tells the whole story of this investigation and how Mr. Sully struggled and to deal with the new found honor and the stress of post-trauma and the crash had on him and his crew.This is a Clint Eastwood movie and Tom Hanks starring the central role Sully. He portrayed the role Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger very nicely and think he really deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. No doubt that Tom Hanks is a very talented actor and again he proves this. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles has also done a good job. But the main hero is Tom Hanks. He acted naturally when the plane landed and his bravery was very good at the screen. He made sure all the 155 passengers were good and this sequence of the movie was very good and really worth watching. Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles who was in the cockpit on that day and he also has done a nice job and his comedic delivery was good.Clint Eastwood's direction was OK but nothing to shout about. He has made a much better movie than this and this is not his best effort. I think the script is a little bit choppy and slow and the character development not so imposing for a true story.

218,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 98,10,30 September 2016,"I was initially wondering how they would make a 30 minute event into a full-length feature. But then I remember, this is Hollywood--they can do whatever they want.Sully is based on the true story of 2009's ""Miracle on the Hudson"" where Captain Chesley Sullenberger had to safely land a plane after a flock of geese flew into both engines, causing them to fail.The event was traumatic enough, but this film mostly details the airline investigation following the incident. Director Clint Eastwood wisely circles the narrative around, sprinkling the action amidst the drama, keeping the pacing up and saving us from having to experience a long, uninterrupted National Transportation Safety Board hearing.Throughout the film, Sullenberger is seen interacting with his wife, played by Laura Linney, on the phone. It's an interesting choice not to have them face to face in person. I've struggled to find a good reason why. Perhaps keeping them apart is to emphasize the film's ""delay is better than disaster"" theme. Or maybe it's to distance Sully from his family and show how he just longs to be home, creating irony around how he was nearly never to be home again. Or it might just be an interesting quirk that Eastwood decided to include. Whatever it is, it's unique and adds to the film's appeal.Perhaps the only thing that's distracting, though, is Linney's acting. It might seem like it's good on the surface. She shows a lot of emotion, yet is strong when she needs to be, but her delivery is just so off much of the time. It's not believable. It feels like she knows she's acting and is trying her best to sell it. Maybe it's because she was acting into a phone the whole time.But that's a minor setback. The film is uplifting, just like the 2009 event itself. It gives us a glimpse inside the mind of an American hero. A normal, everyman who lifted our country's spirits during a time when we really needed it. The film doesn't ruffle any feathers. Nor does it ever really make you ever second-guess our protagonist--which is for the best, I think, in this situation.

219,alexdeleonfilm,A tricky case of Unintentional bird gobbling Well done,9,6 October 2016,"Clint Eastwood's latest offering ""SULLY"" has been doing slam-bang box-office business in the USA since it is a well done Near Disaster film, and in a dark year of police shootings, other shootings, train crashes, and an upcoming election featuring candidates both of whom are likely to bring the entire nation to the brink of disaster, provides a ray of hope and something to feel good about --namely, the saving of 155 passenger lives when a quick thinking American pilot ditched his plane in the Hudson River after both his engines failed upon takeoff due to the unintentional ingestion of a flock of birds.This is not one of Mr. Eastwood's masterpieces but it is a very well made film (as usual with Clint) with near documentary effect and, obviously, very user friendly. What Eastwood has set out to do --and very effectively accomplished -- is to remind a public with impaired short term memory of an act of American heroism that took place a mere seven years ago and received massive news coverage at the time, but was soon lost in the shuffle of News overload with which we are bombarded every day -- and basically forgotten. How many people, even if they vaguely remember the event, can recall the name of the pilot who almost miraculously saved the lives of all of the 155 passengers aboard his plane when the plane was disabled upon takeoff from Laguardia in New York, by steering it powerless straight over Manhattan, managing not to crash into one of the towering skyscrapers, and safely ditching the aircraft in the icy waters of the wintry Hudson? The date was January 15, 2009, and the quick thinking pilot was Chesley Sullenberger -- not an easy name to remember -- but his nickname ""Sully"" is one that stays with you. So Clint has wisely chosen to name his picture just that and cast the best man in Hollywood for the job of playing Scully, Tom Hanks. Hanks sporting snow white hair in the picture is the right age -- 59 during the shoot whereas Sully was 56 in 2009 -- and nobody is better at playing men with a troubled conscience and constant pained expression. Following in the heels of last year's ""Bridge of Spies"" Tom has just about cornered the Pained Expression for a Whole Picture market. And he is actually believable doing it even if sometimes gets to be a bit much.Among other things Sully is a detailed process film about the piloting of airliners, but it is also much more. Most of the film actually takes place outside of the cockpit revealing Sully's struggle to justify his courageous act before a relentless board of inquiry trying to prove that he had other choices, such as landing at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. Even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill the investigation that was unfolding, and takes up the bulk of the picture's running time, was threatening to destroy his reputation and his career which adds a dimension of courtroom drama to the whole. In the end we find out he made the only decision possible after the plane was disabled shortly after takeoff when a flock of birds were swept into both engines knocking them out of commission. These scenes are white knucklers that put you right into the cockpit with Hanks and the co-pilot, Aaron Eckhart -- in a highly commendable supporting role. Another important role is that of his wife (Laura Linney) who is often on the phone with him with words of anxious support as he walks the streets of Manhattan having nightmares in broad daylight of the plane under his control not making it to the river but crashing into a building in a blaze of inglory. The scene in the river with a real plane floating precariously in the icy waters half submerged and the passengers lined up on the wings waiting for rescue teams to arrive must have cost a fortune to make and is so well mounted it looks like archival footage. Fall into the water and you're dead in a minute! -- even though we think we know the final outcome it's suspense all the way. Clint really knows his business and his new film is definitely a winner with various Oscar possibilities down the line, maybe even a third Oscar for Mr. Hanks. At age 86 Clint Eastwood, director, Is not looking back and shows no signs of slowing down. In that department I would consider him to be my role model.Ps: Tom Hanks is a lineal descendant of Nancy Hanks, mother of Abraham Lincoln -- No wonder he has such an incorrigibly honest look!",Sully
220,TheGreatMarkukini,The true story genre is moving in the right direction,8,9 April 2020,"The only thing that I knew about the movie is that it is based on a real story. I don't know the exact odds of landing a commercial plane on water intact with no losses, but as the event is actually called ""Miracle on the Hudson"" I can assume they are close to none.I really like the film adaptations of incredible stories that happened and were overlooked by people not affected by them. This makes me feel happy and shows that miracles do exist. However, too many times creators changed too many things or just stomped real facts in favor of action or more tension. This movie hasn't totally escaped the curse of selling the more compelling plot. Some characters were shown quite different than they were when the events actually occurred, and it was indeed looking weird in the movie.Despite of a chase for more attractiveness of the character (which I find very useless, as the crew of the flight 1549 were already heroes in my eyes), the style of the delivery is incredible. The back and forth of the events is used perfectly to show both the emotions of the pilots that performed an act of true professionalism and the above-mentioned doing itself.The modern technology allows you to experience that life threatening moment and can say that Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart totally impressed me with the performance making me appreciate the skill of the pilots even more.Overall, Clint Eastwood has made a very good example of the movie that tells a real life story. I would say that the genre is moving in the right direction. Now I would like to compare it to the book of Chesley Sullenberger.",Sully
221,hassanlu,Good real story and acting,7,21 November 2019,"The film is good but you will feel boring because of vey slow event and half of the film is flash back and the film is filled of repeated scene which just make it longer

222,The_Swedish_Reviewer,Predictable and therefore less exciting,2,13 December 2016,"I'm not surprised that this film gets such good ratings. Clint Eastwood handles the subject splendidly while Tom Hanks rarely fail in his performances. My objection to the film is the high degree of predictability and lack of excitement. Not that we don't know how this dramatic crash finally ended. But how the story is told.Hanks is good but his acting lacks presence as he does and says pretty much exactly what you expect. His character is the American hero stereotype, which is boring. The story is textbook example of how to make a predictable film: first, everything looks good, then it turns bad, then it turns good again, and you know it's going to be good. I was also surprised that Aaron Eckhart, who played the co-pilot, had so little to say or add to the story. His character reminded more of an extra. Despite the fact that he was in the cockpit landing the aircraft in the river, I almost felt he never was on board. No one asked him anything despite his efforts. Finally, what on earth did Sallys wife, played by Laura Linney, do in this film? I mean, it is hard to believe that the first thing a wife thinks about, after her husband survived a plane crash, is how they can afford to live in the house. I also disliked the repeated time jumps as they themselves became spoilers. The tempo was also too slow.There is by all means no doubt that this is a solid film made with quality and there are good things in it as well. The supporting actors did a fantastic job of adding realism and authenticity. The CGI parts were also pretty good even though I occasionally expected a little more. The interiors, environments, props and visual effects were all very convincing. Nothing felt random or done by mistake and for the most part I actually enjoyed it. But where was the drama? Why put a stone face on Hanks? Why make Eckhart so dull?",Sully
223,valen060,"Intricate Glimpse Into Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger",8,3 October 2016,"I've heard this airline captain's story through the news back in 2009 during one of my college classes at the time, but had no idea a film based on those events was created. Upon watching every minute of it, I'm now able to see what made Captain Sullenberger a hero to his passengers and those who know him personally.The plot revolves around his heroic efforts as he and his First Officer Jeffrey Skiles navigated their US Airways plane right into the Hudson River as a last ditch of effort after their plane had collided with Canadian Geese that flew right into the plane's engines. Despite such actions that saved their lives, there was also debate on the circumstance on what could've happened or what would've been better than Sully himself had explained.Tom Hanks' portrayal of the renowned captain was a pretty impressive performance. Instead of just merely trying to emulate the real-life airline captain's experiences on screen, he managed to capture the angst and personal struggles Sully had faced following from that traumatic event. The board hearing scenes had so much to talk about that it left me further curious on what made these events run into motion. For example, when using flight simulators as to project what happened that day and combining it with Sully's recollections via PTSD visions, it's like placing ourselves into his shoes step-by-step. Director Clint Eastwood followed up well from his previous Oscar-nominated film American Sniper by cranking out a story that focuses on how one man who doesn't see himself as a glorified hero, but a man who did anything a professional pilot would do by taking such incredible risks to save the lives of himself and those aboard. For a biographical drama that touches on the mystery and intrigue, this is a must-watch and is sure to hit various accolades.",Sully
224,ubasarsahin,documentary or a film?,5,22 June 2021,"Came to watch a movie and enjoy myself, ended up watching a boring, non-interesting documentary.

225,WooderIce64,Solid Movie about a Remarkable Moment,8,15 January 2018,"One of the most remarkable incidents of the 2000s was when U.S. Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009. All of the 155 passengers on the plane survived. This dramatization of the incident, starring Tom Hanks, tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who pulled off the Miracle on the Hudson, as it's called. Hanks gives a solid performance as Sully, who is conflicted as to whether or not he endangered the lives of all of the people on board. Aside from the incident itself, most of the movie is dedicated to the debate over whether or not the plane could potentially have returned to LaGuardia. The FAA is made out to be a villain of sorts. Some may argue that this is not as interesting as the incident itself, or that it isn't good movie material. It still works as a film, as it is more about Sully himself than anything else. Director Clint Eastwood does a great job at telling the story, by cutting the incident into several scenes and having the rest be about how it affected Sully's life, and that of his family. After the incident, Sully himself had to deal with PTSD, as well as the stress of instantly becoming a celebrity. His wife and daughters also had to deal with a constant bombardment of attention from the press. This is the focal point of the movie. It's about the people, not the incident. In that regard, it is a very good movie, but if you're expecting it to be about the incident itself, go watch any of the documentaries made about it.",Sully
226,Ben-Hibburd,Sully Review,6,18 September 2017,"Sully is directed by Clint Eastwood and it's the most generic film I've seen this year. The film is neither amazing nor terrible, it lies slap bang in the middle. The film is a dramatisation of the 2009 emergency plane landing on the Hudson river. The film stars Tom Hanks as Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. Hanks is the highlight of the film, he turns in a classy performance as usual. It's also clear to see though, that he didn't have much to work with.The film feels uninspired, maybe it's because there's not a-lot of dramatic tension in the real life events, save for the plane landing. However because the events are so fresh in everyone's mind, it's hard to forget what the outcome is. This means the film lacks any dramatic tension whatsoever.So now that we all know what were getting with the film what does it do to pull us in? The answers is nothing. Other then Tom Hanks the film has no punch. There are a couple scenes where Hanks is exhibiting PTSD. Rather then explore this subplot it's quickly swept under the rug, never to be brought up again.The other actors in the film are just there. The cinematography is bland. Nothing in the film really stands out. In the end the film is competently made, but it's played too safe. It almost feels like a quick cash grab before the story is forgotten about and stored away in the history books.",Sully
227,vinsond21,A timeless story of humanity pulling together,8,8 September 2016,"Sully is a timely movie. Watching it makes one feel proud to be part of humanity and, on the eve of September 11, relieved to know that not all planes flying in the vicinity of New York's skyscrapers have evil intentions behind them. Here is a true story about a passenger airliner in trouble, the pilot delivers an improbable landing on water that resulted in no fatalities. The air crew and passengers are cooperative and live to tell their miraculous near- death escapade. The air traffic controllers tried everything they could to avert any disaster. The first responders were quick on the scene and so efficient that the rescue mission was completed under an hour. And happily, no politician tried to claim credit or steal the thunder from these true heroes. Tom Hanks is solid as always, this time as the calm, composed, almost unassuming pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. It may not be a showy role but Hanks nails every moment, from that of making firm split-second decisions to those of quiet thoughtful ones. Director Clint Eastwood takes us behind the scenes of this real-life drama, from what was happening within the plane to the interrogation of the pilot and co-pilot by officials, providing moments of tension throughout the movie. Even if this story is familiar to the viewer, it is still great to be reminded of how wonderful it feels when everyone involved plays his part and does the right thing. Thanks, Mr Eastwood, for a movie that is not only timely, but timeless.",Sully
228,joncha,Hanks at his best,9,22 August 2020,"One of, if not the best, performance ever by Tom Hanks . He is Chesley Sullenberger, not just Tom Hanks skillfully playing a role. The recreation of the events and other ""what if"" scenarios is spectacular, almost as if they had been filmed when the event was actually happening. (It's a shame the DVD has no additional special features explaining how this was done.) The movie could have taken a more traditional approach, such as following more personal stories of passengers and rescuers from the moment they left their homes to the moment they got off or to the plane. Instead - and equally entertaining and enthralling -- the focus in on the behind-the-scenes examination of whether a public hero actually deserves the accolades he has so instantly received. Such a government agency review is standard procedure, of course, but it seems especially cruel for Sullenberger to have to go through what appeared to be a hunt to find a way to blame the emergency landing on him. In the end, everyone was just ""doing their jobs"" and no hard feelings remained, one would hope.",Sully

230,MajBlade2,Even with the overwrought made up parts a Good movie about a better pilot,9,15 January 2019,Great movie about an very good pilot and good man. The biggest gripe I have is the total made up NTSB reviews and the supposed drama. My uncle worked for the NTSB and was flown out to NYC the day after to work the case. Most of whats in the movie about the investigation is completely made up. If you read the transcripts of the interviews and panel its technical boring and frankly deferential to the pilots because by then they were international heroes. And it took nearly a year to complete. If you take that and the made up dream sequences out its probably a fairly boring movie because no one died. People came together to work a problem and no one was the bad guy except some geese. Its a feel good movie well acted by Hanks. I wish they had gone more into his background especially all the years of military flying he did and the fact he was working trying to start a saftery company before the accident. The right man at the right time and that should be good enough,Sully
231,mhubbard-54657,Watched 3 times now,9,3 November 2019,"I love this film. Great reenactment of the miraculous water landing in NYC a few years ago. Only a few years after 9/11, and right in the middle of economic disaster caused by corruption, NYC needed a true hero, and they got one in Captain Sullenberger.
But after such an incident, there is always an investigation. Although the Captain would have been very familiar with the protocols, after what he went through, questions about his personal life and the need for a urine sample must have seemed intrusive, at the very least.
Great feel good film. I love that the real ferry captain played himself, and the real scuba police were also represented.
Well worth seeing, I am sorry it took me this long.",Sully
232,jay-techie2007,One of the best this year.... Must Watch!!,9,11 September 2016,"I felt it more of a documentary than a movie. But either way, Sully is a MUST WATCH. Arguably, one of the best movies this year. Story - little different than expected; Tom Hanks - top notch and impeccable; Direction - great. Story (9/10): The story is multi-faceted. Contrary to the expectations, Sully is more about the post mortem (post-incident investigation) of the Hudson tragedy and the emotions of the pilot, Captain Chesley Sullenberger - nicknamed Sully, on whose shoulders, lives of 155 people, including him, aboard the US Airways flight hanged in balance for the fateful 280 seconds. As sub-plots, it also covered stories of some of the passengers and the people involved in the rescue. The theme of the movie was very different from what I thought and that's what I loved about it. It narrated the perspective of the pilot on why he did what he did (landing into Hudson river) and his thoughts for those couple of minutes. The story also delves into Sully's life - his teens, youth, his family. Overall, the story carefully avoided the obvious and talked about the things most people wouldn't know about - and that's what makes it very interesting. Screenplay (10/10): This is the first time I am sectioning out Screenplay separately in my review because this movie deserved it. Some of the dialogs left a lasting impression - especially the reporter putting out a big IF around the decision to land the plane on Hudson (which was the essence of the movie), or the wife of Sully realizing he was a part of that 155 endangered lives in that fateful flight. Some of Sully's dialogs to the investigators, which had a hint of sarcasm, were brilliant. Also, Sully's conversation with Skiles outside the investigation room which portrayed his leadership skills was highly inspirational. Acting (8/10): I don't think anybody could have played this role better than Tom Hanks. His expressions and dialog delivery perfectly fit the demands of the character of an immensely experienced and an honest pilot. Besides him, Aaron Eckhart - playing the role of the first officer, assisting the captain - is impressive. Although I felt he was largely overshadowed by Tom Hanks and barely managed to make his presence felt. The rest of the cast had a very small screen time to make any presence felt. Direction (9/10): Clint Eastwood did a great job in keeping this movie very crisp. The idea of narrating the entire incident in pieces was great. More importantly, it was blended very well with the flow of the movie and never felt disruptive. What I also loved was his coverage of multiple sub-plots in a short time of 96 minutes while giving perfect justice to the main plot. However, he probably underutilized Aaron Eckhart or his character - which was equally involved in the entire incident. Overall (9/10): I loved the movie, or documentary if I may say. A great watch - though low on entertainment value - but still a high-quality cinema.",Sully
233,trevor-82944,Hurray for the Hero of Flight 1549!,6,9 September 2016,"Remember when a plane flew into the Hudson Bay? Remember all 155 passengers on board who miraculously survived the impact? Remember the pilot responsible for making the quick move that prevented this delay from becoming a disaster? ​ Now, seven and a half years after these events shook the world, the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger is brought to the screen by director Clint Eastwood and actor Tom Hanks. Based on the autobiography, ""Highest Duty,"" Sully expresses how the passengers' fear was vanquished by their pilot's risky and controversial thinking in a fashion that will inspire dads and business professionals across the nation.It begins with a nightmare by the infamous pilot of his airplane flying uncontrollably into the city, the sounds of the plane booming real enough to rattle you the right way. He wakes up to yet another news report of his catastrophic Flight 1549 landing from January 15, 2009. This reality is simply too overwhelming for him to handle, so much so, that he can't even go jogging without facing a near-hit by a taxi cab. Neither he nor his family can escape from the reporters, talk shows, and high city court who won't shut up about the controversy. It's almost as if 911 is happening all over again, except consequentially by one of America's own heroes.He explains in flashback precisely why he allowed the landing in spite of claims that the left engine could still have been idling. It all follows a nonlinear storytelling structure similar to what Stanley Kubrick or Quentin Tarantino have popularized. Maybe this flashback structure wasn't necessary in the telling of the story, or maybe it just wasn't edited properly. But either way, it got frustratingly confusing as to where or when I was in time, especially when it returns me to a scene that if left off of a half hour earlier.If you were to go ask anyone who was there on that day of the Hudson Bay landing, they would go on to say from backed up evidence that these events are true to what happened; but this retelling doesn't feel quite true enough. Even right from the release of the first trailer, I knew that Tom Hanks wasn't going to fit the part, particularly because he does not look the part at all. Basically all the makeup artists do to make him look authentic is spray-paint his hair white and glue a mustache onto his face, which looks completely unconvincing that he is representing the real flight hero. Then if you look everywhere else around him, there is an excessive amount of branding for New York's culture. The words ""New York"" are everywhere within the overused wide-shots of the city, something that not even the fake-looking CGI planes can distract us from.Yet I still wouldn't say that it makes this a horrible viewing experience. Far from it, in fact. Sully is backed up with plenty of satisfactory performances by the whole cast, particularly Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Thank You for Smoking), who plays Captain Sullenberger's first officer and best friend. There's also Laura Linney (Mystic River, The Truman Show) who plays the captain's stay- at- home wife. She's not the most well-developed or memorable of characters, but her love for her husband still comes out satisfactorily well.Yeah, that's a good word to sum up this movie. It's satisfactory. It's certainly better than average, but not the best thing ever like I hoped it would. It's just plain satisfactory as good, wholesome, inspirational entertainment. It's not that bad for tributing a man who was so big he had an alcoholic beverage named after him (it's made with a shot of Grey Goose Vodka and a splash of water, so feel free to make it at home!)It's also worth noting that the end credits feature some special guest appearances who will make this entire movie truly worth the trip.",Sully

Captain Sully is a decorated pilot who has to crash-land an airplane in the Hudson river. It's a compelling story for sure but some viewers may find it dull and mundane. If you were ever curious about what happened in this news story, filmmaker Clint Eastwood has a video tale to tale you.To borrow from David Spade: I liked this movie better when it was Flight. One thing I notice with older film makers like Clint Eastwood is that they tend to make movies they think will make a historical contribution. This is admirable but be advised these types of films are often not exciting. In fact, they can be quite boring.There is great acting in this film but that's not enough to justify this story being a movie. I think a TV special would have been a better suited genre. I did like the ending, it surprised me. When the panel somehow had a paradigm shift and suspended all judgment of Sully, it was gratifying. Just like in Flight, he is in a lot of trouble the entire length of the film. Unfortunately for me, I feel the story dragged on and I just didn't find the science that makes up at least 50% of the investigation and the movie interesting. I can't recommend this film for anyone but that's not to say pilots and fans of the real sully won't like it.",Sully

Then when they were over, back to the reality of the planet, with tragedy forced down are throats on the news. But watching Sully restored my faith in the average guy doing his job and doing it well. Excellent acting and visually you really feel you are in the cockpit. I had no idea that there had been an inquiry with an attempt to discredit the pilot. Pretty shameful, but the crew stuck together and you can feel and visualize the powerful effects of excellent team work. Sully always credited his team.

Yes ""Sully"" does offer some nice visuals, good directing - there is no denying Clint Eastwood is a great director. Similarly, Hanks' portrayal as Sully is good - no denying this.But this movie is far from being the best from both of them. The story ends abruptly and easily - making the whole plot seem a little shaky to begin with. And Hanks is a cool composed pilot.

Shot almost entirely on IMAX 65mm cameras and featuring stellar performances from Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, Sully does not disappoint.Eastwood's visual style stays intact throughout as he and cinematographer Tom Stern team up once again, capturing the extraordinary brilliance and sheer tension of the now- famous ""Miracle"" on January 15th, 2009. With a story that cuts between the overwhelming news coverage and the landing itself, Sully feels incredibly fresh and grounded.Tom Hanks' performance as Chesley Sullenberger is wonderfully realistic and touching. There are a few moments in the final scenes that really pull the whole picture together in the most satisfying way, and this is greatly supported by Hanks' phenomenal act. Alongside is Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, who brings a lighter shade to the film, delivering some acceptable and amusing lines of dialogue that feels absolutely necessary when securing the film's human touch.Composer Christian Jacob and The Tierney Sutton Band take a personal approach when tackling the project, with ravishing piano pieces and lush string arrangements smoothly weaved into the picture, culminating as the screen turns black.Blu Murray returns to aid Eastwood as editor and this resembles all of their previous work together. The cutting here is masterfully handled, ensuring all scenes are flowing with attentive care whilst providing a fast-paced and sublime experience.With over 50 years of proficiency in acting and helming over 30 directional projects, Clint Eastwood has become one of the greatest icons of the film industry. Yet, even with so much under his belt, he can pull off something different and unique each time. Sully is a fine example of that. Truly wonderful filmmaking.Verdict; Although taking place on the Hudson River, Sully feels undeniably grounded in its masterful direction and skillful undertaking.

240,mailes22,The real event more interesting than the movie,5,11 September 2016,"The problem with the movie ""Sully"" is that it's about 208 seconds of action, and we all know in advance that he successfully landed the plane with no loss of life. The movie starts off by telling the audience that. So the only 'tension' in the movie is whether Capt. Sully is going to go from hero to villain if it's decided by the accident investigators that his decision to go for the Hudson rather than one of the nearby airports was the safer decision or not.Unfortunately, because the movie is based on Sully's own version of events, it looks at the everything from his point of view alone. If there was some background provided for some of the passengers, the audience might be a little more invested in the survival of everyone onboard. The movie's just over 90 minutes long, basically because there wasn't enough to pad it out any further. It's well acted, but that's the only thing going for it.

There is no film that I can think of, in which Tom Hanks ever gave a bad performance. Nor have I ever disliked a character Tom Hanks has played. The man is a National Treasure, and one of the greatest living actors of out generation. Even if one has never seen an interview with the actual Cpt.

There is a blatant reason why Hanks is a two-time Oscar winner, and could very well be heading towards another nomination here cause he absolutely deserves it and all the praise he's getting.2.

There is never a moment where you doubt the chemistry between these two because their acting is on another level. Mr. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an incredible amount of praise just by his directing alone. If this man doesn't get a nomination for 'Best Director', I'll literally pull a 'Dirty Harry' on the Academy. The film is short, but it's edited in such a superb way that it never leaves you feeling bored.3. There are just a few hiccups here and there that just doesn't make this film quite as perfect. Laura Linney plays Sully's distraught wife Lorraine, however she never comes across as such since all her scenes take place within the confines of her home. Maybe the reason is due to some scenes being cut, but her range is never fully explored. With events that could have ended in tragedy, there are (unfortunately) nightmares that follow. There are dream and elapsed sequences where Sully envisions the worst, from the plane crashing, to passengers losing their lives.All in all, 'Sully' is still a sharp and well directed cinematic feature, and something those who witnessed the miracle themselves, should be proud of.",Sully
245,achmoye,Deeply moving drama,8,6 November 2017,"It's been a while since I saw Tom Hanks, maybe it was the Terminal, a movie about a man stuck in a airport, maybe he's got something for planes ! Anyway. I've been deeply moved by this drama, Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckart are just excellent and make a really believable pilot duo, the humanity and steadiness of Sully is just amazing as he faces the cruel investigators. We care about Sully from the very start, because we can see he's a good man tormented by bad dreams about plane crashes, and I have a special mention for dialogues which are really enjoyable, Sully just always finds the right answer to the investigators of the crash, it's a real pleasure to see his confidence in what he did. I would have expected more presence for Eckart though. The co-pilot finds himself in an incredible situation, yet he doesn't even asks : ""are you sure about this ? Isn't there another way ?"", it really felt too passive during the crash. The psychology of Sully is really well-written, you can see he doesn't really like to be called a hero or being hugged, but still he fights back to not be called a criminal. A nice surprise to see Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad, playing here one of the investigators. She quite has the same administrative role in Breaking Bad so it fits her well.Cinematography is mastered even if not excellent, by director of photography Tom Stern who also collaborated with Eastwood on Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby. You can see the real pilot and crash victims meeting in the credits, so stay to the end. One of the most interesting movies of Clint Eastwood. I recommend.",Sully
246,CinePendejo,"Solid, if a bit clumsy, portrayal of an everyday hero. Better than Flight!",7,11 September 2016,"It's kind of depressing for me to witness a growing contempt in Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood. To be clear, all of it is for good reason. I personally don't care for his political views, nor do I stomach his recent, unpleasant comments on my generation. His 2012 support for Mitt Romney hasn't been more than an embarrassment. His films also haven't reached critical success for a decade and, topped with his baggage with the media, still probably won't be for a while. It's a shame that a man who once started out as an out-of-nowhere classic icon and also a well-acclaimed director will now be remembered by the new generation as ""that crazy old guy"". Even then, it's still a bummer considering that he's still capable of making great work. He has a great eye for filmmaking and an unrestrained approach to storytelling. His biggest perk is designing simple yet effective tales out of troubled historical figures. There's no ""what if"" or ""how come"" in his stories. Just the basic ""it is what it is"" style of his biopics. Some might complain that there isn't much meat to chew on as a result, but what makes Eastwood great as a storyteller lies in the trust he bestows on subjects he feels has just enough resonance on its own. Sometimes that works great (Letters from Iwo Jima) and sometimes it doesn't (J. Edgar). With Sully, which tells the story of a recent plane landing on the Hudson River by Chesley Sullenberger, he once again reaches that same template with great earnest to the now-retired hero. The result is a solid, well-intentioned, slightly clumsy, tribute to a historical figure that no man other than Eastwood can make. Now the life of Sullenberger is a fairly straightforward one. Once during a flight in Flight 1549, a major turbulence caused by out-of-nowhere birds forced Sullenberger to attempt a miraculous landing in the Hudson River. After saving everybody on the plane, he is held as an ""All American Hero"" even though he just did his job. However, the NTSB, after an investigation on the wreckage, finds evidence to suggest that he committed an irrational act and found evidence of an alternative and safer method to land the plane. But Sully, along with his co-pilot, suggest that his human instincts point to the contrary, even going as far as to deny the dozens of flight simulations against his claim. Is he right? Did he act rationally? Or does the big, bad, mean NTSB just trying to tarnish his reputation? Do you seriously need answers to all of these?Now I know a bunch of smarty pants is bound to compare this to another plane movie Flight since both films are about pilots who attempted miraculous landings and somehow gets ridiculed for it. But while Flight was an overrated, unlikeable slog where such a landing can only be achieved by an under-appreciated drunk who shoots up blow and abuses his friends, Sully takes a simple, likable explanation. He is just a man with past experience with a plane who believes in doing what he can to save as many people as possible, even if it means not landing on a runway. He has a lovable relationship with his wife and kids who gets separated thanks to a swarm of media news people. He feels that the NTSB forgets the fundamentals of human instinct so much that they wouldn't see the danger of not complying with it. The only piece of extra information we get is when Sully suffers from reasonable nightmares of the plane crashing which resulted from him not committing to the Hudson in the first place (in beautifully crafted CGI plane crashes). Though otherwise, Clint Eastwood adds little more to this story and instead focuses on a man who just simply did his job and gets the well-deserved hero status, which leads to probably his most heartwarming piece in his career so far. Sadly, that does lead to a lot of issues. The film's structure is a little all over the place for starters; Todd Komarnicki's scattershot screenplay rearranges the events rather than in order, which honestly would've been the better route. It starts with Sully after the crash, then before, then even back to his younger days, then the events at the hearing. It's a weird structure and it's made worse by the film deliberately finding ways to film the crash from multiple angles. Another issue lies in the film being too one-note in its short and sweet storytelling, in which Eastwood frames the NTSB as the bad guys who misunderstood Sully's act of heroism. It gets reasonable at first, but then once the film shifts into the ""man vs machine"" court case, it gets distracting. I expected that to be the case all along, especially from a film made by an anti-government conservative, but it's still unfortunate to see a huge sacrifice in complexity, both in narrative and in character. Huge issues aside, this is a fine surprise for me and a huge improvement for Clint after the two-punch disappointments back in 2014. Tom Hanks is still great in his otherwise straightforward role. The way the film represents an everyday hero is admirable and sentimental. The runtime is deliberately shorter so it doesn't overstay its welcome. And yes, lo and behold, Eastwood amps up the production value in this for the first time in forever, with simple camera work and impressive CGI plane sequences. In a weekend of sad recognition of 9/11, Sully deliberately arrives in the right time to remind us about that little heroic event that's bound to bring us hope in the near future. Should this be Eastwoods last film, it'd be a great closure to an impressive career.http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/2016/09/review-sully.html",Sully
247,Stewball,Hanks and Eastwood a great team,9,10 September 2016,"While this may not be Hank's most demanding role, I think it will certainly be one of his most memorable, along with ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". And Eastwood met the challenge of telling the truth of the story in an engaging way without loosing the audience in tedium or BS. And I was glad to see that serious attention was paid to aeronautical reality in a movie--for a change. For those interested in how well the movie does stick to the facts, re: the go to source for that, http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/sully/ . For me, one of the two highlights of the film was what happened after the aircraft was ditched, in how the passengers didn't panic, and how well the rescue effort went. The other was the climax with Sullenberger's & Skiles testimony before the NTSB investigation (read ""trial"") which was in a much larger venue than I would have thought.The one thing the movie (and the actual investigation, apparently) didn't cover was how things are changed when making a dead-stick (no thrust) landing in an airliner, which without thrust, have been likened to flying a brick. With a runway, you have only one shot aiming for a specific point--in this case surrounded by many tall buildings, and they didn't exactly have much time to see how far they could glide anyway. Better to have something flat, very wide and very very long, even if it is wet. The space shuttle is the only large aircraft that routinely does (or did) dead stick landings; and that's with much study, training, practice, and (at least at first) landing on a dry lake bed--offering plenty of wiggle-room.What Sullenberger told 60 Minutes had to have been going through his head that day, ""The only viable alternative, the only level, smooth place sufficiently large to land an airliner, was the river"". The only semi-error they made was not to hit the ditch button which would have sealed the vents in the airplane (though the tail section was breached on landing) because it was at the end of the checklist which they didn't have time to complete. They made a big deal out of his starting the aux power unit (APU) out of checklist order. Just sayin'. That should have been the co-pilots's cue when Sully looks at him 10 seconds before ditching and asks, ""Any ideas?"". (A ""DITCH"" button, who'd've thunk.)",Sully

The formal investigation by the National Transportation Board performed simulations showing Sully could have diverted and landed safety at either airport.

249,anandrajeev979,Excellent film about the Extraordinary incident,9,23 December 2016,"Sully is not only among best of 2016 but also a career high for Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks. This is exactly what I expected from Eastwood and Hank. Top notch direction , check. Oscar worthy performance , check. Rightful depiction of a hero , check.It has got everything but One thing that drives this movie is the power of the human spirit. We all know what happened in 2009 when a plane landed on Hudson river. We all know the story how 155 passengers and crew survived but this film keeping in account for all the events also follows very closely its aftermath and impact on media. There might be some controversy but let's be real when movies are based on real life events such factors are unavoidable.This movie as stated by Sully in a line has the human factor and that's what makes it among the best.To do such extraordinary thing and give fair , rightful and deserved treatment is something which this film holds from start to end. Apart from having the scenes when all this takes place are heart pounding even though you know everyone survived , still Eastwood has crafted it so seriously and so fragile that it speaks directly to your heart. After the massively acclaimed American Sniper and Captain Philips , Clint Eastwood has yet done it again. Especially the investigation process shown makes everything clear and is what which also makes this film different. So it a really good film to watch and is expected to get multiple nominations this Oscar season. As speaking for Oscar I can guarantee Noms for Best Picture , Director and Actor but winning will be quite a shot given La La Land and Moonlight also Casey Affleck's amazing performance in Manchester by the sea. Still everyone loved it given its $ 300 million box office receipts.......",Sully
250,lbenot,"With Reality Like This, Who Needs Fiction!",10,15 September 2016,"Of course, I knew of The Miracle on the Hudson and of it's hero, Sully, but not of the subsequent half-baked governmental finger-pointing this movie so skillfully portrays.Because the investigation was conducted-in/released-to the public, I assume the climatic scene toward the end of the movie - in which Sully himself a crash investigator, publicly exposes the flaw in the board's analysis which wrongly faulted him with an error in judgment - was accurately portrayed. If it was, Sully's calm restraint and eloquence in his own defense has earned even more of my respect and admiration for him.Other personal aspects of the miraculous event are explored and portrayed in a well-balanced non-sappy manner: the immediate media crush on Sully and his family that resulted; his instant popularity; the mental trauma that resulted in it's aftermath; the importance of having a good co-pilot and crew; the steady, modest and grounded manor of our hero; and of course, the gratitude of the survivors.A jazz pianist himself, the understated Eastwood-composed musical score added just the right mood at the right times; and the gifted Hanks again showed us why he earns these types of important and iconic roles.It's rare for a film to inform, entertain, and inspire or uplift all at the same time; but the fine screenplay, acting, and directorial choices of this one - not the least of which is the as-the-credits-roll brief appearance of real-life Sully and some of the actual water-landing (not crash!) survivors all reunited along side the actual plane (now in a museum) - landed them all!",Sully

254,artmania90,A missed opportunity,5,1 February 2017,"Clint Eastwood has nothing to prove to anyone anymore. Having won a handful of Oscars and directed two Best Picture winners, we are only so lucky to have such an esteemed veteran behind the camera (he just turned 86 this past year). His repertoire covers a wide range of subject and setting, from westerns to historical pictures to modern fiction. He has hit's and misses. It's unfortunate that such an inspiring story as the Miracle on the Hudson could wind up so flat on the big screen.It wasn't but a few years ago, and I know we all know the story - how Captain Sullenburger successfully ditched his US Airways flight into the river just outside of Manhattan and miraculously kept everyone on board alive and well. It was a 1 in a million landing, all the more spectacular and alarming for taking place so close to Ground Zero. The world proclaimed him a hero, but (you guessed it) some had initial doubts.The story itself follows Sully in the immediate aftermath of the landing, when he and his copilot (Aaron Echart as Jeff Skiles) are hotel-bound while a hearing is underway to investigate the cause of the crash. Sully frequently calls his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) at home to assure her that he is okay and will be home soon. The hearings proceed simultaneous to an endless barrage of news coverage and late night appearances. In the same day, Sully met with both Katie Couric and David Letterman.The trailer promised a somewhat suspenseful story with a crash scene that would rival that of the movie ""Flight."" We flash back several times in the film to the actual incident, when birds struck both engines and caused the plane to lose forward thrust. The entire incident was so quick (200 seconds or so) that Eastwood devotes several scenes to show the crash in it's entirety from various perspectives. It's a Rashomon approach in many ways, and the effect is a powerful testament to the quick wits of not only Sully but the flight crew and the Coast Guard and even passersby watching a plane descend into the frigid Hudson River in disbelief.Tom Hanks, of course, plays the titular character. He is barely there, so steadfast in his beliefs and quiet in his doubts, I don't think any other man would be as suited for the role. One would think that this would be a sure bet for an Oscar nomination (and well overdue: Hanks hasn't been nominated since Cast Away in 2000) but his performance is as muted and subtle as anything he has done. From crash to court hearings, Sully is played as a man you understand to be a real hero. He is quiet, determined, scared of being wrong but persistent when he knows he is right.The villains (the National Transportation Safety Board who scrutinize his every move) are often laughable and there for the obvious reason of creating more cinematic drama. I don't know how factual the film is in regards to the final scenes, but we are led to believe that Sully is on the cusp of being fired for having endangered the lives of everyone on board. Flight simulations (and we see no less than 4 entire flight simulation sequences, mind you) prove that the plane could have landed safely at LaGuardia, and it comes down to a simple speech by Sully in which human error ultimately would have made landing on a runway impossible.When the movie is good, it's good, but when it's not, it's apparent. There are many sequences of PTSD and such from Sully's perspective that feel taped on and hasty. A dream sequence in which Katie Couric presents a news story about Sully being a fraud is forced to say the least. Clint Eastwood has never been a meticulous director known for precision edits or immaculate framing. Sully simply feels like a rough cut that required a few more trims to make it feel concise. Hanks is great, of course, and the story is inspiring. The film itself leaves a bit to be desired. Still, for a man closer to 90 years old in age, I doubt you will find a more assured director working today.",Sully
255,adam-may-bower,Strong Adaption,8,2 June 2018,"'Sully' director Clint Eastwood strongly adapts the real-life story of an everyday hero. When adapting a true story to the big screen, there are a million and one things that could go wrong, but Clint Eastwood manages to avoid any major ones. In particular, Eastwood manages to make a plane crash incident that lasted only a few minutes long into a full length film that doesn't drag on and have unnecessary scenes. It is evident that the movie's focus is on the humanitarian aspect of the story, not the actual plane crash. In saying this, with the main focus being on the hero pilot Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, a good actor is needed, and Tom Hanks, hands down, knocks this role out of the park. He delivers a realistic and honest performance that brings the character alive and is one of the main reasons this movie is so good. The combination of Eastwood's solid directing and Hank's strong performance, 'Sully' ends being a great film that tells an inspiring story of a real human being.",Sully
256,leosmith-11166,Clint Eastwood delivers a mediocre film,6,22 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood's ""Sully "", a film about Chesley Sullenberger's legal and personal battles after the ""Miracle on the Hudson"", is a film that satisfies the audience by utilising strong performances and converting an intriguing story onto the silver screen. But the film ultimately falls short of great, and it finishes leaving a mediocre taste in the viewer's mouth.One of the strengths in ""Sully"" is its humanistic values and traits that are portrayed within the character of Chesley Sullenberger. ""Sully"" successfully attempts to paint the picture of Chesley as a hero, who acted in the best interests of humanity, rather than the interests of money(being the plane). A combination of his heroic morale and human flaws combine an interesting and deep character, and furthermore allows the audience to connect to the story. But that's as far as Eastwood allows the audience to connect. While the performances are strong and the message is dominant, the film fails largely to take any risks, with either the depiction of the story, or the story itself. The cinematography, lighting and composition is largely dull to look at, besides the few scenes where Sully is having nightmares. The visual aspect of the film lacks heavily, and the whole visual side of the film feels like it's just there to support the dialogue, which, at moments, feels lazy and cliché. The story at times feels insufficient to be made into a film, which doesn't give true justice to the story itself.The depiction of Chesley Sullenberger, however, give justice to the man, and provides the backbone to the films quality. ""Sully"" is definitely worth a watch, but having high expectations of the film will leave you flat. If you liked any of Eastwood's recent work, such as ""Invictus"" or ""American Sniper"", then this film should appeal to you.",Sully

Clint Eastwood once again shows he knows what he's doing when it comes to sitting in the directors chair.January 15th, 2009, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after it suffered dual engine failures from a bird strike. What he endures following the incident is a scathing investigation team hell bent on showing him he made a mistake and he could have in fact turned the plane around and landed it safely on one of the many runways available to him in New York.Tom Hanks, as always, plays a solid role and character and a very believable Aircraft pilot, although i felt at times he could have shown just a little more emotion in certain spots. Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn made good additions to the cast fitting into their roles nicely.The film itself, jumps all over the place, it starts straight away with a nightmare from our hero. we see the timeline of events is post- incident, then eventually goes back to the beginning of the flight before Sully even steps foot on the plane. I wasn't expecting the film to be structured this way and found it kind of annoying at first, but it doesn't at all affect the pacing.Clocking in at just an hour and a half, Sully is a good hero flick depicting the events of January 15th, 2009, because we learn everything we need to know in just that short space of time.

Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger has experienced both. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.On January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the Airbus A320 strikes a flock of birds, disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports. Sully landed the aircraft on the Hudson River. The crew and passengers evacuate without casualty. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him with nightmare, and he repeatedly imagines the plane crashing into a building.Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS suggest that the port engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. The National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.Sully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been pilot error, which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to land the plane.The two simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is landed. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard.",Sully

In my humble opinion, I'm still not wrong. The direction, acting and visual effects were absolutely top-notch weaving together absolutely the most that could have been scraped together, and often delving into Captain Sullenburger's personal life to find extra material. Whilst the film is entertaining, I was on occasion actually bored from being overly familiar with the few minutes of the main story. This main story of the take-off, bird strike and glide before ditching was told three or four times in various different ways. The later rescue and NTSB hearing were shown as were clips of the media circus and heavily padded out sections with the co-pilot and being on the phone with his wife.In short, a worthy picture that does its best with meagre material, whilst resisting the temptation to descend into fantasy.

More specifically, the film deals with the aftermath consequences of the pilot's decision.In early 2009, the now infamous Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played by the equally famous Tom Hanks in the film ""Sully"", attempted to make an emergency landing on January 15. Although he tried to reach an airport, he ends up landing a full plane on the Hudson River and becomes a national hero overnight. Watching these events take place on-screen is breathtaking. However, the aftermath of the events prove to be much less amusing. Sully is eventually investigated and questioned for his decision to land the plane on the Hudson. Although ""Sully"" is a short film to begin with, the drawn out investigation made the film appear to be much longer than about an hour and a half. The directing and cinematography is very tastefully done. Which shouldn't be surprising considering the film was directed by Clint Eastwood. But the story leaves the audience wanting. Ultimately, Sully is exonerated in the film thanks to simulations that prove the wisdom of the famed pilot's split-second decision making. But the investigation is portrayed as unnecessary and mildly intrusive. Many people took offense to the way the National Transportation Safety Board was portrayed in the film. This caused a little controversy among those who work for the investigative agencies responsible for protecting the public. The thing every good movie needs is a villain.

I actually think this is one of Eastwood's best directed movies, along side Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River in the 21st century phase of his career.There are interesting influences that have been seeping in from a couple of Asian directors: Zhang's Hero which approaches this same topic albeit in a different century and with more extravagant visuals, Ozu for the long, patient camera takes as well as Kurosawa for the Rashomon type story that takes place. ""paintent"" is the key word here, as many of the films detractors have said the movie is ""slow"". Notice how each flashback tells more, and more of the story, much like how Rashomon tells the story from different perspectives. Flashback are used as suspense devices, and Eastwood really crafts the picture in way that even though you think your are watching the same scene (birds!) new information is revealed every time which makes it entertaining. And entertaining is not a bad word.For a movie touted as a big studio movie about a real life character, and unlike J. Edgar which I would say is about a ""B"" quality movie though well done biopic, I feel like Sully deserves an the highest rating possible because of the multiple nuances used, and like you said Hanks performance as he disappears into a role unlike any other he has ever had (compared to Captain Phillips, which to me was just Hanks doing Hanks). Hanks deserves an Oscar nomination at least, and a win at best. Eastwood makes movies about JUSTICE as a key theme, where 'what is right is right' and boy does he get his opinions on that across in this film (which also ties it to previous masterpieces he has done like Unforgiven, Grand Torino, and High Plains Drifter).When you know how a movie will turn out it is a challenge to make it entertaining and new to the audience, and Eastwood found a way to do that with several devices and ideas (the court hearings, Sully's jogs and visits to bars around town, his nightmares which echo the 9/11 attacks). Seeing this film on 9/11 (which was an accident really) had a profound effect one as a well. It left me with just enough tears after it is over. Sully is a movie I would recommend for everyone to see at some point in their lives, as it is one of the best movies ever made on the topic of a true life hero, who always includes others in his thoughts and refuses to take credit for his heroic acts (another Jimmy Stewart-Mr. Smith goes to Washington parallel for Hanks).",Sully
264,felixmartinsson,Pretty good,7,14 November 2016,"So I watched it with pretty high expectations, I like Tom Hanks, think he's a brilliant actor and I love Clint Eastwood, I think he knows what he's doing both in front of the camera, acting and behind it, directing. It started off really good, they built up the story, but then I thought the pace went up and everything just went by too quickly. I like a more slow pace with lots of details, but for people in a rush, than yeah this will work fine! This is an example of why a lot of big actors has started to show up in TV Series. And I totally get why, they get a lot more time to play and grow into their characters, and there is much more detail to everything. I'm not saying it's bad (obviously) It just didn't live up to my expectations. I think the film could have added at least another 30 minutes. I do recommend it, the acting and story is very interesting! I give it 7 out of 10",Sully
265,Ben_Cap,The Miracle on the Hudson,7,9 October 2016,"Given where I live I have a vague memory about the Miracle on the Hudson. That is to say I remember it happening and being on all of the news channels, but I never really cared to follow up on the events past those first few days after it happened. What the movie Sully brings is at best an exhilarating account of bravery displayed by Capitan Sully and at worst a little bit of feel good drama where the drama feels inflated.Lets start off with Tom Hanks as the titular Captain Sully. Hanks is not only the perfect choice for this role, he is the only choice for this role. No actor working today brings as much trust and inherent compassion better than Hanks can. From the first moment that the NTSB starts questioning him about the events during the emergency water landing I immediately believe Sully. I trust that he did the right thing and that is because of Tom Hanks. He has made a career of being the good guy and this role demands that he be the best good guy he has ever been, and he nails it. Aaron Eckhart is solid in his supporting role because he is able to play off of Sully's personality. He allows the viewer to step into his shoes and play co pilot in our heads. In those 208 seconds he has to trust Sully like we trust Hanks and you feel that in his performance.Even though I was not really sold on the CGI in Sully, the ""water landing"" scenes were the highlight of the movie. Even though they showed the same sequence of events more than a couple of times, each time it felt different. Eastwood lets you view it through the different lenses of the people involved, the passengers, the crew and even the people on the ground viewing it from office buildings and homes. While the CGI sometimes broke my immersion when they put you in the plane is when it really shines. I could almost feel the bottom of my seat drop out as if the theater had lost both engines.Most of the issues I have with Sully are nit picking. The direction by Clint Eastwood is unimaginative, the writing is average but the biggest problem is one that Eastwood suffered from in his last movie American Sniper and that is an unrealistic villain. This time around Eastwood decided that the real opposition to our hero is over zealous government officials and white people problems. For me the real problem for Sully should have been the constant terror of what if. What if he had done something differently that day or what if he had put those people in danger? They allude to this a bit but I think this really should have been the emotional focus. At least thats what gave me the willies the most. Although i did say the writing was average, Sully actually as what most movies miss and that is an earned third act. The writers saved all their really good stuff for that second to third act transition. They even have a few twists for you at the end there which I did not expect at all.Sully can sometimes be dragged down by the low points and dialogue heavy scenes but when it has to the movie really turns it on. at an hour and 37 minutes the length is just about right, there were a few scenes that kind of felt added in to pad the run time but it was a decently paced movie with as I said before a great third act. I did not expect much from Sully but I am here to say I have been proved wrong. This is a story about a true American hero, but more than that Sully is just a flat out amazing person who deserves for people to really know how great he is.",Sully
266,theresamgill,Captain Sully,7,12 June 2018,"January 15, 2009. Many remember the date for the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" Crew and passengers totaled 155 as birds flew into the engine of the plane, forcing the captain to land in the Hudson River. Heralded as a hero, people who haven't read the book (including myself) that Chesley Sullenberger proceeded to write about the incident may not be familiar with everything that happened after the memorable day.There's different ways of approaching the material, so let's see how they decided to do it before analyzing the contributions of the individual. The beginning sets up how Sully never embraces the role of a hero and how his mind is tormented about how he saved the lives of everyone, yet the flight committee pushes to know if it was the best and safest decision; Sully reported that he lost both engines and thus wouldn't have thrust to return to a runway, but simulations and data engineers put together state otherwise. The beginning also sets up how Sully has always had a passion to fly and is an experienced pilot with over 40 years under his belt.It isn't until about the 30 minute mark that we get our first glimpses of the day in question. From then on there's a good deal of Sully contemplatively running through New York and reliving the day and the possible outcomes, and then different views of the 208 seconds of fateful flight.This is not the most thrilling movie. It just simply can't be. And it doesn't infuse the amount of enjoyment that Moneyball did with subject matter that could've bored audiences. Nevertheless, that is not to say the movie is boring. Clint Eastwood directs, and he more than anybody ever can direct with such a cool hand. And his directing when it comes to the rescue scenes on the river may be overlooked, but it's truly strong directing. And in typical Eastwood form, expect a lot of subtle piano playing in the film (Eastwood is credited with the theme for the film). It's also worth mentioning that even though many glimpses of the crash (or as Sully puts it, ""forced water landing"") are presented throughout the brisk hour and a half, it doesn't get old. There's purpose every time it's shown, and the right amount is shown every time.Tom Hanks stars as the captain who misses his family and truly believes he was just doing his job-- nothing overly heroic. There's some internal demons to battle over the course of the movie, and it may not be Hanks' finest performance, but the everyday-charm and subtleness is still quite a performance. Aaron Eckhart is the clear supporting role, second fiddle character. He's really meant to be the comic relief, and, not all the jokes are the most well-written, but again there's charm for the guy that has his captain's back every step of the way. Laura Linney is never on the screen with Hanks at the same time, but as the distressed wife, they share plenty of phone calls together.Again, this really isn't the most thrilling movie, and there shouldn't be hopes of it being one either. But it is a film shot almost entirely in IMAX cameras and the shots of New York are great; the acting is basically between good and great, and the final act shows the most humanity. Perhaps the film could be likened to Lincoln-- well acted without the most compelling of stories, but instead of Lincoln's ensemble cast, Sully places its bets on the focus of a few individual and that helps it retain the identity of an enjoyable film. It probably doesn't raise to the level needed for any Oscar nod, but it is an enjoyable film. And when you can enjoy a film or the film succeeds in the purpose it set out on, that's a win in my books.

267,Snorreplop,Another solid movie from Eastwood,7,26 September 2016,"Most people in the western world saw or heard about the miracle of the Hudson, where captain Sullenberger managed to land his severely damaged airplane on the Hudson river without any casualties. The film centers on Sullenberger and the crash investigation that questioned his choice to land on the river instead of returning to nearby airports.With a relatively short run-time of 96 minutes it surprised me how rich a story Eastwood managed to make. With clever non-linear storytelling and repeating events from multiple perspectives he puts out a strong and compelling story.Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the captain Sullenberger, Aaron Eckhart who plays the part of co-pilot, does not get the chance to shine unfortunately.",Sully
268,daveygandthekeyboard,OK Movie about an Extraordinary event.,7,19 September 2016,"For 208 seconds, Sully is saving the lives of all 155 souls aboard Us Airway Flight 1549 when he undertakes an emergency water landing in the Hudson River in January of 2009. He emerges a hero at a time when the U.S economy was in the crapper due largely to the actions of many greedy short-sighted men making horrible decisions with your money, and heroes were at a premium. The question is: how does this translate to a feature length movie? This can't stretch out two hours. You need drama, you need conflict, so how is this done?The conflict at the heart of the movie is one that pits humanity versus the computer. Or human error versus those that second guess. Or those that do are criticized by those who don't. For according to computer simulations, done in non-life or death situations, Sully could have managed to land the plane on a runway, at an airport, and not have it become a total loss in the Hudson River. And it is because of this that the authorities investigating the crash (just doing their jobs) try to sully the heroic act of Sully (sorry, bad pun.). We know how it ends, we know where it's going, and for what it's worth, Captain Chesley Sullenberger is without a doubt a hero of the highest degree. The inspiration that his cool-headedness under enormous pressure provided Americans is incalculable. I just wish the film had been able to communicate that a little better. I wanted there to be a resounding victory, a moment where you could cheer for the good guys. Unfortunately, the closest we came to this was the moment where Sully (played well by Tom Hanks, not my favorite actor but what can you do?) after proving his point about human speed and reaction time, says ""DO you need any more tests?"" I miss the days when Tom Hanks was not such a serious actor. But the fact that he plays the part without the audience overly thinking about the fact that this is TOM HANKS is a tribute to his talent. Eckhart does a great job as his co-pilot and Laura Linney is always great, though it would be better if she had more to do than talk to Sully on the phone.Overall, in terms of airplane related movies, I'd put ""Sully"" somewhere near ""Flight"" but not as good as ""Flight 93."" Or even ""Airplane!"" But it's still good.",Sully

272,emailtombuchanan,A Real Crash and Burn of a Film,3,10 November 2018,"I paid $6.50 to watch ""Sully"" in a theater on this drizzly day, and think I would have been better off spending nothing and standing out in the drizzle instead.Sully came highly recommended, and most of the people in the theater seemed to enjoy it, but I found the simplified storyline unnecessarily manipulative and boring. Sully is a typical Clint Eastwood directed blockbuster that pits a purely heroic pilot (Tom Hanks) against the completely villainous investigators of the NTSB. Eastwood has again shown himself incapable of nuance, and unable to tell a story without lazily resorting to a binary narrative of absolute good and evil. Maybe American audiences crave simplistic black and white stories (as indicated by the box-office success of Sully), but I'd rather spend my time with complex stories and characters, even if the grand narrative is one of hero vs. villain.I'm certain there is a good tale to be told about the ditching of the USAir flight. In this case it looks like Tom Hanks did the best he could with a weak script, but Mr. Eastwood's directing made sure that Sully wouldn't rise above the level of a made for TV Movie of the Week. Sully is simply not worthy of the big screen, or $6.50.",Sully
273,swjg,NTSB portrayed too negatively,9,19 June 2017,"That aspect of the movie ticked me off. I understand that it was used to create tension in the movie that it otherwise going to lack but I wish that Eastwood could have found another way. I'm not surprised that the actual NTSB complained I could hear members of the public saying ""damn bureaucrats"" as they left the movie. That IS unfair and just leaves the public trusting agencies even less.But in all other respects I think it is a good movie. If you recall - Sully did return to flying - but not for long. I think the underlying reasons are well hinted at in the movie. Sully approved of the portrayal of him. It might have been more interesting to twist the movie around that. I've seen Jeff Skiles talk a couple of time and had a chance to chat to him a couple of times. I think the actor Aaron Eckhart NAILS his character. Tom Hanks - less so as Sully. He is overweight for starters and I couldn't quite suspend disbelief and go with it.There are some good underlying nods to the fact it was training and Crew Resource Management (CRM) between the pilots that got the plane down successfully and that Sullenburger was unhappy with the media portrayal of him as the sole hero. Reminded me of BA38 in 2008 when the captain of the flight stressed to the press that it was the FO who successfully pancaked the plane onto the runway when the engines quit on short final and that he did his CRM part beside him as appropriate.Now the actual effects - I have to say that when I fly the Hudson and head south over the GW Bridge - I always think ""This is what Sully and Skiles saw......"" Having seen the movie and now gone and found more plots of their ground track. Boy was I wrong. For all practical purposes they flew around the end of the East tower of the GWB as they were so low. MAN were they low. It was great bit of stick and rudder flying (with a little help from the computer - go read the NTSB report) and that alone is worth the price of admission. You could edit this whole movie down to the 208 seconds of the flight and the evacuation and rescue. That would be a total of 24 fabulous minutes of footage! Don't rush out as soon as the credits roll. Worth watching them too.",Sully

276,kevin_newdirections,"""I don't feel like a hero. I'm just a man doing his job.""",8,17 September 2016,"Suly opens with Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) having a PTSD-induced, 9/11- reminiscent vision of a plane crashing into a Manhattan skyscraper. This is the ""what-if"" scenario that haunts the titular hero after successfully landing the engine-blown Flight 1549 on the chilly Hudson River, and miraculously saving all 155 souls onboard. As he snaps back into reality, we will soon learn that the ""untold story"" lies on the aftermath of the averted tragedy. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) starts to investigate and finds results that does not jibe with Sully's estimation: the left engine is still operational and he could have landed the plane on the nearest airport instead of risking passengers' lives with a forced water-landing. ""Over 40 years in the air, but in the end I'm going to be judged on 208 seconds,"" Sully laments and sadly, he's right. Has there been a lapse of judgment on his part? Or could this be NTSB's attempt to use him as a scapegoat against the future lawsuits that will be filed? Director Clint Eastwood may put you into the mind of Sully, yet you won't be able to conclude beyond a shadow of a doubt.Eastwood turns this feature film into an introspective character study narrated in a contemporary fashion. He feeds his viewers with seamlessly-integrated, piecemeal flashbacks that takes us to the events on that fateful afternoon. He does not take the route of presenting a straightforward inspirational tale but he's more interested on a bigger issue here – man's internal turmoil to redeem himself. As we witnessed in his previous works like American Sniper, this is where he shines best. Still, he remains simple as a filmmaker. The restrained execution of plane crash may not please fans of extravagant tent-pole films but the wave impact brought by the musical scoring and sound editing is impressively realistic and accurate.Hanks shines as well in this yet again perfectly-tailored role – a brave, diligent and sturdy ordinary American hero facing against insurmountable odds. It's already a cliché thing to say that Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor but what I like about his performance is that it does not scream of: ""Look at me! I'm a great actor! Give me an Oscar!"" He can be minimal in his acting – during an intense bird-engine collision scene, he stoically yells ""Birds."" and still, he sells a nuanced depth into the character. The same can be said to the underrated Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot Jeff Skiles, the funny guy who mocks the things that Sully is often too nice to say. He earns the film's final laugh.Whereas Hanks has weathered rougher storms in his previous travel-disaster films like Apollo 13, Cast Away and Captain Phillips, Sully, however, offers less dramatic weight. We already know by now that everything will turn out fine in the flashbacks so the suspense gets to be partially ruled out. It can also be a bit underwhelming that the closest thing you'll have here for antagonists are the suspicious bureaucrats (Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, and Jamey Sheridan) armed with computer simulations that should put Sully's career and pension at risk. The depiction of investigation somehow appears to be exaggerated for the sake of adding tension. The straw villains here will probably have more social relevance when they are viewed as Eastwood's take on modern cynicism: that even the noblest of men can still be subjected to harsh scrutiny.Just when Sully is on the verge of becoming a saccharine adulation to its hero, Sully gives credit where credit is due, ""I don't feel like a hero. I'm just a man doing his job."" He's right. This is not only the story of a man saving 155 souls but this is the story of a whole community coming together in the midst of tragedy – his co-pilot, the passengers, the flight attendants, the radio operator, the ferry boat captain, the coast guards and even the bit- players, no matter how thinly-sketched as they may be. Eastwood may not succeed in offering much meat for those who are expecting of a shocking conspiracy, but the fact that he's been able to effectively deliver the human element from a 208-second incident in such a short run- time is praise-worthy enough.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/sully",Sully

Sullenberger could have landed his disabled aircraft safely back at LaGuardia simply because their computer simulations using the same flight data parameters showed it could be done. But at what risk? When a plane crashes in a simulator, the screen freezes but as Capt. Sullenberger realized, a real life plane crash in densely populated New York city would end in a huge ball of fire and the loss of every passenger on board. Tom Hanks' portrayal as ""Sully"" Sullenberger was unquestionably one of his best performances and Aaron Eckhart was equally up to the task as co-pilot Jeff Skiles.

286,ollie1939-97-957994,An entertaining watch from Eastwood and Hanks,7,12 December 2016,"Much like with his last film, American Sniper, Eastwood is trying to portray the everyman. However, Sully is no Chris Kyle. He's someone who doesn't hunt for danger but rather an ordinary man who found himself in the worst of situations, that made him have 155 people's lives in his hand. Half the film is dedicated to the actual ""Miracle on the Hudson"" and the other half documents the media representation and the inquiry from the National Safety Transportation Board.As always, Eastwood gets the best out of his performers. Tom Hanks is brilliant as always, both calm but also engaging in his delivery (his final speech. There's very few actors who can portray people like this but Hanks is one of them. Its a welcome return for the actor after the godawful Inferno. The other standout is Aaron Eckhart as Sully's first officer who delivers most of the comedic relief Some of the supporting characters I did feel were not developed enough fully such as Sully' wife (Laura Linney) who seem slightly shoved in, without a lot of depth to be had to them. But as a film called Sully, is there much more that needs to be added to any of the other characters when the film needs to dedicate time to its title character.The movie is a very short sit at just 90 minutes long, which some may feel is too brief but I think it works in the film's benefit. Primarily, a story like this could've dragged on too long but Eastwood keeps it concise and interesting The film's biggest flaw is perhaps through its editing. I almost think the film would've worked better as a traditional, chronological narrative rather than focusing on flashbacks. Some scenes also feel slightly out of place, especially the ones that focus on Sully's younger, flying days.

It is a simple telling of the tale which allows the extraordinary nature of what happened to stand on its own. Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and his crew show just how extraordinary people can be when placed in an unpredictable situations. Seeing this story unfold, the bravery of those involved and the initially shocking way in which Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles were treated by the accident investigators is sobering and genuinely moving. The fact that one mans split-second decision based on years of experience meant that every single passenger and crew member survived is remarkable. I think few actors other than Tom Hanks could have put in such a beautifully observed and assured performance in the lead role, he is genuinely moving in this role. This is a proper ""feel-good"" movie that is unsentimental and genuinely worth watching.",Sully
288,brighton_dude,Polished and competent but nothing more,4,18 April 2017,"Clint Eastwood is such a conservative director. This film is extremely competent, the storytelling is very secure, but it is totally lacking in anything more than that.This is definitely not a film that sets you thinking the day after about the scenes, realising 24 hours after seeing the film something new about it, this film is the absolute reverse of that.Although you will not get bored watching this film you will have forgotten all about it thirty minutes after it is over and you will not ever think about it again.The facts of the story are mostly true in this, but one aspect of the story is exaggerated in order to create more drama. To me this illustrates the lack of imagination of the director. It is clear that Eastwood could only conceive of the film with a strong dramatic tension at its centre to maintain the viewer's interest. It is true that this works but when you find out that this strong dramatic tension wasn't anything like as great in real life, the only thing the film had is undone.Eastwood does show us events out of chronological order and the storytelling is always completely solid and that is an achievement. Hanks's Sully is totally convincing. Very good performances are everywhere in this film. Unfortunately the film has nothing to offer the viewer outside this competency.I think Clint Eastwood should not have built this film around that exaggerated dramatic tension and instead done a thoughtful film about the USA, about society in the US, about heroes and how they could so easily be undone about so much else. We could have had a film that sent the audience home with food for thought, but what we get instead is a competently told film with very little imagination.",Sully

290,Venom_81,a nice movie based on human aspect,8,10 December 2016,"This is a Clint Eastwood movie, that means that it's a movie well done, well framed, well directed and with a tremendous impact on the human aspect. Everythings flow easy during the narration. I found on this movie a lot of analogies with Grand Torino as in that movie on Sully the main character are normal people that turn to be an hero. Nothing to complain on this movie, a great cast very well directed. Tom Hanks is able to put all the doubts on in self and on the spectator. With this movie Clint Eastwood flight back to great movie based on the human aspect of the character. I'm also happy to see a movie that use visual effects at the service of the story and not as main attraction to recruit spectators. So a must watch movie",Sully
291,LemonLadyR,Got to Me,9,13 November 2016,"Wow, this movie really hit me on a physical anxiety level, as it is all about anxiety. Anxiety before, during, after the incident. So, for that alone, I have to add on a star. I had this reaction not once but twice during the film. I, too, wondered how much of a movie could be made out of this, esp as I don't remember much controversy over this crash. As other reviews have so well put, the momentum was kept by the editing and non-linear story line. Also the realistic silences and great acting by Hanks. He does anxiety very well! Sure, you have to believe in this movie to let it play out and be patient, but the payoff was wonderful. I don't require movies to be full of action or whatever, every second, so this was an easy decision for me. Esp as Tom Hanks pulled me in, coupled with my visceral physical reaction. I loved the special effects used to create this movie, and esp the great camera work that caused me to admire, once again, the guys who jump into dangerous waters from helicopters, to rescue others, even if it was done by CGI. As a frequent flyer many times in my life, and with only a storm and one severe loss of altitude to show for it, I have to say that commercial pilots and everyone else involved, are an amazing bunch, safely ferrying us, in the crowded skies, thousands of times a day. I am happy to put my life in their hands.",Sully

But that type of blockbuster disaster drama is on the wane. In an age of openness and transparency, fact-based calamity cinema is all the rage, with Sully following Deepwater Horizon by sticking closely to the events that happened during and after tragedy.Tom Hanks, cinematic short-hand of the everyman character, was the right choice to play Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who breached accepted aviation protocol by ditching his stricken airline in the Hudson River. He is ably, amusingly supported by Aaron Eckhart.",Sully
293,tymbus,Risky business,8,8 May 2017,"Late in the day, my thoughts have returned to Sully, Clint Eastwood's engaging movie that tells of US Airways's pilots Captain Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot Jeff Skiles who successfully landed their plane full of passengers on the Hudson river after the plane's engines were disabled by hitting a flock of geese. The passengers lived but the geese and their kith and kin were not so lucky as the accident precipitated a cull of the dastardly, life threatening feathered fiends.Sully became a popular hero, but the communications and data gathering Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System lead to an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board which used computer models to suggest that Sully should have followed instructions and headed for a near by airfield. Here, Eastwood draws on themes from science fiction, pitting human 'gut feeling', experience and decision making against the apparently inescapable logic of the machine.Sully himself is presented as a distinctly American type of hero, an average type of guy who you know would make a good neighbor. In Hollywood, this type is often contrasted with 'egg heads' ( in this case the investigators with their computer projections) and suspect bureaucratic types. Even his nickname 'Sully' suggests an amiable sort of guy. In Britain Sullenberger would have been nick named 'Sullen' or some sort of derogatory reference to beef burgers and made fun of until he actually became sullen (or obese from being driven to comfort eating fast food).It is worth noting that the inquiry is just one area where Eastwood has used artistic license to create a dramatic conflict. In reality, computer models failed to predict a successful landing at either of the two available air fields. And Sully and the NTSB raised concerns about the way the film depicted the investigation as an adversarial process. But having just watched The Andromeda Strain, I can tell you a dispassionate investigation makes for boring viewing and, even though we know the outcome, Sully is never less than gripping.What gives Sully a lot of its emotional power, is the film's up front echoes of 9/11. The safe landing is good news from the skies above New York. I did found a scene where Sully imagines his plane crashing into a tower a little on the nose, but this film is all about healing the psychic wounds of that terrible day in September. No one conveys a quietly troubled mind better that Tom Hankes, staring out over the New York skyline while waiting to appear before the investigators.So a lot of narrative work has gone into dramatizing what would seem an already dramatic situation. We are not watching reality in the raw. And nowhere is the film more fictionalized that its treatment of risk. Miy mind kept turning to Tom Wolfe's book 'The Right Stuff' that explores the culture of test pilots flying some of the most dangerous planes ever created, prototypes of the jets and rocket engines that eventually helped Man journey to the Moon. These were planes that were so experimental that repeated failure was a likelihood and yet the pilots saw accidents as the result of a failure of pilot competency.Sociologists have found that a similar culture exists among middle aged men who turn to motorcycling. Objectively, motorcycles are inherently dangerous where as cars are safety cages on wheels. Yet motorcyclists continually attribute accidents to errors of judgment on the part of the cyclist. What this means for the film Sully is that audiences become trapped in an unrealistic either or scenario in which the outcome is entirely dependent on Sully's decision making and skill. Either he was a rogue pilot incompetently defying his orders to land at an airfield and putting the lives of his passengers at risk or he was a highly competent and skillful pilot who drew on years of experience to save the lives of passengers by achieving a safe land few if anyone else could.But there's a third possibility Luck. By chance, on this occasion everything turned out well. But it needn't have. And Sully's skill might not have been the deciding factor. A whole host of other things were. But that's hard to take on board. Not least because this powerful human drama plays to our deepest bias, so deep it is called Fundamental attribution Error. We want the world to be under our control even when events are the outcome of the situation.And with well made, well acted, well scripted films like Sully it is hard to be a nay sayer.",Sully
294,riteshk-71503,Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks. What a delight!,8,26 December 2017,Once again Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks delight us with an excellent movie.

295,vvp_14,Fantastic job by Clint Eastwood,8,20 February 2017,"Before watching the film I wasn't sure if Clint Eastwood would pull it off. The story he had to put on screen wasn't really full of exciting twists, mystery or adventures - there's only so much to tell. To my amazement it was brilliantly done in every department - great script and directing, with Tom Hanks doing a really believable and excellent job. I couldn't find fault with this film apart from the story itself - not that it's uninteresting or unheroic but solely as a material for a movie. Clint Eastwood got the best he could out of it.A normal approach would be to unveil the story as it happened: start with the accident and follow with the investigation. I was afraid it would be a bit too predictable and therefore uninteresting. Instead, the creators used the only possible approach to make this interesting - a non-linear story-telling. They take us on a journey going back and forth in time during and after the accident and even a couple of quick flashbacks into pilot's earlier years as a military pilot and his adolescence years as a young pilot trainee, into the emotional life of the man.The film deals with more that just the action itself (although that is brilliantly done) but with the human aspect, with our ability to be honest and straightforward when we ""have to do our job"" and act on something that is not prescribed by the protocols and procedures (exactly what the captain has done) - in this case the investigators who, being fully aware the pilot did something extraordinary and worthy of praise, are bent on accusing him of making a dreadful mistake and endangering human lives, totally forgetting about the human aspect - something that no computer or protocol they rely on can ever predict, calculate or evaluate. A wonderful piece of work from a professional. Highly recommended.",Sully
296,papacorn,Well done!,10,7 October 2016,"Going into this I was a skeptic. How do you make a movie about something that was in the news for days and days? Something that everyone feels they could repeat from start to finish due to all the exposure? And how would you hold people's interest when we all know how it ends and possibly all the details? This movie accomplished all in a mesmerizing, edge-of-the-seat delivery. I didn't go with enthusiasm but because my husband wanted to see it. ""Sully"" uses flashbacks as a person does when mulling over something from the past. The pilot examines what happened, what he and his co-pilot did, and raises the question as to whether anything was missed. I can't criticize the way ""Sully"" was staged but find it close to flawless. It was as close to the actual experience as one can get. Even the scene involving the NTSB, something that might come off as dull, was not. You know this movie is moving toward a frightening, inevitable, event. This kind of thing anyone who flies, openly, or secretly, fears. There was something a little cathartic in taking the dive from the sky. I can't say whether everyone would feel that way but it satisfied my curiosity. I wasn't there but...close enough! Tom Hanks and his co-pilot, Aaron Eckhart, bring this story to life again in the best way. It also made me aware of how much experience plus instinct the real Sully had, and used, to bring about a happy ending.",Sully
297,mcancea,Sully review,8,4 January 2017,Once again Clint Eastwood does it again sully starring tom hanks as he is the most respected actor in film for a reason. He killed it as sully.Sthe first act was right in the to the event of the films story but it gets slow a bit into the second act and then near the third act it gets very good and suspenseful. This is an example of a film that has a lot of potential it could have been a 10 out of 10 film it delivers and what you think should but it could have been for suspenseful. This is Clint east woods shortest film and he is still knows how to film great movies because this is a great movie it has great moments and and flaws that make is not as good but in the he end it's great movie watch it it's out now. Overall I recommend the film it's a good one.,Sully
298,Miasmakoala,Underwhelming ending to a good movie,6,15 November 2017,"Captain Sullenberger and First Officer Stiles landed a plane on the river Hudson. It sounds quite miraculous and the premise of the film gripped me instantly.Director Clint Eastwood tricked me into thinking that this will be just some generic airplane disaster movie. The opening scene, where Sullenberger crashes the plane, turns out to be a nightmare, which is utilized fairly well in the movie. The landing on the river haunts the captain and Tom Hanks does excellent work in portraying the calm man who is tormented by fear and suspicion.Sully's wife and daughters are at home waiting for the crash investigation to be over and worried of him. Laura Linney portrays the wife and she was great. I loved her in the movie. I saw her performance in the movie Mr. Holmes and she portrayed fairly similar character in that movie as a worrying caretaker for aging Sherlock Holmes. She was very good and sympathetic in both movies.I love the premise of the movie. Sully's nightmares were really interesting, I loved the way Eastwood portrayed the human side of the accident.My first complaint is the supposed ""main antagonist"" of the movie. Mike O'Malley portrays Charles Porter, the man leading the investigation about the investigation. He performs well, but it is very unnecessary for his character to be so obnoxious in the movie. I sided both factually and emotionally with Sully in the very beginning of the movie, there was no need to put an antagonist in the film to make the viewer more emotionally invested in Sully. His character could've been there without him being a total jerk. Did the writers think that the viewer would not side with Sully in the movie? Are the geese that crashed with the plane the misunderstood heroes here?The screen time where characters are pitted against each other could've been dedicated to portray the nightmares of Sully even more deeply. Oh well.The highlight of the movie was the mid point where they show the plane get damaged, being piloted into the river and the passengers and the crew being rescued from the river.I was awestruck with it. I got fully caught with the scene and the scene made me cry. Everything with it hit me so hard, I definitely wasn't prepared for the scene to completely suspend my disbelief in it. The small character arcs of the passengers, the crew working during the emergency, the personnel in the flight control, the rescue crew, everything. I haven't been crying like this because of a movie since The Wrestler, and it was bad.There I was ready to give this movie, despite minor flaws, a 9/10 immediately.But after that the movie falls flat.After the mid point, everything in the movie feels just off. The investigation committee trying to make Sully guilty turns, of course, to be wrong in the movie. Sully is officially made a hero. Sully's nightmares end after he goes into a bar for a drink and there he figures out how to convince the committee that he did what he had to.The ending is so dissatisfying. The character buildup towards the end just feels so bland and obvious. Everything in the end just screams ""obviously this was going to end like this, what did you think"". I didn't want a surprise ending, but rather a satisfying ending.Maybe I should've sided with the geese.I rate this movie six Aaron Eckhardt's mustaches out of ten.",Sully
299,melinetto,powerful biography and drama,8,30 May 2021,"First of all, this is the example of perfect casting for the role of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. Tom Hanks, you sir, performs incredibly well here yet again.The film is about that US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320, on a flight from NYC's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, struck a flock of birds shortly after take-off, losing all engine power and unable to reach any airport for an emergency landing, Captain Sully decided to glide the plane to a ditching in the Hudson River. And afterwards, as you can imagine, National Transportation Safety Board opens an official investigation about the captain and his co-pilot. It's about that Sully's dilemma which is whether the water landing decision was right or not and effect of this decision on passengers, cabin crew and the press or other people. Sully thinks that ""what if i really put all of these people's life in danger?"" or ""was it really a good choice i've had?"" constantly. In general, there's a good script right here in my opinion. Todd Komarnicki sticks with the investigation period and Sully's feelings, not an off-topic or something like that.By the way, I must say that Clint Eastwood did a fine job as a director. Especially, he did some quality work in the scenes which is inside of the plane. You can just burn with the moments of strucking a flock of birds, high tension of the cabin crew and in the cockpit, safely water landing to Hudson River and evacuation with water fairies. Particularly, these scenes were shot really well. I think that these scenes i'm talking about above, he did reflect the tension and thrill of these minutes vigorously.In summary, this movie is a must-watch in my opinion and besides, Tom Hanks in it lol.",Sully

301,gmwatling,Unbelievable,10,9 October 2017,"I cannot believe that this is based on a true story, even though I was 9 when it happened I remember reading the story and watching it on the news as it was being reported. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the man that was named a hero. However, he never wanted the mass media attention. If you haven't yet watched this, I urge you to watch it! It has been too long for cinephiles as this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that reveals the best of human nature. This film was bound to be a success no matter what but it was decided the minute Hanks and Eastwood were to collaborate. It is no doubt that we are in constant awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers it is instilled into us that we want to see crashes and planes falling apart. However, since this is not a fictional film it has to be as realistic as possible and even that is a lot to handle the film wrote itself in the fact that there was drama, intensity, action, and so on. The re-creation is so realistic that we as an audience almost end up following and doing what the flight attendants are telling us to do. This is a sign of a fantastic film as it shows that it has truly grasped the audience and shows that they haven't lost attention and they are still well engrossed in the film. As an audience we already know the conditions of the river and the below freezing temperature of it, this creates sympathy and fear for the people that are crash landing into it, as if it couldn't get any worse they know have to evacuate into a icy river that could surely have health effects. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, while all passengers are evacuating in true style Sully is doing his job and almost taking on that of a Ship Captain as he is the last one off of the plane as he is trying to count all of the passengers, which were a total of 155, as an audience we feel the desperation and anxiety that Sully is feeling as he is praying that he will count all 155 passengers. This has been one of the best films made and that came of 2016, I have seen the film twice and I have actually recommended to people and I would continue to recommend it to people, if you have not seen it, I urge you to do so.

302,Bello-4,Great and Moving Movie Despite Inaccuracies...,7,10 January 2017,"I""m not one for besmirching Sully Sullenberger, the man saved one- hundred fifty-five lives that day he was able to use his experience to land safely in the Hudson River. The man is a hero. But while an excellent movie, I have to take an exception with it.I never got around to seeing this movie while in theaters, so I had to rent it recently. It was interesting to see things from afterwards from the perspective of our hero. Cool and calm when the situation demanded it, but haunted about what might've happened, what he might've done differently. Usually when someone does something positively that's news worthy, that's all we hear about and then the news moves on. No one usually knows how, whatever the situation is/was, effected the individual afterwards.But the exception I have to take is the NTSB being made to be the villain. I mean I guess you have to have a villain for their to be a movie, otherwise what's your hero going to fight or campaign against? The villains role should've been the birds the plane ran into, but their birds, they didn't strike the aircraft out of malice or ill intent. So you've gotta find a villain in order to make your movie. That's the NTSB. The NTSB did it's job, they investigated the accident - looked things over, ran some simulations and agreed with Sully that it was the best outcome. But the movie deviates from Sully's book, from the NTSB's investigation and makes them the villain needlessly.The audience would've been better served with a documentary style piece, but they don't normally translate to big budget films. Guess when the story doesn't fit your intentions, you fudge the story. Which is why I'm giving it a seven out of a ten.",Sully
303,SaritaLW,Easy Going Movie,7,30 September 2016,"As soon as I saw the preview for Sully, it immediately took me back to 2012's Flight starring Denzel Washington. I was expecting somewhat of the same story-line before I really had investigated the story of Chelsey Sullenberger and the incredible story of that day in New YorkI was nervous in viewing this movie, thinking that it would possibly be boring and predictable because we all knew what was going to happen in the end, right? But Clint Eastwood knew how to absorb the audience into Sully's life during and after the crash. Tom Hanks was a perfect fit to play Chelsey Sullenberger with his calm demeanor and passion. I also loved Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles who played Sully's wing man during the flight. These two made an absolute team as they underwent constant criticizing from the media and NTSB.This movie will have you pushing for Sully and backing him on him doing the right thing while others looked for flaws on how to make it his fault even though he saved 155 people. Sully is a go see in my book and a definent addition to my DVD collection.",Sully
304,akir-53426,"Very good film, but I expected more.",7,20 August 2018,"I've always been very interested about aviation accidents and I've watched pretty much EVERY episode of Air Crash Investigations -TV program. And there is one story which most of us recognize and / or remembers, including myself. Yes, this movie tells the very same story. About the emergency landing on freezing water with almost full passenger plane.When I first saw this movie, I was like ""Oh wow, there is actual movie out of it. It must be great."" And then I looked cast ""Oh my GOD, and my absolute favorite character (Tom Hanks) on the main role! Now I MUST watch it!""
And yeah I did that.It turned out to be pretty different than I expected. I was expecting more catastrophe film like The Perfect Storm"" or Titanic or something like that.
To be honest, I didn't like those ""hallucinations"" and different memories that pilot saw.
It's kind of weird that it shows the accident by piece by piece. But however, I understand it because this story was more on the pilot's side. I mean the investigation that focused on human errors. And it was great to see how they managed to fight back.
And here, Tom Hanks really nails it again. Just gotta love every role he acts. He just is excellent actor, no matter what role.In the end, movie still turned to be very great, although I didn't get quite what I expected.",Sully

By exaggerating the evil of federal agencies & including too many of Sully's ""nightmares"" that could have happened to his flight, Eastwood scratched out a feature-length film of 1 hr. 36 min. The scenes of the actual disaster are wonderful, but you can palpably tell where he's padding-out scenes & scenarios to stretch it out. A little very good movie within a so-so feature-length film. I was worried about this movie when it came out--it had generally good reviews, but I could tell from what I read that Eastwood resorted to what seemed to be flabby scenes, and so I waited till it came out on DVD....

All the lives were at stake and still he pulled something very unusual and miraculous. The sound of the film is terrific.Tom Hanks has been excellent again as he balances those emotions with subtlety and grace. Tom did it in the film- Captain Phillips and now again...an outstanding performance.This is the best film of 2016 so far. Top Notch work by Client Eastwood.

308,Hbarker-32233,Terrific. Tom Hanks is on fire!,9,21 December 2016,"""We did our job,"" says Tom Hanks' Captain Chesley Sullenberger in an unguarded moment that turns out to be the emotional fulcrum and raison d'tre of Clint Eastwood's Sully. The eighty-six-year-old director's thirty-fifth theatrical feature is a stripped-down, unfussy salute to professionalism that pretty much serves as a statement of principles for the Eastwood oeuvre – call it The Malpaso Manifesto. In many ways Sully is the Clint Eastwood-iest movie Clint Eastwood has ever made.We begin with Captain Sullenberger crashing U.S. Airways Flight 1549 into midtown Manhattan, killing thousands and engulfing the screen with flames before Hanks' Sully jerks awake in a cold sweat. He's staying in one of the movie's countless, vaguely Kubrickian Marriotts, turning over the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" in his mind and second-guessing every decision as the movie darts back and forth through time. When not being trotted out for media appearances or questioned by the National Transportation Safety Board, Sully's stewing in his own self-doubt and the film follows in the footsteps of Eastwood's American Sniper as the story of a public hero's private PTSD.Of course we all know that Sullenberger's emergency water landing that afternoon in January of 2009 was a super-heroic feat and the stuff of instant legend, so much so that one can easily imagine a thunderously banal movie culminating in the crash and probably winning several Oscars. But Eastwood (working from a script by Todd Komarnicki) is far more interested in the aftermath: a shy man shoved into the spotlight and praying it's for the right reasons. I understand that the actual NTSB investigation was more of a formality and less like the Spanish Inquisition presented here, but much in the way American Sniper invented a nemesis to serve as a shadow-self Chris Kyle needed to kill before he could go home, the hearings in Sully are an externalization of Sullenberger's deepest fears, asking out loud the questions he's asking himself. (Also, it just wouldn't be a Clint Eastwood movie without a bunch of goddamned desk jockey bureaucrats in positions of authority who don't know what the hell they're talking about.) Tom Hanks has been on quite a run as of late – he's the only actor with two Oscars I'd consider calling underrated – and Sully can be seen as the third part of a loose trilogy alongside Captain Phillips and Bridge Of Spies, in which prickly everymen rise to nearly impossible occasions. He plays the best of us but wears it lightly. This is a tremendously subtle performance, with a slight nod near the end providing a release that had the audience roaring with appreciation both times I saw the picture. It takes incredible command of your craft as an actor to understand how doing something that small will pay off so big.People always point out how the male leads of Woody Allen films invariably end up aping their director's mannerisms, and I'd argue the same holds true for Eastwood movies now that he's retired from acting. I'm thinking of Matt Damon's reticence in Hereafter and Invictus, or the steely vulnerability Bradley Cooper shocked me with in Sniper. Sometimes in Sully Hanks seems to be doing a Clint impression – it's the most minimalist performance of his career, and he even looks taller somehow. He's got an easy rapport with Aaron Eckhardt, who as co-pilot Jeff Skiles gets all the wisecracks we're used to hearing from Hanks. And it must be noted that both men's mustaches are spectacular.Laura Linney doesn't fare nearly as well, literally phoning it in as Mrs. Sully and always calling at the wrong time. As in most Eastwood pictures, the day players are all three or four notches bigger and louder than the main cast – although a sinister Katie Couric haunting Sullenberger's nightmares suggests the former Today Show anchor could have a career in horror films if she wants. Hanks and Eckhart get digitally Gumped into the crew's Letterman appearance, and there's a hint of Eastwood's Flags Of Our Fathers in the sly understanding of how America's myths are marketed. A sequence in which Sully jogs through Times Square at night finds the man dwarfed by his own image on televisions and jumbotrons, alongside a skyscraper-sized Old Glory. (Worth noting that he also runs past a poster for Gran Torino, its star looming larger-than-life over the real hero's head.) The film returns to the crash three times from three different perspectives, but it is during the second that Sully becomes something truly remarkable. In what feels like a real-time re-creation of the water landing and rescue, we watch in awe as the fight crew guides the passengers step-by-step through emergency procedures. Ditto for the ferry boat drivers and scuba cops, everybody working together with hushed, meticulous diligence. Eastwood doesn't editorialize, he grants no heroic poses nor the triumphant choirs of horns one might expect from a Hollywood movie soundtrack. (The noodling, jazzy score by Christian Jacob and The Tierney Sutton Band is used quite sparingly throughout the film.) This eerily quiet rescue sequence is so breathtaking because of how matter-of-factly it is presented. Eastwood never strains for affect here. He knows he doesn't have to hype what he's showing us.Sully extols all the classically Eastwoodian virtues of going to work and not making a big goddamn deal out of it. You wouldn't be crazy to notice a whiff of autobiographical identification in this tale of an old pro with forty years of experience frustrated by having to answer to young, corporate-minded whippersnappers who place far too much faith in their computer data. But most importantly, the movie does its job.",Sully
309,imdb020-643-129772,One of the best movies of recent years.,10,8 September 2016,"From the very beginning I was impressed with picture. There are a lot of beautifully composed scenes.Despite it is not an action movie, it keeps tension growing all the time. I felt like my guts were winded onto rusty piece of iron in some moments.You'll not get bored, you have a compassion to protagonists. The cast is brilliant.Despite there were some mistakes and stupid things, and Sully's wife character behaves idiotically in some scenes (maybe something was lost in translation during full dubbing in localized version), I still give this movie 10 out of 10.Worth every penny!",Sully
310,shannonmykayla,Exceptional,9,26 September 2018,"Superbly directed and brilliantly acted. Tom Hanks again defies gravity and lands himself on the legendary plain of cinematic artistry to add to his multi-faceted character ability. If anyone at all can tell a story it's Clint Eastwood and if anyone at all can live it....it's Tom Hanks. I also have to give Aaron Eckhart a solid A for his supportive role. I remember the day this historic event happened, but in no way did I or anyone I know, have any comprehension or understanding as to the length of rigorous interrogation that Captain Sully really truly had. There was definitely more at stake than what met the eye, and it was Captain Sully's heroic decision that was the fine line between the survival of 155 souls and losing 155 souls. Just incredible.",Sully
311,jarthur0111,"It ""sticks the landing""",9,23 December 2016,"Here is a movie that got very good reviews, did very well at the box office & after a half hour into it isn't really flying. It is a ""Clint Eastwood movie"" starring Tom Hanks so you give it the benefit of doubt.Then this movie finds its thrust. It gets better & better as it goes along before it really sticks its landing (to borrow a term from gymnastics).The ever reliable Tom Hanks --my generation's ""Jimmy Stewart""-- turns in another fine performance as the unflappable Capt. Chesley Sullenberger who, of course, landed a United Airways flight on the Hudson River with all 155 souls surviving while 9/11 was still fresh on our collective minds. Yeah, it winds up being a ""feel good movie"" that unexpectedly begins as a ""feel bad movie"".This movie brings back some some very good memories while exploring some under-reported angles. The script becomes very crisp & witty while spreading credit to to ""Sully's"" co-pilot Jeff Skiles (nicely played by Aaron Eckhardt), crew & first responders. There is also a cool role played by the air traffic controller who thought he lost the flight.There is a surprising lot of stuff going on in this under 2 hour movie. The ever efficient Eastwood directs it with his usual assured economy & rarely overplays his hand emotionally & cinematically. Laura Linney must also be applauded for her touching ""phone scenes"" (those could not have been easy for an actor).This is one of the best films of the year.",Sully
312,thelastjedi_good,A forgettable retelling of an unforgettable event,7,6 October 2016,"In ""Sully,"" Captain Chesley Sullenberger spends a fair amount of time musing about how his life's legacy is defined by a plane crash that took only 208 seconds. Sully's life was only noteworthy for those 208 seconds. As one might predict, it turns out that this biopic is also exciting for about 208 seconds.Sully's main focus is on Capt. Sullenburger's difficulty handling the media attention following the crash, and the investigation that the airline did into Sullenburger post-crash. If you don't remember hearing much about this investigation in the news, that's because it wasn't newsworthy. The movie makes this investigation to appear bigger than it is, and the threat of a lawsuit lasts for exactly 90 minutes of screen time, only to magically disappear as the movie is about to end. Just before the credits roll, even the villainous plaintiff lawyers seem to concede that they never really had a case against Sully anyway. This threat never seemed credible to the viewer, and it disappears in an incredibly anti-climatic way.While great biopics like Fincher's ""The Social Network"" play up real dramas in the lives of notable historical figures, ""Sully"" is a 90 minute picture about a three minute event. Luckily, Eastwood handles the crash itself pretty well, showing the viewer windows into the lives of multiple passengers on the plane, so we have people to be concerned for in the heat of the action.The movie suffers from jarring edits and needless jumping in the narrative. Sometimes we see Sully before the crash, and sometimes we see him after- the crash itself is shown about halfway through the film. Before we see the crash, there are a handful of ""gotcha!"" moments in which we see the plane almost crash inside of Sully's daydreams. The whole concept of jumping back and forth seems totally random and unnecessary. The ""gotcha!"" daydreams also only hurt the film, as they cause nothing but frustration for the viewer.This is a weak film by Eastwood's standards. Even though its runtime is a slim 1h 36m, Sully feels overlong, and that's because there's simply not much to make of the story. This is a competent enough movie, and is a better choice than some other films currently in theaters, but you shouldn't lose too much sleep if you skip this one.",Sully

The depiction of the actual ditching (landing in the water) and the conversation between the pilots and controllers is quite accurate, and with CGI, quite believable.However, the depiction of the investigative process, including the behavior of the investigators, is not realistic at all. I have worked as a professional pilot and air accident investigator for most of my life, and the investigation as depicted in this film is pure fiction.In several interviews with the director, Clint Eastwood, he admitted that the movie needed a villain or antagonist, so he chose to depict the investigators and the investigative process as much more hostile than it really is.",Sully

Film producers have deceived audience because of Hanks face value. As far movie is concern, it was pointless as we already know many miraculous flight accident where many or almost all lives saved by Pilots and Crew (for example Dubai Accident where every passengers life saved on ground landing) but in this movie director was only concentrating and glorifying single man (Only Captain) for live saved in the accident, although in climax they tried to give credits to other crew members but it was like they were doing some kind of favor to them.

Had it been much less, below 7, I would not have wasted my time, so it is through this sense of altruism that I extend my compassion to you all and try to lower it and save you time. This movie was so 'by the numbers' I started counting them in order to relieve the boredom.Like the crash landing itself, it was grinding and creaking - only this was during the movie's take off. Such a non-event and nondescript start. At least it lowers your expectations for the rest of the movie to a suitable level. Then jump to the actual event about 20 minutes in, then jump to the Sully's seemingly irrelevant past - if it was relevant then it should have been more consequential.He is a good pilot. We get it. A serious person. We get that too. A boring sort of serious person that you want flying your plane when both engines go. Check. A damn good pilot. We get that too. Over and over... until you wished it was all over and out already. The air safety investigators where flawed, .. oh, .. didn't see that one coming.

317,gcarpiceci-73268,A movie based on a non-story,5,30 November 2016,"I went to see Sully with a good deal of curiosity, curiosity to see how two heavy-weights such as Eastwood and Hanks would put up what could only be as a minimum a strong movie in absence of an underlying story. In fact, the events involving flight US Airways 1549 present a very thin story indeed: take-off, engine failure, emergency landing on the Hudson - all taking 208 seconds, plus rescue operation. A miracle indeed, but paradoxically a pretty simple and linear one, without much else attached to these sheer facts. So what was left for the movie was another superlative performance by Tom Hanks and the very professional direction of Clint Eastwood, but it remains a very thin story, with an attempt to inject some tension through the NTSB investigation, which is a usual routine after every incident, which is the movie is artificially dramatized. So, I walked into the cinema with great curiosity and I left with the question why did Eastwood picked up such a light story for his movie.",Sully

More of a dramatised documentary than a movie, but more powerful because it represents a true story. Real-life heroes don't wear capes, they aren't out for revenge or tortured souls .... they're often just quiet, modest, professional people who do their jobs really well, and keep their calm when >95% of us would crap ourselves. In the words of his wife, Capt Chesley Sullenberger ""hates surprises and always plans ahead"". The documentary about Sully is arguably more interesting than the rather contrived court-room drama of the investigation which dominates the film. In the real world, calm heroics come at a price. Sullenberger suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, lost 13 pounds in two days after his miracle landing on water, and loathed the attention. If you get the DVD, watch the feature documentary - it's as good as the film (no disrespect to Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, their movie is excellent). The interesting thing is - there's a world full of Sullys, and 99.99% of them will never be recognised - but they just do their best anyway. In Sully's case, he gave New York good news, involving a plane - and that really was a miracle.",Sully

The story focuses on the happenings after the incident, and the investigations whether the pilot did the right or the wrong decision, to potentially endanger the lives of 155 people.This is a very well made movie. Storywise this quite masterpiece by Clint Eastwood seems very similar to Robert Zemecki's 'Flight'. But in truth, they are as far apart as possible. The story built-up with the flashbacks mixing with the investigations are superb. Tom Hanks is Oscar-worthy (as always), the flight scenes are unspectactular and realistic, what moves the viewer are the emotions underneath. But all this is unimportant, this is not another well-crafted action drama but a masterpiece with underlying message as powerful as it is subtle. And I think it was this subtlety that made Eastwood direct this film, not the superficial heroism.If you ever find yourself in a situation, where everyone criticizes you for what felt like is the best thing you can do, and all of a sudden what was right seems to be wrong, and you start doubting yourself.

However, it's directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Tom Hanks, so that's normally enough to warrant a look.The film is about an incident in 2009 where a pilot had to make a water-landing on the Hudson River after both of his engines gave out. The film shows us what happened during the flight (from multiple points-of-view), as well as the investigation afterwards.If you like films like Apollo 13, then you'll probably enjoy this too (not just because of the Tom Hanks connection).

Without question the movie is a technical marvel, and I understand that Mike O'Malley has to put food on the table and do what the director tells him to do, but this movie's gratuitous and conspiratorial bashing of career civil servants is going to drive me to Sully's autobiography and the NTSB transcripts. Did they really try to railroad guys who JUST SAVED 155 PEOPLE? Did they really hide the number of (SPOILER ALERT) failed simulations just to get Sully's silver scalp? Seriously? What could possibly be the government's motivation beyond (SPOILER ALERT) ""big gubmint is evil""? And since Clint couldn't find a chair to play the lead villain, he had to find the smarmiest, most supercilious actor possible (again, sorry Mr. O'Malley.) Is this is actually what happened then my apologies, but I'll bet my talking chair that it's not.

What these pilots did was truly remarkable and should be remembered in the most honorable of terms. That being said, Clint Eastwood's film is a bit of a mess.Firstly, there is very little story to tell to span the running length. There are moments so stretched out it is unbearable to watch. A couple of subplots with passengers from the Hudson River flight are popped in to ground some form of reality to the people involved. While on paper this sounds fine, in execution there is a really phoniness to the whole proceedings. The crash incident itself is very tense yes, but for some reason we are subjected to it a couple of times over the film when this could have been skipped over and feels like it was purely done to stretch the film.The depiction of the National Transportation Safety Board is hilariously bad and sort of disrespectful to the real people involved. A painful attempt at creating a villain presence for a film that could have easily done without to purely focus on the heroic efforts of Sully and his co-pilot.That being said, the crash scene is very well done ignoring some bad CGI moments. Tom Hanks is also very very good and gives a real warmth to the cold direction of Eastwood (at least in this film). His speech defending himself is by far the best scene in the film and makes me want to see a film that was engaging and well written as that scene.",Sully

333,hegedus_dani02,"Not the typical Clint Eastwood drama, but still pretty good",8,19 September 2016,"This film is unlike any other, that Clint Eastwood, the 86 years old legendary director and actor created so far, due to it's style and it's length. The full length of Sully (including the rolling cast) is only 96 minutes, making this feature the shortest film Eastwood ever directed. This is mainly because that the movie was shot entirely with IMAX 65 cameras, which makes a lot of extra work in post-production, such as in color grading and removing the background noise. Although it's relatively short screen time, the movie is still slow paced compared to other airplane dramas, for example Robert Zemeckis' Flight (2012). The acting is superb. Tom Hanks is excellent as usually, bringing nearly the same level as in Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips or in Ron Howard's Apollo 13. I only seen Aaron Eckhart one time acting better than his role in Sully, and that's his awesome performance as Harvey Dent's complex character in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. The direction is amazing, as we except from an Eastwood movie. In this film, he focused more on the visuals than in the actors and emotions, which he usually do. Although I prefer his more human-oriented dramas, it was interesting to see him directing a feature like this. This movie is a must see for those, who like Clint Eastwood, and for those, who love slow-paced dramas. Overall, I think this film is not as good as Flight (I think Flight is the only movie I can compare with Sully from the 2010s), but Sully is definitely a must see. 8/10",Sully

The characterisations are believable and involving.The second part is not dealt with well at all. The film presents a gross caricature of the NTSB investigators as being self satisfied bureaucrats who have already decided what occurred and who is to blame - that is Sully. This is not how it works, in this and most other investigations. The reason for this is obvious - to create a villainous counterpoint to the heroic flight crew. But the whole thing is so one dimensional. I almost laughed when towards the end one of the investigators starts gushing admiration for Sully at a public hearing.There was no need to do this - a more interesting and involving story would have been to portray the challenges felt by the NTSB team. A heavy responsibility to get to an account of what happened and why and to make a judgement about cause and contributory factors. Perhaps portray a back story of an investigation which went wrong with significant consequences.But hey ho - why let facts spoil a good story?",Sully

If the plane was any weaker it would break in two or three pieces upon impact, and no rescue crews would be there in time. It would sink like a stone.But this particular airplane (Airbus A320) survived abnormal deceleration when it hit the water and got submerged for a moment, losing the speed quickly under the enormous water resistance. It didn't break like many other planes that landed on water. Instead it stayed afloat long enough for all the passengers to be saved. In fact, it didn't sink even hours after the accident.There are numerous cases of airplanes breaking up after landing on water because they weren't structurally strong enough. This was a good plane.

We both found the acting to be superb. Hanks didn't 'overplay' his real-life, heroic-yet-modest pilot. I especially liked his reflective and anxious moments alone.

Aaron as the first officer Skies is great too and does full justice to his part. Laura Linney's part as Sully's wife is limited and she plays the role decently. Overall the movie's greatest asset are its actors.Direction (8/10) - Clint Eastwood's American Sniper remains his best work but Sully's direction is one notch below it and its because the story is pretty simple and the director's role in keeping the story engaging does not require much effort. Clint Eastwood has of course done a commendable job and looking forward to more.Overall, Sully is a great work to keep audience entertained with its subtle humor at regular intervals.

I am not a person who gets overly emotional while watching movies. Well, most of the time. But I did have to wipe the one or the other tear surreptitiously away while watching Sully - Miracle on the Hudson.We all saw the TV footage and we all read the news stories about the US Airways plane that landed on the Hudson River in New York on January 15, 2009. But we were never told the story around the incident, from what went wrong to what happened in the aftermath of the emergency landing.The captain of US Airways Flight 1549 was being hailed a hero for saving all 155 lives on board the plane. We read the newspaper articles, applauded the captain and then we moved on. At least I did. Until the movie brought that heroic act back to me. It made me think about the people on the plane, about the crew and the passengers.Who ever took a moment to think of the rescue teams that were out there on that fateful day, helping to get everyone to safety? It was a icy cold January day. Without the help of the coast guard and all the other helpers, people may have died of hypothermia. Yet, thanks to the heroic efforts of every single person out there, everybody made it out alive. All of a sudden all these people were not an article in the newspaper, they were real people. What made them real? Their story. Why? Because it is a very powerful story.The StorySully - Miracle on the Hudson tells the events around the emergency landing from the perspective of the pilot, Captain Chesley Sullenberger. The crash is re-enacted as is the rescue operation that ensued afterwards. As a nice touch the rescue crews in the movie are portrayed by the real life heroes who were actually on duty when the plane came down. From the captain of the boat to the frog man who jumped into the water - these guys are the real deal. Its nice to have a face to them.The movie deals with the emotional trauma that comes from such an experience. Not many people would have stopped to think how this near tragedy affected those onboard afterwards. We are witness to the nightmares and the PST symptoms that the pilot suffered from in the days after the crash. The stress must have been immense.Also part of the aftermath was the investigation in the crash that followed. Such investigations are a crucial part of the process, as things learned will hopefully aid the prevention of future disasters. The investigator in the movie are portrayed as heartless and cold people, devoid of compassion. They were sent by the corporation to find out why the plane ended up on the Hudson River and not on an airport runway.I don't know if this is exactly how it happened or if some Hollywood screen writing liberties were taken with that part. It certainly made for a lot of drama as the movie progressed. The truth lies probably somewhere in the middle.The CastTom Hanks was as usual on top of his game with his portrayal of Sully. He is such a great actor. Although, a few times he reminded me of Forest Gump in his mannerism. I don't know if that intentional; I would not think so but what do I know.The very strong supporting cast was lead by Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney. Both were just incredible.As a woman and a wife, I really felt for Laura's character of Lorraine Sullenberger. Her husband had just been in a place crash. He was far away, both physically and emotionally, and there was no way for her to be there. She had no option to see with her own eyes that he was OK, or to hold him. She had to deal with the sudden hype around his person to an extend she was completely unprepared for. The media parked in front of her house, making such noise that conversations inside were almost impossible.Sully, her husband, was under pressure and fighting his own demons. He was also far away. It is hard to be there for someone if that someone isn't there. It is also hard to draw strength from someone how isn't there. She almost lost her husband and the father of her children. She must have been a very strong woman to be able to deal with all of this on her own.Aaron Eckhart plays first officer Jeffrey Skiles, who copiloted the plane. His outrage and disbelief at the way the investigation was handled will resonate in many who are watching the movie.Final ThoughtsOverall Sully - Miracle on the Hudson is an extraordinary and powerful movie. The courage of the captain and his crew are awe inspiring. It is easy to forget that this is a story about real people. The passengers, the crew, the rescue people, the guys in the control centre in the radio tower at the airport. The movie makes them real to the viewer.Saving 155 lives is a miracle. It was made possible by many people. One of them is Sully.",Sully

342,anne-m-hudson,What is a hero?,9,26 October 2016,"In Sully we get another fine example of director Clint Eastwood's interest in showing the human side of a hero. The main character is ""Sully"" Sullenberg, the pilot who lands his plane in the Hudson River in the middle of January and has all 155 people aboard survive. Is he a smart, seasoned professional who is just doing his job? Or is he a hero? Are the people deemed heroes so called because other people put that label on them? Tom Hanks gives a compelling performance as the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. Sully is a low-key, low-blood pressure kind of guy with a natural aversion to the hoopla the ""miracle on the Hudson"" attracts. Just as Sully credits his entire crew for the success of the emergency landing, the entire cast in this film is strong and works together to bring this movie home.",Sully

BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT!,8,27 October 2016,"8/10 Sully based on 'The Miracle at Hudson' is itself no less than an miracle of a film.Guided by excellent direction from Clint Eastwood and immaculately performed by Tom Hanks, the man who makes you believe that he was in fact in Sully himself. The plot follows the true story of pilot Sully co-pilot Jeff and 153 passengers who survived without a scratch on an A320 which landed on icy Lake Hudson on January 15 2009. And also the intricately detailed aftermath that ensued.The narrative is non-linear yet relentless with a slick pace. Sully does not overstay either with a run-time of about 1 hour 40.minutes or so.A true hero story which deserved retelling and Sully does total justice to it.",Sully
344,bryanjacobs-01667,Incredible look at a hero's moment of valor.,7,24 December 2018,"By now everyone reading this review would be somewhat aware of the Miracle on the Hudson. This film is based on the hero of that incident- the Captain Sullenberg. Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It just seemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance the character development of Sully himself rather than to bring a different perspective to the story.",Sully
345,patbiggam,Tom Hanks movies always worth viewing,7,13 May 2020,"I knew little else about this drama than that this pilot landed a fully loaded commercial airliner in the drink with no fatalities. I had to know the story behind the headlines and knew the combo of Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks would not disappoint. It was very interesting to see the actual drama played out in detail which included the main characters and also some of the passengers. Heartening to know there are great aircraft pilots out there with the experience to adequately handle the unexpected. In an unpredictable world, that's a great comfort.",Sully
346,Manton29,Eastwood lands the plane,7,4 September 2016,"An intelligently unfolded drama that makes good use of multiple flashbacks and internal visions to bring the audience not only inside Sully's head but also to really 'feel' the emergency landing rather than just witness it, without disturbing the flow of the film. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart give solid performances and their portrayals of pilot and co pilot respective are compelling and likable. Laura Linney is good but doesn't have much of a part. After that it's just a handful of featured passengers, who are a little predictable but not problematically so, and the investigation team, who come across right off as having an agenda to scapegoat Sully - needed for drama, otherwise you don't really have a film - based on fact or not I can not say. The big event is very well portrayed, and seen from multiple perspectives several times via flashbacks. CGI was occasionally a little obvious but I watched on an IMAX screen, the largest in the world, so possibly that exacerbated the issue. I don't recommend seeing it on the IMAX - too many close ups of cast which felt weird plus I perceived a kind of jerkiness in movement at times as if frame rate was off for the giant screen - no idea what caused this or even quite how to describe it, but it was distracting. IMAX was great for the flight scenes and that's it. Good job Eastwood and co. 7.5.",Sully
347,czsme,Slooo Start,6,18 September 2018,"Didn't get interesting until 46 minutes had elapsed. Then it really began to roll. Questionable sequencing. The real drama was unexpected. C'mon, Clint: you can do better!",Sully
348,filmaniacist,Great film!,7,20 December 2016,"Director Clint Eastwood paired up with writer Tom Komarnicki (and cinematographer Tom Stern) and created a film worth watching. The cinematography is amazing, firstly we see close ups of a shy and calm Tom Hanks (portraying Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger) and the feelings arising at moments, the self-doubt but yet confidence of Mr. Sullenberger, and secondly, the airplane scenes with the highest attraction and convincing the audience that it really happened.Although there's no question about whether Tom Hanks performed or not, you're never really disappointed in his acting and he added a star or two on my rating. What did disappoint me was the shallow and 'unnecessary' tension between the investigators and the pilots (Aaron Eckhart portrayed co-pilot Jeff Skiles). Why were they so upset with them? They saved the lives of 155 passengers, successfully landing on the Hudson River, and the plot was whether they could have managed to land on the runways of La Guardia or Teterboro. Instead they're questioning the probability of landing on 'natural place for planes' and shows simulations that everyone know is not the same as reality. I understand it's a film portraying part of a man's life and the incident as full, but somehow the tension wasn't attractive enough to convince me it's a higher rate than 7 out of 10 movie. What was compelling though, was every scene with a plane captured the essence of the story. IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Everything was 100% believable. The landing on the river, the crashing into buildings etc., everything was done with great cinematography and VFX. There was never really a moment where you went ""That didn't seem real at all"" because everything was captivating and executed perfectly. For that and the actors performance, it's definitely worth watching.",Sully

350,nyiri-timea,Great,8,29 November 2016,"First of all, I want to say that this is a great movie with great acting - and not just from Tom Hanks, but from everyone. The film was interesting and although I knew what was going to happen, it still made me anxious. Most part of the movie was like watching the plane crash documentary series on National Geographic, but with much nicer looking people and an inside view about the actions. And that is a really good thing. The only thing I had a problem with was the first part of the film, the first half hour. I cannot understand why they did it like that. It wasn't a problem for me that they didn't start with the flight and the landing on Hudson, I think it was a great move, but I felt they couldn't make that first 30 minutes interesting, the scenes were good in that first 30 minutes, but it may needed some more editing. Other than that great movie and I definitely think I'm going to watch it again - maybe the first part will get better for the second time :)",Sully

True, you know the ending, but our overzealous media most of the time overlooks the human element of a story. I am so glad Clint Eastwood, and Tom Hanks, and Aaron Eckhart gave us insight into just how difficult it was to make those crucial decisions that were made that day. Of course the whole cast added to the story in their own way. The special effects are top notch, and I am surprised that the Academy ignored a truly great story this year. Too busy being afraid of the PC police I guess. To which I say, Pffft! This is great to watch, even on disc, which I still do from time to time.

Always some agency trying to capitalize on someone's judgment, even if heroic.I highly recommend this masterpiece of film making and a bit of a history lesson here and something positive for New York City, since 9/11. At just over an hour an a half in length, it makes for a perfect night out at the movies.

353,boclani,Could have been something,1,23 November 2016,"SULLY, directed by Clint Eastwood is a true story made into a film surrounding Captain Chelsey Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his first officer (Aaron Eckhart) who save 155 passengers by landing their plane on the Hudson River, and also focuses on the aftermath they debate whether the plane could fly a little further and land safely on land without putting anyone in danger. I don't remember a thing from 15th of January 2009. And with all the great reviews of this retelling I was hoping to learn and be entertained while doing so. Which I was, kinda?When they were doing the hearings at the end of the film to see if it was possible to land safely on land as I briefly mentioned before, was where I had the most fun. And has a lot of suspense. Including the music playing, and all of these aspects made me really excited and worried at the same time for these people, the message at the end was really nice as well.Eastwood's movies are very colourless as shown in J.Edgar. It made that movie very un interesting and boring and kind of hurt my eyes after watching it for a while, and I have never finished watching the movie. Sully isn't half as bad in colour choices as J. Edgar and actually helps the movie to give it more realism with the darker shades and tones.The film is spoken all in a quiet tone, sometimes hard to understand, and doesn't give the movie much personality. But makes the film calming at times, which I liked. There are no scenes of people changing emphasis in speech, like yelling, having different speech types, (I guess), I find these breaking moments really important and makes the characters more fascinating.Eckhart was an interesting character, and looked like he had more fun making this movie.The wife was there to give us another reason to love Sully and shows us he has a family, but she just tags along. She makes some really stupid decisions.Tom Hanks plays a suppressed everyday hero, and it was comforting being around him and Hanks gives the character a little bit more of a personal element to Sully, but not really an emotional side, or really a heroic side. He doesn't believe in himself and never takes a second to realise he did such a great thing. Because the media is everywhere he goes assessing him, recording his every move. He never wanted this life, so he thinks he made a bad decision in a way, there are bigger reasons he thought it was a bad decision but I won't spoil anything. And by this character he plays, Hanks feels very contained in this movie, I just wanted him to change his tone, spit out his words faster. Something. But never does.There are scenes in the movie where Sully dreams up scenarios because he is, in a way, going crazy.The same dream is shown at least twice in the movie that I can remember, the exact same crashing dream and landing scene. The scene in the second act of the movie where the plane is landed on the water is shown randomly after Sully falls into a dream at a pub. Not 100% sure, but it was something like that. All I remember is that it felt really out of place, when in the third act of the movie when he listens to the audio file of the event in a court hearing, the audio recorded in the plane shows us the exact same visual scene and in a better context, it made sense for it to be there!There is really too many cuts from the past to the present to even more in the past. Once you get invested in one time period it jumps to a different one, and then when you like that time period, it jumps again. It would be a lot more convincing if it told it in a chronological order, except for the land itself. It was smart having it at the end. So the mixture of flashbacks and flash forwards in this movie didn't really work and was kind of jumbled throughout the movie. The movie lacks from the placing choices and ultimately made the rest of the flashbacks a little useless and annoying as it took us away from the personal story of Sully we were following.Although at times was entertained, mostly in the third act, the entertainment value wasn't all there. And even though I enjoyed the movie, I'm not too sure if it should have been made into a movie in the first place. It was a little hard to make a story around the material Eastwood picked, because as it said in the real life and the synopsis of the film that all passengers survived, so it's not really a heart pounding when a person starts drifting away from the plane, when Sully said at the start of the movie that everyone is living. So unless you have amnesia these scenes won't be as frightening and thrilling as it could've been.I enjoyed Sully and it had my whole family awed by the ending still days later after coming back from the cinema, in a positive way. This is a quiet movie, with good performances, with some great scenes that goes well with the soundtrack. The movie brings up questions that were intended to be unanswered. So is this movie good? Definitely. Is this movie great? Kinda. Is it a masterpiece? Not in my eyes. Too many faults and missed opportunities for me to really call it a great movie, but I enjoyed it, and I think you will too.Overall : B-",Sully
354,heat9120,Should have stuck more to the real story,5,1 February 2017,"The crash/rescue scenes were very moving, but the rest of the film wasted too much time on repetitive depictions of Sully's feelings in the aftermath (just one scene would have been enough to tell us that he's uncomfortable with the attention) and the completely made-up witch hunt by the authorities.There was a lot of actual heroism among the passengers, and it would have been much better to depict that. One young man, for example, went back down the aisle to help the woman with a baby, and he pretty much carried them to the exit when she fainted in his arms. Plus Laura Linney was utterly wasted as Sully's wife. She's far too good an actress to just perform endless variations of ""Oh my darling, you did everything you could.""",Sully

As anyone who's read a NTSB report would tell you one of their big things is analyzing the human performance of the crew as a team during the event which made the Airbus reenactments especially laughable as would the need for the crew to have to point out the human factor to investigators in the first place.One thing i would give them though was the examination of the likely results if he had gone for one of the airports rather than ditching.

A wonderful supporting role performance, perhaps co-star is a better description, was given by Aaron Eckhart as Sully's co-pilot Jeff Skiles. Excellent heroics in ""Sully"" were directed by Clint Eastwood and it is probably his best movie; Oscar nominations all around will be well deserved.

362,narendrarastogi,Well crafted 5700 Seconds (from 208 sec),7,10 September 2016,"Sully is best example of how a great director(Eastwood) can make a great movie (definitely not his best) with just one line or 208 sec story. Sully is a movie which glorifies the real time effort of a real life hero who saved every one on the flight and still keeps his humanity intact. The best part of the direction was that director teases you with the accident which could have happened without showing the real landing on Hudson river till last.(he shows 3 different scenario of landing through Sully's eyes.) Tom hanks was perfect in every frame( After 15 year, Oscar nomination is on the way) and i couldn't have imagined anyone else for this role. he was pitch perfect and showed how confident captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger was, but at the same time uncertain of his own doing that if he was the real danger to life of people on the plane. I was immensely impressed by the other hero of the movie, Editing and Cinematography. it was great to see how flashbacks and imagination was used to move story forward. The only disappointment of the movie was one dimensional role of a talented actress Laura Linney and how she was given only one object to show her emotions and how she was just reduced as a weeping wife. Aaron Eckhart was good and provided some much needed comic relief. On the whole it was a satisfying journey, journey which might be the most important journey of those 155 passengers and crew of their life. I recommend everyone at least give it a try.",Sully
363,Smokey_T,"A better recent Eastwood, but still (typically) flawed.",7,22 February 2017,"Eastwood's more recent films have often left me wondering if he has been approaching, or even reached, the logical end of what has been a lengthy career. I have often considered him one of my favorite directors. While his films are sometimes and somewhat imperfect, perhaps self-indulgent, they are usually interesting, and possess a particularly unique quality.I can recall this film being criticised for it's re-showing the last few minutes of the flight. In another film this might provide greater insight, or reveal a new dimension to the event, perhaps a twist of some sort. In Sully this appears to both serve as a departure from the rather pedestrian events before and after the landing, keeping the viewer interested, and also to reinforce that this was an event that was experienced by many New Yorkers. Perhaps reinforcing to Americans that this was a significant national event. Eastwood is certainly no stranger to infecting his films with his personal ideologies, and I suspect this film yet another example of the director's politics at work. This was most apparent in the decision to depart in corny and dramatic fashion from the truth of events following the event.Such significant distortions in a film pretending to be factual and biographic should come as no surprise to viewers familiar with the liberties taken in Eastwood's other biopics, particularly American Sniper. I can only attribute these unnecessary deviations from an honest portrayal of events and characters to the favorite tricks of a beguiling, but sometimes clumsy storyteller/myth-maker, if not the direct effect of a director whose political axe requires grinding with each and every film. Be that grievance one with big government, or the crippled that can't access his restaurant, or his love affair with war heroes that are confirmed notorious bullshitters with the moral fiber a gnat.Like most of Eastwood's films this is a quality product, it is dry, but well filmed, and remains engaging. It is unfortunate that while his films appear so convincingly authoritative, and grounded within the real, they are persistently undermined by their creator's decision to be creative or dishonest regarding the characters and narrative.7/10",Sully

Wow! Knowing that he had so much more to endure after the fact was absolutely fascinating. Again incredible kudos to Clint Eastwood for another amazing film. The realism and authenticity of virtually every frame was awe inspiring. I felt like I was there for the original experience.

365,jevonlondoner-15682,Tom Hanks is just amazing!,6,12 January 2017,"Sully is a true story about Chesley Sullenburger who in January 2009, landed an airplane on the Hudson River in America. Tom Hanks as Sully (Sullenburger) was just an amazing pick. He really makes the audience feel what actually happened that day. Although the film was good, their were some problems throughout the movie.Firstly, their isn't as much action as the trailer proposes. The movie starts with the audience being told what happened, then we see the plane crash. But the crash is only about 4-5 minutes long. And that scene is virtually the only scene with action. Also, everyone knows in advance that everyone on the plane survives so they shouldn't have used so much of the film time on that.The film is only 90 minutes long and I can understand quite well why. Clint Eastwood had nothing else to add to it. The acting of Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are very good and emotional but that's really the only thing that worth the while. The film ends before it even begins. I think that the film shouldn't have ended where it did. Their should have been more after the court case like Sully calling his family to tell them what happened, or something else. But the way they ended it on a a joke wasn't very well prepared or done.To conclude, you can watch this film as its not too bad, I still enjoyed it partially, but don't be too hyped for it or you'll be very, very disappointed.",Sully
366,burkey_b,Like watching paint dry.,4,21 January 2017,"There could possibly be two miracles in this film, first will be the miracle on the Hudson and the second will be your ability to watch it all the way to the end. What a boring film, not to take away from Sully's amazing feat but this would have been much more suited to a short 10min film than a feature. A film filled with padding to stretch it to feature length. Let's watch Sully go for a jog, let's watch Sully sit in a hotel room and think, let's watch Sully sit in a bar. The fact that you watch the landing in full twice really shows the amount of scraping necessary to get it over the line. Tedious.",Sully

368,ziga321,Beautifully crafted film,8,9 September 2016,"==THIS REVIEW HERE MIGHT CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS. VIEWER DISCRETION IS THEREFOR ADVICED==If you live in the west you probably already heared of this story. Technically speaking 'some' plane make their way through a flock of birds and with both engines hit and unworking, the pilot still managed to make their landing on the river Hudson and all the passenger had been saved. However, hidden to the public eyes there was also a back-story to it. Immidiatelly after the crash there was a federal investigation going on, where investigators run simulation programs to get their point proved. The point was that the pilot could get back to the airport, without putting their passenger on danger by landing on the river. However as we see through the end of the film, the investigators used this programs in the really dirty way, the one that gets their points prooven in the way that only technically speaking is possible, but humanly speaking totally impossible. For instance will the pilot in normal situations really turns around and drive the plane back to the ""base"" the same seconds as the birds hit the engine?, as are things presented in the simulations as they ran Wouldn't he first try to run the engines and turned them on, only to realize in shock that the both engines have stopped working, and he is unable to turn them on, which is a really rare case I believe. Or wouldn't he make a call to the airport, checking that its free, for not hitting the other plane, that it's currently rising., and others..The translation of this film in my country is 'Miracle on the river Hudson', which I think is more to the point. As you watch this film you start to believe that is nothing more then a miracle. Or as Sully(Tom Hanks) puts it, when he left with his co-pilot the court, it goes something like that: ""I believe that we get it through very well. But we actually put it through better."" Clint Eastwoodis without a doubt a very respectable director and very respectable to all the characters involved. However this story also gets true to the truth as is humanly possible. There is no big bangs, no big unnecessary explosions, as long as they don't put anything to the Original story. For instance did you notice that when Sully(Tom Hanks) imagined a building hit by an airplane is the same that the women hit during running the second simulations run. You could imagine what Could happen if he listened to flight controllers and not, acted on his own, as he did.Technically speaking this is a beautiful crafted film. however I still have some negative points. Tom Hanks for instance could be in my eyes more livable. The film is also crafted with a dark and depressing tone to it, the darkness in this film is more moderated, but in my eyes could be made more livable. All in all, beautifully crafted film, which puts to the real story, answering some answers that might be risen.",Sully
369,sleeplessdave_2000,Relive The Miracle on the Hudson,9,11 September 2016,"There aren't many feel-good stories in the world in which we live. It's a sad fact of modern life that most of the news we hear is bad, and even events that can be considered triumphs by some have a downside for another group. In January 2009, America got an honest- to-God miracle, and an authentic hero. No qualifications, no asterisk, nothing but one of the most amazing stories in aviation history put the right man in the right cockpit to save 155 lives in a spectacularly-executed water landing of a passenger jet on the Hudson River. Over seven years later, the event dubbed ""The Miracle on the Hudson"" is a feature film helmed by director Clint Eastwood with Tom Hanks portraying the man in the pilot's seat for the incredible hair-raising flight: Captain Sully Sullenberger.US Airways Flight 1549 was supposed to be just another routine run from NYC's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, NC and then on to Seattle. Just another flight in Sully's 42-year career behind the stick of various aircraft. Less than three minutes into the flight, the plane was hit by a flock of Canadian Geese that completely destroyed both engines and essentially turning the Airbus into a glider. If you're unfamiliar with the geography of the NYC area, the Hudson River separates NYC from the Newark, NJ area. It's one of the most densely populated areas on earth. Sully was given clearance from both LaGuardia and New Jersey's Teterboro airport to make an emergency landing, but he determined that the only course open to him was to attempt a water landing on the Hudson. The wind chill that day was -5 degrees Fahrenheit. The water temperature in the thirties. Any water landing that put passengers in the water for an extended period of time would have resulted in extensive casualties. Skillfully landing the plane and joining the crew in evacuating the passengers onto the wings and inflatable emergency ramps (Sully himself was the last person off the plane, only after making two additional sweeps looking for stragglers), Sully was met by lightning fast response from NYC's ferries, NYPD, Coast Guard, and a host of emergency responders. There were a few injuries, only two of which required overnight hospital stays, but not a soul was lost. The temptation in Sully would be to try to over-glamorize something that was already astonishing as is or make Capt. Sullenberger into something more than the quiet, reserved, professional, dignified man he is. The triumph of the film, to me, is that the star of this film is the crash. Hanks' portrayal of Sully is true to what I've seen of the man in interviews. He's not glamorous or flashy. He's a professional pilot who took the lives of his passengers very safely. He's humble and soft-spoken; not the sort of things that make up a Hollywood star. But, I think, that's why everyone identified with Sullenberger and hailed him: he was one of us. Yes, his job was more high-profile than those of us sitting in cubicles, but to him, this was him doing his job. Eastwood and Hanks give you pieces of the flight from the very beginning of the film, but it's not until the finale that you see the entirety of it from the viewpoint of passengers, crew, ground control, and bystanders. Sully is a brief film at 90 minutes; it tells its story tightly, with enough human angles to lend perspective. The narrative device used to drive the crash is something I was unaware of, the tremendous pressure exerted on Sully and First Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) by US Airways and the NTSB, claiming Sully could have easily made it back to New York or New Jersey and the water landing had been unnecessary.I viewed the film on the 15th anniversary of 9/11, and that context needs to be kept in mind in watching the movie. This occurred just over seven years after the attacks on the World Trade Center, and what could have been more devastating than another passenger plane, for whatever reason, hitting a populated area in that same city. Eastwood has received some criticism for shots of planes crashing into buildings as Sully replays the events over the Hudson, questioning himself and his actions, but how could he not be thinking of that worst case scenario? Those were the stakes, you had densely populated metropolitan areas to each side and the Hudson River. He makes the water landing wrong, at best, he suffers significant passenger casualties. He gambles on either side of the Hudson going for an airport, and he may end up plowing another passenger jet into the New York skyline. It's difficult to even imagine stakes that could have been higher.Clint Eastwood, at age 86, has made one of his best films, lending just the right touch to a story that needed little embellishment. Tom Hanks brings the same subtle strength and realism to his portrayal of Captain Sullenberger, and Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn, among others, round out a strong ensemble. This is really the first big picture of the fall and it delivers in every way, and I strongly recommend people get out and see just what a miracle this truly was.",Sully
370,ypjoshi,SULLY : Justice to The Highest Duty,9,14 September 2016,"He had done it before and he had done it a few more times after that.And every time he made it a point to not miss the target . Taking the apprehension out of the head of the viewer,laying it down nice n easy, stripping it to its purest form and then delivering the final dose with dexterity; Clint Eastwood has done it once again. The ability to lift a viewer's soul from the seat and placing it in the story delivering an out of body experience is the skill very few possess.Considering Mr.Eastwood's interest and success,particularly of late, in making movies based on true events, Sully was looked forward to pretty anticipatedly in the erudite factions of the fraternity and audience.So when you have such agenda on your hands and stakes are high, obviously, you need the perfect tools to realize the vision.First, Tom Hanks. One of the very few actors who not only understand their role but also are able to share the vision of the director in the movie making process (I guess that's what makes him a very successful producer as well). Speaking a bit about Tom. Over the course of his career, he has taken me, like the countless others, on a roller coaster ride of the modern cinema and has added many dimensions to movie watching. For me, he has given the confidence to let go of fear, doubt, and disbelief regarding whether the actors are doing justice to what exactly director had in mind, whenever he's on screen.Now, about the movie. It paces nicely giving out the necessary realistic vibes. Hanks, in all senses literal and figurative, is the captain here.He handles the build-up and unraveling of a small but well-rounded web perfectly.I see no one else than Tom playing the audacious Ct. Chesley Sullenberger. Now since it's all happened and wrote upon it's not a spoiler to say that it's about a 'plane landing in the river'. In the process of achieving a singular class in the making, the crux of this event is shown in three different perspectives, each going on and adding the much-required dimension to the viewer's understanding of the scenario. You just have to experience the joy of putting those perspectives together to form the whole of the event. Also, in an excellent display of 'shot- making', Eastwood, builds the protagonist's drama of the story with a forehand and points out potholes in the judiciary system in a cautious backhand.And all this fitted cozily in 95 minutes of running time, is a hats-off effort from the team. Take a bow. Also, Aaron Eckhart is worth mentioning here, as he plays perfect Watson to Hank's Holmes. Rest of the cast does just about enough not to get noticed for any wrong reasons, Barring Anna Gunn. To whom, by the way, you have already given a fair share of loathing in Breaking Bad (:P) and you won't be seen making friends with her here either.I was wondering, before, that why the movie was being made in IMAX, since it did not have the blockbuster visual element to it , only to learn that there's that one little step taken,very much necessary to depict a plummeting A320 from a spectacular New-York skyline in the backdrop to the fluvial water body of the Hudson. It does take you from eliciting awe to dropping jaw. It's worth it. Good call Blondie. And since on the topic, a worthy mention here for cinematographer Tom Stern,Who's been Clint's sidekick in the camera department in many of his previous directorial ventures, for crafting some IMAX worthy sequences and putting the peripheral vision of the viewer to a good use.Since Interstellar broke the stereotypes of background scores by using it generously, audaciously, and successfully, I make it a point to take notice the use (over/under) of background score in a film. No follies here as well, as Sully is punctuated with background score only when necessary, giving enough scope for the viewer to let the reality of the events unfolding on screen, sink in..Deep.The body-binding spell cast by the powerful duo of cinematic wizards will take quite some time to wear off. In all regards of film- making, justice is served. Bon appetit.",Sully

Ooops, Spoiler alert)This movie documents the aftermath of the ""landing"" more than the actual event itself and it doesn't really do much of a job at that. The intentions are clearly to take you through the emotions and strain placed upon the captain in the aftermath of the event.Simply put, there just isn't enough substance to really create a story line out of this. The most similar comparison of such a story line would be the movie; Flight, with Denzel Washington. That does a far better job of what was intended here. As an avid movie enthusiast, I'm confident they could have done a better job here, but to me that goes without saying, especially when given a cowardly run time of 136 minutes.",Sully
376,val-29,OK at Best,6,3 September 2017,"Having been interested in air crash investigations I have seen many documentaries on the subject. One thing that rings true is the professionalism and thoroughness of investigations by the NTSB who's sole aim is to establish the cause of the accident and advise any safety recommendations that may arise. They are not their to judge and certainly do not hold hearings until all obtainable facts are at their fingertips. When this film came out I was waiting to see it with baited breath. Unfortunately I found it disappointing. It chopped backwards and forwards in time which I accept is a story telling technique but I think it was a little overboard BUT accept that that is a personal issue. Where I have a big problem is the portrayal of the NTSB who came across as a ""Gestapo"" type organisation intent on bringing Sully down. This is not a fair representation of the NTSB and I don't think it was necessary to sell the film. Please watch the many good documentaries on Air crash investigations, such as the ""Mayday"" series - available on ""youtube"". The one on this particular incident will show you what I mean. Enough said !!",Sully

With Biopics as a whole been very difficult to show on the big screen, this film not only tells the story from sully's POV, but we also see a slight PoV from his wife. In certain aspects through, you are drawn into the film that much that you feel that you are watching a documentary rather then a factious/based on a true story film. The action within the film is limited in a sense that the whole film centres around the aftermath of the events in question, rather then building up to what actually happens, which is a fantastic way of displaying it to an audience.

While it includes the details of the actual event in great detail the story mainly focuses on what transpired after the incredible water landing on the Hudson. This is a little known part of the story that was not reported on by the mass media. It reveals the post event ordeals that Sully and his co-pilot were put through. Tom Hanks portrayal of Sully is nothing short of amazing. One of his best performances that I've seen in years. I also happen to think that his overlooked performance in ""Bridge of Spy's"" was nothing short of a travesty. The direction of Sully is suburb. Clint Eastwood blends the actual events, flashbacks into Sully's earlier days and the aftermath into a seamless heroic tale. I highly recommend this movie. The world is short on hero's these days.

380,hollywoodpsychic,Clint Eastwood's Shortest Directorial Work is Also His Most Padded,4,27 November 2016,"Clint Eastwood rarely makes a movie shorter than 2 hours in length. Even Blood Work (2002), one of his shortest movies (and perhaps his worst film as director), clocks in at 110 minutes. So it's especially notable that his 2016 film Sully is by far his shortest at just 96 minutes.It's also insufferably padded to reach even that meager length.Ostensibly, the story concerns the real life drama behind ""The Miracle on The Hudson"", a true life event from 2009 whereby airline pilot Chesley Sullenberger saved the lives of 155 passengers and crew when he successfully landed his plane on the Hudson River after hitting a flock of geese and losing both engines shortly after takeoff. Tom Hanks plays the titular hero Sully well enough, with bleached white hair and mustache, but the key phrase of this paragraph is ""real life drama"", and in that the film is sorely lacking.Oh, sure... the procedural scenes of the plane accident and its miraculous landing and subsequent rescue of all passengers and crew is real enough, if you can forgive the poor CGI. And if you like procedural drama (as I do), those scenes are pretty riveting as well. But Eastwood and screenwriter Todd Komarnicki know that you already know that story, and they've deigned to focus the bulk of the movie on a purely fictional and wholly inaccurate NTSB investigation that never feels genuine, plausible or entertaining.The central drama of the film therefore involves a ridiculous assertion that the investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board just have it out for poor pilot Sully and are determined to fault him for endangering the lives of everyone on board. The villains helming the investigation smirk and sneer their way through scene after implausible scene, but none of it really happened. It's all so distasteful and badly conceived. An early line in the film implies that they're under considerable pressure from the airline and insurance companies, but mostly their behavior is to be taken at face value, and it just doesn't work. And though this plot (the main plot, I'd like to reiterate) is tedious and unwelcome, Eastwood and Komarnicki offer a number of excruciating bad scenes to suggest that the NTSB may be right, including far too many scenes of Sully waking up from PTSD-induced nightmares and fantasies of the plane crashing into the city, as well as scenes where he questions his actions to his lap dog co-pilot (Aaron Eckhart).But even this empty, manufactured main plot (and its many supporting scenes of Sully questioning his worth as a pilot) only pads the film so much. In order to hit the 90 minute mark, the filmmakers become mired in uninteresting minutiae about all manner of supporting characters. The audience is asked to endure countless scenes in which Sully speaks with his wife (played here by Laura Linney, in a totally wasted non-role of a character) by telephone. They talk about nothing even remotely interesting and nothing that propels the story or the drama. It's painful and dull and insulting. Unless your idea of riveting drama is two people talking on the phone about bills and house payments and how it sure would be nice if this investigation would be over already, then perhaps you'll enjoy Sully. But, I can assure you that's not my idea of good storytelling and I found the whole wife subplot unnecessary and distracting.There are also a number of scenes involving passengers and hotel employees and regular New Yorkers, and they all get about as much to work with in terms of quality. There's the bartender (Michael Rapaport, again completely wasted) who tells Sully how he named a drink after him, and the makeup girl (Molly Bernard) who kisses Sully for her mom, and the passenger with a baby (Autumn Reeser) and the passenger who gets separated from his family (Sam Huntington) - But none of their stories are compelling because we either already know that everyone survives or we just don't care about such obvious padding in scenes that have little to do with the central story. They're the kinds of roles that would be cut out of most films because they drag the movie down, but in the case of Sully, they are given the unenviable task of simply killing time.And don't get me started on the various flashbacks of Sully flying. (Here he is learning to fly as a boy! Now he's in the Air Force!)Sully is a disappointment, to be sure, but Eastwood and Hanks try to make the best of the dreadful screenplay and almost make you think you're watching something important. And the bloated supporting cast of struggling or barely recognizable actors (that had to be employed in order to pad out the many, unnecessary characters) are actually mostly pretty good. Or, at least the ones who can hide their excitement at working in a scene opposite Tom Hanks or getting direction from Clint Eastwood are good - Some are worse at that than the rest, sadly.As real life dramas go, this one falls way short, mostly due to the obvious padding that only serves to ruin the good stuff.The real Chesley Sullenberger deserves better.",Sully

383,ken-35957,Sully - Film meaning specialist review,9,8 September 2016,"Film Meaning Specialists focus on ""meaning"" or the ""moral in the story"". Good films typically have high levels of meaning for audiences. Our job is to extract that meaning out so you get as much value from watching a film as possible.We identified 11 core meanings within Sully. Some messages are more significant than others, but all of them worth commenting on.** Spoiler Alert: Film meanings require a description of the plot and film outcomes to contextualise. If you want to be surprised by a film, read this after a film. If you want to be enlightened by a film, read it before watching it. **Message #1: Distraction is dangerousAt the start of the film, Sully is jogging, his mind full of thoughts and concerns. He is almost killed (run over) by a cab (taxi) driver. He is unharmed, but it could have been a serious accident. In ""Me Before You"", the central character crossed the road distracted and was hit by a motorcycle. He ended up disabled and flew to Europe to commit assisted suicide. Moral: When you are distracted you are in danger. Pay attention.Message #2: Sensational stories create overwhelming media attentionSully landing safely on water with none of the 155 in the plane dying was unheard of. In fact, before the landing, it's obvious that water landings mean death to everyone on the plane. The sensational nature of this story creates media attention that is overwhelming for Sully and his family. The degree of attention increases as time progresses. Moral: Once in the media spotlight for something significantly newsworthy, expect the spotlight to brighten to overwhelming levels.Message 3: Keep going and maintain focusSully has a flashback to when he was young. He receives sage advice, ""Never forget that no matter what is happening fly the air plane."" Moral: No matter how problematic things get, keep focus on what you are doing, and keep going. Don't panic, get distracted or give up. Don't stop. Keep going.Message 4: Life's work at risk from 1 actionIf Sully was investigated and found negligent, it would mean that his consulting business and his profession as a pilot would be over. Not only that he would lose his pension and be fired immediately. Moral: Sometimes we face events that could destroy our future. See what happens. It may not be as bad as you think.Message 5: Be committedSully was the last off the plane, painstakingly checking that everyone was safely evacuated. Moral: Commitment is doing your job from the start to the finish without gaps in between.Message 6: Are all 155 accounted for?Sully needed to know all 155 were safe as survivors were taken by multiple ferries to multiple locations. Moral: Know what you are accountable for.Message 7: Last one on the rescue boatSully was the last one on the rescue boat due to his commitment (Message 5) and accountability (Message 6). Moral: When you are a leader commitment and accountability are how you show leadership.Message 8: When facing death, the 1st call is to familyWhen people thought they were going to die they reached out to their families and loved ones. They didn't call their work and say they may not be in tomorrow. Moral: What really matters becomes obvious in times of crisis but is often ignored in good times. Reach out and let the ones you love know them before a crisis. Message 9: Question the evidenceA brilliant message was how Sully refuted ""evidence"" that if left unchallenged would have seen his life fall to pieces (Message 4). He questioned the evidence, found it lacking for numerous reasons and created reasonable doubt. His attack on the validity of the evidence saved his career. Moral: When people use evidence against you, refute it based on logic, fairness and reasonableness.Message 10: Exert control: I need a quick breakSully exerted control. In a room full of what looked to be 100 people where he was being questioned in an adversarial way. He said, ""I need a quick break"" and left the room with his copilot. He was letting the gravity and weight of the refuted evidence impact the people judging him. It was a masterful stroke of negotiating. Moral: In an adversarial encounter find a way to take control and slow down or stop the attacking side's momentum.Message 11: Share creditAt the end of the film Sully is found to have acted in with the highest possible skills levels. A previously adversarial opponent, becomes a supporter and praises Sully as the only reason that the 155 people lived. Sully refutes that and shares all the credit with his co-pilot, the stewardesses, the crew, the many rescuers and more. Moral: Victory, nor defeat, is never ours alone. Many people are involved.

It looks like some people did not like this movie at all but I did. I was left with a good feeling and restored faith in mankind. Clint Eastwood did a great job in his direction of this flick. The ""dream state"" scenes were worked into the story line very, very well and wasn't hard to follow as it did not distract from the story but instead drew me more into the story. I know some people dispute the interrogation of the NTSB and government agencies and whether it happened exactly like the movie shows or not it is very true that the people in power do like to put you on the spot and play devil's advocate just like this movie shows. It also does a good job of how the title ""Hero"" can be more troublesome for some than others. Tom Hanks does a great job as Sully as he was able to convey the emotional struggles somebody who has gone through this might endure. His facial expressions were powerful as was that of Aaron Eckhart's Jeff Skiles. I know people didn't appreciate the side story of Sully's family because they felt it was shallow but that was not the plot or story line. The movie touched on that but did not dwell on it so it did not take away from the main theme of the movie. Bravo Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart but mostly Bravo for Capt. Sully and first officer Skiles for their heroics on that cold winter day in NYC.

Tom Hanks does a subtle and masterful job of bringing you into the pilot's, Sullenberger,character, and Jeff Skiles performs as well in the lesser role of co-pilot. The portrayal of the spouse, Lorraine,was competent, but the script set up a role that lacked the fiber I can recall in the real person. The NTSB protagonist was well done by Michael Porter, though the script positioned him as a villain--and my knowledge of these people is that they are boring in their methodical objectivity ( a good thing). My one concern is that this movie positions the NTSB in a position to prove a hypothesis, instead of following the facts methodically, as though they were defending the manufacturer.

Particularly annoying in this effort though, is the use of cheap Extras for the passengers, for additional profits if I could venture a guess. The only thing they got right is the ""Big Bertha from Auschwitz"", chief-stewardess. Her bossiness is unfortunately quite typical in all forms of public service nowadays.The good news is, it avoids the irritating trend of patronizing minorities in general and Blacks in particular. Also, the perennial plastic coffee container with baby lid, or alternatively bottled water, everybody is carrying around at all times, is conspicuously absent. In defense of Tom Hanks and, as a long time observer of body language, he did not appear too happy with what he was told to do.

388,bobizam65,"Not your usual over-dramatised film, but brilliant in it's own way",8,15 September 2016,"Sully is a film about a plane crash in New York (not 9/11)The events of 'The Miracle on the Hudson' occurred about 7 years ago, which is fairly recent (as far as major plane crashes go). This means that, while it was a bit of time ago, almost the entire target audience of the film has some sort of memory of what occurred, considering it was news that spread very quickly across the entire world.Immediately this puts Sully in a bit of a tricky situation. In order to make a good story, there needs to be conflict, but if the events are changed too much, then the audience will be able to tell, which then breaks immersion – something a director wants to avoid at all costs (unless you're shooting Deadpool of course). A film like Saving Private Ryan can take creative liberties with it's story and still seem as though it's based in WW2, but Sully can't do such a thing because then it would just be a film about a plane crash, not specifically the one that occurred in 2009. So the film needs to strike a very fine balance between the accurate depiction of events and an intriguing story – between documentary and drama.Sully gets the first part right, with a very accurate recreation of the crash. Almost all the details are covered excellently, from the conversations with the flight control tower to how many times the crew went through the aircraft to look for remaining passengers. It also helps that the film was based off of the Chesley Sullenberger's book ""The Highest Duty"". Even the sound design is remarkably accurate and especially aircraft sounds which are generally very difficult to record faithfully, and the decision to keep music to a minimum means that the events shown feel raw and unprocessed, as though it was filmed during the actual crash. All this really helps with the immersion during the crash sequences. There was one noticeably oversight though, in one of the shots a poster for The Revenant is visible which is a bit distracting considering The Revenant was released in 2015 and the film is set in 2009. So it's a real shame that despite the efforts that Eastwood made to keep sequences realistic and true to the actual event, the VFX really lets it down. In a few shots it is perfectly fine, and seems completely believable, but there are more than a few shots where it looks like something out of Air Crash Investigations rather than actual footage of a plane in the sky. Most of this is likely caused by a somewhat inaccurate simulation of the slightly different Raleigh scattering present in New York skies, which means that the CGI planes look a bit too shiny and clean – more like a toy model than a real aircraft.Visually, Sully has fairly decent cinematography. The use of IMAX cameras for many sequences adds a subtle intensity to the film that wouldn't normally be present on smaller formats. There are a few questionable shot choices, but overall it complements the way the film was edited and also the restrained use of music. Something that really stood out (in a good way) was the way the crash scene was filmed. Not using a Bourne style camera movement in the (relatively) high intensity scene visibly helps strengthen the captain's point of view (which I won't say, cause spoilers).Now the second, and arguably more important, part is the story and how it was handled. The main problem with it in Sully is that the writers were tasked to create conflict even when there wasn't really much conflict in the first place. It is after all a film about a plane crash and part of the investigation following, there isn't really much of a complication in the story. And the inability to take some creative freedoms in the writing meant that even the little conflict they tried to produce didn't have any tangible stakes – if the 'bad guys' won there wouldn't be much problems for the pilots. Still, the film was edited well enough that there was a coherent flow from each scene to the next, and the choice of editing in a non-linear style meant that the film didn't become too predictable or that information wasn't too easy to find. Despite the film inherently having a weak story, Sully manages to make itself interesting in more than a few ways.Another thing of note is the wonderful acting in the film. Tom Hanks really shows why he is a first-rate actor, giving a completely believable performance as the captain of the flight. Aaron Eckhart also manages to bring to life his character of a younger co-pilot and the two main characters balance each other out wonderfully, giving life to the film. Surprisingly, the extras also seemed to be quite capable. While it was nothing compared to Hank's work, they were good enough in their (small) roles that it wasn't a distracting element.Overall I think Clint Eastwood made the right compromises and managed to balance the accuracy of the event and the narrative of the film – if it was more 'factual' it would have been a dramatized documentary, if it had a stronger story the film would have been less accurate and that would have been quite distracting. Maybe in a few decades if the film was to be remade there could be some more liberties taken with the story, but given the circumstances, Sully is a wonderful, very natural feeling re-enactment of 'The miracle on the Hudson'.8.2/10",Sully
389,katyhun,Uninteresting,1,14 September 2016,"Boring. Very, very dull. Before anyone starts questioning anything, there were advance screenings at the local cinema, that's why I saw it early. Moving on.Who thought making this story into a film was a good idea? An event happened, everyone did their jobs, nothing went wrong. Why all the drama? Even the film just feels like a news story of the week type thing. I didn't know that much about this story so I went in hoping for more insight, but I learnt nothing. I knew going in that the plane crashed into the Hudson and the pilot did a good job. The film offers nothing beyond that.It is competently directed, as expected by Eastwood. I'm a little sick of the colourless visuals, although this wasn't nearly as bland looking as Jersey Boys nor as murky as the awful J Edgar. Hanks just does his usual thing pretty much playing himself in the lead role. There isn't much character development in this film, nor any truly memorable or resonant moments. The film lacks insight into the characters, I feel as if I could have had the same experience just reading a newspaper article based on this event. It's incredibly dry.I thought Flight with Denzel Washington was a very underwhelming film. And this was a bad version of that. Let that sink in for a little. At least there we had the story of him overcoming alcoholism. Eastwood really needs to pick films based on more interesting material, as he did until around 2008. It's pretty surprising to see such lacklustre output after films like Gran Torino, Letters From Iwo Jima, and Changeling.You know they're running low on material when they show the crash twice from the same perspective. I have no clue what Eastwood was going for there. Very strange.I'm sorry this review was so short - I just don't have much to say about this film.",Sully

392,tigurrr,Great movie making still exists.,8,20 March 2019,"Eastwood and Hanks team up to tell a story true to life and without over dramatization in a convincing fashion while building on the foundation of real world heroism. The theme even projects throughout the movie as characters consistently remark on the rarity of ""good news"" stories that have real heroic action involved in this day. Hanks brilliant ability at portraying self reflection as he has so often pulled off in titles like Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan is well presented here.The fact the movie may contain a number of continuity errors, for example Captain Sullenbergers dry pants moments after being waste deep in water are superfluous to the gorgeous story unfolding of a self doubting hero who after all is said and done wants to simply be known for ""doing my job"".Regardless of the motivations of the FAA and Corporate Airline entities involved and how they are portrayed we can all relate to a thematic relevance of an individual under mental siege, being questioned and ultimately pushed with intentions toward making the individual the patsy for the systemic failure of a large organization. The understanding that even the best of pilots cannot see birds from a great distance and in time to react or maneuver a large cumbersome airliner on a dime is well displayed and enacted by Eastwood and Hanks.The final analysis being that veteran experience in decision making saved the lives of 252 individuals and prevented what would have most certainly been one of the worst catastrophes in aviation history.Everyone should watch this movie.",Sully
393,hiteshpcs,A man did his job. But still he has a lot to Survive!,9,13 June 2021,"Clint Eastwood's movie, ""Sully,"" is about a man who is excellent at his job. Specifically, it tells the story of Capt. Chesley Sullenberger and how, on a frigid January afternoon in 2009, he came to land a plane on the Hudson River. And how he deals with the aftermath investigation. The movie is economical and solid, and generally low-key when it's not freaking you out.What's incredible is how the entire movie is made revolving around the 208 seconds from US Airways Flight 1549's takeoff to the instant it flew into a flock of birds that was sucked into both engines, leading to an almost complete loss of thrust, and its miracle landing. This movie engrosses the audience by how it bends reality, rather like plane travel, and how Mr. Eastwood plays with space-time, freezing events, sliding into the past, only to jump back to the now.Here, a few minutes open one man's life, revealing layers of consciousness that, in turn, lay bare that life's moral center, largely involves what happens after Sully (Tom Hanks), his crew, and his passengers were plucked from the river, specifically the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.",Sully

396,stansolomon,Eastwood and Hanks...Perfect Together,10,10 September 2016,"Have to admit: I was prepared to be cynical and critical about this film, mainly because of my past revulsion to Hollywood's usual abysmally-moronic treatment of commercial aviation (example: a computer-generated MD-80 defying the principles of aerodynamics and flying inverted in that awful ""Flight"" !). As a former Contributing Editor for the ORIGINAL ""Airways"" magazine (when it was still run by Founding Editor/Publisher John Wegg), I thought I knew a lot about the topic, as I wrote that magazine's cover feature-story about the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" incident (it was NEVER a crash).After the first 5 minutes I became a TOTAL BELIEVER in this film, as I sat there, mouth agape and eyes tearing up at HOW WELL Director Eastwood, star Tom Hanks, and everyone else created AN EXCELLENT AND COMPLEX FILM. Why ""complex""? Because it is NOT JUST the water-landing story, but also:1. the technical perfection of the film, making the flying sequences and Air Traffic Control sequences spot-on accurate (probably thanks to a lot of technical advisers);2. the courtroom-drama scenario of the NTSB hearings where Sully's and First Officer Skiles's careers could have been destroyed had they been found guilty of making a bad decision, based upon European airplane manufacturer Airbus's self-serving inaccurate computer simulations;3. AND, for this proud Manhattanite, the wonderful portrayal of how the NYC ""first responders"" (especially the crews of the New York Waterways ferries, which were first to reach the floating airliner) reacted to the incident and kept everyone safe.No one has ever questioned Tom Hanks's acting nor Clint Eastwood's directing, but, as far as this reviewer is concerned, their work in this film is not only among their best, but is definitely Oscar-worthy.",Sully

402,LukeTitles,"A very well executed movie, high quality product",8,8 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood comes back to our screens two years after American Sniper to tell us another American story. This time is the true story of the US Airways flight 1549, which, on February 15, 2009, was forced to land in the Hudson River after hitting several birds in the act of taking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport. The movie is centered on the figure of the captain, Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the hero that saved everyone on that plane by taking the decision and then executing a bold water landing. In the movie, we go through the investigation of the accident and the struggles that captain Sully faced during that period. The hero is then haunted by doubts about himself and by the perspective of losing his pension after 40 years of service. Telling a true story on screen is always tricky, but Sully delivers with power every emotion, overcoming the fact that the viewer already knows the outcome of the story. I've enjoyed the movie, I felt a wide spectrum of emotions and it feels authentic. The actors are amazing and very well directed, the dialogues are powerful, and Aaron Eckhart should be forced to keep that glorious mustache till the end of time. Moreover, the narration of the events is very well designed, not giving us the scenes of big visual impact right away, but rather delivered, one bit at a time, in different moments of the movie. The only flaw of the movie itself is a piece of dialogue that gave my nerves. It appears to me that the old Clint wants to remind the viewers that something else about planes crashing on New York happened in the recent past. Therefore, starting from the very first scene, we find images of how worse that accident could have been. At first, I tolerated the choice, since it is fitting with a PSTD of the pilot. Moreover, it could be the way of the director to say ""everyone will think about 9/11 anyway, just ride the elephant in the room"" (although I'm not sure about the first part and we will never know now). I ran out of tolerance when the issue was explicitly addressed with a phrase like ""It has been a while since New York had good news, especially involving planes"" (not a literal transposition). I found it inappropriate and it doesn't fit well in the movie.Besides that, it is a very well executed movie, I fully recommend it because it is a good way to spend a couple of hours.At last, I would like to address a message that the movie made me feel and to which I disagree with. The method used to represent the investigation, as well as the people whose duty is to establish what went wrong and who is responsible, made me take a stand against the investigation itself. This is simply a wrong message to deliver. In such accidents, the investigation is mandatory because you have also to decide if giving or not to the pilot (or the plane) the responsibilities for other human lives. It is true that the struggle and the self-analysis of the main character are saying that he trust the necessity of such investigation. However, from the choice of the actors (that always interpret annoying characters) to the dialogues, the feeling is that the investigators are the bad guys. I think this is simply the wrong message and I don't think that an expert director like Clint Eastwood did that by accident.",Sully

404,ucapoor,review,7,20 September 2016,"The film recounts the US 1549 emergency landing on the Hudson River — not in, as the First Officer Jefferey Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) cheekily points out — and the ensuing investigation. Sully's not so much about the crash (though you get to see it in IMAX grandeur at least thrice); it is about the little-known details of the investigation launched into finding out if Captain Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks in top form) could have done better. The filmis full of such delicious ironies. The Captain has saved 155 lives, but could he have saved them without damage to the aircraft—a fact that is of great interest to the insurance company? Could he have avoided risking their lives in the first place? Captain Sully may have emerged triumphant against the Canadian geese, and the Hudson, but can his human frailties overcome the cold computer simulations that seem to suggest that his choice wasn't the best under the circumstances? What about the irony of being regarded as a national hero, even as an internal investigatiocch then threatens to countermine the achievements of a 40-year-old career? In Sully's own words, ""I've flown millions during the 40 years of my career. But I'm going to be judged on 208 seconds."" Is Sully ""a hero or a fraud?""

405,konayoda,"This isn't a documentary, the NTSB weren't attack dogs as portrayed.",4,13 October 2016,"Clint Eastwood, his political views aside, might be wise to stick with comedy, like Space Cowboys (since he's too old to play Dirty Harry anymore), and leave the directing to better people. Are there any left in Hollywood? I realize that this movie was not meant to be a documentary, which is a genre that I often enjoy, and I also realize that Hollywood has to do what is best for their revenue, which often means sensationalizing ""true stories"", (Like the movie Race the Sun, about a good friend of mine, but almost totally fictitious) but we're talking about the Miracle on the Hudson here, it's sensational as it is. Granted, the intensity only lasted for 208 seconds (plus another minute or two to get out of the plane), but there is sooo much of the story that this movie could have told, but didn't, like the rescue, background of those involved, etc.All the confusing bouncing back and forth in the timeline, all of the distortion of the events, were beneath Tom Hanks acting abilities. And the portrayal of the NTSB was pure fiction. So much so, that they spoke out as soon as they heard about the movie. Search: bloomberg crash investigators pan their portrayalI still give the movie 4 stars, because Tom Hanks played his roll well (and the other actors tried, especially Aaron Eckhart), although Tom's heart didn't seem to be in this one. And if you don't care about accuracy, it was an OK movie. It's worth seeing once, I guess, with a grain of salt (or a mine), but unlike many movies in the same ""True Story"" genre, I doubt I'll watch this one more than once.",Sully
406,picketf,A missed opportunity,3,21 March 2018,"There are many many inconsistencies all throughout the movie the most disturbing one is how the Airbus approaches the river on a level angle at 140mph. All you need is to have seen at least once in your life such a plane on a descent. The nose is pointed up specially during the stall that the pilot must have put the plane in to decrease its speed for touchdown. From the cockpit window no river would have been visible and that would have made it a much more poetic visual composition. It's just a deliberate mistake to increase the drama through ""epicness"" of landscape photography but since it's such a vital shot it ruined the whole movie for me.
The things that were of interest all fell flat: Sully's background as a fighter pilot, his relationship to a guy who flew that particular Airbus for the very first time, the geese and how they were subsequently hunted and annihilated, the deep shock of the traffic control agent that thought he had lost a plane (rather than that goofy, spaced out mess), there is just so much material in real life for this movie and yet somehow Todd Komarnicki just managed to keep it as dull and formulaic as possible. The editing is well done except for a terrible bar scene that lasted way too long and had a barkeeper making a joke about a splash of water?

That being said, I was going to wait to rent this movie because the subject didn't appeal to me very much. Ended up at the theater with a group of friends who wanted to see it, so that's what we saw.Put simply, it was just OK.Tom Hanks is always good (in my opinion) and that was still the case. He did really well and might get awards consideration. I don't think he reached the heights of his performances in Philadelphia, Cast Away, Forrest Gump, or Saving Private Ryan or even another bio-pic, Captain Phillips. He was very good and made the movie watchable. Aaron Eckhart was also pretty good. My problem with the acting is that I don't feel those characters would be very difficult to portray, so although they did a good job, it isn't impressive per se.I am all for creative license, but I think the choice for the antagonists in this film is borderline slander given how actual events panned out. That's all I will say about that.The plot honestly doesn't have much going for it. We already know how the flight ends and thus lose a great deal of dramatic suspense. Eastwood tries to work around this with how he structured the story, but it just felt forced. Three separate times, I believe, we end up in a flashback of the flight in question and it does not add anything to the story. It quickly grows old.I mean, technically, this film is impeccable. The editing, the cinematography, etc. Clint Eastwood knows how to shoot a movie. So I don't want to knock it too hard. I just feel like it is pretty forgettable.6 stars is my standard rating for a movie that is well made, but I just didn't really care about.I do have to say that Aaron Eckhart's mustache is the star of the movie.",Sully

An Airbus 320 had actually 'landed' on a river! And all were alive! In the coming days, the miracle would be written and spoken about across the globe.And now in 2016, when I had first seen the trailer of Sully, I knew this was a movie I cannot afford to miss. Then the added excitement of the opening of the first IMAX in Oman and sully being the first film. So here it was, my first IMAX experience and that to with Sully. Sully, played by Tom Hanks is nothing short of a great movie ever made. Forget the incident and its re-creation. It was all about Chesley Sullenberger, the Captain of the flight, whose presence of mind, grit and above all experience saved everyone on that flight. Not once did I remember Tom Hanks (well, maybe the first scene). His conviction of the roles he plays is really stupendous. The movie enacts what happens and goes to show what transpired thereafter which only a few might be aware of. The movie shows, how the lives of 155 individuals collaborates towards one destiny on that day. The worries, thoughts, tension, remembering their loved ones, prayers, all captured in those few moments when the aircraft is poised as if in time, before the ultimate undecided moment.The big screen experience really made me live the scenes. Being a flying enthusiast and a flight simmer myself, I really freaked out at all the cockpit scenes and shots.What more would you expect from the Daddy of Cinema, Clint Eastwood himself? The direction, editing, acting is truly flawless. Enjoyed every frame of this movie.A Hollywood production you ideally should not miss. And if you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX, don't miss it. As it has been shot on IMAX and the scenes are tailor-made to be enjoyed there.

Clint Eastwood did a great job stretching the story from the Plane scene, court scene and Sully's little background story. I love the editing of the film and the screenplay. It's not a linear storytelling but it works well showing some flashbacks and visions. I like also how they add some humor in this film. Cinematography was good. I didn't experience it on IMAX because there's no IMAX theater nearby do i watch it on 2D they said that the plane scene was good in IMAX in 2D looks good. Overall it is a worth watching movie. If you love drama films you're gonna love this but if you love films with explosions and a non-stop action this film is not for you. It's about human, human who makes decisions.

413,richkaminski,Good acting not bad writing but much left out,8,9 September 2016,"I really liked this movie but being a pilot myself I was surprised at what was left out of the movie and not mentioned. For instance the air traffic controller was removed from duty immediately and a blood and urine sample was taken or mentioned to be taken but not from the pilot and the copilot.Also when an aircraft goes down because of two engines failing and shutting down I would think the fuel would be examined and red tagged until it was tested safe with no contamination to prevent other aircraft being fueled with the same fuel from shutting down. That also was not addressed. Why Sully nor the co pilot failed to complete and follow the ditching procedure no one ever will know but that also was not mentioned. The procedure specifies that in a water landing that a ditching button be activated.The Airbus A320 has a ""ditching"" button that closes valves and openings underneath the aircraft, including the outflow valve, the air inlet for the emergency RAT, the avionics inlet, the extract valve, and the flow control valve.It is meant to slow flooding in a water landing. The flight crew did not activate the ""ditch switch"" during the incident. To be fair holes were ripped in the fuselage during the ditching of the aircraft that opened huge holes that let water seep in but still proper procedure was not followed by activating the switch. No one mentioned this during the movie.There is no doubt that both pilots acted professionally and should be commended for safely executing the water landing but it makes one wonder why after all the training and hours they received in training and in the cockpit they failed to follow proper procedure.But then again it is said that any landing you can walk away from is considered a good one.",Sully

415,amyamy-49421,No Cartoon Super Hero,8,16 October 2016,"So refreshing to see a movie depicting a hero who isn't a cartoon-like Super Hero. The industry is sadly saturated with action-action-action Hollywood films. Sully suffers mildly from post-traumatic stress after he successfully lands his damaged plane in the Hudson River, amazingly saving all 155 of its passengers. After the landing, he is made a hero in the public's eyes, but begins to doubt himself when the aviation panel believes he could have successfully landed the plane in the LaGuardia runway. This story that unfolds is realistic, intelligent, and moving. Do we really need car chase scenes or explosions to hold our interest? My favorite line of the movie was when the hotel maid hugged Sully, and he asked, ""What just happened?"" The crash was not overplayed, thus, more tragic. The rescue scene was brutally realistic. The aviation panel's witch hunt was ugly and unfounded, and the fact that this story was based on true event made it even more harrowing.

This is shown in a variety of perspectives throughout the movie including passengers, citizens on land, boats, aircraft control centres and of course, Sully's. The movie examines the events after the incident involving when all the passengers make it to shore, and days after the event. Sully also has nightmares and visions of him crashing into the city which may be distressing for some viewers. Sully is forced to deal with the aircraft investigation team who state that Sully could have landed at an airport instead of the river. The movie also explores some of Chesley's 'Sully' background and previous events including his life in the air-force and a jet incident where he was forced to land. Sully was a well made movie and gave a realistic take on the events that occurred on January the 15 2009 and explained the story very well to foreign viewers who were unfamiliar with the events.",Sully

I highly recommend this movie.For an hour and a half long movie, the pacing was perfect. A bit of action, a bit of talk, some more action, some flashbacks to get a feel for the character.

422,sdneuro33,Better than expected,8,9 September 2016,"I 'thought' I new the story of what happened so I wasn't eager to go and see the movie. I figured I would wait until later in the year and just watch it 'On Demand' or some other way at home. But I kept thinking it must be pretty decent with Tom Hanks starring and when I realized Clint Eastwood directed the movie, that's when I decided I had to see it in the theater. SO glad I did and if I can make a recommendation, make sure to see this in a theater that offers Widescreen if possible. Most people know about the heroic landing of the plane on the Hudson river in New York where all passengers and crew survived. But few of us, myself included, know all of the details that led up to that event happening. Nor was I aware of the questioning by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). What is also striking, is despite the heroic move by Captain Sullenberger, he is an incredibly humble man who clearly did not care for the spotlight nor the fame that came with this. It's interesting if you have ever seen the movie ""Flight"" with Denzel Washington where there is a horrific crash but the pilot minimizes the crash and everyone agrees he was the only one who could have done this. Good movie except that was fiction and in ""Sully"", this is real life and again, he is probably the only Captain who could or would have pulled off this miracle.The only fictitious thing I would say about the movie was the part when people were boarding the plane. Everyone was extraordinarily courteous to each other. People helping others with their belongings in the overhead bins. Nobody bringing on excess luggage that won't even fit in the overhead. People being patient as they go down the isle looking for their seat and everyone saying thanks, excuse me and please. There was a woman sitting in a middle seat with an extremely young toddler in her lap. Yeah, don't think that's even allowed, but the man next to her was smiling and seemed so happy to be sitting next to a woman with a young child. The boarding of the plane was a bit fantasy and I heard quite a few people in the audience chuckling at that part. But otherwise, this is a great movie and here is my 2017 Oscar nomination predictions for this movie:Best Picture Nominee - Tom Hanks, Nominated for Best Actor - Clint Eastwood, Nominated for Best Director - ""Sully"", nominated for best cinematography",Sully

424,markus-sauder,Flying at its best,10,22 October 2018,"There's no other movie than Sully that depicts the demonstration of perfect flying skills in what appears to be and would otherwise be a hopeless emergency situation. Not only thanks to the very realistic and accurate re-enactment of this true story by the superb Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, but also and more importantly because it is simply amazing to see how the pilots pull off the impossible in just over 200 seconds.
Having taken myself private pilot lessons on a single engine Cessna in my student years 40 years ago practicing different inflight emergency situations, one key rule engraved from the beginning is NOT to attempt to return to the same (single) runway when engine failure just after take off. The temptation is there to turn around but the procedure taught by the instructor was to quickly (in seconds) pick the best place for an emergency landing in the immediate vicinity and plan and execute your one-shot approach.
Now with a twin-jet engine airliner and a single engine loss, there's sufficient thrust from the second engine and time to turn around and land safely. With both engines stopped as in Sully's case, it's like the single engine Cessna rule. No time for ""guessing"" or ""experimenting"". The incredible pilot skill is deciding where to land, gliding, steering and landing this large aircraft on water so smoothly that it did not roll, flip and break apart, saving everyone aboard. That is the beauty of this movie, seeing how it's done, the perfect reactions and actions by the experienced pilot and copilot in every detail. The realistic cinematography and sound experience augment this movie, directed by the great Clint Eastwood. Watched it several times already and still am mesmerized by it.",Sully

During the whole movie, Tom Hanks has an expression of someone who did something bad, or hides something because he's afraid it will be revealed, only for us viewers to find out a the end of the movie that he did that in order to create the much needed drama this movie desperately wanted, in order justify itself of being a movie... This ""movie"", however well directed it is, should have been a documentary in the first place. The events of this plane crash are not enough to create the drama or tensions a movie needs in order to create engagement with the audience.

427,murrap,Fantasy wins over fact.,4,20 January 2017,Eastwood takes an amazing incident but one from which he cannot make a film without wildly diverging from the facts. Sully is made a persecuted hero as if it was a Spaghetti Western (who was the director again?). The post-crash incident investigation was a complete distortion but necessary to make a story. I really dislike filmmakers playing fast and loose with real life events without any acknowledgement. An aircraft incident investigation is just not carried on as described. But I guess most people don't care as long as they leave the cinema warm and fuzzy. The crash re-creation sequences were incredibly well done though and reclaimed the film.,Sully

We go to the movies in the hopes we will get to see a good movie. We go to see a good story, good acting, a well developed plot and some action.This is why we need more movies like Sully.Clint Eastwood presents a story that we need, a normal guy , a hero and an simple man that acknowledges everyone who participated in the event of the downing of an aircraft landing in the Hudson River. Sully stars Tom Hanks as ""Sully"" and with a excellent Co pilot portrayed actor Aaron Eckhart and a truly gifted supporting cast.At the end of the movie the theater should erupt with applause even though the actors cannot hear our appreciation.Why will Sully make money. It does not lean on top stars to make it work. It does not lean on a race like in the Ben Hur remake. It does not lean on simple action like a Marvel Movie. It does not lean on the LGBT community to buy the tickets up. It does not lean on a whole bunch of fake news stories to drag you in to see it. It does not lean on social issues to make you feel like you have to see it. It is not another sequel or darn remake. It has not been female upped or colored upped to get you in.Sully tells the story of a hero, and the heroes' that surround them. In our country of forever at war, and forever's on welfare , we need a hero, a role model for kids of all the country.Thank You Clint, Thank you Sully, Thank you Hollywood for getting one right this year.Do Not miss this Movie.",Sully

430,balakand,Factual errors in the movie..,7,11 September 2016,"Its a good movie alright, but when I read the wikipedia article about the aftermath events I realized that Clint Eastwood for some reason wanted to portray the NTSB as devil's advocate or even devils. I am sure Sully did the right thing when he was facing the situation. But NTSB never accused him of any wrongdoing as shown in the movie. Also the simulation details given in the movie are all wrong. The wiki article says the below :""The NTSB ran a series of tests using Airbus simulators in France, to see if Flight 1549 could have returned safely to their choice of LaGuardia Airport (LGA), either runway 13 or 22, or Teterboro Airport (TEB) runway 19. The test pilots were fully briefed on the series of events and maneuvers. The test pilots were only able to return successfully to either airport in eight of 15 attempts. The NTSB report noted that these test conditions were unrealistic: ""The immediate turn made by the pilots during the simulations did not reflect or account for real-world considerations..."" A single follow-up simulation was conducted where the pilot was delayed by 35 seconds: He crashed trying to return to LGA runway 22.[96]""Clearly this was not the same as shown in the movie. Shame on you Clint Eastwood for doing a very poor job like this! There was no need to glorify Sully by degrading NTSB's actions. Sully did the right thing and he is a hero beyond any doubts. You don't have to prove that by this cheap tactics!",Sully

435,sean_footynut,Hanks and Eastwood provide a professional tribute to a man that was all about professionalism.,8,15 September 2016,"The story of Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's ""forced water landing"" of US Airways flight 1549 is delivered wonderfully to the cinema by Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, portraying Sully as a subtle everyday hero.The film follows the story of the crash of the Airbus A320 onto the Hudson on January 15th 2009 and the following investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Tom Hanks stars as Capt. Sullenberger, with Aaron Eckhart (First Officer Jeff Skiles), Laura Linney (Lorrie Sullenberger), Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, Jamey Sheridan and Jerry Ferrara in supporting roles.But the undeniable star of this film is Hanks, who portrays Sully in such a wonderful and inspiring way. Hanks gives a master class on how to portray an everyday man who suddenly becomes a national hero. Hanks portrays Sully as a subtle man, who is just trying to save the people on board his plane during the crash, while trying to save his job in the aftermath. Hanks makes it believable to the viewer that he is traumatized by what has just transpired and it gets you to feel for Sully, wanting to reach out and give him a hug. To put it in simple words Hanks provides a professional tribute to a man that was all about professionalism. Hanks is wonderful as Capt. Sullenberger Hanks performance does also have a negative side. From the get go of the investigations, Sully is portrayed to be right at every opportunity with him attacking the NTSB, which he has every right to but, This comes back to the way in which the film is directed. The director of Sully is acclaimed director Clint Eastwood and he has shaped the story to make it feel like that the NTSB are the bad guys for thinking of dishonoring an American hero such as Capt. Sullenberger, where they were merely just trying to do there jobs and found out as much information as they could about the incident. They are portrayed at the beginning as attackers of Sullenberger, asking questions about drug consumption, how much sleep he had or whether there were any problems at home. I feel like this scene could have been done more subtly and not seem so attacking, therefore changing the viewers perception of the NTSB from attackers to just people inquiring about the incident and doing their jobs.Apart from this Eastwood has shaped an insightful movie, taking us into the deeper parts of the story and into the mind of Sullenberger. Hanks was in close contact with Capt. Sullenberger throughout filming, gaining insight from him and shaping the movie to be as truthful as possible, which is evident through Hanks acting and how Eastwood has structured the film. The plane crash feels realistic and like we are apart of them and it fits right into the narrative and allows for a continuous flow through the story. While the inquiry stages of the film don't feel boring but naturally flow from action to talking seamlessly. The films narrative is based on Sullenberger's autobiography ""Highest Duty"", which was co-written with Jeffrey Zaslow. The influences of the book are seen throughout the film as we are shown cutaway shots of planes crashing into New York and of a military jet landing, which enhance Hank's and Eastwood's portrayal of the traumatized Capt. Sullenberger post crash. While the insights from Sullenberger enable the crash screens to be replicated for our eyes on screen. Sully is wonderfully crafted and wonderfully delivered across the park. Apart from the slight attack on the NTSB it runs smoothly through its action sequences and is intense throughout. Sully is an insightful thriller that will have you leaving feeling better getting into a plane then other plane crash movies.",Sully

Also, never would the NTSB accept simulator tests where the operators were allowed several attempts. They are well aware of the stress factor and don't have to be lectured by some film producer.

Simple enough? Well as we see the movie there is more to the story than the famous water landing footage and a white mustached man.Sully is a movie which told in 3 points of view, the actual fight, Sully's personal story, and the NTSB investigating what happened. Asides from the flight, we see Sully having trouble taking all the new stardom as well has having anxiety wondering ""what if I did.."" The NTSB basically want to prove that flight had the ability to return to the airport and holds Sully accountable. In that sets up a conflict as well as ""who's the bad guy?"" for the movie. The movie does well with flashbacks of the flight, the meetings with NTSB, and Sully's own personal venture though the whole process. Since this is a personal review, I found the movie to be amazing. It's wonderful to see a movie and get a ""wow did that really happen?"" from it. The acting, directing, editing, and even the special effects was top notch. A Clint Eastwood movie with top notch special effects?? Huh? The special effects of recreating the flight scene along with possible outcomes of other fictional plane possibilities was extremely shockingly clear and didn't appear very CGI'ish.Tom Hanks does fantastic job playing the famous pilot with all of his coolness and reserve. Many people might think, well, it's Tom Hanks haven't we seen enough of his warm-hearted roles? Not like this. He does the job showing a man in a face of stardom while trying to live his normal life. This is a stardom he would never want to be in but let's face it, you land on the Hudson you're IT. Sully is great example of those moments when you know you did something you had to do but can't describe in words or math. I encourage viewers to listen to the actual audible cockpit recordings, when you do, tell yourself ""how many people are able to handle themselves in that situation?""

Now let come to the movie. Unfortunately nothing of the emotional part of the passengers shown in the movie. Even when the film maker got a good chance to win some tears from the audience they did not gone much for emotional part but concentrated on investigation part.

You cannot expect more from a movie than what this offers. Allowing for taste, some may find the pace too slow I guess (from what I've read) but for me this is presented at an excellent tempo for the subject matter.If you submerge yourself in the moments portrayed this is quite a cinematic experience. Hanks, and all supporting actors are sublime throughout. Understated at times I guess, but for good reason.It's just great stoytelling with the right balance of fact and artistic licence to be visceral and enthralling all at once, I guess (could be very factual for all I know but it's very entertaining!)For me, it is what filmmaking should be more often. I guess for some too slow. Sometimes, an enthralling historic event unfolding at a pace that makes you salivate is almost as good as it gets.Great cinematography, scirpt, acting and storyline. It's not as memorable as some classics, but you'd watch it more than once.",Sully
453,montever-09965,"Hard to dislike a hero movie, but...",5,8 June 2017,"I wanted to like this film. I really did. Having seen pilot Sullenberger on numerous TV shows, and recognizing him as an ordinary guy who just happened to ""do his job"" as he has said, at a perfect moment in time- thereby saving the lives of 155 ""souls"" aboard the ill-fated flight, January of 2009. The problem is that, often, the truth just isn't as exciting as a fictional screen play. Director Clint Eastwood attempts to show the (apparently truthful) friction between the NTSB Inquirey board and Sullenberger, but what he gets is cascading clichés: the heartless bureaucrats who refuse to look past the computer data and simulators, the incredulous pilots who are suffering sleep deprivation and nightmares, and a public clamoring to give Sully the keys to New York City. Also making cameos are the dutiful wife back in the burbs, worried about purchasing some casually mentioned house, and a sympathetic union rep who shrugs a lot.Missing from this film version is the hysteria, noise, and confusion of a crash scene -Sully calls it a water landing- and the real look of people who feel as though they may die a cold, watery, death. The survivors are too collected, too calm and not very believable. Eastwood directs ""Sully"" as an homage, documentary style, to the extraordinary skill of Sullenberger. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks, as Sully, underplays Sullenberger to the extent that we see nothing of the man. On a ticky tacky point, Hank's make up job and gray hair only call attention to the fact that he really isn't Sullenberger. On a technical note, the camera changes bothered me a great deal. The broad shots alternated with obviously hand held camera shots that could have been made with a film student's iPhone. Maybe this shouldn't get in the way of telling a great story, but it does to this reviewer. Most bothersome of all is the way the story is told in flashbacks that seem completely contrived. Borrowing flashback styles from any number of classic films, Eastwood mishandles this story by almost signaling to the viewer, ""Here it comes!"" On a positive note, you should see this film if you want to see an accurate portrayal of a ""hero"" who doesn't want to be one; the admirable and unassuming Sully Sullenberger. Just don't expect a wide range of emotional response from Tom Hanks. He played Sully all too well.",Sully

It is a 2016 American biographical drama directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Todd Komarnicki, based on the autobiography"" Highest Duty by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow"". The film stars Tom Hanks as Sullen berger, with Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, Jamey Sheridan, and Jerry Ferrara in supporting roles. The film follows Sullenberger's January 2009 emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, in which all 155 passengers and crew members survived the plane crash. A feat largely credited to captain Sullen Berger. On 15th January, US airways flight no.1549 departed from LaGuardia airport. Barely 3 minutes into the flight, disaster struck. A flock of birds flew in to the engines; which cripples both of the engines and raised an emergency situation for the pilot. Although there were no airport in range Sully still maintained the aircraft and saw if they could make it on airport otherwise they would crash. Sully decided that the plane won't make it to the airport so he choose to land on the Hudson river which was nearby. Finally he successfully landed the aircraft with minimal damage; sparing the lives of the crew and passengers. It was the first-time in history that a plane landed on water without any casualties. However, the official investigation reports that one of the engines was running ideal and not damage yet. The flight simulations indicated that it would have been possible to land at either of LaGuardia or Teterboro airports. This charge caused Sully being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill. Sullys life was being invaded by reporters and investigators forced sully to put his job and reputation on the line. Sully was almost charged guilty of endangering the lives of his passengers and crew as the human flight simulations showed that it was possible to land the aircraft safely on any of the two airports. But then Sully asked jury how many times did the simulation pilots practice the turn and landing to make the landing precise and also added that they were not in the real life and death situation that he had to face. Then the jury took his opinion in concern and found out that the simulation pilots had to practice 17 times to make the turn, and so they gave the pilots and 30 second handicap then both of the landing attempts failed in disasters. And afterwards they received a report on the recently recovered left engine and it said that the left engine was severely damaged. After seeing this the jury was convinced that what sully did was inevitable and a miracle. So, all the allegations on sully were taken down and Sully was finally recognized as the hero that he was.",Sully

461,optwoodau,Good depiction of Sully. Cartoon villains,3,13 April 2021,"The flight scenes and PTSD Sully suffered were very good. But the portrayal of the NTSB. They may as well have come with black suits, whiplash moustache, and an evil snicker.At no point in the entire transcript of the proceedings (very boring read) were NTSB hostile to Sully or Jeff. The whole point is to identify the point of failure and correct it. If pilots think they have something to lose, then some will hide details, and people will die.I know a movie where all the details are obvious and known beforehand is very boring, but presenting the National Transportation Safety Board as the bad guys is insulting and very misleading. Their job is not to determine who or what is at fault. Their job is to determine how to prevent the accident from reoccurring.I cannot recommend this film due to the made up conflict.",Sully
462,ferdistegmann,Factually and technically brilliant,8,10 September 2016,"Sully is probably one of the most detailed, factually and technically brilliant movies ever made of a real life event. Apart from some obvious CGI rendering of the plane which could have been done much better, I was amazed by how Eastwood has given the viewer a clear and accurate reconstruction of what exactly happened that day and almost from every angle.However, having read the book of Sully, ""Highest Duty"", I feel that a lot if not most of the message of the movie would have completely gone over my head if I did not read the book. Sully's mentor at a young age and the story of how he successfully landed a damaged plane in his earlier military career was perfect from a cinematographic point of view, but I think it did not convey Sully's message of ""a life dedicated to doing your normal job remarkably"" clearly.I appreciate that the movie tells the untold story of how Sully was almost blamed for his heroic actions through the investigation (not told elsewhere or in ""Highest duty""), but the cheesy ""wife crying on the phone""-type of storytelling misses an opportunity to inspire the audience to go home from the cinema and start preparing for their own ""land on the Hudson"" moment in their life, something which the book ""Highest duty"" most certainly does perfectly.Nonetheless, Sully remains an amazing film which serves as an example of what a fine actor Tom Hanks is. I also enjoyed Aaron Eckhart in this film.",Sully

The real elements of this story lend credibility to this fiction. If you can tell they're talking nonsense when you've never been in the cockpit, it's not because the story is well told; it's because it's made up to give you a villain.

465,bigrich007-276-435774,Good film,7,17 June 2020,"The film works in representing the post-traumatic stress experienced by Sully, with his insomnia and regular flashbacks of 'what might have happened) The final NTSB hearing scenes are also well-done and suitably gripping: particularly for viewers outside of the UK where we wouldn't have heard the outcome of the affair once the news cycle had moved on from the 'gee- whizz' headline event.Where the film aquaplanes somewhat is in the padding achieved through multiple scenes of New Yorkers back-slapping Sully. Some of this is needed to establish the pedestal that Sully is set upon: the bar scene, for example, is well done. But all the rest of the references become just plain tiresome.There is also a back-story focused on Sully's financial problems and rather scratchy marriage (as portrayed) to Lorraine (Laura Linney). Linney is normally a highly-watchable actress, but here her character is just so irritating that the mood of the film plummets every time she reappears on screen.",Sully
466,ron-320-820376,Great Movie but Unrealisitc Portrayal of NTSB,8,19 September 2016,"As a pilot for 40 years I really enjoyed Sully as I'm sure most pilots did also. Since the actual flight was so short it would have been nice to have seen an uninterrupted view of the flight from take-off to the water landing from the cockpit perspective. Instead we got a lot of short edits jumping back and forth from the cockpit, to the cabin and then outside.That's a small complaint though. A larger one is how poorly the NTSB was treated as arrogant and oblivious to the human factors involved in an unprecedented emergency involving dual engine failure at 2,800 feet. I understand every drama needs an antagonist and maybe only the NTSB could have played that role in Sully. Just understand that's show business. Pilots might have the occasional complaint with the FAA, say, during a ramp inspection, but the NTSB is pretty much universally respected as one of the most capable and thorough agencies within the federal government. The incredible safety record of American air travel is largely attributable to the NTSB and the FAA.Google ""ntsb final report USAir 1549"" to read the final NTSB report on the flight. Judge for yourself. This wasn't written by a bunch of arrogant bureaucrats.One other thought. If you liked the pilot heroics in Sully, watch ""The High and the Mighty"" filmed in 1954.

Rule number one in screen writing is ""show, don't tell"". Yet the only thing Captain Sully, or anyone else for that matter, is talking about is their feelings.It felt like I was watching a live action Disney Channel TV-movie with the obvious, over-acting bad guys, that are coming after the morally strong and extremely likable good guy for ""no reason"". They want us to root for Sully so bad, that they compromise the integrity of the film. Why does it seem like the two investigators hate Sully? Why do they want to crush him? And suddenly, after realizing the painfully obvious (that a human takes longer to think and execute than a computer), they love him and give him praise in a personal note. It just doesn't make sense. Every single piece of dialog in this film is overly pathos garbage. I found my self turning in my seat from the cringe worthiness. It's clear that they wanted me to be moved by this film.

Some of the events in this film are dramatised, some to an annoying level (the guys in the investigation team were like Disney villains...) but I do understand that the show needed to have sort of dramatic flair to keep it interesting for 90- odd minutes. Hopefully it didn't tarnish anybody's recollection of the events too much. It's oddly structured too but as time goes by in the film and events unfold, you understand why it was structured in such a way and I think it's fairly well done. It does mean that a few scenes are a bit heavy-handed in describing what's happening and how people are feeling and some transitions in and out of scenes are a bit hard to follow. Overall though if you take yourself away from these issues and immerse yourself into this film and Hanks' stellar performance then it's a pretty thrilling ride (I can end my review on a corny joke too...)",Sully

The conflict has been portrait in a believable way. While watching the viewer can slowly make their own decision on whether they think Sully made the best decision, while never accusing him of having made the wrong one.It is unfortunate that they made it abundantly clear in the end that Sully did in fact make the best decision.

477,playersanonymous100,Good (76/100),7,11 January 2017,"This movie tells the true story of the airplane pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (played by Tom Hanks), who, in 2009, had to land in the Hudson river after a bird strike that disabled both engines. And though he was able to save everyone on board, people started doubting if he did the right thing and whether or not he could have made it back to the airport.The film starts after the event had already happened and we see the consequences of it both in the media and in Sully's personal life and the actual event is told through flashbacks throughout the movie. One of the complains I heard about this film is that there are too many flashbacks and most of them are not needed. I partially agree with that: they show several clips of the accident always with something more (or less) each time they show it and most of them don't add much to the one showed before, so I think some of these should have been cut. There's another unneeded clip that shows Sully learning how to fly a plane and one showing him in the air-force landing a jet (though it's not needed, this one is pretty cool).I found acting in this movie to be mostly okay. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are both great as the two main leads but the rest of the actors were not that good.Here in Brazil this movie is called ""Sully: The Hero of the Hudson River"" and that basically tells you everything about how the movie want us to see Captain Sully: as a hero, and the ones that are ""agaist"" him: as the villains. And that's my biggest issue with this movie: there is a clear ""right"" side and ""wrong"" side. The people investigating if he did or not the right thing are portrayed as villains and thus we don't ask ourselves if what he did was right or not. I think the film would be much better if we kept asking ourselves who's side is the ""right"" one! That happens briefly in the fist act but it just stops! And the villains are not even good villains they're just blend!Clint Eastwood's direction is really good for the most part; There's one scene that I found it sort of weird: Anna Gunn's character is the only one talking and there's two other people in the frame with her and she's almost out of the frame and every time it cuts back to her it's this exact same angle!Most of the characters, with exception of Tom Hank's and Aaron Eckhart's, I found to be kinda generic though the movie focus is mostly in the main leads. But surprisingly one character that gets too much screen time is the guy from the air traffic control, he has two pointless scenes and he is by far the worst actor in the movie!It has good suspense (mainly in the ending scene) and a good atmosphere, result of the really good cinematography.This film has good acting (for the most part), good atmosphere, cinematography, suspense and it's overall a good movie.

Having sat through this film however I have a greater insight into how things really went down that day.I now have so much more respect for Cpt Sully and the crew of that flight.

But I could not help but think during the whole movie ""Why do I care if he made a mistake or not?"". The trailer pretty much gives you everything you will find out about the character Sully - there is little character development, I see no reason to sympathise with him, nor was I given any reason to understand what ""struggle"" he was going through - the phone conversations with his wife seem like an afterthought - we don't know what exactly are their family issues. The wife mentions losing a house - but there is no context. The daughters are never present on camera - why is Sully away from home and seem to have a strained/detached relationship with his family? Almost scene almost feels like they are created for a sake of it. Why the hotel scene when the only thing they do there is to say they're tired and then go out? For the large investigation committee present on screen, only two people have a voice. And their animosity towards the pilots are very contrived - only one reason was revealed in the causal chat between the two pilots ""insurance"". And after Sully raised the point about human reaction time - there is this sudden magical change in attitude of the two people - so drastic that the women who wanted to add a sentimentalist personal note to the pilots.Everything just feels so contrived, artificial - emotions just don't add up or make sense. The context is not clear. Given that we all know that no one dies in the incident, the movie failed to make me want to care about Sully and his reputation, given how little I know about him.If you're an American, I see the appeal of the crash and rescue scene, but other than that I don't see why this movie deserves the acclaim it received.",Sully
483,spqr-32004,"If you fly, do not miss this film",10,24 September 2016,"Do go and see the film ""Sully"", when next you fly, you will think of this film. Tom Hanks did a great job in the role of Sully. We take for granted those who crew and fly our passenger planes. Seeing this film, you feel you are one of the passengers. When your flight lands and it takes so long to get off the aircraft, think of this film and if it ever happens to you, remember were the emergency exits are and do read the safety brochures on the back of the seat in front of you. As well the life vest is usually under your seat, but do not inflate it till you are out of the cabin, else it may catch and lose its air or it may hang you up from exiting the plane. Some people who see this film may never want to fly again. Trust your crew to look out for you.",Sully
484,chrispapakr,One Of The Best Movies Of 2016,9,14 January 2017,"It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. What Tom Hanks (Sully), said at the last meeting in the movie was amazing:""You are looking for human error, than make a human!""The whole directing was amazing, the way they slowly showed the whole water landing and how we actually became familiar with the people inside the plain fascinated me.Tom Hanks? He was just amazing. He played so well his role, at some point I forgot I was watching a movie. I thought I was seeing this in real time as it happened.Overall, It was an amazing movie and seriously consider watching it, not only for fun, but for learning what really happened back then as well.",Sully
485,smproduction,Sully is Sullenberger,7,16 December 2016,"There's obviously a lot of research and accuracy of facts that need to be considered when making a film out of a real life incident. Clint Eastwood once again shows he knows what he's doing when it comes to sitting in the directors chair.January 15th, 2009, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after it suffered dual engine failures from a bird strike. What he endures following the incident is a scathing investigation team hell bent on showing him he made a mistake and he could have in fact turned the plane around and landed it safely on one of the many runways available to him in New York.Tom Hanks, as always, plays a solid role and character and a very believable Aircraft pilot, although i felt at times he could have shown just a little more emotion in certain spots. Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn made good additions to the cast fitting into their roles nicely.The film itself, jumps all over the place, it starts straight away with a nightmare from our hero. we see the time line of events is post- incident, then eventually goes back to the beginning of the flight before Sully even steps foot on the plane. I wasn't expecting the film to be structured this way and found it kind of annoying at first, but it doesn't at all affect the pacing.Clocking in at just an hour and a half, Sully is a good hero flick depicting the events of January 15th, 2009, because we learn everything we need to know in just that short space of time. Nothing feels overdone or over dramatized and I walked out of the cinema feeling thoroughly satisfied with what Eastwood managed to do with this story. Really good stuff!Fox.",Sully
486,onekillernash,Overall a well formed dramatic biographic film.,7,6 December 2016,"In the biographic film, Sully, director Clint Eastwood pays tribute to pilot Chesley Sullenberger, the man responsible for the ""miracle on the Hudson."" Tom Hanks, a renowned actor plays the role of Sullenberger well and respectively. The plot focuses mainly on the events that took place after Sullenberger's historic landing with the investigations focusing on the investigations that took place afterwards.Overall, the film presents a fantastic take on the untold story behind the events that unfolded on January 15th 2009. The pace of the film proved to be excellent through the use of flashbacks to give insight on the plot occurring during the present. Emotionally, the film proves to be quite the drama with scenes of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression eating away at Sullenberger. Despite the investigations against him, Sullenberger persevered through the setbacks that appeared against him, and as an empowering character, he captures the audiences heart. Although the dialogue in the beginning gave me a shaky feeling about the writing for the film, it eventually became a well written screenplay that captured the emotions needed for the drama. Tom Hanks takes center of the film with his phenomenal acting as Sully. By meeting with the real life Chesley Sullenberger, Hanks obviously was able to adapt to the emotions needed.My only problem with the film would have to be the abrupt ending. It felt forced and was cliché with the fade to black ending. All of the emotion throughout the film built up towards the end, but for what? Between the fantastic cinematography, special effects, editing, and emotion, the film deserved more closure at the end to create a powerful ending. Undoubtedly, both Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks worked together to create a unified film describing the event that occurred on January15th 2009. Through post-traumatic flashbacks of the plane potentially crashing into New York to the constant stress over being fired due to an investigation gone wrong, emotions drove the movie into becoming a dramatic biographic film.",Sully
487,starshooter-51099,"Excellent true story of real life hero, Sully!",9,23 December 2016,"I finally got to watch this movie. and I was very pleased with it. It is well made and, as always, I find Tom Hanks to be a consummate actor. I think this movie captures what real life hero, Sully, went through after his dramatic act of bravery and calm in the face of such a tragedy. It takes the time to show the humanity, the real fears, the stress and the reall caring of one man for another. The interactions between characters is great. The quality of the movie is very good. I have found that some of the best movies are those that are based on real life, and this one continues to prove that in my book.If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend that you do so.",Sully
488,zachster-07684,An overall great acted drama about family and the plane crash of 2009,8,1 January 2017,"Clint Eastwood does it again with a new and excellent acted movie about the Hudson River plane crash of 2009. The main premise of this movie is to make you feel and see the intensity and seriousness of the events of 2009. The acting in this film is top notch Tom Hanks plays Sully (The Pilot) and Aaron Eckhart plays Jeff Skiles (The co-pilot) both do a great job in this movie. Tom Hanks plays a serious emotional role while Aaron Eckhart plays more a humorous and relief role. This movie also does a great job incorporating New York City. It shows numerous shots and great cinematography of New York while also focusing on the problem at hand (the plane crash). It also shows Sully running down the streets of New York and down Time Square. Believe me this movie isn't all about the plane crash, its also about family and friendship. It explores aspects of Sully's life no one probably even knew were going on at the time. This film is also very realistic in which it shows people emotionally distraught after the plane crash and how much the passengers cared about there families. There is one scene in the movie which I thought that there might be a classic Hollywood moment but instead it went a different way and I was happy about that. I absolutely love how the movie showed little mini stories about the passengers and there families throughout the film. There is a sense of fear throughout this movie and that's what makes this film intense at some moments.Issues I had with the film There were very few issues I had with this movie but I thought for starters there were a little too many dream sequences which I wont get into detail about.The feeling of 2009 wasn't really there. There were a couple of shots I could see things like an advertisement for the Revenant on a cab.The movie was a little slow at the beginning. The beginning of the movie sort of moved a little slower than i thought it could have but i understand why it was crucial to put those scenes in the film. Eventually the film does pick back up.",Sully
489,vicochoa-79341,"Contrived, fictitious, unreal, and ingloriously political",2,12 August 2017,"This film is simply filled with claptrap, and right-wing nut job claptrap at that. The juvenile rendering of the NTSB agents as cartoon character villains is a disservice of all those who try to protect the skies from airplanes deprived of their correct servicing and from terrorists as well. The film clubs the viewer over the head - or at least tries to - with the notion that the government and the media are evil, out to get heroes like Sullenberger. Abandon government regulation, the film cries out, led by the film's ""hero,"" the near senile Clint Eastwood, with his Fox News-rendered illusions. What is most disappointing on an emotional level is the unreal rendering of the man Sullenberger himself. As Hanks plays him, he has not a shred of a personality, is nothing but a stoic, jaded, unhappy misanthrope, which the real Sully isn't, as is seen at the end of the film, when he is actually shown smiling with his former passengers, something - smiling, that is- that he doesn't do throughout the entire film. Tom Hanks and Laura Linney should be ashamed: the nadir of their careers.",Sully
490,philipverstraeten,"Good B-film, but nothing more ...",5,9 January 2017,"As mentioned, an interesting story, well told but not much of a movie ... Technically superior, good acting ... However, I find that Tom Hanks translates his inner feelings mostly in looking very somber, staring, moving slowly ... I got the impression method acting is back again ! The story is told clearly but on the other hand with few surprises. I read here that people find it emotional, are involved etc... but I did not feel any of these sensations, on the contrary ...It doesn't help that some characters (wife / daughters / ...) are so empty... We don't know anything about them and how they really feel or react, both to the crash and the investigation that followed.Nice to watch but easy to forget ...",Sully

492,gotmike-25924,Very good movie based on a well-known true story,8,5 August 2017,"I saw most of this movie on HBO last night.It was a little repetitious with part of the crash scenes, but solid all the way through otherwise. It gave me more respect for flight attendants.It seems to have ruffled feathers at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It is my understanding the Mr. Sullenberger requested that the names of the NTSB be changed to fictional ones after he reviewed the script. The movie didn't paint a rosy picture of NTSB, but I wouldn't call it harsh either. I've have an experience with another state government agency which was quite similar to that portrayed of the NTSB in this movie. In my opinion, the NTSB people were being way too sensitive. The movie makes them look good at the end.",Sully
