0,MartinHafer,Does NOT suck as badly as you'd think,6,25 May 2005,"Before this movie even premiered, critics almost universally panned it. Because of this, many made fun of the film and few went to see it (I was among them). However, a few years later, I saw it on cable TV (on a day I was too lazy to change the channel) and was shocked that I didn't hate the movie. While a little dopey at times, the movie kept my attention and surely didn't deserve all the bad press. Another Stallone movie that falls in the same category was Demolition Man. A decent film--and this is shocking since I am a film snob.FYI--do not think I am a crazed fan of Stallone or a family member. There are MANY movies he made that I hate--such as Lord of Flatbush, Rambo 2 (one of the DUMBEST movies ever made), or Rhinestone.",Judge Dredd
1,bkoganbing,Order in Judge Stallone's Court,5,31 January 2017,"One thing I did like about Judge Dredd is that most futuristic science fiction films only put their events maybe decades away and in film we've seen enough over past decades to know thing didn't turn out quite as predicted. Judge Dredd is set safely several centuries in the future so by then if things don't turn out as abysmally for the earth no one is around for an I told you so.This is one dismal future. We've not reached the stars, we've poisoned our own planet and the population is now all urban dwellers. I didn't see anything on how food was provided, presumably we're all eating Soylent products. But with the kind of crowding in these domed cities law and order is a problem.A lid is being kept on with a system of judges. But don't expect learned written opinions from these guys. They are police, judge, and executioner. Stallone is a guy who dispenses summary judgment in his court of the streets, very few appeals are made. Rooster Cogburn would have liked this system.But Stallone himself is accused of murder, but he's given a life sentence at a penal colony in Aspen. Nevertheless he escapes and finds out who put him in the jackpot with the help of fellow judge Diane Lane and petty criminal Rob Schneider.The villain here is Armand Assante who has appeared in several of Sly's films. Let's say he has a plan of reforming the system that will bring real law and order to the world according to him.Sly over the years has developed a light touch and it's applied in Judge Dredd when needed. Imagine Rambo dispensing summary judgment and you have Judge Dredd.",Judge Dredd
2,Leofwine_draca,Big budget time waster,4,9 August 2016,"More no-brain thrills and spills from Stallone, who found his popularity on the wane at around this period. On the strength of this film, I can't say I'm surprised, especially as scenes of Stallone walking around like a tree shouting ""I am the LAW!"" in a supposed-serious manner are frequently laughable and make you feel embarrassed for the actor. JUDGE DREDD is one of those movies that was possibly messed up in post-production, as the disjointed, fragmented narrative and frequently confusing action may testify to. Indeed in one scene we see a bloodless Stallone in action; in the next we see him running down a corridor bleeding profusely, suggesting that perhaps large chunks of the film were cut out due to negative audience reaction? Whatever the reasons, JUDGE DREDD is a shallow, action-packed film totally lacking in any characterisation or deep plot. In this respect it may be a good approximation of a comic book, but as a film it's a failure and makes you wonder why on earth they bothered in the first place. The biggest insult is that the producers have gathered together an excellent cast of famous names and faces, only to mishandle them and let them sleepwalk through their respective roles on autopilot. Apart from the granite-jawed Stallone in the lead role, we have Diane Lane as the superfluous love interest who spends a large amount of screen time missing; Jurgen Prochnow (in his ""do anything for the money"" period) as the boring, ineffectual and forgettable bad guy; Max Von Sydow as Chief Justice, whose role amounts to little more than a cameo; and Joan Chen whose screen time is also minimal. The only people who seem to be trying are the not-too-irritating Rob Schneider as the comedy sidekick and Armand Assante as the crazed, ruthless villain.It's a shame as this movie is so poor, because the special effects are marvellous. The evocation of a futuristic cityscape is something that is done often in the movies and here it is most impressive. Also impressive are two robot creations (one CGI, one makeup) which act as adversaries for Stallone. The first is a gigantic, ED-209 style bodyguard for Assante, which lumbers through scenes shooting and tearing people limb from limb! Cool stuff and some fantastic CGI work. The second is an equally impressive android-man called Mean Machine who has a metal head and arm; he's one of the evilest robots that I've seen in a film, and it's a shame that he only appears in one scene. Sadly, as a whole JUDGE DREDD is a mess which glamourises death and violence so much that it doesn't mean anything in the end (by the time Stallone finishes slaughtering his 100th bad guy in EXACTLY THE SAME WAY you end up getting sick and tired of it all). COMMANDO this ain't. Instead, it's a time wasting big-budget flick which is impossible to enjoy with the brain engaged.",Judge Dredd
3,SnoopyStyle,Fun Camp,6,14 January 2014,"In the future, most of the world has become a desolate wasteland. The population is crowded into Mega Cities. However these city states turn chaotic and a new law & order system is established. Judges become the new police, jury, and executioners. The strictest of them all is Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone). Meanwhile dangerous criminal Rico (Armand Assante) has escaped from the Aspen Penal Colony. Rico has a past with Dredd, and there is sinister plan afoot. Dredd is framed for murder. While power mad Judge Griffin (Jürgen Prochnow) takes over the council after engineering the departure of Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow).This movie is camp of the highest order. The visual look is a mix of 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', and 'Escape from New York'. It is a good representation of its British comics roots. Sly is quite good as the stiff muscle bound Judge. It's the perfect role for him. Goofy Rob Schneider is kind of funny which only adds to the camp.The story is somewhat too complicated. It would probably be better to have just one villain. It doesn't help that Prochnow and Assante sort of have a similar look. They both excel playing the same character. For a comic book movie, a bit of simplification would probably help. It would be better to keep just one of them.",Judge Dredd
4,Prismark10,Judge Dredd,5,15 July 2020,"Danny Cannon has done very well being a television director and producer. He is the go to man to direct pilots of hit shows and it has brought him financial success.I think Cannon would trade it all for a burgeoning film career. In his 20s he would had loved to have been the next Ridley Scott making critically acclaimed action movies.Cannon was only 27 when Judge Dredd was released. It has a terrific opening sequence that is obviously inspired by Blade Runner. Unfortunately the rest of the film shows signs of studio interference and a director who is out of his depth.Everything from hiring Sylvester Stallone to the unmaking of Judge Dredd, because we are paying Stallone millions to appear in this movie and the audience wants to see his face. There is the comedy sidekick played by Rob Schneider because in those days, action films needed a comedy sidekick and at least Schneider is pretty restrained here. It could had been Pauly Shore in the role.An adaptation of the famous comic strip character. In a future where most of the world is a scorched wasteland. The population live in mega cities where there is disorder, recycled food that is good for the environment and ok to eat.Judges bring law and order to the chaotic mega cities. They are the the police, judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone) is the best known, strictest and the most powerful of the street judges. Now Dredd has been framed for murder, his Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow) pleads for his clemency and departs.It is all done as a power grab by one judge and they are aided by Rico (Armand Assante) a former judge now a convict.Part of it looks great. Stallone should had made a great Dredd but the movie has an uninspiring script and lots of camp. It has none of the edginess of the British comics. Although Stallone now claims the film turned out awful. I do wonder how much he is to blame by suggesting various changes as the film progressed.The casting of Max Von Sydow brings to mind another film he would later make. Minority Report which shares plot themes similar to Judge Dredd.After I watched Judge Dredd I discovered actor Maurice Roëves had died that day. He played the prison warden in the movie. Known for playing intense characters, he was always someone dedicated to his craft rather than turn up for the pay cheque.",Judge Dredd
5,classicsoncall,"""I am... the LAW!""",7,20 July 2017,"This film was panned pretty heavily by critics when it first came out, and like a lot of movies I've held off watching for just that reason, it turned out to be entertaining enough to have disregarded the naysayers. What you have to do perhaps, is go in with the idea that the film makers were going for camp value by putting Judge Dredd on screen, and in that regard, the picture can probably be deemed a success. Sylvester Stallone was a solid choice to portray the title character because he has that brooding, stoic look going for him, and who better to effect a character with no emotion who's only interest is in carrying out the law.Armand Assante, who portrayed Stallone's brother in 1978's ""Paradise Alley"", is teamed back up with him as a brother again of sorts. It's revealed that both were the experimental result of the Janus Project, a government program gone wrong and put to rest nine years earlier. Judge Dredd was the intended outcome of Janus, but Assante's Rico had a programming anomaly that made him a violent criminal. As I write this, an inconsistency in the story presents itself, in as much as Rico knew he wasn't human, whereas Dredd did not. I didn't pick up on that while watching, but it's more than evident if you think about it.The biggest surprise for this viewer that the movie had to offer was the strength of the supporting cast for what's nominally a popcorn flick promising over the top action and a requisite amount of explosives. You've got Jurgen Prochnow, Max von Sydow and Diane Lane in principal roles, no slouches when it comes to actors who've made their mark in much more prominent films. The one concession to the popcorn crowd would have been including Rob Schneider as somewhat of a comedic sidekick to the droll Judge Dredd. There were any number of times I thought Dredd might have squashed him like a bug, but in the end he served a fanboy purpose.I think I may have read all of one Judge Dredd comic book, so I don't know if humor played any part in their regular story lines, but I did find the occasional cultural references in the picture to be amusing, like the street corners of Abbott and Costello and Burns and Allen. I found Rico's comment about guilt and innocence to be a matter of timing as quite an intriguing concept, and even though the Mega-City presented in the story appeared to be entirely lawless, I found the admonition to 'Be kind to each other' played over and over again on the city's broadcast system as more than slightly ironic. However someone still needs to get back to me on the idea of 'recycled food'. What the heck would that be?",Judge Dredd
6,gavin6942,"Not Stallone's Best Futuristic, Renegade Cop Movie",4,27 September 2007,"In the future, the police are transformed into a unit that can both arrest a person for a crime and judge them for it. They can even execute them if necessary. One of the most noteworthy is Judge Joseph Dredd (Sylvester Stallone), who is hailed as a hero by some and a loose cannon by others. When he is arrested on charges of murder, he finds out the hard way that the law isn't always right.Although this film was fun and in general I enjoyed it, it really wasn't a very good film. Let's start listing why: first, the really bad CGI. Granted, this is 1995 and the budget is lower. But as I like to point out, ""Jurassic Park"" was 1993 and their effects are amazing (or even ""The Thing"" back in 1982). When the motorcycle is flying over the city, it shouldn't look more fake than ""E.T."" does -- that's just not believable for an audience.Rob Schneider's presence was a mystery. Was it good or bad? On the one hand, I love Rob Schneider. Sure, his humor is often stupid or juvenile, but he still appeals to me in some way. Yet, he made this movie which should have been dark and menacing (this is a bleak future) and made it a joke. Sometimes the comic relief just isn't necessary.And I hear it's a good thing I didn't read the comic. I thought the love interest aspect was unnecessary, and I guess that's even more true in the books. And they don't like it because he removes the helmet, although I think it served the plot well for this so that doesn't bother me. Probably wouldn't have even noticed, especially after seeing Matt Salinger in ""Captain America"".I didn't understand the pirate mutants. I had no problem with genetically engineering clones (although why a whole arm is needed for a blood sample is beyond me). I had no problem with robots and cyborgs, or the never-ending supply of Wild Turkey whiskey. But why are there pirate mutants with robotic parts who also happen to be cannibals? That just seemed like something that would never exist -- like Morlocks with cybernetic features. Cool but extremely unlikely.Diane Lane was fine as Judge Hershey. Armand Assante made a great Rico (Dredd's brother), but why not cast Frank Stallone? Credit must go to Max von Sydow as Chief Justice Fargo. I love Max and he really came through here, adding a seriousness that this film sorely lacked. He was the Ben Kenobi to Stallone's Skywalker and it was great to see that father/son bond. He needed a bigger part.You want to see Stallone as a renegade cop, see ""Cobra"". You want to see hi mas a futuristic cop, see ""Demolition Man"". You want to see hi mas a cop, see ""Cop Land"". This film is only something you need to see if you just can't get enough of Stallone as a cop, a future cop or a renegade cop. Because it's far from his best work.",Judge Dredd
7,jboothmillard,Judge Dredd,6,16 September 2008,"From director Danny Cannon (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Goal!, CSI shows), this is an explosive comic strip thriller. The film opens with narration from James Earl Jones, it is the future, 2139, and the Earth is populated with ""Mega Cities"", while the rest of the virtually uninhabitable planet is the ""Cursed Earth"". The justice system has also changed because of the high violent crime, with the three systems (police, jury and executioner) have now all become one person, these officers are known as the ""Judges"", and the most feared by all criminals is Judge Joseph Dredd (Sylvester Stallone, who was for reason nominated a Razzie). Then one day he is charged for murder, with both some video footage of him murdering reporter Vardas Hammond (Liar Liar's Mitchell 'Mitch' Ryan) and his wife, and the definite evidence of his DNA on the gun and bullets. Dredd does manage to escape the criminal carrying ship, going across the Cursed Earth, along with his ""judged"" prisoner Herman 'Fergie' Ferguson (Rob Schneider), and he is now determined to find the person who framed him. Chief Justice Fargo (Max Von Sydow) reveals to Dredd, before he dies, that he is in fact the result of an experiment to create the perfect judge, and it also resulted in him having a brother of the opposite side, who he thought was his student friend, Rico (Armand Assante). Anyway, now you get the DNA connection, Dredd will not stop till he has found his evil brother, who is planning to eradicate the Mega Cities with many clones of himself. Also starring Air Force One's Jürgen Prochnow as Judge Griffin, Diane Lane as Judge Hershey, Joanna Miles as Judge Evelyn McGruder, Joan Chen as Ilsa, Balthazar Getty as Olmeyer, The Blockheads' front man Ian Dury as Geiger and Christopher Adamson as Mean Machine. From the poster I saw, I thought this was an 80's film, it would make a bit more sense if it was, but anyway, filled with over-the-top destruction, snappy catchphrases, and some cool special effects, this is a fun enough (apparently underrated) action film. Good!",Judge Dredd
8,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of Judge Dredd,4,11 July 2006,"This was a loud, wild, silly, sophomoric science-fiction action film that had a number of good and bad points.THE GOOD - If you have a surround system, and particularly with a sub-woofer, the sound in here is excellent. For the most part, the film entertains and stays away from profanity until the last 15 minutes. Armand Assante plays a convincing villain.THE BAD - There is some stupid dialog, especially by Rob Schneider's character ""Fergie."" He isn't funny; he's just plain annoying. There's another cheap shot at Christians as the villain out in the desert is shown to be a ""Believer."" None of the good guys are, of course. This also has a script that isn't easy to follow and it gets too loud with too many explosions. That stuff wears thin after the first hour.OVERALL - The negatives outweigh the positives. There are so many other good action movies that I wouldn't waste your time with this.",Judge Dredd
9,Tweekums,Okay but nowhere near as good as 'Demolition Man',5,22 March 2011,"In the nineties Sylvester Stallone made two films with remarkable similar plots: 'Judge Dredd' and 'Demolition Man'. In both he plays an enforcer of the law in the future, in both a corrupt official releases a particularly dangerous criminal from a maximum security prison and in both he has a race to defeat his foe before he can release even more danger unfortunately the two films are not of equal quality and this is by far the weaker of the two. Stallone plays the eponymous Judge Dredd; a man who rigidly upholds the letter of the law until one day he finds himself sentenced for a murder he didn't commit. The DNA evidence seems irrefutable but he doesn't know he and the perpetrator are clones! The other clone is Rico, a man who has no respect for Dredd's beloved law. As Dredd is being transported to jail the transport shuttle is shot down and he and a petty criminal called Fergie are the sole survivors, they are captured by a group of cannibals but manage to escape and returned to the walled Mega City where they must confront Rico.On the plus side this film packs plenty of action into its short run time and Stallone isn't bad as Dredd even if his 'I knew you were going to say that' catch phrase is far from classic. Rob Schneider who plays Fergie is just irritating though; he is meant to provide comedy relief but is just irritating, Diane Lane is fairly good if terribly underused as Judge Hershey, the film might have been a lot better if her role had been expanded and Fergie dispensed with. The special effects were probably good at the time the film was made but many of them look rather dated now. If you want to see Stallone playing a hard hitting cop in the future you are far better off watching 'Demolition Man' it is much better. While this isn't terrible it isn't all that good either; certainly not as good as I'd expected when I first watched it.",Judge Dredd

11,BA_Harrison,Should have been so much better.,6,30 August 2009,"Mega City One's toughest cop, Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone), is framed for murder by his supposedly dead clone brother Rico (Armand Assante) and evil Chief Justice Griffin (Jurgen Prochnow), who intend to seize control of the city with an army of cloned judges under their control. Aided by cheeky, wise crackin' criminal Fergie (Rob Schneider) and loyal friends Judge's Fargo (Max Von Sydow) and Hershey (the lovely Diane Lane), Judge Dredd endeavours to thwart their dastardly plan.When 2000AD fan Danny Cannon secured the job of directing the big screen debut of comic book hero Judge Dredd, it was to be the realisation of a long-held dream (amazingly, his design for a Dredd movie poster had been printed in the galaxy's greatest comic 8 years earlier!).That dream was to turn into a nightmare, however, once production began: working from a script that displayed little respect for either the character or his many dedicated fans, and with a major star who demanded a say in creative matters, Cannon found himself struggling to deliver the movie he had envisioned. In short, the project was doomed to fail.It's a shame, because I've no doubt that if Cannon had been left to his own devices, he would have produced a masterpiece that would have not only satisfied long time fans of the comic strip, but also mainstream audiences who had probably never even heard of 2000AD's lawman of the future. The evidence is definitely there, in the pitch-perfect comic-book tone of the film, the incredible set designs, the confident handling of the action, and the excellent casting (Diane Lane as Hershey: great call!). Oh yes, Cannon was more than up to the task; it was Hollywood that killed Dredd.It was Hollywood that called for the inclusion of a comedy sidekick (indeed, Stallone himself suggested pal Rob Schneider for the role of Fergie); it was Hollywood that was responsible for the sacrilegious script that turned Chief Judge Griffin into a bad guy, killed off the Angel gang within minutes, and gave Dredd an annoying catchphrase (I knew they'd screw that up!); and it was Hollywood that demanded its expensive star to show his face, thus destroying an important part of the Dredd mythos.If, by some kind of miracle, another Dredd film ever goes into production, for Grud's sake, let's hope that Hollywood keeps its drokkin' nose out: that way, we might get the truly unmissable movie we deserve.I rate Judge Dredd 5.5 out of 10 ('mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but seriously flawed'), generously rounded up to 6 'cos I enjoyed seeing Diane Lane duke it out with Joan Chen.",Judge Dredd
12,BandSAboutMovies,Not my Dredd,2,17 August 2019,"Since the second issue of 2000 AD, Judge Dredd has ruled over the streets of Mega-City One, a domed city that contains most of the East Coast of America. The Judges are empowered to be judge, jury and executioner, keeping the lawless post-apocalyptic land of the future as safe as possible.This movie isn't anywhere near as beloved as the comic. Co-creator John Wagner said, ""I hated that plot. It was Dredd pressed through the Hollywood cliché mill, a dynastic power struggle that had little connection with the character we know from the comic."" He also added, ""The story had nothing to do with Judge Dredd, and Judge Dredd wasn't really Judge Dredd even though Stallone was perfect for the part.""Joseph Dredd (Stallone) assists first-year Judge Hershey (Diane Lane) in ending a block war (an uncredited James Remar appears in this scene). As Dredd and Hershey quell the rebellion, Herman ""Fergee"" Ferguson (Rob Schneider) is caught up in the arrests.Meanwhile, Judge Griffin (Jurgen Prochnow, Sutter Cane from In the Mouth of Madness) releases a former judge named Rico (Armand Assante), who just so happens to be Dredd's brother, from prison. He reactivates an ABC Warrior combat robot (another 2000 AD series) and murders Hammond (Mitchell Ryan, the Dark Shadows TV show and Dr. Wynn from Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers), a reporter who was critical of Dredd's methods.Dredd is put on trial by the Chief Judges, including the villainous Griffin and his mentor, Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow). To save our hero, Fargo agrees to step down and enacts the final service of all Judges - doing the long walk into the Cursed Earth while Dredd is sentenced to life in prison.Rico causes chaos while the cannibalistic Angel Gang attack's Dredd's transport to prison. Joining up with Fergee, they escape and are saved by the final sacrifice of Fargo, who is killed by Mean Machine Angel. Before dying, Fargo reveals that Dredd and Rico are the progeny of the Janus project, a genetic engineering effort to create the perfect judge. This explains why Dredd's DNA was at the crime scene, as Rico's is identical to his.Of course, Dredd has to come back and save Mega-City One, ending with a battle between the man who is the law and Rico atop the Statue of Liberty.To be perfectly honest, Judge Dredd is a mess. Even though it was made more than three years after Demolition Man, a film that it is quite similar to, it feels incredibly dated. The film gets the look of Mega-City One right, but none of the humor or nuance. That said, the Gianni Versace-designed costumes are awesome and I love that Adrienne Barbeau is the voice of computer at the Hall of Justice.The film has to be submitted to the MPAA five times to get an R rating when its goal was PG-13. And the constant creative disputes led director Danny Cannon to swear he'd never work with another big name actor. He's gone on to direct I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and Geostorm, as well as being a major part of the CSI and Gotham TV shows. Stallone wanted an action comedy film while Cannon wanted a darker, more satirical vision that was closer to the source material.Stallone would tell Uncut ""I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea; just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been.",Judge Dredd
13,Coventry,Judge Not-Dreadful (and he knew I'd say that!),6,20 March 2020,"Ah, the mid-nineties. An era yours truly mainly remembers for his sneaking into theaters to go and watch action, Sci-Fi and horror movies that he wasn't yet supposed to! ""Judge Dredd"" was one of them, since only audiences of 16 years and older were allowed to see it in my country. I still wonder why, because I always considered this film as half a comedy/spoof. The decors, scenery, action sequences and performances are incredibly over-the-top and, compared to the pitch-black and crude comic books, the script for this film added a completely useless and irritating goofy sidekick character in the shape of - God forbid - Rob Schneider. Apart from that, however, ""Judge Dredd"" is fantastically entertaining Sci-Fi/action fodder! Stallone is aptly cast as the emotionless, stoic and square-faced future law enforcer cleansing the ghetto streets of Mega City One. He gets framed by a corrupt supreme judge (Prochnow), exiled to the desert wastelands and replaced by his evil and genetically engineered twin brother Rico (Armand Assante). The undeniable highlights for me, being an incurable horror freak, are the encounter with the cannibal family in the desert and the moody ""awakening"" of the clones during the climax.

It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, Jürgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle.Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him.OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms....The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster.I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is.Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10",Judge Dredd
16,Theo Robertson,The Jury Is Still Out On This One,5,17 November 2002,"Can`t really say I was much of a fan of the JUDGE DREDD . My favourite 2OOO AD strip was INVASION ( That`s the one where Britain is is invaded and occupied by a bunch of commies from the central Volgan Republic ) so I wasn`t going to judge ( Geddit ? ) the film version as some sort of comic book geek , but even so I found Danny Cannon`s film version disappointing . I know he`s trying to do a film based on a comic strip but he does so too literally , there`s no character development , the villain is just sooooooo evil because he kills everyone he comes across , makes the occasional wise crack while commiting murder and gives an silly evil laugh and shouts very loudly when riled . But Cannon and the screenwriters fail to introduce the razor sharp satire and gut wrenching irony that made the strip such a success so you`ve got a film that won`t really appeal to either the average cinema goer or fans of the comic strip .I doubt if anyone will ever bother making another DREDD movie but if they do I think Paul Verhoeven directing a script much closer in feel to the strip ( Only the scene involving the preacher in his cave with his sons feel like they came out of the strip ) could be a major blockbuster hit . As it stands the 1995 version isn`t much cop ( Geddit ? )",Judge Dredd
17,Scarecrow-88,Judge Dredd,4,10 January 2015,"Comic book hokum that pales in comparison to what we have been fortunate to see a lot of in multiplexes of today has Sylvester Stallone as the titled character barely ever wearing his helmet as one of many ""judges"" that are the judge, jury, and executioner of those who are found guilty according to the law. Armande Assante is his ""brother"" (created through a clone project called Janus), however, Dredd is unaware of this until much later when his mentor (and ""father"" in some respects) reveals the Janus clone project to him as he lays dying. Jürgen Prochnow is Judge Griffin, a corrupt judge wanting the Janus project restarted so he can have an army of clone judges under his own maniacal rule, allowing the release of Assante's highly unstable Rico so that he can see all those who stand in his way (judges of stature and lawful repute) are put away. So Stallone (thanks to Assante's having relatable DNA) is set up as the murderer of a reporter (Mitchell Ryan) considered a major critic of Dredd's, sentenced to life imprisonment (a camera caught Rico disguised as Dredd, wearing Dredd's badge, with Ryan calling out his name before being obliterated), is fortunate that a family of cannibalistic, scavenging, murdering fiends (led by Scott Wilson!) blow down his prison transfer ship. Narrowly escaping them, with his mentor (Max Von Sydow, in a film that's a far cry of his work with Ingmar Bergman) not so lucky thanks to a barely-held-together cyborg, Dredd, accompanied by a weasel sidekick Rob Snyder (I can only imagine his casting made fans of the comic cringe), will seek out Rico and Griffin to restore justice and the law. Mostly a reason to have ""hi-tech"" weaponry destroying structures and people, and actors intensely delivering lines in over-the-top fashion (especially Assante, who has zero restraint), ""Judge Dredd"" is all explosions and dead bodies in Judge costumes. There is Diane Lane as an advocate of Dredd's who failed to save him from a prison sentence eventually joining forces with him, and Joan Chen as a supporter of Griffin's, both of who duke it out eventually. And, obviously Stallone and Assante fight it out at the top of a ""moved"" Statue of Liberty in the heart of the city. This film is almost ""Demolition Man"", substituting Assante with Snipes, except without the sense of humor and satirical future comedy. Assante wishes to clone his ""corrupt and free"" DNA and create an army of his own psychopaths to be commanded by Stallone! The detail regarding Dredd ""judging"" Rico is an important plot point that drives home the tension and rage that exists between them. A lot of action bluster and a waste of talent such as Lane and Von Sydow. Definitely one of Stallone's worst 90s films. This features voicework from James Earl Jones and Adrienne Barbeau. Assante is rather embarrassingly hammy as the villain, and Schneider as the miniscule low-scale crook tries to liven scenes as Stallone skulks and wears his scowl. Some decent effects of the city, travel cycles, and weapons help a little but not much.",Judge Dredd
18,Hey_Sweden,Not really all that bad. It shows movie goers a reasonably good time.,6,11 March 2018,"Big budget, major studio adaptation of a beloved cult sci-fi comic book takes place in a Dystopian future, where populations are crowded into massive ""Mega Cities"" and the main form of law enforcement consists of ""Judges"" - bike riding officers who are empowered to act as judge, jury, *and* executioner, all in one. The most feared and legendary of them all is Judge Joseph Dredd (Sly Stallone), who ends up framed for the murder of a crusading reporter (top character actor Mitchell Ryan). Dredd is able to escape transport to prison, uniting with a goofy low rent criminal named Fergie (Rob Schneider) and heading for an inevitable confrontation with a megalomaniac named Rico (Armand Assante, hamming it up like there's no tomorrow).It's understandable that purists will take some exception to this adaptation and greatly prefer the 2012 feature film version (starring Karl Urban as Dredd). But the 1995 ""Judge Dredd"" does attempt to give people their money's worth. There's lots of hard-edged action, a non-stop assortment of razzle-dazzle futuristic images (utilizing what was then cutting-edge CGI), an ominous music score by Alan Silvestri, some entertaining characters, and great costumes. The plot is nothing special, but is not hard to follow, as it centers on a conspiracy where a ruling Council tried to play God, and ended up with a mess on their hands.Sly doesn't have to stretch himself here, getting to play a rough and tough and VERY stoic man of action who thinks that having emotions is key to getting a person killed. Adding the humanity is lovely Diane Lane as a fellow Judge who proves to be completely loyal. Schneiders' comedy relief may be a matter of personal taste; although not generally appreciated, this viewer found him to be at least mildly funny and not unlikeable.The excellent supporting cast includes such luminaries as Max von Sydow, Jurgen Prochnow, Joan Chen (who's under-utilized), and Joanna Miles, with ever-wonderful von Sydow coming off the best. Other familiar faces like Ewen Bremner and Angus MacInnes turn up. Making uncredited contributions are James Earl Jones (who reads the opening narration), James Remar (as a block warlord), and 'The Walking Dead's' Scott Wilson as Pa Angel. (And that's one thing that this viewer did appreciate about this film version: the presence of the desert-dwelling, degenerate Angel family.)Overall, colourful entertainment that may indeed play like a video game, but it's certainly never boring.Six out of 10.",Judge Dredd
19,poolandrews,"""I'm alive... oh, so are you"". I rather liked it.",7,6 December 2006,"Judge Dredd tells the story of human society in the near future, the entire world population has been crammed into a few 'Mega Cites' where millions of people live, outside the confines of these man made cities is what's now know as 'The Cursed Earth' our once green beautiful plant has become a hostile wasteland. Living inside these Mega Cities isn't easy & someone has to try & control the unruly locals, step in the likes of Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone) who have the power to try, convict & sentence. Dredd is feared throughout Mega City 1 as being very harsh & tough on criminals, that is why his brother Rico (Armand Assante) devises a plan to frame Dredd for murder, cause unrest & retaliation amongst the population & try to get a genetic cloning program called 'Janus' reopened by misguided Judge Grffin (Jurgen Prochnow) so he can use the technology for his own evil plans in an attempt to create a genetically cloned army of himself to help him gain complete control over Mega City 1, however Judge Dredd has other ideas...Directed by Danny Cannon I'm going to have to go against the general opinion here (as usual) & I'm going to say that I really rather enjoy Judge Dredd as a film & for that I apologise to no one. The script by William Wisher & Steven E. de Souza moves along at a nice pace, tells a decent enough story although it doesn't match the darkly clever comic book equivalent by any stretch of the imagination & generally speaking it entertains throughout. I liked the character's for what they were, Dredd is a tad clichéd as he starts out tough but ends up showing some emotion while I quite liked the usually annoying Rob Schneider's comic relief character & Rico was an OK if somewhat unimaginative villain, I'd have loved to have seen Judge Death & his mates but I guess we can't always have what we want can we. The story lacks a certain political or satirical angle which it could have used to great effect, I must admit that I used to read the Judge Dredd comics when was younger & while I have't read any in donkey's years I have always remembered the story with Judge Death, no idea why I just have. Anyway, I can probably see why many dislike the somewhat standard American action film that the Judge Dredd name has been turned into here but when all said & done I thought it was a good watch & I enjoyed it & that's all that matters to me.Director Cannon does a good job, the special effects are still pretty good even now as they mix CGI, model work & live action. The whole look & feel is here, sure the helmets look a bit daft but otherwise the film hasn't dated badly at all & it still looks impressive. A special mention goes to the huge war robot who is totally cool. There is one part that I've never got, that's when Rico hatches the clone early & we see at last one sit up in it's pod but then they are never seen or referred to again, I suspect that more was filmed but ended up being cut out, a theory that would seem to be backed up by the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section. The film has a few violent moments & sufficient amount of action.Wit a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 Judge Dredd obviously has that Hollywood polish to it & is very well made with neat special effects that hold up even today. The acting was alright, Stallone makes for a good Dredd as he has to be virtually emotionless throughout.Judge Dredd seems to have a bad reputation which to an extent I can understand but I don't care about what anyone else thinks, I liked Judge Dredd for what it is & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Personally despite the lapse in logic at the end I think it's well worth a watch",Judge Dredd

It looks great, it looks wonderful. It is shown repeatedly from only one angle. You never really move off this one street, and you never change perspective, it always the same shots from the same angles probably because they couldn't shoot it any other way.Its not as bad as you've heard, but its not good.

The sets, costumes, and props are all appreciably well-made. Unfortunately they are filmed in such a way to make the whole thing look kind of cheesy. There's no craftsmanship in the direction. The performances are mostly tongue-in-cheek. This was made at a time when, despite Batman's success, comic book movies were still being treated as a joke by the industry. This campy approach is the movie's biggest flaw. Sylvester Stallone plays the whole thing like a parody. Rob Schneider is the completely unnecessary comic relief. He's terrible in every way. Diane Lane plays the 'sort of' friend/love interest. Not exactly on the list of her career high points. Jurgen Prochnow, Armand Assante, and venerable Max Von Sydow are all better than the material they're given. James Remar has a brief but memorably awful performance at the beginning of the movie.

22,zardoz-13,Terrific Sci-Fi Thriller,8,21 September 2012,"""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" director Danny Cannon's larger-than-life crime thriller ""Judge Dredd"" introduced movie audiences to the futuristic apocalyptic comic book hero who appeared initially in the British science fiction comic anthology ""2000 AD"" back in 1977. Cannon's fast-paced but formulaic cinematic adaptation toplines Sylvester Stallone as the eponymous policeman who serves not only as a judge and jury but also as an executioner. Indeed, Judge Joseph Dredd can impose an immediate death sentence on a criminal that he encounters on the street if the crime calls for such a consequence. Comparatively, in terms of sci-fi, ""Judge Dredd"" resembles ""Blade Runner"" partially because the action occurs in a dystopian future where overpopulation and anarchy plague a mega-metropolis. Citizens fly around in cars and motorcycles. ""Terminator"" scenarist William Wisher and ""Commando"" writer Steven E. de Souza have created a textbook perfect melodrama that neatly deploys exposition without interfering with the momentum of narrative. Cannon orchestrates the action with speed and clarity so this obstreperous, overwrought, 96-minute epic never wears out its welcome. Wisher and de Souza have fashioned a gripping actioneer with charismatic characters that boasts the kind of outlandish violence, suspense, tension characteristic of an Indiana Jones cliffhanger and a sense of sarcasm that makes this predictable but entertaining fare enjoyable. Stallone's co-stars include Armand Assante as our hero's chief adversary and he is no slouch. Rob Schneider provides the comic relief, while Diane Lane backs up Stallone as more than just a pretty face. Max von Sydow and Jürgen Prochnow portray Stallone's superiors on the council who are concealing a secret about the relationship between Judge Dredd and his brother Judge Rico. Unfortunately, ""Judge Dredd"" failed to generate the critical and audience appeal necessary to justify a sequel, but it still surpasses the most recent live-actioneer version ""Dredd.""",Judge Dredd

This is a fun ride from start to finish. From the opening moments, with a brief introduction to the world presented herein, by the booming, powerful voice of none other than James Earl Jones, to the very end, it's entertaining. The pacing is fast and good, the film neither overwhelms nor lulls the viewer to sleep. The plot is actually pretty good, well thought-out, though I guess it may not be the most original. Stallone does well, and the relationship between him and Schneider(who, well, he does well, as well... well) is quite funny(in general, the humor is nicely done and tends to work). Assante makes up for whatever acting talent he may lack by bringing a lot of energy and passion to his performance, with great results. Prochnow proves here that The House of The Dead was more Uwe Boll's fault than his. Max von Sydow is marvelous as always, and if anyone's wondering what he's doing in this, hey, it's not the only role he's done in a film that isn't all serious(and this never intends, or claims, to be)... the man was in a Bond flick, for crying out loud. Keep your eyes open for Balthazar Getty in a fairly small role. The film has its share of one-liners. The action is cool and well-done. As others have said, the effects hold up well, and production design is quite well-done. It's a sure way to spend an hour and a half being entertained.

Of these judges, Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone) is the top dog.The whole judge system is threatened with collapse when someone posing as Judge Dredd kills a reporter and he is summarily convicted.""Judge Dredd"" was pretty good. The future doesn't look so bright. Crime and corruption are constants in any era, but I'd expect the future to be a little better technologically and even legally. I think the movie benefited from the addition of Rob Schneider as the comedic sidekick. Sly is great as an automaton type, as Judge Dredd was, but that can get old and tired.The bad guys in the movie were far from subtle.

25,neil-476,Underrated,7,11 April 2011,"The Judge Dredd comic strips offers up a post-apocalyptic world where urban American sprawl has gone berserk, development has gone upwards because radioactive fallout limits outwards, there is huge overpopulation, lawlessness is rife, and maintenance of law and order in Megacity One is given over to The Judges - law enforcement officers with the authority to be judge, jury - and executioner. It is a precarious profession, and legendary among the Judges is Dredd, whose summary judgements are particularly lacking in mercy.It is worth pointing out that, notwithstanding its notional North American location, there is something peculiarly and resolutely English about the comic.This movie adaptation gets most things right, and stands as a fairly satisfactory science fiction action thriller in its own right. The depiction of the Judges, Megacity One, and all the trimmings is spot on.Stallone is an inspired piece of casting, too - with his helmet on he absolutely IS Dredd. However, he does take his helmet off quite a lot of the time, which is absolutely NOT the comic Dredd. I can forgive him that in the interests of an entertaining movie.Rob Schneider is somewhat less easy to forgive. Fergie, in the comic, may have elements of light relief, but he isn't the wisecracking clown Schneider portrays. Which matters not a jot to the ticket buying public, most of whom will have no idea that there ever was a Fergie elsewhere than in the movie.The story is effective (with part of it taking place in the radioactive wastelands outside the city), the casting is excellent, and the whole thing is a decent romp.One understands that Stallone and director Danny Cannon did not get on.

Unfortunately, a criminal mastermind named ""Rico"" (Armand Assante) has plans to take him off of the streets permanently by framing him for a murder he did not commit--and only Judge Fargo and a fellow colleague named ""Judge Hershey"" (Diane Lane) believe him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was-yet another-film based on a comic book and it captured the essence and the environment rather well for the most part. Yet, even though he had a good cast to work with, the director (Danny Cannon) chose to utilize action and CGI to the exclusion of everything else and the film suffered as a result. Likewise, although it started off rather well, it became rather predictable toward the end and for that reason I deducted a point or two off the overall rating. Slightly above average.",Judge Dredd

We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo.So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others.

And then there is Stallone, who is speaking less clearly with every movie that he makes.  The plot seems more fit for a sequel as we are only briefly introduced to Dredd and learn what he is as he is framed rather quickly.

Y'ask me, it makes the movie. The most fun I had was drinking in the sets and architecture. The movie has its problems, sure, but you can see where the money went.2. Who the hell was in charge of music? You've got a big Summer action movie - a Stallone actioner, no less - and you bring on the end credits with the muscular sounds of . . . The Cure? C'mon, someone should've been fired for that one.Putting aside those stray observations, I've gotta be honest, I vastly prefer the Karl Urban movie. Now, even I know that it's not really fair to compare them (they're just two completely different beasts), but it still colors my impression while revisiting this one. I think it's more fair to compare this to ""Demolition Man"", something that better uses Stallone's talents. He just felt more at home there. The humor is also hit-or-miss. Rob Schneider isn't annoying, but most of his jokes don't land.But it all comes down to the look of the movie, and there's a strange apocalyptic vibe coming off of this, while even the opening credits are touting Versace as the costume designer.6/10",Judge Dredd

32,JamesHitchcock,A Hymn to Fascism,4,29 April 2005,"Judge Dredd owes his origins to a British science-fiction comic book named 2000 AD, although the series is set considerably further into the future than that date, at some time in the 22nd century, a time when most of the earth's surface has been laid waste (presumably by a nuclear holocaust, although this is not made clear in the film) and, apart from a few outlaws, virtually the entire population lives in a number of huge mega-cities. It is never explained where, in a world without farmland, the food to feed all these people is produced. The action of the film takes place in ""Mega-City One"", a hugely expanded New York. This is a violent place where order is maintained by the Judges, a group of men and women who not only exercise judicial functions but also the functions of police and lawyers. The senior Judges also act as the society's politicians and rulers. The title character is the city's most famous Judge, a man known for his incorruptibility as well as his stern and unbending approach to law and order. The plot concerns an attempt by a group of corrupt Judges, including Dredd's evil brother Rico, to frame him for murder and thereby pave the way to a seizure of power.This is one of a number of science-fiction films that portray the future as a sort of high-tech City of Dreadful Night. Like Tim Burton's ""Batman"" films and Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", it is set against a dark, gloomy urban landscape. ""Blade Runner"" seems to have been the strongest visual influence on ""Judge Dredd"", but the two films are very different. In ""Blade Runner"" (by far the better of the two), the gloomy look corresponded to an equally gloomy, pessimistic moral atmosphere. ""Judge Dredd"", however, was clearly intended as a more straightforward, bad-guys-against-good-guys, type of thriller.I say ""intended"", because in my eyes this intention was never successfully realised. Although Dredd is not a villain in the way that Rico is a villain, a man who deliberately commits evil deeds in pursuit of his own self-interest, I could not see him as a hero either. His main qualities are incorruptibility and a rigid adhesion to the letter of the law, but despite this he still comes across as a deeply unsympathetic character. The problem is that his is a society where democracy has been dispensed with, where political power is concentrated in the hands of a small, self-perpetuating elite, where peremptory justice is dealt out to alleged wrongdoers, where the people have no say in how they are governed; in short, a dictatorship. It is hard to make the loyal servant of a dictatorial system into a sympathetic character, and matters are not helped by Stallone's deliberately emotionless, unsmiling interpretation of the title role. (None of the other acting contributions stood out except for the irritating one from Rob Schneider as Dredd's petty-criminal sidekick Fergie, which stood out for all the wrong reasons.) The original comic strip had a strongly satirical bent and encapsulated what was quite a common British view in the seventies and eighties of America, particularly of urban America and above all of New York, seen as a lawless urban jungle ruled by gangsters and where the only order was provided by a corrupt and brutal police force, only marginally less criminal than those against whom they fought. This view contained elements of both left-wing anti-Americanism and British patriotism of the ""Our unarmed bobbies would never behave like those trigger-happy Yankee cops"" variety. The Dredd comic strip represents the urban jungle view of America projected forward into a dystopian future.This is perhaps an example of a film that was made in the wrong place and in the wrong time; a British version made, say, ten years earlier might have been more interesting. Unfortunately, the British film industry of the eighties rarely had either the budgets or the self-confidence to tackle a large-scale science-fiction project, and so the responsibility fell to the American industry. For obvious reasons, Hollywood preferred to tone down any elements of anti-American satire, and by the time the film was actually made the world had moved on. After the end of the Cold War, post-apocalyptic scenarios were no longer so fashionable, and in the Giuliani era of the nineties New York's crime problems no longer seemed as insoluble as they once had. The solution seemed to be to make the film as a sort of futuristic Western, with Dredd as the guy in the white hat, but the result reads, probably inadvertently, more like a hymn in praise of Fascism. There have been other recent films which have revealed a certain sympathy for authoritarian methods of government; ""First Knight"" and ""The Last Samurai"" were examples, but in those cases the impact was lessened by a historical or exotic setting. A science-fiction film which presents an authoritarian society not as a dystopia but as a viable option for the future is, to say the least, disturbing. 4/10",Judge Dredd
33,bowmanblue,Not as bad as people would have you imagine,7,27 July 2019,"I have no idea about the comic book 2015's 'Judge Dredd' was based on, so I can't say how well it compares to the source material, however, all I know is that it was met with quite a degree of disdain at the time of its release. From what I gathered it was largely down to the fact that the titular character never takes his mask off, whereas Sylvester Stallone (who plays the man in question) spends the majority of the film running around without any form of facial covering (or Judge armour!). However, if you can get past that (and I assume most of us non die-hard cinema-goers can) then you'll at least find a competent little action/sci-fi film here somewhere.In the near future overpopulation has forced the majority of human life to be based around various giant 'Megacities' while the vast surrounding area is all desert. To maintain law, 'Judges' are allowed to be judge, jury and - if necessary - executioner. And, the most famous of all these 'Judges' is - you guessed it - Judge Dredd.No sooner are we introduced to him, does he end up getting framed for a crime he didn't commit and forced to go on the run. This is therefore the part where Stallone ditches all recognisable Judge Dredd garments in favour of a simple vest and tight trousers. I suppose it would be like the level of criticism leveled at 'Iron Man 3' when you barely see the character in his most famous outfit throughout the whole film. Anyway, Dredd has to do the usual things a character in his position has to, i.e. escape, unravel the conspiracy, prove his innocence and get the bad guy.Yeah, it's all kind of run-of-the-mill, but it's definitely not as bad as many made out it to be. The sets are great and it's nice to see practical effects instead of today's computer-generated versions of giant futuristic cities. A few of the visual effects do look a little dated now, especially the blue-screens behind the characters during chase scenes, but it was 1995.Stallone does as good as he does in most action films. Unfortunately, he's just Stallone rather than the character fans came to see. Therefore, this is probably more one for his audience than those of the comic book character. There's a minor love interest and the bad guy (plus his female helper). None of those really stand out, but there's a giant evil robot who's cool without having half the lines the human actors get. Then you have Rob Schneider - an actor known for his low brow comedy films. Here, he's the 'comic relief' and his 'comedy' kind of wears off quicker than the film-makers probably would have liked. I'm surprised he's not mentioned more when it comes to film's 'most annoying characters ever,' as - in my opinion - he's well up there with Jar Jar Binks.Anyway, if you like sci-fi, action, Stallone or films with practical effects you should get something out of this. However, if you're a fan of the 'Judge Dredd' comic book, it looks like you're best off waiting a couple of decades until Karl Urban dons the outfit.",Judge Dredd
34,ericstevenson,Could've been better or worse,5,27 April 2016,"I guess if I was a fan of the ""Judge Dredd"" comics, I would have disliked this more. From what I saw, it isn't really THAT bad. It's really cheesy and over the top, but it is kind of entertaining in that way. Don't get me wrong, I still wouldn't recommend this film, but it's not quite as bad as people see. I mean, a movie that pairs Rob Schneider and Sylvester Stallone is pretty much doomed to fail. There are so many ways to make this better. And wouldn't you know it? They did make it better with the new Dredd movie...even though I personally wouldn't quite recommend that either.It tells the story of Judge Dredd, who's framed for a murder by his evil brother, Rico. I guess it's hard to hate this movie, because there really is the sense that it was never intended to be anything that good. I will compliment this film on having some great settings. I mean, this film is truly beautiful to look at! These are backgrounds and sets that really hold up! It really does make me miss the designs of the mid 1990's. Yeah, Rob Schneider's quite annoying, but at least he has more serious actors to work off of, I guess. A lot of what they do is actually pretty creative and the characters are kind of colorful.It's still way too hard to take seriously. Stallone's dialogue is way too silly to care. I believe that this guy was nominated for the most Razzies. My advice is just ignore this one, but I can see how some people would consider it a guilty pleasure. I just wish we could have seen those clones fight at the end. Those last scenes had so much potential!",Judge Dredd
35,callanvass,Did the law have to be this dull?,4,14 November 2013,"I saw this a year ago, and absolutely hated it. I was honestly bored to tears, and felt Stallone was miscast. I got the feeling as of late I was a bit too harsh on the movie, and maybe I was missing something. I popped in my DVD, and gave it another whirl. I was both correct and wrong with my original feelings on the movie. I was correct with my initial thoughts, being that this movie isn't very good. It's rather murky and kind of dull as well, but it wasn't the disaster as I initially felt either. It has elaborate production values, and the futuristic setting is especially well done. My problem with this movie is that it's so serious I ended up becoming rather bored. The average action scenes don't exactly help. I honestly can't think of one action scene that stood out in this film. This movie was troubled right from the outset. Sly Stallone & Danny Cannon clashed over the movie, and egos ended up prevailing. Why on earth was Rob Schneider in this movie? For some reason during Stallone's comeback in the mid 90's, he was somewhat of a fixture in Stallone movies, including Demolition Man. I'm a die hard fan of Stallone's. I collect everything he's in, whether it's good or bad, so naturally I picked this up on DVD. It pains me to do this, but Stallone shouldn't have been cast as Judge Dredd.It's not that he's bad, he just felt so out of place, and unsure on how to portray the role. He has moments of greatness, but he plays it too straight faced, and lacks the lovable Stallone humor that I am accustomed too. He has cheesy lines, such as ""I am the law!"" ""I knew you'd say that"" but he's a bit of a stickler overall, and I had trouble warming up to him. I realize he's supposed to be void of emotion as Dredd, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. This isn't one of his best performances. His subtle romance with Diane Lane felt pretty contrived as well. Speaking of Diane Lane She is hotter than donut grease, but I didn't buy her performance. She felt very awkward as an action type, but she was amazing to look at, so I didn't pay much attention to it. Armand Assante is very OTT as the villain, and the shoddy brother storyline with Stallone did me no favors. I really didn't get what made him tick. He's fun to watch at times, don't get me wrong, but he's clearly hamming it up. Max Von Sydow is barely in the movie, and serves as a mentor for Stallone. Final Thoughts: This was much too heavy handed to be enjoyable. For die hard Stallone fans, I guess it's worth a look if you have nothing else to do, but don't expect that much. It's pretty mediocre4.2/10",Judge Dredd
36,ironhorse_iv,1995's Judge Dredd isn't the law. It's the flaw.,5,8 March 2016,"Created by comic book writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, and first appeared in the second issue of 1977's 2000 AD, a weekly British science-fiction anthology comic book magazine. Judge Dredd is that magazine's longest-running character. He became so popular, that in 1995, a movie was made about him with top action star, Sylvester Stallone in the main role. Directed by Danny Cannon, and set in the not-so distance future, Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland. While some humans manage to survive in the barren ""Cursed Earth"", the majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities where crime has risen to ungodly levels due to over-population and the lack of resources. To combat crime, the traditional justice system has been replaced by a corps of Judges whose role combines those of police officer, judge, jury, and executioner. This is the world that Judge Joseph Dredd (Sylvester Stallone) lives. Things get worst for Judge Dredd, when a former Judge name Rico (Armand Assante), escape from prison, and frame him for the murder of a new reporter. Now imprisoned, Judge Dredd must go against the system of law, in order to prove his innocent, while also stopping Rico from his evil plan of taking over the world. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the plot has way too much elements from a bunch of different arcs from the comic book, including The Return of Rico (Dredd's corrupt twin brother Rico returns from a prison colony to get revenge), The Day the Law Died (an insane and tyrannical senior Judge seizes power), The Cursed Earth (Dredd traverses the bombed out territory outside the city), The Judge Child Quest (Dredd encounters the cannibalism family), and Oz (Dredd thwarts a plot to conquer the city with an army of clones). It was a mess. It lead to many plot-holes, like how Judge Largo's DNA (Max Von Sydow) isn't shown to be relation to Dredd in the trial, nor the fact, that the Janus cloning project was hidden from most of the Judges. Also, when you think, deep about it. It doesn't much sense for them to have this technology in the environment in which this movie is set in. How did they do it, with limited resources!? Also, why? Over-population is already a problem. Why, add more people? Yes, I guess, it would be, easier to control the population, if you replace them, with mindless clones, but if they had the power to genetic engineer people, you would think, maybe they would use that resources for better use; like I don't know, solving the barren wasteland, by genetic engineering food and crops. In my opinion, this cloning sub-plot seem unrealistic and ridiculous, for even for the Dredd comic. The whole cloning arc was never my favorite from the comics. Nevertheless, I also didn't like some of their changes from the comics like how Judge Griffin (Jurgen Prochnow), is now a villain. Wasn't he originally part of Dredd's main allies in the comics? Honestly, they should had call him, Judge Cal in the movie. It would make more sense since he's a villain from the comics. Another thing, I didn't like, about the movies, is how Dredd is willing to kill his former buddies, the judges in able to prove his innocent. He rarely did that in the book. Isn't the point of this film is show that Dredd can act more human, rather than a totalitarian figure piece? He seems more-cruel now without the law, then the beginning of the movie. Despite the over-used of catch phrases and one-liners and the slurping of certain words, Sylvester Stallone does make a good Dredd. He does have the built at the time. I just wish, the movie didn't allow the character to removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. Another thing, I wish the movie kept, was the Rated R violence. It need to be grounded and gritty. This movie should had never been PG-13 with the over-the-top and clichés action. The source material was mature, gritty and gory for a reason. The world is supposed to be dark and depressing. The Judge Dredd comic strips were originally conceived as UK satires of the Thatcher government and its authoritarian police like state. It was then put in a Reagan-era fantasy about the liquidation of the underclass. It's supposed to incorporating obvious fascism, but it's never truly mention in the film. Instead, the movie makes the Judges seem like the good guys. Also, the movie made Mega City look way too futuristic, for a society that is supposedly on the brick of collapse. As much, as those things were jarring. The worst thing about this movie had to be the Rob Schneider's comedy relief character, Herman Ferguson. Yes, I know that his character was in the original comic, but Rob Schneider's performance as Fergie is annoying. Plus, his character in this, is pretty much, useless. In the comic, he was a muscle bound mutant, not a wimp. There is little to no reason for Dredd to care for him, here. I know, a lot of critics, has also bash, Armand Assante's performance as the villain, because how hammy, he was, but in my opinion, he was alright. The world of Judge Dredd is full of out of their mind, villains. I just wish, the movie choose Judge Cal over Judge Rico. It would make the film, a lot more fun. Overall: The film has a certain comedic and entertainment value that for reasons, outside, my views, people has find fascistic to the point that it has been call a 'guilty pleasure'. However, I don't share that same view. In my opinion, the movie is garbage. If you want to see it, go ahead, but in my view, check it out 2012's Dredd, instead. It's closer to the source material than this trash. This movie is dreadful.",Judge Dredd
37,slightlymad22,A Missed Opportunity,5,29 January 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 1995's Judge Dredd.Plot In A Paragraph: Judge Dredd, (a blue eyed Stallone) is convicted for a crime he did not commit, and he must fight to clear his name. Armand Assante (an actor I normally like) tries too hard and over acts awfully, but he is not alone. Diane Lane and Max Von Sydow apart, the acting is bad, bad, bad (Stallone included) In the Dredd comics, tradition dictates that Dredd does not off his helmet, thus his face has mostly only fleetingly appeared in full, but this mean Stallone would never show his face clearly, so to placate his ego, 15 minutes in to the movie and the helmet is off. It's a shame this movie doesn't work, as Sly looks the part, and it could have been a franchise. However the ball is dropped and he must take the lions share of the blame.In interviews, Stallone said he felt the film was supposed to be a comedy/action film, and demanded rewrites to make it even more comedic. The director and screenwriter, however, had intended a darker approach, which led to many difficulties behind the scenes.Director Danny Cannon was so disheartened over his constant creative disputes with Stallone that he swore he would never again work with another big-name actor. He also claimed that the final version was completely different from the script, due to the changes Stallone demanded.",Judge Dredd

James Remar, Diane Lane, Max Von Sydow, Armand Assante, Jürgen Prochnow, Scott Wilson, Joan Chen, and Rob Schneider were all good! The costumes and action were terrific! The ABC Robot was fantastic! The music by Alan Silvestri is tremendous! In My opinion Judge Dredd is an underrated and misunderstood film that deserves a lot more than it has received! The movie is a must see!",Judge Dredd
40,zkonedog,A Comic Book Hero Nobody Cares About,2,11 March 2017,"The problem with this movie is simple: nobody cares about Judge Dredd.For a basic plot summary, this film is set in an American future where the rule of law is enforced by ""Judges"", who skip trials and act as judge, jury, and executioners. When the finest of all these futuristic law-enforcers, Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone), is set up and put away for murder, the shady past of the Judge System is finally brought out into the light.Though Judge Dredd may be listed (according to Wikipedia) as the seventh-greatest comic book character, his appeal isn't nearly broad enough to draw in the audience needed to make this film work. When it comes to comic books, it's pretty much Batman, Superman, Spidey, X-Men, and then everybody else. Director Danny Cannon does a decent job of creating an over-the-top comic book adaptation, but unless you are familiar with the Judge Dredd world established in the comics, this film will leave you confused, bored, and severely disappointed.The acting in the film is also terrible. Stallone does little more than shout ""I am...the law"" multiple times and flex his huge arms while shooting automatic weapons. One has to wonder how a serious actress like Diane Lane got caught up in this dreck. Plus, can you really take any movie seriously if it includes Rob Schneider in more than a cameo role?Thus, I consider this to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and one that unless you are a ""Judge Dredd nut"" (which excludes roughly 99% of the population), you should avoid at pretty much all costs. Go see Demolition Man instead.",Judge Dredd

42,Vartiainen,Great camp value,6,8 September 2016,"Okay, it's not a good movie. The story is full of plot holes, the characters are very shallow, the world is not build properly and overall it's just... silly. But that's what makes it enjoyable. It's pure 90s in the best possible way, from the absolutely ridiculous costumes to the hammy dialogue to the deliveries by some of the machoest actors alive at that point. (I'm looking at you, Stallone.)So, the story. The movie is based on Judge Dredd comics, which feature a harsh dystopian future where society has crumbled to a point where the only way to uphold any semblance of law is to roll the judge, jury and executioner into one. Thus, the Judges, law keepers entrusted with keeping the peace through overwhelming force. The most effective of them of course being the eponymous Judge Dredd, played in this instance by Sylvester Stallone. And no, it's not a very good Judge Dredd adaptation. Sure, the world is similar enough, but the main character is horrible represented. Dredd in the comics is a very solemn character, never taking off his helmet. He's the avatar of law, an impersonal force of nature. Whereas Stallone is... well, Stallone, one of the hammiest action stars ever to fill the silver screen.But by heavens if he is not enjoyable to watch. The whole movie is one giant camp festival from start to finish. It's silly to the extreme and it knows it. Throw in some pretty decent special effects for mid-90s and you have a movie that has all the makings of a guilty pleasure classic.If you're a die-hard Judge Dredd fan, steer clear. If you're just looking for a good, campy B-grade action film, you could choose much more poorly.",Judge Dredd
43,FiendishDramaturgy,"Cheesy and Glib, But Still Fun If You Like Blockbustery Popcorners",4,8 April 2007,"Judge Dredd was a terrible attempt at a comic book movie. Superman fared well for the first couple of movies, and the Burton Batman line did okay for the first couple of installments, and Judge Dredd does hold potential for a successful franchise line. However, this was done well before the current technological CG age, and it shows something awful. The dialog is trite and glib, delivered with about as much reality as plastic, and comes off like they were trying SO hard to have fun that they couldn't actually have any, if you can understand that.Coupled with the fact that this work takes itself far too seriously, Stallone in particular considering he was the ONLY serious thing about the work, Stallone comes off as an over-dramatized ego maniacal schmuck. A. Asanti does portray a competent villain, and Stallone contributes a decent performance, all things considered. I think it was more...everything else, that went wrong with this production...Rob Schneider, for one.Whose idea WAS it to cast that moronic imbecile in a Judge Dredd movie? Is it possible that some idiot considered him the comic relief?! Not possible when one realizes that Rob Schneider is about as funny as a bad case of syphilis. He drug it down, if that is possible.The set designs were another thing. The budget existed to have built good sets, but these looked worse than some of the original Star Trek episodes' sets and props! In places, it looked good, but for the most part, they were pretty cheesy. Blend that with Stallone's over-acting, and trite dialog, Rob Schneider's presence, and everyone else just milling about as if there was no point to the plot, and you've got a pretty bad movie. Fun, but still pretty bad.The sound track and the plot (when it is discernible) are the only enjoyable elements of this work. Unless you're a die hard Stallone fan, I'd suggest you pass on this one. If you're a fan of the comic book series, do yourself a favor and reread the books.It rates a 4.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Judge Dredd
44,elshikh4,Why I Have a Heart to The Heartless Judge Dredd !,7,23 September 2008,"OK, so this was nearly the end of the metallic heroes on the screen. After something like 15 years of (The Terminator, Ropocop, Universal Soldier,..), the super, insensitive, and semi-merciless lead came down to the rejection point. Though it was box office flop, but it's a good live comic book that would enjoy you for 96 min. I'm not a fan of the violent comic books nor the metallic characters (or stars!), but this one captured my attention and admiration.First of all, the direction was better than a lot of things. (Danny Cannon) was so enthusiastic about it. All the scenes seem snazzy. Scenes such as the one in which Chief Justice (Fargo) goes to the desert, or the movie's last shot, were mighty cadres that evoked brilliantly the comic books' style.The great music of (Alan Silvestri) ranked as the second best; its grand sense concentrated strong feelings, personified cleverly a massive heroism, and created epical shadows.Then the lovely catchy plot of (Steven E. de Souza) that got: framing (Dredd), the escape to prove the innocence, insane evil brother. When it comes to (de Souza) - as one of the 1990s' action masters - he can explode it fine. Look carefully at the construction of the climax; tough guy vs. another, catfight, a ticker bomb, or imminent catastrophe, in the same time. A construction that became almost basic in next action movies, to have the majority of them imitates it blindly: (Die Another Day - 2002), (Bulletproof Monk - 2003), (Torque - 2004), etcetera.All the cast gave me a wonderful time: (Diane Lane), (Max von Sydow), and (Armand Assante) who looks very agreeable as the mad (Rico). And unlike a lot of reviewers, I liked (Rob Schneider). He's not a favorite of mine, at all, but surprisingly he was so funny, and not annoying for a second.Although a lot of elements privileged this movie unlike a lot of the comic book movies that we're having yearly and absurdly during the whole 2000s, but I hated some points: the awful loud performance of (Sylvester Stallone), the evident special effects sometimes; the flying bike chase over the buildings for instance, the fabricated climax which was lesser than previous action scenes in the same movie, not to mention the biggest of them all; the matter of non-changeable hero!Actually you'll never feel any alteration at (Stallone)'s character in the end, like they forgot that?! Especially when the movie had him ruthless at the beginning, and put him into that hot conflict to end up with him as the same! Rare time to observe main character that ends the way it begins; it's in the manual catalogue of the drama's studiers as ""not to be done in films""! Maybe the high dispute between (Danny Cannon) and (Stallone), which made the final version completely different from the script, caused matters like that. Anyhow it's not the movie to evaluate fairly the honorable (Steven E. de Souza), as he wrote better crazy actions before.True that I don't like those metallic heroes, but considering our days of too many kids (Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia,..), and too many superheroes (Superman, Batman, and Spider-Silly-Man,..), I may find a reason to deem (Judge Dredd) more nice and classical than other contemporary movies. All in all, despite its foibles, I liked it. It's the noisiest valium you can ever have.Btw, historically speaking, after Judge Dredd (1995), there were Virtuosity (1995), Solo (1996), and Soldier (1998), and then, as if Hollywood said goodbye to the metallic action heroes. But nothing is forever; they may come back sooner or later. Hope them to be armed with good script and acting by then.",Judge Dredd
45,iquine,80's Action Approach In The 90's,4,16 October 2017,"(Flash Review)The execution of this movie felt more appropriate mid-80's than mid- 90's. I expected more from it. First off, those costumes. Really?! Judge Dredd's costume looked very flimsy and weak; like an obvious prop. That led me to pick apart other parts of the movie. Such as the futuristic vehicles and their tacked on accoutrements. Never looking as if they were from their own world but yanked from reality. The comedic one-liners were so bad. All blatantly related to being a judge or the legal system. Something the writers quickly came up with one night after a few cocktails. I grimaced more than chuckled and each one followed a dialog pause so each one was telegraphed. Onto the plot and I'll admit I have no idea this was a comic book until the movie started. The Earth has become a desert and people live within crime-ridden, walled cities with a police force called The Judges. They are allowed to stop criminals as well as judge their crime and punishment at the scene. Of course there is a battle for power and shenanigans are pulled that effect Judge Dredd's reputation. Will he overcome and will the truth be uncovered? Overall, the was a lot of popcorn action and bad dialog but it was brainless amusement nonetheless. The best part about watching it was getting to clear a movie out of my streaming queue that I had light interest in seeing after 20+ years since its release.",Judge Dredd
46,jimbo-53-186511,Judge it for yourself,6,27 May 2020,"In the near future, society is governed by a new justice system whom act as police, jury and executioner all at once and are known as 'the judges.' The most feared and respected of all these judges is Judge Dredd, but when Dredd finds himself being framed and convicted for a murder he did not commit he sets out to prove his innocence and discovers some disturbing truths along the way...Judge Dredd seems to have got a bit of a bad rap over the years and whilst it's a long way from being a masterpiece it's also not a terrible film either...It opens well with a tense showdown between the criminals and the judges and what I liked about it is that it showed vulnerability within 'the judges' when one of them ends up being killed due to his inexperience. By avoiding the 'superhero' route it is possible to see these judges as people which does give the story a more human feel to it.Like Demolition Man, Judge Dredd tries to mash up comedy and violence, but I have to admit that it isn't 'executed' (sorry) quite as well here. To me, Stallone seems to be basically playing John Spartan in a helmet, but oddly enough even the way Stallone delivers the one liners and the dry dialogue doesn't seem to be quite as effective in Judge Dredd. I believe that Stallone was at loggerheads with the director and writers as to how the film should be pitched (tonally) so perhaps on-set problems are the result of some of its failings.The story is OK here (although it's hardly one that really involves) and doesn't really stick in the memory. The performances are variable; Stallone does a reasonable job and I've certainly seen worse from him - although he is capable of being better as well. Schneider has never been someone who I have been a big fan of and whilst there are occasions when he is funny he is sometimes a bit annoying. Lane is pivotal in the first half of the film, but is mostly forgotten about in the second half. Von Sydow is always good and doesn't disappoint again.As director Danny Cannon does a good job in moving things forward and there are enough slam and bang moments to keep the majority of viewers happy. The darker moments of the film are arguably where the film is at its best as a lot of the comedy moments feel forced and some of the catchphrases are cringe-worthy with the line ""I knew you were going to say that"" becoming almost unbearable to hear by the end of the film.All in all though it's a fairly entertaining film and despite some flaws it isn't boring.

47,juneebuggy,Not exactly a good movie but damn did I have fun watching this,7,3 January 2015,"This is your typical 90's action flick, so its kinda cheesy with over the top, well... everything. Big action, big explosions, garish skin tight costumes and laughable (but bad) one liners. As far as being faithful to the comic, it fails big time as its more of a Stallone movie than a true Dredd movie, but if you're in the right mood its also entertaining as hell.Stallone IS the law here as Judge Dredd, a futuristic cop from Mega city who holds unilateral power as judge, jury and executioner over overpopulated and violent cities. When he's framed for murder and banished from the force (and the city) he must fight his way back to reclaim his badge and take down Armand Assante -who is pretty awesome as the bad guy.This movie is generally hated but I had a ton of fun watching it (except for Rob Schneider as the ""comic"" sidekick -he was terrible) The story is decent though and there are a ton of interesting characters (and actors) involved (Diane Lane, Max Von Sydow, Scott Wilson). I also liked this future view, yeah its kinda 'Bladerunner'-ish but interesting with cool gadgets, giant robots, flying motorcycle chases, redneck cannibals and a ton of unintentional laughs to be had along the way. 12/1/14",Judge Dredd

Stallone to me always felt like an Action Figure come to life in the movies, he's an action legend.Judge Dredd is an Action-packed Sci-fi epic, a BladeRunner of the 90's that's full of Awesome action set-pieces, humour, great fight scenes & beautiful futuristic production design. The look of the futuristic city is still stunning in 2021 because it's not all c.g.i like every big Blockbuster today!!! The sets, outfits, look, music & action is all greatly done & crafted. Probably the main complaint would be the role for Rob Schneider as the silly comic relief & he didn't need to be in the movie at all but he also doesn't ruin the movie at all, just a weird part is all.I love the mutant Cannibals scenes in the desert when Dredd is captured as it has a ""Hills have Eyes"" feel to it all but with fun & abit of humour. I love the flying bike scene & the opening shootout street war scene is Awesome too, well pretty much all the film is Awesome.Diane Lane is good in her role & the whole ensemble cast is good. I love the big old scrappy Robot that is brought back to life, it's scary & huge.The work that went into this production is truly amazing no matter what the boring critics said, the film looks Amazing & it really is a spectacular big budget popcorn Blockbuster that's so entertaining & alot of fun.No matter what anyone said about this flick it's a movie that I've always liked & i still prefer it to most Blockbusters these days.Stallone is great as Judge Dredd.",Judge Dredd
49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Is it bad? Yes. But is it entertaining? Hell yeah.,6,11 May 2016,"Ah yes, the 90's version of Judge Dredd, featuring a hopped up Sylvester Stallone as the titular comic book lawman. There is so much hate floating around for this flick that I feel like radios have picked up some of it right out of the air. There used to be a lot more loathing, but then the 2013 version graced our presence, and it was so good, so true to the source material and such a kick ass flick that the collective bad taste left the fan's mouths, leaving this version somewhat forgotten and to many people, for good reason. But.. but... bear with me for just a moment, readers, and I'll tell you why it's not as bad as it's utterly poopy reputation. Yes it's silly, overblown, altogether ridiculous and Stallone takes off his helmet to yell about the law a lot. Basically pretty far from the source material and weird enough to raise eyebrows in many others, and prompt the torch and pitchfork routine from fans of the comic series. But it's also a huge absurdist sci fi spectacle that will blow up your screen with its massive cast, opulent and decadent special effects and thundering, often incomprehensible plot. It's in most ways the exact opposite of the 2013 version, all the fat that was trimmed off of that sleek, streamlined vehicle is left to dangle here, resulting in a chaotic mess that looks like a highway pileup between Blade Runner, Aliens and some Roger Corman abomination. But.. is it terribly unwatchable? Not in the least, or at least not to me. Like the highway pileup, it's so off the rails that we can't help but gawk in awe, and if we're not some comic book fan who is already spiritually offended to the core by it, even enjoy that madness and lack of any rhyme or reason in it. Stallone uses his bulk to inhabit the character, and infuses a level of stagnant processed cheese to his dialogue that would be distracting if it weren't for the electric blue contact lenses he sports the whole time, which look like traffic lights designed by Aqua Man. He's embroiled in one convoluted mess of a plot line involving a former sibling (a hammy Armand Assante with the same weird eyes). Joan Chen and Diane Lane fill out the chick department, the former being some kind of cohort to Assante, and the latter a fellow judge alongside Dredd. Dredd has two superiors, the noble and righteous """" (Max Von Sydow in the closest thing he'll ever make to a B-movie), and the treacherous Griffin (a seething, unbridled Jurgen Prochnow). The cast is stacked from top to bottom, including a rowdy turn from James Remar who sets the tone early on as a rebellious warlord who is set straight by Dredd. Rob Schneider has an odd habit of following Stallone around in films where his presence is wholly not needed (see Demolition Man as well), playing a weaselly little criminal who pops up whenever we're off marveling at some other silly character, plot turn or risible costume choice. Scott Wilson also has an unbilled bit as Pa Angel, a desert dwelling cannibal patriarch, and when one views his scenery chomping cameo, although no doubt awesome, it's easy to see why he had his name removed from the credits. The whole thing is a delightful disaster that shouldn't prompt reactions of hate, at least from the more rational minded crowd. Yeah its not the best, or even all that good, but it's worth a look just for the sake of morbid curiosity, and to see an entire filmmaking, acting and special effects team strive way too hard and throw everything into the mix, forgetting that less is more as they pull the ripcord of excess. Sure I'm generous, but I'd rather be puzzled and amused rather than bitter and cynical when a lot of work still went into this and me as an average joe has no right to bring down artists when my greatest life accomplishments so far are riding a bike with no hands while I have a beer in one and check my phone in the other. Such silliness is what we find in this movie, and I gotta say I was tickled by it.",Judge Dredd

This world of Urban Chaos only the ""Judges"" with the supreme authority of both the Police Force and Legal System could control the violence from the street gangs or dangerous criminals. Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone) is caught in a conspiracy that can overthrow the government and eliminate the judges, when Dredd is framed for murder.Directed by Danny Cannon (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Phoenix, The Young American) made an entertaining, over-the-top, sci-fi action film. Based on a cult comic book by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Stallone is well cast as the lead. The film has an strong supporting cast like Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, Jurgen Prochnow, Joanna Miles, Balthazar Getty, Mitchell Ryan and Max Von Sydow.The film has some interesting plotting but the film gets lost with it's extreme violence, game-like special effects and some over-the-top performances. The film was actually longer in theaters, cutting an action sequences when Dredd is destroying the Judge Clones. Originally the film was supposed to be PG-13 but since the filmmakers were trying to make a PG-13 movie (That explains the film's lack of blood). But the MPAA (The Motion Picture Association of American from the Rating Boards) gives this film an R-Rating for it's extreme violence. The film plays better on video. Worth seeing, if you are an fan of Stallone or Comic Books (Since the Comic Books, Dredd never remove his Hamlet in the Comics). If you love non-stop action, don't miss it.

Sly does Sly like no one else can. He seems to have one-dimensional down pat.

With the likes of Max Von Sydow, Rob Schneider and Diane Lane supporting Stallone every step of the way, we didn't have to subjected to his typical array of bad jokes and funky sounding dialogue.

It must be just the right kind of ridiculous 90's cheese for me because I keep going back to this and it never gets old.",Judge Dredd
54,ShootingShark,Exciting And Eye-Popping But Heavy-Going Comic-Book Fascist Cops Caper,5,15 July 2006,"In a nightmare future, mankind is crammed into huge mega-cities, and crime is rife. Law and order is maintained by the Judges, elite police troops with absolute authority. When arch-criminal Rico breaks out of prison and frames the powerful Judge Dredd for murder, Dredd must prove his innocence, defeat Rico and expose corruption at the highest level.Hmmm, tough movie to review. Good points - it's derived from an excellent 2000 A.D. comic-strip by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra about an unknowable neo-fascist antihero, the cast is terrific, the visuals are eye-popping and the pacing is breathless. Bad points - it's an overly familiar mish-mash of ideas from other superhero action flicks - particularly Robocop and Batman - there are lots of lame one-liners (though I must admit I like the, ""I knew you'd say that."" one) and the characters are frequently annoying. It's fun, but it's stodgy, dogmatic fun. Compare it with Tank Girl for example, another comic-book movie made the same year, which is just as inventive visually but takes itself far less seriously and as a result is much more original and enjoyable and has aged far better. Movies are about images but they are also about people, so when your heroes are a confused macho man and his unfunny sidekick, I ain't exactly riveted. However, the cast is great; Stallone is a perfect choice to play Dredd (although in the comic-book his face is never revealed, he's just a chin), Lane is a lovably gutsy Judge Hershey, Assante and Prochnow have fun trying to out-shout each other, good old Max lends the film some much-needed dramatic gravitas, and don't miss funny bits by Wilson and Dury as a scavenger-cannibal and a doomed gun-runner. Young director Cannon (he was twenty-seven) turns in an ambitious and exciting film - there's nothing wrong with his technical ability, and the visual realisation of the comic-book's environment is spot-on. Where I suspect this movie went a bit awry is in the multiple-screenwriters, multiple-producers film-making-by-committee trudge so many big-budget films fall foul of. Well worth catching though, with a strong score by Alan Silvestri, great costumes by Emma Porteous and exciting photography and visual effects throughout. Jones (who does an opening narration), Remar and Wilson all appear unbilled.",Judge Dredd

Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante both give amazing over the top performances and plenty of perfect and cheesy one liners. Diane Lane, Max Von Sydow and Rob Schneider are all great. It also has solid production values and Danny Cannon's direction is really good. The music by Alan Silvestri is extremely bombastic and works perfectly.",Judge Dredd
56,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An sloppy written but good future film,7,9 May 2012,"Sometimes in movies, it is hard for the audience to like certain characters. And at first, I wasn't quite sure if I was truly going to become attached to the character of Judge Dredd. Even after the film ended, I couldn't fully side with the fact that I really liked the character. Unfortunately, this is all due to how the screenplay was written, credited to William Wisher Jr; not Stallone's acting. He was only following the script and the story line. That's the major thing that brought my approval down.Stallone is Judge Joseph Dredd. An elite officer who knows the law like the back of his hand. Speaking of which, this is an interesting trait. All officers are judges, which means there's no court sentence, the lawbreaker is assessed in the open and is determined to what will happen to them right then and there. Imagine if reality was like that? Things would actually be moving a lot swifter when it would come to courts! Plus it's cool how the officers can site immediately what the criminals sentence will be. Talk about photographic memory.What isn't worth appreciating in this film is the screenplay. The character of Judge Dredd is so callous, that it'll be hard for the audience to really gain an understanding of why Dredd is the way he is. This is not explained until much later in the film. But even after that, the personality of Dredd doesn't change. It's almost like the idea of character development was totally left out of production. Either that or Michael DeLuca as a storyteller, really doesn't know how to tell a story. This is why I still can't decide whether I like Dredd or not.Co-starring with Stallone is Rob Scheinder as Fergie, a goofy feeble computer hack who practically has all the funny lines. If Scheinder weren't in this film, I'm not quite sure I would have liked it as much. Diane Lane plays Judge Hershey, which the last name describes her nicely. She's candy to the eye. Everything about her face is very attractive. Playing the villain, Rico, is Armand Assante. As for him, I felt like Rico could've had a better voice. Assante's voice was too high-pitched and shrill to be a villain in this film. It just didn't fit.For the most part, I did like the special effects. They all around looked well in their place. The judges' bikes though seemed a little bit over-sized, like they were riding Honda Gold Wings or something. Two characters that I thought were cool looking were Mean Machine and the ABC Robot. Mean Machine reminded me of Kroenen from Hellboy (2004), while the ABC Robot looked like an early T-600 prototype for the Terminator Salvation (2009), just slightly clunkier and a little more loyal.This whole area that this story takes place in reminds me of the first fifteen minutes of an earlier Stallone movie, Demolition Man (1993). The only difference is that the world is not futuristic, however it is still a mess. One thing I felt uncomfortable with in this movie was the city itself. Everything was too close together; in other words, there wasn't enough room for the audience to get a sense of position on the screen. As for music goes, which Alan Silvestri made the score too, there were some moments that just seemed overly dramatic. Majority of the time I don't have a problem with Silvestri's work, but this one bothered me a little.Judge Dredd could have been a really entertaining futuristic cop movie but it ends up running by the book a little too often with Stallone being almost emotionless. Thankfully, the rest of the movie is held up with some fair action sequences, interesting special effects and a unique supporting cast.",Judge Dredd
57,raulfaust,I knew I wouldn't like that,5,27 July 2011,"Well, this film is very nineties. It contains thousand of clichés, predictability and cheesy conversations, as expected from a nineties action movie starring Sylvester Stallone. Thought it's not good or clever, it entertained me for a while.The script is an imaginary world where Judges would take policemen jobs and they'd be the law themselves. Of course it wouldn't work; giving more than one power of jurisdiction to a person would make it less democratic and more subject to corruption and authoritarianism. That's a good thing that movie kind of showed (maybe not if you're not a law student). Fergee is a funny character that delivers some silly laughs, and it's impossible to not remember Black Eyed Peas' Fergie when Judge Dredd call his name. Interesting and entertaining movie, with decent special effects for 1995, but no big deal.",Judge Dredd
58,winner55,"well, gee, i kinda had fun...",7,30 July 2006,"Probably every criticism I've read on the movie is true. Especially about Rob Schneider, whose starring films probably amuse some toothless hillbillies living in a swamp where they're waiting for some fat city-slicker to force to his knees and ""squeal like a pig"". I mean Rob Schneider is definitely the male-rape poster-boy of white trash everywhere, ""he got a purty mouth"". Which is why the cannibal Angel Family sequence works as well as it does, I guess.Having added my agreement to the hope that Rob Schneider retires really soon, I must now buck some of the negative reviews here - this film is very fast-paced campy fun. Schneider aside, the acting is uniformly hammy, to the extent that I can't imagine it was intended otherwise. Sly Stallone is clearly having the time of his life.The camera-work and editing are generally very good, and the story just takes us from one action sequence to another, with hardly a moment to catch our breaths.Director Cannon gets special credit for having realized this fantasy world to the max. I never have any sense that this is just some Hollywood appendage to the real world, it is entirely self-contained without ever feeling claustrophobic.It's definitely a film that you want to watch without trying to use your brain - but don't we all want to 'give it a rest' on occasion? As for Rob Schneider - well just bear in mind how utterly unbearable all of his other film appearances have been - this is easily the most tolerable of the lot - that counts for something, doesn't it? 7 stars for the roller-coaster ride.",Judge Dredd

In some ways, it does a remarkable job of bringing the British comic book to the big-screen, but in other ways (humanizing Dredd) it fails miserably. Generally, it's an entertaining big-budget action/sci-fi flick.  It's not going to beat out Robocop or Total Recall, but if you can catch it during a video store special, it's probably worth the dollar two you'll spend on it.",Judge Dredd

(R)Noisy, clunking adaptation of the British comic book character (created by John Wagner & Carlos Equerra), set in a futuristic dystopian society of Mega-City One; Stallone plays the titular Street Judge who brings law to the lawless as policeman, judge, jury and executioner rolled into one. Fans of the source property were understandably rankled by this Hollywood treatment--although Stallone is well-cast, the way the character softens over the course of the story is frustrating (and don't ask purists about the helmet). The production's trappings are familiar but smartly-designed, effects work uneven but occasionally eye-popping, atmosphere appropriately stern and totalitarian. With overly ambitious but formulaic plotting, the movie tries to do too much in its short running time, and the signs of excessive editing are apparent (example: Chen's come-and-go character is given no depth or motivation whatsoever). Von Sydow brings gravitas to his role as an elder judge, while Assante goes hysterically over-the-top as the excitable villain; the ""actual"" comic relief, as provided by Schneider, is only occasionally amusing, more often irritating.

62,BrandtSponseller,Delivers thought-provoking action in a fantasy sci-fi wrapping,8,25 April 2005,"Judge Dredd is based on one of the most popular characters from the UK's 2000 AD comics. It is set in the 22nd Century, when most of the Earth has been turned into a desolate wasteland known as the ""Cursed Earth"" and most humans live in highly concentrated cities, walled off from the rest of the world. Society is fairly anarchic, except there for a class of humans, known as ""judges"", who act as cop, judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one. Sylvester Stallone is the titular judge. He's notorious among the other judges, the general citizenry and the other judges for upholding the law in a harsh way. The film primarily tells the story arc from the comics known as ""The Return of Rico"", and concerns a plot to get Dredd into trouble while overthrowing what's left of the existing ""order"".This is a great action/sci-fi film with a tone reminiscent of Demolition Man (1993), Total Recall (1990), The Fifth Element (1997), Blade Runner (1982) and similar films. If you like Stallone, gloomy futuristic production design and/or intense action films, Judge Dredd should be a rewarding experience for you, as long as you're not a purist who is coming to the film by way of an intricate familiarity with the 2000 AD comics.The source material caused a slight problem for me, too, but not because I'm a purist. Rather, Judge Dredd suffers a bit from a flaw that plagues many films based on comic books--writers Michael De Luca, William Wisher Jr. and Steven E. de Souza had an extensive, pre-existent mythology (as is necessary when creating a complete, new world) on which to build their work, and they tried to incorporate a bit too much of it. Because of this, we're introduced to a large cast of characters fulfilling functions that we're not familiar with (in the details, at least), and we're regularly faced with new lingo, new cultural concepts, new technology, and so on, often with just a couple lines of dialogue. If you want to understand the details, you really have to pay close attention. But on the other hand, the general arc of the story is relatively simple, and you don't have to know every detail to enjoy it.Given the disposition that Stallone has as Judge Dredd in the film, he may as well have walked out of Kurt Wimmer's film Equilibrium (2002). Dredd initially goes about his business almost robotically; he only cares about enforcing the law. When he's recruited by a higher-up, Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow), to teach ethics (which is quite an ironic idea when you see Dredd's behavior in the opening scene), he tells the students that being a judge basically means giving up one's life to the law. He says that one cannot have friends, for example--never mind that other judges, like Judge Hershey (Diane Lane) try to have social lives outside of work. Dredd later tells Hershey that he did have a friend at one point, but he had to judge him. Sending a friend to prison or killing him (we're not told exactly how Dredd judged him, although we find out later) isn't exactly the best way to encourage a healthy social life.So the subtext of the story, and Dredd's character arc, becomes that through a number of hardships, he finally learns something about ethics for himself--just in time to deal with a potentially shattering bit of information about his personal identity. He ends up accompanied by a man, Herman Ferguson (Rob Schneider, in a role meant primarily as comic relief, although more generously, he's an ironic emotional facilitator), whom he had just judged harshly, even though Ferguson wasn't really doing anything wrong on his first day out of prison. Together they have to go to a figurative hell (The Cursed Earth) to deal with figurative ""demons"" (a famed band of rogue cannibals who live in the tough environment) and back again to reach their fulfillment.Like many recent sci-fi stories set in the future, Judge Dredd has a pessimistic view of where technology and social conventions are leading humans. As the story has it, at one point, we had built massive, relatively unstoppable robot warriors, and one of the highlights of the film is when the villain finds one and puts it back into service. It's as much fun to watch the gadgetry as it is to watch the action sequences, and the computer generated ""landscapes"" throughout the film are spellbinding, with their sly jabs at various changes and similarities to present locations and cultures. The whole concept of the judges and their hierarchical structure is fascinating, even if some apparent inconsistencies (such as why judges are not summarily dealt with in the same manner that other citizens are) are never explained in the film.The performances are good, even if a few actors barely get enough screen time (like Lane and Joan Chen, who plays semi-villain Ilsa), and the premise is captivating. It's too bad this film gets unduly knocked by purists and those misguidedly looking for detail realism in the genre. Judge Dredd is severely underrated on IMDb. It deserves a first look or a second chance.",Judge Dredd
63,mstomaso,Got all the basics of some challenging material right,6,9 June 2005,"This film, and its generally poor reception is a good example of what happens when huge marketing mistakes are made. Take a look at the cover of the DVD package: ""Stallone: Judge Dredd"". The film should have been titled ""Judge Dredd"" - even in the packaging - and the emphasis for the marketing of this film should have been less Stallone, more content. On the flip-side, when the most consistent complaint you can find among IMDb psychofants is ""HE TOOK OFF HIS HELMET!"", you really have to wonder if the film is quite as bad as so many believe. Eagle Comics 2000 AD character Judge Dredd was one of the most original, entertaining and intelligently written and interestingly drawn sci-fi comics of recent times. With story arcs varying from 2 pages worth of panels to 4 or 5 episodes, and sometimes multi-threaded plots, this violent, political and tough cyberpunk version of Dirty Harry set some pretty high standards for adult comic authorship both in its native UK and in the USA, once the imports started flowing in. It freely traversed from film noir to flat-out wild sci-fi action to nihilistic hard justice, and did so with style and originality rarely seen in the comic medium. Hence, although I like Stallone in this film, it's not only misleading but a little insulting to call this 'a Stallone film'. The producers had very big shoes to fill, and though I am in the minority here, I believe they did well.The production team chose a story arc which I was never very fond of, but one of the more do-able ones to be sure. Any Dredd-based film would necessitate a huge special effects budget, and most of them, even with the best special effects available, would likely be nearly impossible to pull off and might look ridiculous. To their credit, the Return of Rico story arc was rightfully recognized as good film material - it involves more emotional content than the usual Dredd fare, and actually required fewer outrageous special effects, than, say, the many Judge Death arcs might have.Dredd is a ""street judge"" - and the judges are the closest thing to a government in a post-apocalyptic future where nuclear war has concentrated all of the world's population into mega-cities - hotbeds of crime and chaos, surrounded by mutagenic wastelands called The Cursed Earth. Dredd is the best of the best, a very tough cop who knows method, theory, and has an incorrigible sense of ethics and dedication to the law. Dredd is also mentor to an entire generation of judges, including the brilliant Hershey (Lane). Rico, Dredd's former best friend, and a psychotic murderer escapes from a high security prison with some help from a fascistic leader of the judges who is bent on securing power and a new world order with himself in charge. Soon, Dredd is framed for murder and exiled to the wastelands, and judges start to die all over the city. About midway through the film, Dredd learns the truth of his relationship to Rico and begins to figure out the sinister plot. Of course, there is only one thing for him to do - return to Megalopolis to stop the conspiracy before it plays out.The film features good performances by a really nice cast. Armand Assante brings the character of Rico to life better than the comic book ever did. Diane Lane, Jurgen Prochnow and Max Von Sydow are always good, and though I had my doubts to begin with, Stallone pulls off Dredd very well. While some folks complain about Rob Schneider's irritating behavior, I found that his goofy character took a little of the edge off of Stallone's depressive performance of the most stoic law enforcement officer on planet earth. This is not one of Joan Chen's better roles. If you're a big Chen fan, you might think twice about seeing this.All considered, I see Judge Dredd as a under-rated and mis-marketed film, which, through its fast pace, sophisticated sci-fi plot, Excellent special effects and very good cast, took all of the screenable elements of the comic book and made them accessible to an audience a bit wider than its original fan-base. If this review peaks your interest, see it!",Judge Dredd
64,sarastro7,A disappointment,5,7 June 2010,"Judge Dredd is supposed to be based on a comic book. In the comic, Judge Dredd is a fascist. The whole concept is satire. This movie, however, which reads like a tediously directed bastard child of RoboCop and Demolition Man, presents the judges as good guys. So the movie is not in fact a reasonable adaptation of the comic. That's the biggest and most basic problem.The movie could still have been a success. It starts out with some pretty good humor, and as he has demonstrated time and again Stallone is not a bad action hero. The rest of the cast is promising, too: Diane Lane, Armand Assante, Max von Sydow, Jurgen Prochnow. Unfortunately, the story, involving clones and an evil twin, is very dull and unoriginal, and by the time the end rolls around, the movie feels unfinished and without a proper climax. A big and sad disappointment with no underlying vision or message. Bleh.Assante was pretty good as a crazy bad guy (""the laaaawww!"" - you should really go to Youtube and watch the YOU BETRAYED THE LAW! clips - they are the funniest thing about this movie), but he couldn't save the movie.

65,mentalcritic,Judge Dreddful...,2,2 May 2005,"I just finished reading a comment with the headline ""Not all that bad! They should've edited to PG-13 though for more audience members!"". I really do not think this author has really seen Judge Dredd, because the idea that this film could not pass the MPAA with a PG-13 certificate is one of the most telling signs that the censoring of film has gone too far in America. Indeed, this conception of Judge Dredd is so watered down you could almost cuddle up to it in your sleep. The sins of this film are numerous and heavy, but by far the worst is the attempt it makes to please everyone. That old saying about trying to please everybody and winding up pleasing nobody as a result was invented for a reason. Sadly, film executives once again misinterpreted this as a sign that our films need to be more censored and watered down in order to appeal to everyone. If only they could realise that the varying nature of individual taste means that there is never going to be a film that everyone in the world will pay to see twice.Not that the childishness of the film is limited to its marketing approach. In the big introduction of Dredd, we have Dredd getting off his motorcycle, stepping out in boots and armour that look far too big for him, and announcing to his fellow judges that the weapons being fired at him from some hundreds of metres above him have an effective range around a hundred metres too short to reach him. I don't know who put this doozy in the script, but I wish they had at least paid attention during a basic lesson on the principles of gravity. Bullets tend to stay effective when gravity is aiding them on their journey down. It is why so many have been killed by falling bullets when they fired their weapons upwards into open air. Mind you, this is by no means the worst blunder in the film, even if it is the most obvious.Exactly how Sylvester Stallone got his name attached to this project, I don't know, but this is probably the biggest of the mistakes. From what I have heard, Dredd never appears anywhere other than in this film without his mask, and he is a much larger specimen than Stallone to boot. Of course, the studio wanted to have a big-name star to sell this adaptation on the back of, but this results in the actor overwhelming the character. What little I knew of Dredd was definitely nowhere to be seen in this impersonation. Stallone simply recites a bit of exposition here, a few catchphrases there, and the rest is just sheer phoning in. Attempts to capture the hardened, flatlining personality of the Judge simply fall flat, and the support cast simply look lost. Max Von Sydow and Jürgen Prochnow look as if they are embarrassed to be there, and how much their asking fees contributed to the estimated ninety million dollar budget is something I can only guess at. Diane Lane, Joan Chen, and Balthazar Getty all do a good job of hiding how embarrassed or disappointed they are to be there, while Stallone simply looks oblivious to what a pile of garbage he has helped make.Director Danny Cannon has vowed to never make another film with a big name star, and it isn't difficult to see why. Apparently, Stallone had a big say in the final film, and the script was often subject to rewrites as the film was being shot. Now, while Stallone has penned some brilliant scripts in the past, this is not a Rocky film, and the requirements of the story or continuity were quite obviously beyond Stallone. Indeed, it is because of films like this one and Batman Forever that the reputation of comic book adaptations needed such a major rescue in the form of the X-Men films. Those films also proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that compared to casting a superstar whose acting range is, shall we say, a little limited, casting a relative unknown for a role that has specific characteristic requirements is a much safer bet.Judge Dredd is not even so bad it is good. It is so incredibly bad that it is utterly stupefying. It has somehow uncovered that secret universe where every performance is utterly stilted and every line is howlingly bad. Every so often, I get to thinking that maybe people who complain about corporations spending ninety million dollars on what is basically nothing when there are so many who barely have enough to eat, are whining. Then I see films like Judge Dredd.",Judge Dredd

67,mattymatt4ever,A damn good time at the movies!,8,24 April 2001,"It's unfortunate that ""Judge Dredd"" wasn't accepted by mainstream viewers or even received a cult following.  I found it to be very entertaining.  I don't see too many movies based on comic book superheroes that I honestly enjoyed.  ""X Men"" for example went on too long, moved very slowly and took itself too seriously.  ""Judge Dredd"" is a fast-paced sci-fi-action thrill ride that delivers from start to finish and has help in the comic relief department by Rob Schneider.  Sylvester Stallone overacts throughout, but that's part of the fun.  Watching him scream out ""I AM THE LAW!!"" makes you want to scream it out along with him, which is what I do whenever I view this movie.  There are many quotable lines, which I enjoy reciting.  ""Judge Dredd"" is not a deeply intelligent, insightful film.  But it makes a great popcorn flick!  This upbeat, funny, nonstop entertainment is a real treat for me to watch over and over again.  My score:  8 (out of 10)",Judge Dredd
68,ODDBear,A good no brains action flick,7,13 January 2008,"In the future a normal police officer is called a Judge and he has the power to pass Clement on offenders and carry out executions. The most hard-ball judge of them all is Dredd, with an impeccable career. But soon he finds himself on the other side of the law as he's framed for a murder he didn't commit and it's up to him to pass Clement against those who rule the system.These comic book incarnations don't ever seem to satisfy all. I remember when this came out there were a lot of Judge Dredd enthusiasts who ripped the movie to pieces, along with critics who almost universally despised the film. As for myself, I've always thought this was enjoyable popcorn fare not to be taken too seriously. There's a lot of good action, top notch set design, OK special effects and a not too bad story to set everything in motion. Still, I found myself backed in a corner when defending the flick.Stallone is perfect as Dredd. People may have different views concerning his acting talents but in roles that require much muscle and less talking, the guy excels. In the few instances that he has to express some dramatic gestures, well, I think he nails that too. And what a roster of supporting actors; Max Von Sydow is always good, Jurgen Prochnow is appropriately slimy, Rob Schneider is sporadically funny, Diane Lane is wonderful eye candy and Armand Assante is brilliant with his over the top interpretation of the main villain.As a no brains action flick Judge Dredd delivers in spades. I think it's judged a bit too harshly and should have a better overall rating.",Judge Dredd
69,vip_ebriega,"Wait, so they actually want us to take it seriously?",4,23 September 2007,"My Take: Another instance of awful eye-candy. When I saw a TV commercial for ""Judge Dredd"", and saw Sly Stallone in a silly superhero/cop outfit, I was prepared to laugh, big time. And I did, for most of the first part, then pretty soon, Stallone takes of the funny helmet, I guess it's time to stop laughing. Is it gonna get serious? Surprisingly, it tries to. And by that point, ""Judge Dredd"" got even sillier than it was before.""Judge Dredd"", though, is not as campy as it sounds, but it still is. Most especially if it takes itself way to seriously. The film is based on a series of comic books I haven't manage to read, but these comic books aren't those things that are taken to seriously. That's what this film does wrong. It's just a fun, campy action adventure, much like ""Robocop"" perhaps, wherein a fighter of justice fights thugs and shoot bad guys. In the film though, we have a frame-up (a common plot outing in futuristic-setting films like this) and a lot of violence than could be too much for its younger audiences.There is no problem, obviously, to add a plot to an otherwise ridiculous premise. But ""Judge Dredd"" took it too high. The plot is for films like ""Total Recall"", yet the film is definitely marked for sci-fi buffs 10 and below. One, wherein a futuristic hero fights bad guys and saves cities and stuff. ""Judge Dredd"" pushes the envelope as well by having a lot of violence. The film is rated R, yet you can't stop kids from actually going to these kind of things. And obviously, adults will just laugh at it. ""Judge Dredd"" will have a hard time finding its audience, because it's too violent for the kiddies to watch alone, and too campy and just plain silly for the adults to sit through without laughing.Rating: ** out of 5.",Judge Dredd
70,gftbiloxi,Don't Go Out Of Your Way,4,3 June 2005,"Beware of movies that require an explanatory prologue, even if it is read by James Earl Jones.A cross between wannabe BLADERUNNER effects and Saturday morning ""Superfriends""-type characters and stories, JUDGE DREDD offers the tale of a future society so lawless that ultra-police ""judges"" roam the streets dispensing inflexible justice right and left. Among them is Judge Dredd, played by Sylvester Stallone at his least expressive, a legendary incorruptible who must be gotten out of the way if an evil take-over is to be staged. In classic manner he is framed for a crime he did not commit--and the rest of the film is as predictable as last night's popcorn.A major critical and box-office flop when released, JUDGE DREDD isn't quite as bad as some would lead you to believe. True enough, it is EXTREMELY predictable from start to finish and INCREDIBLY heavy-handed in execution; even so, the special effects (which borrow heavily from everything from BATMAN to ROBOCOP to BLADERUNNER) are watchable, and if you're in the mood to waste time on ""junk cinema"" you could probably do worse.

This really never puts you back an inch, while you are on the edge of your seat. It is great, although I would have liked it bloodier (show how they rip Prochnow's arms and legs of and show how that human is barbecued). While I am at the bad stuff, I feel that the effects were pretty poor sometimes although that didn't bother me that much I still enjoyed it. What bothers me that at 93 minutes this film seems heavily cut, or why does the lab at the end just start exploding and why didn't I see one clone moving around. That's it, nope, the ending could have been better, but it is OK.

73,The_Movie_Cat,"""Somebody must have used a CGI terminal and a scan quad to make this. State of the art. twenty years ago""",4,17 June 2000,"Warning - Slight Spoilers AheadI really, really dislike Judge Dredd. It's a surprisingly violent and soulless film; a patronising moronfest that treats its audience with no respect whatsoever. Even the titles annoy, the opening music with its silly bombast and a pompous monologue by James Earl Jones. The accompanying images are a series of the 2001 comic from which the Judge Dredd character came. It's quite exceptional that a major Hollywood picture should credit a minor British comic in such a prominent way. Even more exceptional as the film is nothing like the comic. Did the cartoon Judge really have romantic entanglements and monotonously quip anti-catchphrase ""I new yuud say dat""?The film opens out with a future cityscape ludicrously indebted to Blade Runner. Except where that picture had depth, this one throws it all up on screen, a garish splurge of CGI movement. To be honest, they aren't that convincing either, particularly later scenes where Dredd is flying his bike. Yet this was made 12 years after the more realistic-looking Blade Runner. Odd. Other rip-off, er, homages are a flying bike chase sequence straight out of Return of the Jedi. Though a scene where Hershey (Diane Lane) saves Stallone from falling by telling him to ""take my hand"" is a nice spoof of Cliffhanger.Stallone makes his first appearance as Dredd with the musical cues and iconography hopelessly indebted to the Terminator. He then proceeds to tell us that he's in no danger standing in the street as the criminals firing on him from a tower block are using weapons that are non-lethal from their range. This is strange, as less than two and a quarter minutes earlier we had seen one of said weapons killing a civilian from the same distance. I mean, if a movie can't maintain continuity over a three minute period then what sort of confidence can you have in it?Maybe part of the reason I dislike the film so much is Stallone. I've always had a great deal of time for Sylvester, and feel he's extremely underrated as an actor. However, at this time the sheer number of cursory action roles he was playing were dampening his reputation. Particularly as the action roles were not the equal of those given to an ""actor"" with infinitely less talent, Arnold Schwarzenegger. There was also an interview printed around the time where Sylvester gave a great number of right-wing views, and also laughably claimed that he'd read Homer to study for the role of Dredd. Maybe it was Homer Simpson. However, I've since told myself that the publication probably made it all up, and a reputable publication, Empire magazine, conducted an interview with the star in 1998. When asked if there were any film he would want to apologise for, he apologised for not really applying himself to Dredd and claimed that the film could have been ""a great satirical farce"". His dislike of Danny Cannon's methods also led him to suggest that Terry Gilliam would have been a better director for the movie. So at least Stallone is humble enough to admit his mistakes. Pre-Dredd we got a boastful, posturing actor - post-Dredd he said ""sorry"". In a way that kind of makes it okay. Because Judge Dredd is Stallone's worst acting role bar none. Wooden, wearied and with awful diction, he seems most ill at ease when playing opposite Max Von Sydow. Maybe he was intimidated by Sydow's status, or maybe his stories of Cannon shouting ""Fear me! Just fear me!"" had led him to be frightened away from anything approaching a performance.Rob Schneider's irritating Fergie is only there for comic relief, though he's hardly comic and the only relief comes when he leaves a scene. His sole saving grace is to prick Stallone's ego with a cracking mickey-take of his ""I am the law!"" What really worries is the transparent formula of the piece. The whole structure of Dredd is virtually identical to the far superior Demolition Man. (Schneider was lame comic relief in that, too). There are the political machinations that spring a villain from jail to aid in a plot, and also a whole series of defrosting baddies. Except the clones in the fridge never do anything, making this element doubly fatuous.One thing that I did find disturbing at this stage in cinema history was the worrying predilection for violence against women used as titillation. Tia Carrera's sole purpose in the boorish ""True Lies"" was to be beaten and slapped in the face by Art Malik. Worst manifestation of this was Jamie Lee Curtis turning her wedding ring inside out before slapping her face. Seeing a woman's face being slashed open by another woman who is supposedly the heroine is not a positive message. That this scene went by without warranting any moral implication and was there merely to arouse the audience is deplorable. This is thankfully softened for Dredd, though in her battle with Hershey, the similarly-Asian Joanna Miles does take the unusual step of trying to kick her in the crotch. Hershey eventually wins, though; proving Hollywood likes to see Caucasians beating up on token minorities.Films like Dredd are patronising to an audience. They are dumb, conveyor-belt movies that are produced to earn money and have no artistic merit whatsoever. The plot points and the emotional journeys work to an equated rule, so that they ultimately become hollow and artificial; while the ""romantic interest"" is merely a quota to be fulfilled in order to satisfy a demographic. I don't like going to the cinema and being told I'm stupid by a lame film. I don't like seeing a film that makes you think ""I could do better than this"" - even with the acting. And I don't like Judge Dredd. As a film it contains no content that engages the mind and is merely a series of witless set pieces. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy a good no-brainer, if presented well. When shot with an element of pretension - such as Stallone failing to emote in front of a statue while what sounds like the full Hallelujah chorus plays in the background - it becomes silly and overwrought. To be honest, the film's elements are so unengaging there really is little to actually review. So why did I bother? Well, I just wanted to get it off my chest.I new yuud say dat!",Judge Dredd

Now I can go on with the review.While many hated JUDGE DREDD and trash-talked it, I beg to differ. I enjoyed it very much (hence why I gave it a 7) and it doesn't deserve to be ranked among the worst superhero movies of all time (just like STEEL).

75,Maziun,Enjoyable popcorn fare – good campy fun,5,28 July 2013,"I'm no expert when it comes to Judge Dredd . I 've only read few comics book with him .I thought they were quite good. I have only some basic knowledge about Dredd mythology . From what I've noticed the movie had potential to be ""Robocop"" of the 90's. The 2012 movie ""Dredd"" is better movie and more accurate adaptation of the comic book.""Judge Dredd"" is a movie caught between director Danny Cannon (fan of the comic) will and Stallone/studio insistence on making a standard popcorn fare. I can understand the hate of comic book fans for this movie to some extent. Hollywood took a dark, sarcastic, satirical comic and turned it into lightweight summer action movie. In terms of character and plot it is, by any objective standards, a failed adaptation. The history of the 2000AD universe is significantly messed around with . However , it really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. It got all the basics of some challenging material right. Mega City One looks terrific. The casting was absolutely spot-on: Dredd, Hershey, Fargo, McGruder, Griffin... all these actors looked and behaved exactly as their 2000AD counterparts. Fergie wasn't the same as his comic-book counterpart, but the movie version of him is much better than original. The costumes were also brilliant . We have also a cool Hammerstein robot from the ABC Warriors and the Angel Gang. Mean Machine is exactly as he is in the comic book. There are delicate hints of totalitarianism and traces of satire as well.The movie has political overtones and a pessimistic view of future where technology and social conventions are leading humans. The whole concept of the judges and their hierarchical structure is fascinating. Too bad that the movie never really explores those interesting ideas. It could be thought provoking film.Another problem is that the plot has it's share of plot holes and dumb moments . There is also too much of shouting (because for the filmmakers shouting equals big drama , obviously) which makes some of the scenes cringe worthy.Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante both give a hammy performances as the undestructable hero and crazy villain. They have their moments of good acting , but mostly they overacting. It is however completely intentional , as you can see that they not taking their roles seriously , so in the end your having fun with them. Rob Schneider mostly irritates as the comic relief, however he does have some occasional funny moments (the voice impression , ""I'm aliveoh, so are you"" , ""We don't have time for that"") and he helps Dredd twice near the end of the movie. Diane Lane is OK as Dredd's friend/love interest , even if the movie doesn't really give her much to do. Max Von Sydow adds a touch of class to the whole movie. Jurgen Prochnow is uneven – sometimes good , sometimes bad. Joan Chen makes a rather pointless appearance (probably for catfight only ?).The special effects are OK , if not little dated in some places (the chase). The music by alan Silvestri is great – catchy and heroic. I liked the one-liners - ""I am the law"" , ""I knew you would say that"".The movie is fast paced, loud , colorful and brash but not in an insulting way like Schumacher's Batman movies. It has a charm and personality that seems to have been lost in modern comic book adaptations which seem to be either very dark , gritty and serious or slaves to special effects.It's not a bad movie. It's a obvious crowd pleaser which doesn't take itself too seriously. An adequate blockbuster. Mindless fun. (unlike say Michael Bay movies which are just annoying). There are far worse comic book movies and movies overall than ""Judge Dredd"". I give it 5/10.",Judge Dredd

In a dystopian future, Joseph Dredd, the most famous Judge (a police officer with instant field judiciary powers) is convicted for a crime he did not commit while his murderous counterpart escapes. This is a great film with a tone reminiscent of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. If you love Stallone, Judge Dredd should be a rewarding experience for you.

He can't do stoic without seeming like a piece of drift wood. It isn't in him. The movie is dragged down by his humorless performance. Armand Assante is over the top, Rob Schneinder proves a few laughs, Diane Lane tries to show Sly how it's done, and Max von Sydow is wasted. Assante completely overshadows Stallone, to the point where the movie belongs to him. The costumes are dopey, the effects are mediocre, the wastebillies are annoying, and the script is inane.

78,tomimt,Greatness reduced to mediocrity,4,20 February 2006,"Judge Dredd wasn't a total disappointment, but did come near close. It must be noted tough, that Judge Dredd is one comic, that is rather hard to turn into a movie, because the comic itself lacks a continuing story arch and it has always been a kind of a play ground for a bit more unconventional ideas.That's where the movie goes to the woods: they make JD a regular hero, a cop with morals and a personality, when we all know, that law is only personality Judge Dredd has. Everything else secondary. And they show Dredd's face which was something the comics never did at the point of that becoming a some of a joke among the fans of the comics. And the makers as well.Another big flaw in the film is, that the script omits all satirical pointers given in the comic books. There always is some sort of criticism provided towards fascistic society in the books, like the judges right on random house searches in hopes, and usually even most minor offenses mean jail time here, of finding criminals.Stallone was actually very fitting in the part before they decide to show his face and remove his shirt. Armand Assante does okay job as the main villain Rico, Dredds brother and Max Von Sydow does what he can as Chief Justice Fargo.Other than that the film has been reduced as standard action, with annoying sidekicks (Schneider) and mandatory female partner (Diane Lane). There are some good scenes, but the special effects and make ups are rather disappointing. Best example of this is The Mean Machine Angel (Christopher Adamson). The film lacks the appeal the comic has and one can only feel a bit disappointed of the lack of using the source material at hand.",Judge Dredd
79,Min111,He was the right choice to play Judge Dredd,5,8 August 2020,"What I'm going to say is that Sylvester Stallone was the right choice to play Judge Dredd. I don't think anyone else could've played that character better. You can tell he's suited to the role. I thought he looked great. I remember watching this as a child when it came out during the nineties, and I liked it very much. His full name is Judge Joseph Dredd. He's a street judge that is falsely accused of murder, and is given a life sentence. He has a brother named Rico Dredd who is the bad guy. He escapes from prison with the assistance of one of the Judges. Judge Dredd needs to stop him from destroying the society. Can Judge Dredd stop him? You have to see it to find out. Let's not forget another important character - Judge Barbara Hershey. She was played by the popular Diane Lane. She is very attractive as the Judge by the way. Judge Barbara and Judge Dredd made a great team. They're police officers that have plenty of powers. I like the uniform they wear - I thought that looks very cool. It's the year 2139. It's the 22nd century. All this takes place in a place called Mega-City One. That's where and when it happens. It's a action movie. There was a lot of action. I liked the action, and it's what makes Judge Dredd exciting to watch. I thought it was one of these cool movies from the nineties. That's when it came out. There's another 'similar' movie which involves Sylvester Stallone called the Demolition Man. It's a movie worth checking out. Judge Dredd, just like Demolition Man, is one of these 'futuristic' movies. I happen to like 'futuristic' movies - I think they're great. I'm particularly interested in these 'futuristic' movies that come from the nineties. That's when they look at their best for some reason. Judge Dredd is a fun movie.

I vividly remember the hottest girl in class pointing out to me that, since Judge Rico and Judge Dredd have exactly the same DNA, they should look exactly the same. What a quibbler! You start applying that kind of sophisticated analysis to this movie, and the whole thing will peel apart like a wet napkin.""Judge Dredd"" must be appreciated for what it is, a brain-shutter-offer motion picture experience. But what joyous escapism it is! This movie has it all: cool CGI cityscapes (quite ahead of their time), an awesome killer robot, hammy muscular guys, and great European actors slumming for a Hollywood paycheck. I love all two-and-a-half of its stars to pieces.The first half is actually quite good, as it occasionally borders on being a clever satire. Of course, much of the dialog is too functional for the social commentary to really work, but every once in a while a little gem of a scene appears. Or a little gem of a line, such as ""they're non-functional - like my wife.""The casting is just about perfect. Max Von Sydow classes up the film no end, and Armand Assante is good for a laugh. Dorky sci-fi addicts such as myself should keep an eye out for Maurice ""The Caves of Androzani"" Roeves in a cameo as the prison warden. Maybe the only person who really doesn't fit is Rob Schneider. He's funny at the beginning of the movie, but he rapidly becomes less amusing towards the end, when the stakes are really too high for his wisecracks to work. I think he was supposed to die in the original cut of the movie, and if you look closely during the final scene, he's never visible in the same shot as Dredd or Hershey. Methinks he was added later.Too bad the movie degenerates rapidly in the final act. Prochnow's motives are never clearly explained (he wants to cause chaos now in order to install order later - I guess that makes some sense), and it's clear that lots of the material with the clones was cut; they really should be involved in the final battle, but they conspicuously vanish. Bo-ring. I also intensely dislike the silly catfight between Lane and Chen (""JUDGE bitch!"" - how witty). But you can't have everything.Who else is up for ""Judge Dredd II?"" I know the original was a bomb, but c'mon, the definitive Dredd movie is still waiting to be made.

It's cliched, lacking in a good story, and missing something special.

I thought it was a fantastic film, with a really cool story, great action, cool actors, decent acting and some great bits of comedy.Sylvester Stallone was the PERFECT choice for the role of Judge Dredd!  He completely fits the mold and does an outstanding job portraying Judge Dredd. Rob Schnieder was an excellent choice for the part of Herman Ferguson as well.  Rob added a great deal of comedy to the film and it was all good comedy, nothing terribly cheesy or annoying, just perfect.  Diane Lane looks nothing short of fabulous throughout the film, and pulls off a fine performance as well.  Max von Sydow is not someone I would expect to be in a film like this, but nonetheless, I'm glad he did, because he did a fantastic job.  Armand Assante was excellent in the antagonist position.  He makes and excellent ""bad guy"", I'd love to see him in more films.  The rest of the cast was good as well.The special effects in the film are very good for the most part, there's nothing much to complain about.  The thing that completely made this film for me is the ABC Warbot.  What a beautiful design!  Truly fantastic!!!  The only thing I would have liked to see is a long shot of the Warbot walking, but I'm sure with the budget of the film that was virtually impossible, so I'll deal with it.  But all the scenes with the Warbot are just fantastic!I don't really see why people tend to dislike this film.  I thought it was an all around fun movie with plenty of good things going for it.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that like super-hero movies, or just futuristic action films.  I hope that you like this film as much as I do.

83,Antagonisten,Max von Sydow and Sylvester Stallone,2,13 September 2005,"You can say what you want about Sylvester Stallone, his wooden acting and his slurred speech. There is no actor, NONE at all, that can keep a straight face like Stallone.Just think about it. Here Stallone plays the ultimate bad-ass cop, the comic book-hero Judge Dredd. A cop who not only arrests the bad guys but also passes immediate judgment on them - and effects the punishment immediately (most of the time it means he just shoots them in the face). Not only does he in this part get to bawl lines like ""I am tha law!"", he also gets to wear an armor built from what looks like 300 pieces of shiny LEGO and carry a pistol that talks and fires all kinds of funny ammo. As his sidekick he has the chronically annoying Rob Schneider, as his foe an Armand Assante on speed (or so it would seem).And all through this Stallone never breaks his perfect facade of brutal law-making machine. He never smiles, never laughs. He doesn't even break down and spontaneously cry over the lines he's given. That takes stamina, and i must admit i'm quite impressed with the man. The movie itself though is a train-wreck of ideas gone wrong. The comic-book feeling is intact if by that you mean every prop looks like enormous pieces of plastic toys firing sparks. The story is not really important but it involves a plot to overthrow the system of street-judges and take control over one of the two remaining cities on the planet.The funniest part is when Max von Sydow (how does he always end up in crap like this movie?) comes in and talks to Stallone about the true meaning of justice. It almost brought a tear to my eye seeing a distinguished actor like Sydow explain the philosophy of justice in a dignified way to Stallone who is dressed in plastic and a tank-top.In a funny way though i can't really hate this movie. While it's certainly bad it still holds a certain entertainment-value. But don't get me wrong, you'll never laugh ""with"" this movie, only ""at"" it.

85,bheadher,Unbelievably fun to watch...,8,12 December 2017,"I know alot of people just don't like Sly, and I understand that purist comicbook fans just won't like the screen version of Dredd...but darn !!!Judge Dredd was intended as a visual fantasy, really weird and out there in the ozone movie, and it delivers that feel in spades...sure, the dialog is bizarre, but that simply makes this fun. Sure, the backdrop is bizarre, and that is exactly the way it is supposed to be, It is fun, plain and simple...Darn it people, it is a slapstick couple hours of fun entertainment, that doesn't conform to any preconceived notions of how a popcorn style, shoot 'em up movie should be...so just sit back and enjoy the fun...",Judge Dredd
86,grendelkhan,Mediocre mess adapted from a classic.,4,17 October 2006,"Judge Dredd is an institution in British comics, making his first appearance in the second issue of 2000 AD. in 1977. He was the creation of Pat Mills, John Wagner, and Carlos Ezquerra. He was an instant hit and paved the way for the other great stories that would appear in 2000 AD. The series has a dark, satirical bite, with over-the-top violence and wry social commentary. Sounds perfect for a cinematic adaptation, right? Wrong! Judge Dredd, the film, is a complete mess, beginning with the casting of Sylvester Stallone. Stallone can be a great actor, when he is challenged. He can deliver a great action movie; again, when challenged. He did neither here. He plays the character as a joke, thereby removing any real humor from the story. The essence of satire is to play it straight and let irony carry the joke. Stallone all but winks at the camera throughout the film.The next issue is Rob Schneider as comic relief. He's just not funny here. Whether that is a result of the script, changes made by Stallone, or his own disinterest is debatable. Suffice to say, he detracts from the story.What does work are the performances of Max Von Sydow, Jurgen Prochnow, Armand Assante and Diane Lane. They at least play it straight, and Assante is perfectly over-the-top as Rico.The costuming is also excellent, wonderfully adapting the look of the comic, while making it work with real clothing. I wondered how they would handle Dredd's uniform, especially the shoulder pads and helmet, but the filmmakers got it right and made it look good. They also handle the Lawmaster well and improved on the look of the Lawgiver (never liked the comic design).It's been said that Stallone took over the film and moved it completely away from the script. It certainly veered sharply away from the source material, although it took bits and pieces from it. Had Stallone played it straight, the film might have been more entertaining. As it stands, about a third of the film is very entertaining, but the rest ranges from a mixed bag to plain awful.The shame of it is that there is a wealth of material to explore for a Judge Dredd series. This is a movie that would be perfect for a remake. Robocop proved you could do an over-the-top, darkly satirical movie, with some subversive social commentary mixed in and a sense of fun. Most of that was nicked from the original Judge Dredd. Here's hoping someone else will take up the gauntlet and create a better film.",Judge Dredd
87,richieandsam,I liked it..,7,4 January 2014,"JUDGE DREDDNow the thing about this movie is everyone hates it except me.The movie is about a law enforcer set in the future that gets falsely accused of murder and is sentenced to life imprisonment. He escapes and is on a mission to try and find the person who set him up.Anyone that has read the comics hated this film due to the fact that is apparently so different to the comics. From what I have been told, Dredd never takes off his helmet and reveals his face. Not in this film. His helmet is taken off within 15 minutes of the movies start. I never read the comic so I don't know any other differences, but that is probably why I enjoyed it.This film has a very 90s feel to it. It reminds me in a way to Demolition Man. They are both set in the future and are both really good action movies, although Demolition Man is better. I do love the action films from the 90s. They have a good over the top feel to them.The acting is alright in it considering it is a cheesy action movie. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone as Dredd. He looks uncomfortable in this role some of the time, but then Stallone does not suit some roles. A young Diane Lane plays his partner. She does a pretty good job. I was very surprised to see a cameo from one of my favourite singers the legendary Ian Dury. He only had a very small part, but he was really good.The effects and explosions were really good and well done. But that is what was expected from the action films of that era. The gun fights were completely over the top too in a good way. I also loved the giant robot in the film. It was one of my favourite characters.If you like cheese, Sly Stallone, futuristic films and never read the Dredd comics then I can't see why you would hate this.I will give it 7 out of 10.""I am the law!""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Judge Dredd
88,domino1003,It Could Have Been Worse...At Least It's Not Rhinestone!,6,26 August 2003,"I actually enjoyed this film and can see where the hefty film budget went. Stallone is pretty good, although sometimes it's hard to understand what's he's saying most of the time. In the future Judges are basically the law. They are judge, jury and executioner. The best of the lot is Judge Dredd. When Dredd is framed for a murder he didn't commit, he ends up being exiled. He soon finds out that a former friend of his (Armand Assante)was behind the murders and has a plan to create a new order in the city. Saving graces are Armand Assante, doing his best villain role, Diane Lane as Dredd's fellow Judge and Rob Schneider, doing his usual comic relief. Worth renting if the video store is out of new releases and you just HAVE to rent something fun, or if you just want to have a Stallone fest party. Worth checking out!",Judge Dredd
89,nikola17,this movie is a fun Action Packed Not Great but still worth watching,8,1 September 2013,"i Enjoy Dredd (2012) it was awesome as well even i Liked This Movie but it wasn't balls to the wall Action scenes was good and fun but i agree what Stallone said it wasn't balls to wall agree and i did enjoy Judge Dredd movie with Stallone i liked the acting and his anger in movie like new one and i am not judge Dredd comic book reader sorry i am not but i enjoy and love the movies and i haven't read noting to books to it and i know Dredd doesn't take the helmet off that's what people say and never read the book of it i know people got Disappointment about this i didn't i liked it enjoy i am big Fan of Stallone big one and character Rico Dredd (Armand Assante) was pretty much of Psycho Path crazy guy well i know he is bad guy and Rob Schneider was worst in this movie i didn't find him funny in this film he played in 2 Stallone movies in Judge Dredd and Demotion Man but in this as apart from this movie not really that good when he was in Demotion Man he wasn't really part of movie only in 2 parts that's it in this in start and middle and end i really don't want Rob Schneider to be in this movie it was bit silly when he was in it that's why people saying why Rob in this movie ? people say Stallone Cartoon Version i don't find this Cartoon version i think that's how old movies was like that back then this is why Stallone had a bit Problems was this movie in Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut magazine in 2008 and he loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the 'action morality film' and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 8/10 for only Sylvester Stallone and worth watching action scenes it's still good movie but nots great as Cobra (1986) its like dredd but old version in different movie watch Cobra (1986) then watch Dredd (2012)you will understand",Judge Dredd
90,lordzedd-3,Good adaptation,8,31 March 2007,"I got to admit I know nothing on the comic book or as the Political Correct dorks put it now, Graphic Novels. But I must admit I liked this movie. The only time I read anything with Judge Dredd when the two companies crossed over and Dredd went through time to fight Batman. That's it. The effects are impressive, there is tons of action. But doesn't the Constitution guarantee the right to a trial by jury? So the comic book and this movie raises questions of ethics. So, not only do you have a great and funny action movie. But you have something to think about, the ethics behind the Judge program. I don't know why this movie didn't do well in the box office, I went to see it and I don't go to see many movies in the theater. I think it's underrated and I give this movie 8 STARS.",Judge Dredd
91,tankace,"Love Stallone ,but this film isn't any good.",5,29 September 2017,"I am a big fan of Sylvester Stallone ,however I have no issue saying that this film is very good ,the acting, the style of the mega-city and as for faith- fullness in the comic let's leave it at that. Thsi film could been at least decent ,but the thought to make it such a loud any cliché action film was beyond fluid and down right baffling. As for Stallone in the lead role... well he was and still is a good action star ,but in this film he is just a over the top policeman and not the iconic antihero we all know and love. His portrait makes difficult for me to take him serious ,with his corny manners. As for the plot well it is a interesting thought to use maybe the most famous story arc of the Judge, but though they hit all the needed points , the tension and the way is done cuts out every sense of suspense and shock. Over all this film is a good example of a comic-book film of the nineties, when big studios just learned how big is the comic audience and try to capitalize on the success of 1989 Batman, with out first figuring out what made it so good or what made the comic so beloved and of course which characters are the truly iconic like Batman, Wonder Woman ,Spiderman and not Spawn or Steel.",Judge Dredd
92,La Gremlin,Fun if you get to see it for free.,2,26 August 2000,"I saw part of this movie on television so it was edited and thus shorter, and more importantly it was free.  If you don't spend money on this movie, it's a pretty good time waster.  It's stupid, no doubt, but it's not really as bad as most reviewers have said (that's not saying a lot, though). Dredd's evil twin was a pretty cool character only in that this is the kind of movie that involves evil twins, bad robots, and cannibal hillbillies. And, hey, there are people who love this kind of movie!  It is to them that I heartily recommend this.  For everyone else, this is the movie that will make you REALLY appreciate ""the Fifth Element"".",Judge Dredd

I can't speak for my friend, but I am a big Stallone fan and even when a film like Judge Dredd may not be his best if your a true fan you come out and watch. The concept of this film is nice and neat which takes place in the future with Stallone judging people and being a one man police world! Many don't know that Judge Dredd is based on a comic book, and sure it's not as entertaining and exciting as Batman but this movie is a nice watch for any Stallone fan.",Judge Dredd
94,patches89,I AM THE LAW!!,5,1 June 2021,This film is silly but has the 80's/90's action movie feel to it largely thanks to Sly Stallone. The plot and acting is quite average to tell the truth but Stallone as Dredd as the hardnosed supercop in Mega City 1 who gets framed for murder fights his way through the corruption with convicted criminal Fergie played by Rob Schneider. The action scenes and one liners are fun and made this film quite an entertertaining film even if its hollow of any real meaning.,Judge Dredd
95,the amorphousmachine,More a Stallone movie than a Judge Dredd comic-book one,6,1 January 2007,"Never a huge fan of the ""Judge Dredd"" comics to get worked up by this film by Danny Cannon, and starring Sylvester Stallone. Though I can understand some of the disparaging comments towards this movie. To me, 'Judge Dredd' is more of a Stallone action film rather than a decent interpretation of the comic. I don't even think Judge Dredd ever takes off his mask in the comic. Stallone did look good with the mask on, but I think when this film became a Stallone movie the mask had to come off, as it just used the comic to become a vehicle for him, and I can I understand why some fans were annoyed.Nothing great here! Stallone gets the ""wrong man accused"" treatment and finds himself on the run. He was ""da law"", but now he has to fight it. Some decent make-up ala Mean Machine, and Rob Schneider added some needed comic relief. As an interpretation of Judge Dredd, it's probably not that good- but as a Stallone flick, it's merely okay escapist sci-fi action.*** out of *****!",Judge Dredd
96,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Star Wars meets Blade Runner in one of the worst disappointing Stallone flicks,1,27 October 2019,"Judge Dredd - The Rant! This is one of the worst Stallone movies i have seen so far in the 90's. I only hate Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot and this flop of a movie. This movie could be a bad-ass rated - R sci-fi futuristic action movie but NO! Stallone and Steven E. de Souza ruined this movie. Steven E. de Souza ruined Street Fighter in which Van Damme played! Steven E. de Souza ruined this film with slapstick comedy, the back story about, comedian sidekick. Action scenes are lame. Movie is boring. This is missed opportunity for Stallone. It could have been a good movie and it wasn't. Do I think Dredd from 2012 is better bad-ass action movie than Judge Dredd? Hell Yes! Dredd (2012) is the best sci-fi action film I saw.I did not read the comic books but is also disappointing that Dredd takes his helmet off. Why does Stallone have a blue eyes? In most of his movies Stallone has a brown eyes even in Rocky IV has brown eyes you can see that. This is not Stallone I remember he dosen't act like that. I don't know why Stallone did this movie or why he accept this role, that it wasn't meant for him. Steven E. de Souza completly ruined the script, the film is cut. Also Stallone was disappointed him self with this flick. Stallone already played Judge Dredd in 1986 called Cobra. Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti is Judge Dredd - The strong arm of the law. Crime is the disease meet the cure."" He already played Judge Dredd that's Cobra he alredy played that movie. ""This is where the law stops and I start..."" This could be Cobra II but it wasn't. Stallone played Judge Dredd twice he was the 21st century's most dangerous cop Sgt. John Spartan (a.k.a ""The Demolition Man""). Demolition Man that is Judge Dredd! John Spartan was already framed for involuntary manslaughter, Spartan was placed in the cryo-prison for a sentence of 70 years. Demolition Man is a bad-ass action sci-fi futuristic movie that is Judge Dredd. I recommend that movie to everyone. It is my personal favorite movie, it is my movie.I hate Rob Schneider a humoristic comedian sidekick. I think that was really a shame Dredd without helmet and with a comedian humoristic sidekick. The villians were weak bad guys!! Armand Assante I like and respeact he come visit Slovenia, Bled in 2000 and he like it. This role just wasn't for Armand Assante because the villian he played was weak and the cast who played villians were weak. There is no memorable villains or gangs in here. The action is really lame. The story is lame it was wrong and it dosen't work.The acting from Armand Assante as Rico is lame ""You want caos I am caos."" Or that Rico and Dredd are brothers is stupid! Dredd is framed for a crime he did not commit that was already in Demolition Man and Tango & Cash!! When Rico uses his DNK in his lab for Project Janos he was trying to create a clones so that he will run the city and he will create mass destructive army. But that plot was already used. It was in Demolition Man. When Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) was unfreezing Crycons so that he will create an army of killers. Than Dredd gets another sidekick by Diane Lane as Barbara Hershey. But we already had a lady sidekick in Demolition Man that was Sandra Bullock - Lenina Huxley!When I watch this movie not only humor is bad, but I would rather watch Blade Runner (1982) because special effect in Blade Runner are much better create it. It is much better future than in this movie. I would rather watch Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) which is miles way better sci-fi movie. Dredd (2012) is a bad-ass much better movie. Judge Dredd is a failure. I hate this movie. Karl Urban is better Dredd! ""Ma Ma is not Law, I am the Law!"" Karl Urban acted perfectly as Dredd. That movie reboot was based on comic book story. This movie is not and it is one of the worst superhero movies ever.A real disappointing Stallone flick ever. I rented this film on VHS in the video store in 1997 when I was a kid and even that time I thought this movie is bad with a bad name and it is weak. This is not an action movie. I like The Specialist that Sly made in 1994 I gave it pass it was a cheesy revenge film but I still like it. This movie I am not giving a pass. Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Bad Boys and GoldenEye - 007 come out the same year in 1995 and they were more successfully action movies than Judge Dredd. Directed was by Danny Cannon who also directed I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998) and I like that film, but I hate Judge Dredd!This movie is better than Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot Stallone made, but that's all. This movie is a STINKER in my opinion.",Judge Dredd
97,The_Wood,6/10 Some fun to be had,9,22 January 2002,"I feel Judge Dredd doesn't really get the respect it deserves.  Let me explain.  While this isn't a great film by any means, it is entertaining, and it doesn't kiddie itself up for teens.Judge Dredd is a R rated comic book.  That right there may limit its audience, because most filmgoers might feel comic books are just for kids, and they are goofy.  Well that is true with Dredd, it is goofy, but its far too violent and chauvinist for small children.  Perhaps that is part of its charm.It's a nice action movie, with a good hard helping of violence, and interesting characters: including redneck cannibals and a giant robot.  The film would have been much better with out the comic relief of Rob Schneider.The film could have benefitted from some Diane Lane nudity.",Judge Dredd
98,ReelCheese,Not What It Was Supposed To Be,3,17 August 2014,"JUDGE DREDD was meant to be the summer blockbuster of 1995. The fusion of Stallone asskick and the newly hot comic book genre was supposed to be irresistible to audiences. Visions of a franchise a la BATMAN danced in the minds of studio execs.Instead, JUDGE DREDD went down as one of the biggest disappointments of the year, a huge critical and commercial flop and another skid stain in the descent of Stallone's career. And it's easy to see why.JUDGE DREDD is loud and contrived. It is poorly edited with a guaranteed cliché every ten minutes. It flows with as much ease as a sandpaper Slip 'N Slide. While it cost $70M, huge dollars back in '95, today it looks like something you'd see on the CW.Stallone, his pupils blanketed by icy blue contacts, alternates between so-so and apathetic in his titular performance. He does, however, spew his ridiculous dialogue with the zeal of a man falsely convinced the words will become catchphrases. (How could he not see the folly in a line like, ""I should have taken care of you myself -- personally""? Well, what exactly can you take care of yourself but not personally?).The supporting crew is no aid. Armand Assante, our evil-for-the-sake-of-being-evil villain, is given surprisingly little to do except cackle like a Saturday morning cartoon baddie. Diane Lane looks like she's trying but never fits into the nonsensical mishmash. Comic relief Rob Schneider serves up exactly one laugh (""We don't have time for this"" he disgustingly remarks as Stallone unclothes a judge to pilfer his uniform) and is generally annoying otherwise.The whole thing is overseen by Englishman Danny Cannon, then an inexperienced director in his mid-20s who was inexplicably handed the keys to this wreck. The action sequences -- of which there are actually few -- are not Cannon's strength. He seems confused and over his head, not knowing quite what to do other than shout ""Action!"" on random, pointless explosions and trite fighting sequences. One suspects there must be a director's cut of this film floating around somewhere that makes far more sense than what made it into theatres.But I'm convinced that the biggest reason JUDGE DREDD was an unexpected failure is its appearance and source material. With his gold-armor-covered spandex and very plasticy helmet, Stallone looks like Captain Power, the hero of the 1980s TV show at which children fire their light-sensing guns. Sure it's a faithful replication of the comic-book Judge Dredd, but who cares? Judge Dredd was (and still is) such an obscure character that to think his name recognition would draw bums into theatre seats is naïve to the point of absurdness.Who didn't want to like this movie? Stallone, despite his many poor career decisions (this being perhaps the worst... and that's saying something!), is a great action hero. But this is just a mismatch for him, and I can't imagine he was pleased with how it turned out. The final verdict: mindlessly mediocre.",Judge Dredd

100,TheHande,"Stallone's ""serious"" sci-fi film",8,2 October 2008,"There are three reasons why I love this film.1.) It's based on a comic book 2.) It's science fiction 3.) Jürgen Proschnow While Judge Dredd is undoubtedly guilty of featuring a number of action-movie clichés it also has an interesting story. The setting of the film, which raises some thoughts about fascism, among others, has always appealed to me, especially if compared to Stallone's decisively less serious Demolition Man.While some of the plot-elements can be considered somewhat over done, it's the little intricacies of the plot and the subtlety of the films pace that make it into a credible film. I also can't deny that the production values were appropriate and the special-effects still look convincing by today's standards.While Judge Dredd is not really among the all greats of the science fiction genre, it definitely deserves mention for depicting a believable future-society and a hard-hitting plot. The more human and comical elements undoubtedly take away some of its credibility but over-all, it's a good movie.",Judge Dredd
101,swedzin,Laaaauuuwww!!,6,3 October 2012,"$70,000,000 dollars... straight down the drain... I remember seeing this film as a kid, boy... it was a hot summer. You know, as a kid, you'll be impressed by everything. What's another Stallone film for you? A whole fun all the time just for you. Being older now... I can easily review this film... for starters... it's a crap. Danny Canon... read the comic.The comic book was ruined by this film. And you know why? Because it has Stallone written all over it! Stallone, being an famous action hero of 80s, he was already famous for his action star status. Judge Dredd (1995) is nothing more than typical, everyday Stallone film. And guess what? He did it terrible. Stallone's retarded talent for acting gave us a bunch of face palms over and over. And he removed his helmet in the film. Judge Dredd always has his helmet on his head, well of course, because it's Stallone film... he can't afford not to show his face to the audience and his beloved fans. That... high-blown, pretentious, selfish pr*ck. Guess what, Sly? You are not pretty at all, keep that helmet on. Under the helmet he looks kinda alright, but when he speaks... damn... he is loud mouthed, and incomprehensible, that's ordeal that you need to tolerate. Disgusting. Loudmouthed... midget, stallion co*sucker... unbelievable.Armand Assante was great. He is a great actor, though on few occasions I thought that he is going to dance or sing, just like in ""Mambo Kings"", well... I wouldn't mind. Assante really gave us a fine performance here, and he can pronounce ""law"" better than Sly. Diane Lane, well she was OK, but I don't understand why joined this testosterone crap? Rob Schneider? A comic relief that ruined the film, now I won't deny that I laughed on a few occasions, but still he ruined it more. Max Von Sydow? Why? What is he doing here? Waste of such a good actor from Bergman's films. And Jurgen Prochnow? Here too? Stiff as a board. But still we need German actors to plays traitor villains... Joan Chen who came out of nowhere... she was kinda hot. And to mention Ewan Bremmer... a good guy in British, but in US, you are evil. And James Remar as a gang leader who looks like futuristic Gantz from 48 Hrs (1982)... what a hell? Other things as cinematography, costumes, music score, CGI... well that was OK, Alan Silvestri's score was good, set decoration was excellent, very good these things were OK... but.. can't save the film. Because it already failed at most important things. The story is kinda over the top, created for these kind of films where ""leading actor"" is bigger than the film, and it should be other way around. I gave this film 6 out 10 because it's highly entertaining, and that's the only thing this movie is worth watching for. OK, perhaps maybe... the ABC warrior, he was pretty cool, very nice work and Mean Machine from Angel family. That was good.My advise... go see Dredd (2012).",Judge Dredd

104,BrickNash,"A very decent and polished action sci-fi film, but will never be lived down by comic book vultures!",7,7 April 2013,"For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself.The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits.As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film, and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers' ego, when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience - which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad!The good is the fact that there is lots of it here.The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part, and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it. Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice, and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match.The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm.This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd.When boiled down, what we essentially have here is 15 minutes of a Judge Dredd film, with the rest basically being Demolition Man 2. Once the helmet is off, Stallone shifts into a carbon copy of John Spartan, and it's a shame becasue he was doing quite well as Dredd beforehand. It's still enjoyable as just that, but obviously it would have been better if they had stuck to the source,If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two, then Judge Dredd is well worth checking out. However, if you're looking for authenticity, well you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!",Judge Dredd

106,LuboLarsson,Should have been great,5,28 March 2004,"I had high hopes for Judge Dredd after reading articles in magazines on the movie and seeing the fabulous trailer, then the first review I seen had the headline ""Judge Dreddful"", my heart sank. I've never been into Judge Dredd or read 2000 AD but I always knew about the character as many of my friends were big fans and read the comic and I always thought it would make a fantastic movie. I remember rumours that Swarzenegger was to play the role way back in the late 80's but nothing came of it, then Stallone was announced to be playing the part. I thought that was a great choice as I have always been a big fan of Sly, plus he was coming off making Cliffhanger and Demolition Man and appeared to be back on form after a few lousy comedies. But something went wrong as Judge Dredd is pretty disappointing to say the least. It does however look absolutely brilliant. Stallone is pretty good but Rob Scheidner doesn't seem to fit in at all. The music is fantastic as well. The story isn't that great however and I think they didn't get the right director for the film either. Sadly this seems to have killed off any hope of another attempt at what could be a great movie franchise. Judge Dredd will however live on in the comics and video games. ***5/10***",Judge Dredd
107,sam_smithreview,"a good action film, but a great entertaining film",7,23 April 2016,"Stallone is one hell of a unique actors around. He was type cast as the action hero, because he doesn't have much of acting range. This movie was sold, like all comic book movies of the 1990's a pure action film, with bits of laughter here and there.This film is a fun ride, and I never get tired of it. The special effects and sets are great for the times.You can tell there was a lot of attention to detail when they made this, and making it in the England where Judge Dredd was created was also cool since so many of these big films are made over in Hollywood.If you are looking for an entertaining action film with some comedy then check out Judge Dredd. Many people claim that the New Dredd film with Karl Urban is a better film since it is more closer in tone to the comics. Whilst it isn't a bad film, I found it quite boring and didn't buy Karl Urban as Judge Dredd at all, unlike Stallone who is clearly a tough guy and not just *acting* the part.",Judge Dredd

In a futuristic world ruled by cops with instant judiciary powers, Judge Joseph Dredd, who is highly regarded as the best, is wrongly accused of murder in this futuristic version of THE FUGITIVE. Entertaining, with loud special effects (that seem dated now), but is hampered by stupid dialogue (Student: `The picture is fake, Hershey.' Hershey responds `You mean it isn't real?') and an all-too-familiar climax. The film loses 2 points, however, for including probably the most annoying character I have ever seen in a film: Fergie, played by Rob Schneider.

The comic relief actually fits in with the comic style, and this captures well the look and feel of the Judges, Mega City One, and the Cursed earth - with good costumes, props and special effects for the bikes, weapons, robots and so on. But the story is only very weakly set in the Judge Dredd universe, and is the weakest element of the whole.

Stallone was terrible, and nothing about his character was enjoyable or even tolerable. Laughable special effects are a given, but half of the time they went overboard for no good reason (besides the fact that this is Judge Dredd). I felt like most of the dialogue was unscripted as well.Rob Schneider's comic relief was funny at times (except the beginning), but he had all the makings of a good main character.

Sly Stallone nicely captures Dredd's rock-hard persona, and also imbues human warmth to the character.  Though Rob Schneider's comedy relief is abysmal (as bad as Jar-Jar Binks, and that is bad), the film survives him and succeeds with garishly attractive visuals, sets, props, special effects, and an otherwise superb cast, all fleshed out with Alan Silvestri's magnificent score with The Sinfonia of London.",Judge Dredd
112,talllwoood13,I was suprised,8,21 September 2021,"I have never read anything to do with Judge Dredd so I can't compare the movie to anything it's based on. However I enjoyed this a lot more than any watered down 9999 Marvel or DC movies that are spewed out every year it feels like. Honestly how can people hate this? Unless they grew up with Judge Dredd in other media forms prior to this.I LOVE how poor the acting is in this. Sly always looks like he's taking the best poop ever with his facial reactions and how he delivers just about every line. I have no idea how else to describe it. The movie had a lot of great special effects that were inspired by video games and similar giving it this almost Fifth Element vibe and the eat recycled food sounds a lot better than most of the fad diets you hear movie stars and similar go on today. The futuristic outfits and cars for the most part worked really well too.The opening scene with Sylvester was so great. It reminded me of the opening of a movie he did called Cobra which if you haven't seen it. Watch it, it's incredible. The over the top acting in both reminds me of Riki Oh and of course the first Toxic Avenger. But does the bad acting mean the movie isn't great? No far from it!Judge Dredd comes off as very cold and heartless. He always seems on like a WWE wrestler in public to have this put on tough guy image. The voice activated firearms he has is really ahead of its time and of course the different ammunitions. It reminds me of the gun Zorg has in fifth element. It honestly works how he almost never wears his helmet because a lot of the scenes would be too cheesy or over the top if he didn't.The dystopian city is really beaten to death in so many movies but I suppose they made it work. It's surprisingly multicultural for the cast that are going to be judges considering this movie was made in 1995. Not that multiculturalism matters at all to me. If a movie is good they can be all the same family for all I care. If the movie is good, it's good. Millennials take the tiniest of things too seriously.The super criminal in the movie without ruining anything escapes from prison too easily and I despise when actors blink their eyes when they fire guns. However I like the back story they used with him as it makes the second part of the movie make sense.When Sly gets banished and gets on the plane to reflect on one prisoner who just happens to be there seemed kind of shoe horned in but they made it work. I'm glad to see whenever this story is based on you can still sneak weapons on planes. However when the plane gets shot down and Sly and Rob have to fight off the cannibals was a bit over the top, the fact they survived the crash seemed like a miracle. But it's not a realistic movie, you've got to have some fun. The way the metal faced cannibal dies is so over the top that I love it.The standard cops in this movie really remind me with their voice of that fifth element voice effect a lot of people used.It would have been interesting to see two exact Sylvester Stallones fighting. Sort of like Double Impact with JCVD.All in all it was a fun movie and really deserves a watch if you're sick of batman, super man and whatever Disney thinks we need right now.",Judge Dredd

Recently I bought it on VHS the other day and checked it out for the second time. I actually liked it better this time around. The film is extremely well produced with great effects and sets. The costumes are excellent as well. While action is the meat of this film, the plot isn't terrible and there are some decent sci-fi concepts at play throughout. Diane Lane looked so freaking hot...man what a babe. There is an awesome terminator style robot and a freaky cyborg dude with an adjustable rage setting that looked super cool also. This film is very fast paced as well, its over before you realize it. While Judge Dredd doesn't really make you think a lot, it certainly delivers with blast away action (and even a couple of laughs).

115,Keyser Soze-12,Good old stupid fun,4,1 October 2000,"First off, I'm going to say how stupid this movie is.  Number 1: it's about clones.  No, it's not like Gattaca.  Number 2: it has cannibal hillbilly Christians.  Number 3: the guns in this movie make a zapping noise that is very familiar to ray gun I had when I was 6.  Number 4: cheesy PG dialog in an R rated movie.  Number 5: stupid one-liner catch phrases that repeat themselves way too often (I knew you'd say that).  Finally, Number 6: Rob Schneider is so stupid that I'm surprised Stalone hasn't killed him yet. Number 7: the city in the movie is a direct rip off of Blade Runner.  I'm not saying this movie is any better than Blade Runner, because I hated that movie.  If you want to find out why, then go read my review of it.Now, I'm going to tell you why this movie is fun.  Number 1: GIANT KICK ASS ROBOT!!!!!!!!!  Number 2: cool uniforms.  Number 3: Armand Assante is sooo good in this movie.  Number 3: flying motorcycle things.  Number 4: good CGI effects.  Number 5: great sets.  Number 6: Stalone was made to play Judge Dredd like Arnold was made to be the Terminator.  Number 7:some of it is funny.  Okay, so what did I think of this movie?  I liked it because it's fun.  It has its fair share of problems, the entire desert sequence with the hillbillies should have been cut out completely.  But, it's just fun to see. If you haven't seen this movie before, don't rent it over some other movie. But if there is nothing else you want to see, and you got some spare money, pick this one up, preferably on DVD for the sound.  If you like classic SCI/FI, then you will hate this movie.  If you just want to relax and watch something that wont make you think too hard, see this movie.

That the cinematography and sets look like made for TV? That there have been dozens of movies about dystopian future and they have all been better?

117,ray-280,Diane Lane's Finest Film,10,19 June 2007,"This is on my list of one of the ten or twenty best films ever made, even though I am not likely qualified to ""Judge"" it, since I watched the movie not because I am a fan of the comic series that gave birth to the well-developed characters, but because I went to high school with Diane Lane, who also happens to be my cousin's ex-girlfriend.Diane's career has left me on cable watching films like Unfaithful, The Outsiders, Rumble Fish, or Touched by Love, and the god-awful Perfect Storm, where death and happy endings are not mutually exclusive. I've never disliked her work, as she's a highly competent actress, as well as a physically stunning, highly intelligent, socially polished and engaging lady, but this was the first time I actually saw her stand out in a role, and make a film far better than it would have been without her. On that note, if the producers of the long-awaited Dallas movie can find a better Sue Ellen (or Pam), please let me know who that is. In Judge Dredd, Diane absolutely, positively shines as Judge Hershey, second-year ""street judge"" and sidekick to the title character.America has been reorganized in the future due to climate catastrophe, leaving us with a ""cursed earth"" wilderness that doubles as an outdoor prison camp requiring no guards, and several ""megacities"" where the old justice system has been replaced by a new system that centers around the ""judges,"" men and women sworn to uphold the law, by functioning as police, DA, judge, jury, and if need be, executioner. What is fascinating about this film is that the new society is not fascist, and despite the judges holding all of the power, the commitment to human rights and fairness appears to exceed our own in the present day. Power which we would call unconstitutional is not used to suppress the people, but to empower them by maintaining law and order in the best way possible under their circumstance.The plot is pretty standard comic action fare, so I won't delve too deeply here into it, other than to note the strong supporting cast, including Rob Schneider as the ""action buddy"" with all its inherent humor, Armand Assante as the line-blurring Rico, and Joan Chen as Ilsa. Still, it is Diane who stands out, and who managed to make Stallone a convincing romantic lead in a way Talia Shire never could. Hershey softens Dredd just enough while respecting his aloofness and inflexibility; she laments his inability to display emotion even as she admires it. Hershey seems to accept, reluctantly, that what causes her to love Dredd is also what makes it impossible for her to be with him. This subplot is explored with just the right touch in the film.The people who NEED to see this film are those who believe that the American way is the only way. Dredd's era and his society have their flaws, but no more or less than could be expected of any society of any generation, living under any system of rules. This is an exceptionally thought-provoking and well-acted film that every serious DVD collector should own.",Judge Dredd
118,filmbuff1970,More Fun Than Xmen 2 or Spiderman 2,9,17 September 2004,"This movie is far more fun than the boring Xmen 2 or Spiderman 2. Why simply because it does not have a hero constantly whining about being a super hero. The whole point of a super hero is he is super. I don't need a action movie to have less action and more character study. Action movies should entertain not bore the pants off people. I want my heroes to be like heroes, not ones that could do with a slap. This is fast paced and one of the best action movies of 1995, just compare it to Waterworld, Batman Forever and Die Hard with a vengeance. This is superior to those movies yet flopped. If Schwarzenegger had been in this it would of done well, but Stallone movies never got a fair review. The Special FX are superior to the awful Playstation 2 cgi rubbish we get now.

The movie almost succeeds as a cheesey, sci-fi flick in many respects.  The set is beautifully done, probably the best part of the entire movie.  Likewise, the effects are well-done, and many of the action sequences are quite entertaining.  The plot's not great, but it holds up (until...read on...).However, this movie not only trips at the last hurdle: it falls flat on its face, weakly staggers back to its feet, and limps awkwardly to the finish line with this goofy look on its swollen face as the audience gawks, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.  I've never seen a movie go from ""alright"" to ""bad"" to ""even worse"" in such a short period.  In the last half hour, the plot starts to crumble; the last 15 minutes are simply atrocious.

""Judge Dredd,"" the 1995 action film starring Sylvester Stallone is in fact a great film and is probably the best action film to come out during the Summer of 1995. I will go as far as to say this is Stallone's most underrated film. Never have a seen such a Stallone film get trashed by fans and critics alike. What do you expect. This film was not trying to grab any Oscars or special awards. It was just a feel-good action film that I felt had a good plot. Now at times, I will agree that this movie had a certain level of cheesiness but it was good cheese. Did I mention that this film had very good special effects? That was another plus about this film. Now I will say that Stallone and Schneider didn't have the best chemistry in the world, but they could've easily worked on that so that was a minor to medium flaw, in my opinion. This film definitely doesn't deserve the criticism that it gets. It's a shame that this film only took in a meager 34 million out of it's massive 90 million dollar budget.

The acting was really bad and needed some major improvements and the scene where dredd and his friend are driving on the hover bike its shows some bad green screen and the inclusion of Sylvester Stallone was cool but i wasn't really stoked about him and im glad and so are my parents that he isn't in the new one, like i said i dont hate him i just never seen any of his movies but hes making the new rambo last blood movie that i will see a little while after it comes out so yeah. Some actors were annoying like dredds friend which i dont know the name of right now because i forgot. I came in scared but at the end my parents all gave it a 9 and hey i cant disagree and i say the same, a 9 it is and im so excited for the new dredd especially the motorcycle chase in the intro and the cool atmosphere and music.

122,James_Denton,A 23 year old film but certainly worth a watch,7,2 April 2018,"To rate this film without being mindful of its age would be unfair.Since first reading a 2000 AD comic in 1990 I was a fan of Judge Dredd and eagerly awaited the release of this film. The music, introduction, 'block wars', his lawgiver, lawmaster, the Judge uniform, cursed earth and much more are all in this film... and for a fan like me it's fantastic!!However, in the cold light of day it's easy to see I was caught in the euphoria of seeing my comic book hero brought to the big screen, and with a little reflection I saw its flaws.Sylvester Stallone does a reasonable job of portraying Judge Dredd, he certainly has the physic and at times had a tired look that brought to life what I imagined Judge Dredd would look like, but there is no escaping the fact that its Sylvester Stallone playing the role... a role that bears an uncanny resemblance to his character in Demolition Man.In one scene he voice activates the gun mode rapid fire, but instead of saying, ""Rapid Fire""... it comes out as a mumbled mess only Sylvester Stallone can do. A comedic moment to say the least, and to this day leaves me wondering how on earth his lawgiver knew what to do?Rob Schneider attempts to bring a degree of unnecessary comedy to the film, but soon becomes more of an irritation than anything else.The film isn't without its pluses, as a great deal of authenticity is brought to the viewer in the form of characters and places that are true to the Judge Dredd comics. However, it's all a little too much and the saying 'little is more' is true here.If you are a Judge Dredd fan then this is worth a watch and certainly compares better to some more modern action films.",Judge Dredd
123,ikrani,One of the Great Bad Movies of the '90s,10,5 March 2014,"Judge Dredd is a bad movie: it's hammy, it's flawed, and it's nothing like the source material, which, given how the fans of the comic go nuts over that boring remake, might be a good thing.The making of bad movies is a lost art, but one that might be rekindled by Robert Rodriguez's ""Machete"" series. It's hard to tell when a movie goes from being bad to awful, but it can be accurately summed up in one word: ""shameless"". Films that came out in the '90s didn't try to be emotionally riveting or emphasize some kind of lesson like all of Christopher Nolan's comic book adaptations. They just wanted to do what film originally did: ENTERTAIN.And by God is this movie entertaining. Stallone as Judge Dredd was PERFECT casting on the director's part, since he wouldn't have to emote as much and his bad acting wouldn't become that apparent. Max von Sydow is good as the old and tired Chief Justice, and Diane Lane is good as the more human Judge Hershey. Armand Assante as the villainous Rico is a surprisingly complex ham and cheese sandwich with some very interesting viewpoints on innocence and guilt. Yes, Rob Schneider has some rather annoying moments but, to the film's credit, he does help out on more than one occasion and even saves Dredd once.The story is told pretty well through what I can only describe as ""throwaway exposition"". This is a method of delivering story by slowly feeding it through seemingly throwaway lines that become relevant later. The JANUS project is hinted at by most of the characters in their conversations along with the incidents that led Rico's downfall. It's a good way of storytelling as the audience is kept wondering about what all this talk of conspiracy and murder is leading up to, and this film doesn't disappoint in its final revelation.All in all, this is a fun and ultimately enjoyable film. What elements that don't make much sense (like the motivations of one judge on the High Council) become irrelevant as the story takes off and the forces driving the plot shift around. If you're a fan of bad movies like I am, give it a watch.And if your a killjoy AD2000 fan who hates different interpretations of his beloved source material, then stop whining about Dredd's helmet being off and go watch that crappy 2012 remake.",Judge Dredd

These are those movies that are filled with fun, do not emphasize much on the other aspects like deep story or a plot and other elements. Judge Dredd very clearly comes under such a range of films.I have read that this movie is based on a comic book. However, I have not read the comic so I cannot comment about the faithfulness of this movie to the comics. As far as the story is concerned, the plot is pretty simple with only an occasional twist here and there. In the end, the movie is far too predictable in terms of its end. A typical Hollywood action flick. Bad and the good show down for one final time and guess who triumphs.The catch phrases in the movie and the one-liners are definitely not something you are going to feel like reciting after coming out of the movie hall. Stallone's acting is simply absent. He is just a scowling rough guy with a very little range of emotions and expressions on his face.In the bundle of all that it lacks, I feel that the movie is ignored for its imagery. The movie is filled with impressive imagery and computer graphics that are worthy of respect. This movie is worth one watch though unlike other Stallone movies you would not feel like going back and seeing it once again unless you really like a few aspects of it.All in all  a one watch movie that won't leave so big a lasting impression.",Judge Dredd

It's a bit like Snakes on a Plane - if you go in expecting it to be a bad movie then you'll probably enjoy it. I love the music though. Really. It has a theme that sticks with you after it's finished. Good action too.All in all - for me this is a guilty pleasure.

Judge Dredd (Stallone) is the greatest and more admired and respected judge in the city, but suddenly he is accused for the crime of a journalist an his wife. Dredd then faces the challenge to probe that he is innocent, with the help of Judge Hershey (Diane Lane), an extremely good Judge and Lawyer, Herman Ferguson or Fergie (Rob Schneider) an coward and funny computer hacker who was convicted by Dredd and the support of Chief Justice Fargo (Max Von Sydow). He has to fight against one of the more evil criminal minds in his time, Rico (Armand Assante), and some of his allies.The special effects in this movie are really good, and the futuristic view has a resemble of the fifth element (flying cars, and the sense of chaos), the acting performances are good; some people critic the role of Stallone, but if they had read the comic in which the movie is based (2000 A.D.) they would see that Stallone plays the role as it is (you can feel that the Judge Dredd of the comic is now in the screen as he is); Rob Schneider plays a good comic role and complement the depressing and cold Dredd Character; Diane Lane, makes good as an intelligent officer too.This entertaining sci-fi film is good to have a good time with good action and excellent visual effects, worth to see 7/10",Judge Dredd

We all knew that at some point Stallone was going to take off the helmet, it was also likely that there would be a romantic storyline built in. While not part of the totalitarian ruthless character of the future lawman, it was an important part of getting a wider audience to watch the film.
Alas what could have been the start of a great franchise ended up as a sub par 90's action movie. The film looked good, there were some solid actors but it just didn't work.
Part of the problem was that the film tried to cover too much. There were multiple plot lines from the comic, each able to fill a movie quite easily, squashed down so none of them were satisfying.

I would have liked to have given it no stars at all it is seriously that bad! Where do I start and how do I keep it brief....? Oohh I know, let's start with the fact that the artists in 24 - 25 years of drawing the character have NEVER and I mean NEVER revealed his face. The reason for this is it is a much more menacing force when confronted by the unknown. In this case it is unknown what he is thinking, and it is unknown what it is he is going to be doing. The perp (short for perpetrator) cannot play him and therefore he becomes everything that is right within the law up right up to the line. If a perp puts a foot over that line into unlawful territory he/she is served justice in no uncertain terms. Now I know that in a Hollywood film the main lead has to show his/her face all the time (especially if it is a big name like Sylvester Stallone but couldn't they have just this once embodied the spirit of the comic and got him to permanantly (just as it is in the comics) keep the helmet on? They could have done with reading a lot more of the comics because Stallone's performance must surely go down as the worst of his career. He has put in some wonderful performance in his time like in Copland, Over The Top, Oscar, and Tango and Cash to name just four of his many non-action roles in which I think he was superb but in this film he and the director completely fail to hit it at all.Mega City 1 is not bad and the bikes and helmets are OK as in they all look pretty much as they are supposed to but there weren't enough Mega City 1 residents for my liking. And of the ones that there were there weren't enough doing what the residents do to give Mega City 1 a totally authentic Mega City 1 feel. For example there weren't any that had had body parts placed in the wrong places due to botched surgery or fatties walking with belly-wheels. They even could have done with showing the 'lighter' side of Mega City 1.As I watched the film I kept getting the feeling that something was missing to make it a true representation of 2000 AD's leading and main character and city. Actually I kept getting the feeling that there was a lot missing and instead of it being a serious film of a serious character and city, it became a caricature of one of the most fantastic comic creations that has been created within the last 30 years because it really does poke fun at it (not in a nice way but a 'heck-it's-only-a-British-character-and-story-from-a-British-comic.'

About 10 mins ago in Stallone shows up and all the silly cheese starts. It is non offensive but is way over the top as you would expect.The SFX are actually still ok (2020) although some of the flying bike scenes are early CGI and are rough.The film is cheese and you don't have to have 2 brain cells to work out what is going on. It's a standard Stallone 90s flick although not one of his best. It's a bit like the 6th day and Demolition man rolled into 1 but not as good as either.Rob Schneider is just annoying. 20% of what he brings to the table would have worked but he is way over the top and the bumbling sidekick!All in all, stick it in if you want some carefree action.",Judge Dredd

Sly is probably the best at finding good actresses to team with and he doesn't disappoint here. His teaming with Sandra Bullock in DEMOLITION MAN works great and Diane Lane (""Judge Bitch"" to the evil scientist she battles) holds her own with him almost as well. Action films demand really mean villains for their heroes to overcome and Armand Assante is a capable actor, but he doesn't give Sly a really memorable final battle sequence, and their scenes together weren't nearly enough to illustrate how their characters became the way they were. I think some flashbacks to their lives together would have fleshed this picture out much better. All told, this film doesn't measure up to Stallone's other action flicks, but it's still pretty entertaining for its visuals of the future and a few decent action sequences, and some clever throwaway lines by Stallone, Lane and Rob Schneider.Dale Roloff",Judge Dredd

With this poll taking place in 1980-81, most readers voted for CHARLES BRONSON or JAMES COBURN. To be true, either BRONSON or COBURN had the 'DREDD' look, but were getting on a bit, in years. Finally after many legal wrangles, the movie got made in 1995, and SYLVESTER STALLONE was picked to play the futuristic lawman. Once made, the fans picked holes in the movie. DREDD takes his helmet off (the fans could not forgive this) but allow Hollywood, a certain 'artistic licence'. Obviously STALLONE had to show his face (if only in the scenes were he's incarcerated, unlike the 2000AD 'JUDGE CALIGULA' stories, whereas he was bandaged up, due to a snipers wound) Now nearly ten years on, the movie is still fresh, the effects still special, and STALLONE still shines (despite what people say, STALLONE is the only 'tough-guy' i'd want to see play DREDD, right down to the comic-book 'snare') Every performance is great in this movie (especially MAX VON SYDOW) and director DANNY CANNON has come in for a lot of misguided flack. And it's also good to see that other minor 2000AD elements have been kept intact. The 'ANGEL FAMILY' are exactly as i remember them in the comics, and the set design, is MEGA-CITY-ONE come to life.

Everything else is a wasteland, destroyed by (presumably) a Nuclear War. However, these cities are really big, and really, really high-tech. Massive skyscrapers everywhere, and hovering and flying vehicles filling the air. The cities are more living than any cities today. Unfortunetly, the violence has also increased. There are crimes going on everywhere. From gangwars and riots to murders and stealing on every street, 24/7. Not exactly a paradise.
The Judges (The police force of the future) keep the law and order in the city. They are both Jury, Judge and Executioners. If they find someone guilty of murder, they might execute him on the spot. The Judges live a life full of danger, and every day might be their last. The most respected Judge out there is Judge Dredd (Sly Stallone). He was born geneticly and his childhood was one of lonleyness and despair. He therefore lacks emotions and human feelings. One day, Dredd is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and is sent to a prison colony. But he escapes the transport, and finds himself in the wastelands outside the city walls, with a new companion. Ferguson (Played by Rob Schieder, almost the highlight of the film)Dredd must now get inside the city, and find the maniac who framed him, and most likely putting a bullet between his eyes as well.
I really like this movie. I liked it from the first time I saw it. Even though its nowhere near an Oscar winning movie, or an intellectual film, its a really good action film. Then again, it might have something to do with me being a Science-Fiction freak. I can't think of a single Sci-Fi movie I don't like... But I like this one a little bit more than most of the others.

139,timefreezer7,Another underrated Stallone film (small spoilers),8,30 May 2001,"This film is surely inferior than the brilliant Demolition Man but it HAS redeeming qualities . Personally I understand people who disliked because they read the comics. Maybe the point of the comic was different , maybe they wanted other characters to appear like the horrifying Judge Death , maybe important characters were altered , not to mention Dredd NEVER takes his helmet off . But every viewer will have to compromise whenever a book or a comic hero or historic event or even a fairy tale(!) is being transferred in big screen . They always undergo serious changes . For us who have not read the comics this movie can definitely stand on its own . There are accusations that it is a rip-off of Blade Runner and other sci-fi films . Come on people ! Matrix was also a copy from Dark City but it was praised beyond all measure . The screenplay with the poitical conspiracies , the clones etc also reminds Demolition Man , Total Recall and others . Who CARES ? The brilliance of the script is that it created 4 VERY STRONG characters . It reminded me of Batman Returns . Despite the plot flaws the basic heroes were so well written and reliable that each of them could carry a movie by his own . Here we have Judge Dredd (Stallone) , Judge Hersey (Diane Lane) , small crook Fergey (Rob Schneider) and Max Von Sydow excellently playing Chief Judge as a father figure . Diane Lane is one of the most dynamic female heroes . She plays a crucial and ACTIVE part in the plot . At last , not some decorative beautiful doll just for love interest. Unfortunately the villains are miscast and somehow disappointing . It does not matter . The direction and SFX are good (but could have been better) but the music score by Alan Sylvestri steals the show . The acting from the good guys is quite good . I will have to admit that there were subplots not well developped like the Dredd - Rico relationship . Also Dredd is somehow bullet repelling !!! (he is never hit). There is much unwanted violence and the desert hiibillies are a bit corny (but in a sense cult) Despite the flaws there some classic moments like the Council 's sessions or the trial scene . The plot is unfolding very fast and you are never bored (and I have seen it 6 times) . Also there are classic one-liners . But probably the best scene is when Dredd is in row to be transported to jail while the echo of Griffin 's words says that he should be erased from our heart and our memories forever .Simultaneousley the aged Judge Fargo departs in full honner for his exile in desert someone says "" May he be written in our hearts and our memories FOREVER "" it is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema. Don 't get carried away by obsessed comic fans . Give it a shot.JUDGE DREDD                                          7.5  / 10",Judge Dredd

On the contrary, it's actually very entertaining on several factors. 1) Sylvester is in full ""over-the-top"" (no pun intended) over-acting mode in this film and he delivers his lines with so much cheese and enthusiasm that it's hard not to love him! 2) Rob Schneider contributes a healthy dose of mediocre comic relief which for the most part is a little annoying. It's Dredd's reactions to him which are the funny part and offer the punch line to many of the gags. 3) The action scenes aren't too shab. There are enough explosions and gun-fights to keep any 13 year old boy with A.D.D.'s attention from whaning! 4) The whole look of the film is quite bleak and dark and the picture it portrays of the future is reminiscent of films like ""Total recall"" and ""Highlander 2""....heck even ""Star Wars""!!! 5) The special effects and CGI aren't half bad for 1995. Granted it's no Matrix but I've honestly seen worse special effects in movies this year than in Judge Dredd! 6) Diane lane as 'Judge Hershey' is nice to look at. 7) the film is not too long, as if it were made today - it would surely be 2 and a half hours in length as most Hollywood blockbusters which is too long. It's also not too short either. Just the right length to hold your attention. I'm sure there's other reasons why this film is enjoyable and I'm sure there's just as much if not more reasons than this not to enjoy it but honestly...it's a 1995 action flick starring Sylvester Stallone, what more could you expect?

142,sagniknath,"23 years later, a retrospective",7,21 October 2018,"I still have quaint memories as a boy watching this either on cable(on the only English movie channel available back then in India, Star Movies) or VHS rent weekends. Initially, I do remember being fascinated by the effects, the action and ofcourse Stallone as a gun toting, cartoonishly big shoulder pad wearing wielder of JUSTICE. Overall, it felt like an enjoyable 90's action romp that had a high rewatchibility score.
However, as time passed and I grew up, I started feeling that the movie had simply too much camp in it. At the turn of the early to mid 2000s, when we started getting the realistic, grim perspective of the superhero, as popularized by the likes of Nolan and Singer, the very notion of Stallone mouthing dated one liners in his weird accent with Rob Schenider trying to be the comic relief/sidekick seemed too ludicrous . Soon, we had the new Dredd movie from 2012 which adhered to the dark gritty realism shtick. Despite the initial poor box office reception, this film was undoubtedly overall better than Dredd '95 and has all the trappings of achieving cult status.
Now, recently, I sort of felt like rewatching the 95 film on a whim because I was bored with all the new Netflix action/mystery shows they had which were all starting to look the same and formulaic. And , let me tell you, Dredd '95 was surprisingly a breath of fresh air. So here is a very honest retrospective review on Dredd 23 years later and how it holds up today.
First the positives, which I begin with the world building. I had read some 2000 AD comics on the side and this movie did justice in bringing to life Dredd's world in Mega City. The visuals and set locations feel like an expanded version of Blade Runner's cyberpunk world. However, it also incorporates more color and vibrancy and genuinely feels like a fantasy world which can be inhabited by the audience. If there ever were a sequel to Dredd '95 , they should have definitely focused more on fleshing out this wonderful world of Mega City.
Then , we have the laudatory practical effects. The ABC robot has to be one of my most favorite movie effects. The animatronics are just superb. On the few occasions that the robot does walk onscreen, the transitions between the moving robot torso and the legs (which are operated separately offscreen) seem fluid . Another feat of practical effects is the prosthetics and makeup involved in creating the character of the cyborg Mean Angel. Today, the character would obviously have been played by the actor in a mocap suit. However, the fact that back then, the performer actually had to don all that makeup and put on a robot arm, while looking very intimidating, carriers its own special charm. The aerial chase scenes of Dredd in the flying car also manage to hold up today fairly well.
Now, on to the negatives. So many fans of the Dredd franchise back then had a problem that Judge Dredd was in fact not wearing his iconic helmet 90% of the movie's screen time, an issue which the 2012 version resolved by always having actor Karl Urban have his face covered by the helmet. Personally, based on the script, I see no problem with Dredd being outside his uniform. Clearly there is an arc built around his character and you wouldn't be able to gauge his changing humanity if he remained a stereotype of the gruff helmet wearing police officer( which was the point of the original 2000 AD comics). So I do support this change of character. However, I am definitely not satisfied with the actor they chose to portray Dredd, Sylvester Stallone. He lacks charisma
and when he delivers the campy one liners, it feels too cartoonish to be even considered unintentionally hilarious. This film definitely needed a hero who was not a stranger to camp films and who could hold his own even when his character was in a B movie plot. The likely candidate for me would have been Arnold Schwarzenegger . While undoubtedly, Stallone is the better actor, Arnold had that dominating screen presence and sense of wit and charm that could have given Dredd the arc of humanity that he deserved. Many people consider Rob Schenider to be miscast but I would say he was alright. The main case of miscasting was with the lead himself. Every time Stallone was delivering his lines, the screen felt very lifeless and drained.
In conclusion, I can certify that Dredd 1995 is a cultural artifact that perfectly encapsulates the whirlwind of 1990s action filmmaking and also a good source of nostalgia.",Judge Dredd

Trivia indicates Stallone went prima donna and started changing things ie the removal off the helmet, but te]he fact he just played it as Rambo is a uniform made it even worse. As a big fan of the graphics I cannot stress how bad Stallone is however the rest of the production and the cinematography is probably worth giving it a look over.Inherently not a bad film make up design is great, ok influenced by the novels but totally wrecked by stallone.

There isn't a single actor in this film that does a good performance, Sylvester Stallone in particular is cold and emotionless, albeit unconvincingly. Rob Schneider is one of the most annoying and undeserving little punks I've seen in any film; so much so that why anybody would want to be have their movie ruined by him is beyond my understanding. Money, perhaps? He ain't worth much these days. Stop hiring him, Hollywood! Filmgoers don't like him anymore. The villain is laughably unconvincing and has a confusing plan. The action is not fun and full of terrible clichés, the story is trying to be smart, but I have no idea what the point is. The comedy is cheap and most of it shows Rob Schneider obnoxiously screaming and him or Judge Dredd making stupid jokes. The story is full of clichés.I haven't read the source material, so I am strictly judging this as a movie, although from what I hear, the film isn't very faithful to it.Bottom line, do not see this film if you value great movies. This is anything but. I pity the poor souls who made this, although Stallone has made enough Rocky movies to warrant my forgiveness (f.y.i. I haven't seen all of Stallone's failures).

But where Starship Troopers went all the way, Judge Dredd only has a few moments of fun, fluffed up with tons and tons of cheap action, cheesy one-liners, a dumb sidekick (more coming up one that one) and no story worth mentioning.The only thing that kept me going all the way through this inedible hunk of cheap sci-fi rip offs was the desire to see Judge Dredd's hacker side kick get killed. If I were the actor with that role, I'd probably have to get myself committed to a mental hospital and be treated for suicidal self-loathing.'Why then 3 out of 10 and not just 1?', you ask. Well, even though most of the material is a rip off, there are some nice effects in there, I liked the old chief officer of justice (or whatever his title was) and Stallone made me smile here and there with his hero-cheesiness. I was going to give it 4 out of 10, when the recall of the flat and unimaginative soundtrack took off a point.So there you go.

They blow vehicles up & try & keep order in very disorganized city blocks (Mega City). Outside the walls of this city is The Cursed Earth where cannibals dwell & cite religious quotes! You don't want to go there but Judge Dredd (the stern-faced Stallone 'wearing a Buick') is wrongly judged & guess where he's sent? You guessed it! Along for the ride (& comic relief) is Fergie (Rob Schneider). He has the line that says of Dredd that he is Mr. ""I Am the Law""! The whole film centers on Dredd going back to Mega City to clear his name by going after his 'brother', Rico (the deliciously evil & handsome Armand Assante). Rico tries to create more judges but with his own evil DNA, only they get caught in mid-life & die. Interesting bit of sci-fi there. Diane Lane is the natural beauty who believes in Dredd & is 'secetly' in love with him. And he respects her as 'top of her class'. He seems incapable of love. He holds to the letter of the law, not the spirit of it. Thus how Fergie ends up judged. With Dredd's helmet on, it's obvious who he is by the jutted-out chin & thick cupie-bow lips. The flying motorcycles are just too unbelievable though. So is the last scene atop the Statue of Liberty in the rain. Tidbit: Stallone with BLUE EYES?! Yes, they're contacts. So are Assantes'.

But then it just goes down hill. And fast. It takes a great, bleak, blackly funny view of a near future (and in some cases present day view of America) and ignores everything that makes the comic great. Instead it turned it into a standard rogue cop with buddy type movie. The whole idea of Judge Dredd was that he was the perfect embodiment of the legal system. He never fought the system because he WAS the system. In all its brutal and unpalatable forms.JD's greatest ever writer wrote a screenplay for this film (the i'm not worthy to type his name JOHN WAGNER *sigh*) but the studio merely wanted to have it off him for peanuts. he told them where to go and as a result a great character (and indeed great enemies) were wasted by a film that said nothing new. and in many cases said it very badly as well.The only bright spot is that JD has been taken over (2000AD for the first time in it's history is being run by people who are actually fans of it, go go go Rebellion, run with it and make things happen) and who knows maybe we will one day see ol' Joe Dredd in all his big chinned, tight booted, fascist glory. Maybe as a cartoon (think Akira, not bugs bunny) and maybe as a film but if anybody saw this film and thought what rubbish. well, you are right. but get a hold of the comics (especially 'Song of the Surfer' or 'America') and see why this film was attacked on sight by all fans of the comic.

Some of the early scenes are a bit cringe-worthy, sometimes the comic relief is too goofy, and some of the characters are ill conceived and contradict the world they are in. Despite its flaws, it has a charm and personality that seems to have been lost in modern comic book adaptations which seem to be either very serious or slaves to special effects.",Judge Dredd
152,El_Rey_De_Movies,Fun...just don't think too hard about it,5,3 November 2005,"From the pages of Britain's ""2000 AD"" comes the futuristic lawman, Judge Dredd. The original comic series, drawn by Brian Bolland, was a mixture of Mad Max and Clockwork Orange starring Judge Dredd, a lawman working and living in a society where law and order have completely broken down and the police are now called ""Judges"" and have to power to judge and pass sentence on any criminal they apprehend on the spot. It's a visually fantastic movie that brings the future metropolis of Mega-City One to complete life, from the rarefied heights where the wealthy live all the way down to the street-level slums where life is a constant stream of out of control street crime and block riots. Sylvester Stallone, as Judge Dredd, is the perfect granite-jawed embodiment of the complete judicial hardass that is Dredduntil he opens his voice to intone, ""I am the law!"" and you just start convulsing with laughter! With Armand Assante, Jurgen Prochnow and Joan Chen as the villains and Bruce Schneider as his comedy sidekick, it's a fun way to spend an evening as long as you just want escapist entertainment and aren't looking for any deep comments on humanity or the meaning of it all.",Judge Dredd
153,carry-on-man,Why waste such potential?,2,3 October 2019,"I saw this when it came out and hated it, I was a big 2000AD and Judge Dredd fan as a kid and this film broke so many of the rules around the Dredd established in the comic strip it rendered it a ""non"" Judge Dredd movie. I saw the later ""Dredd"" movie and though I felt it was closer to the comic strip it still lacked too much of the spirit of the strip, probably due to a limited budget affecting what they could actually do with a futuristic city, ironically the Stallone version gets that aspect correct as it had a much bigger budget. I feel that if 2000AD had been a big deal in the USA we would have got some good movies out of the characters within the comic, but unfortunately they've had two cracks at the main character and failed both times, which is a shame. If they'd used the huge budget in the 90s to make a movie more closely linked to the comic we might have been on to a winner, but the potential was wasted.",Judge Dredd
154,j-tochtenhagen,"Not the comic, but becoming classic and individual adaption",9,27 April 2013,"A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the ""Stallone-type"" action style.Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of ""Dredd"".And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective.""Judge Dredd"" and ""Demolition Man"" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.",Judge Dredd
155,CC_The_Martian,The shadow of a much better movie,6,4 April 2016,"First question a lot of you are asking; who or what is Judge Dredd? Well in answer Judge Dredd is a British comic book series. In a dystopian future all of mankind has been wiped out except for one gigantic city. In this city crime is out of control so the people in charge introduce the Judges; Law enforcement officers who can serve as judge, jury and executioner, of these Judges the most feared is Judge Dredd whose unshakable sense of justice make him a force to be reckoned with. Now this is a great concept, especially in the 80s and 90s which were the best age for action movies in my opinion, Sadly this movie had a bit of a rocky production; Director Danny Cannon was in fact a fan of Judge Dredd and wanted to make an adaptation that had the same gritty edge and dark sense of humour as the original comics. As a result the first cut Mr Cannon submitted to the MPAA was NC-17 and had to be tossed back and forth between the two of them to finally get and R rating. On top of that Stallone (who was playing Judge Dredd) and the studio decided they wanted to make the movie into a PG-13 action comedy and the film got hacked up even more. Danny Cannon was so unhappy with the finished result that he hasn't worked with a big name actor since. After all that this movie was a commercial and critical failure, falling quickly into obscurity until certain critics on the internet resurrected it with the reputation as one of the worst comic book movies of all time. And yetIt's not all that bad. This movie could have been awesome; the cast aren't half bad, the production design is great, and the score is cheesy but fun. Unfortunately this movie also has its fair share of bad-in-a-good-way points and just plain bad points. I Love Sylvester Stallone but in this movie his portrayal of Judge Dredd reminds me of Buzz Lightyear done as a live action 80s action movie, which is fun but a misrepresentation of the source material. A lot of the acting in this movie is cheesy, not helped by dialogue that is both clunky and awkward. The scene with the Angel family is weirdly entertaining in this The Hills Have Eyes 2000 kinda way and of course there's Rob Schneider's character. This was a bad idea. Rob Schneider plays a bumbling thief who ends up unintentionally partnering with Dredd. This character is annoying, superfluous, and reeks of studio interference. Bottom line if you're looking for fun cheese you'll like this movie but for fans of either 80s action films or superhero movies this is a miss. Which is a shame because thee are times Cannon's original idea rears its head above all the garbage and you wish you were watching that movie.",Judge Dredd
156,harry-austin,"Perhaps a B Grade Movie, but still worth a watch.",7,26 August 2009,"If you like Stallone, then this is definitely worth a watch. He is typical action hero in this film, with everything you would expect, from the gun that seems to be able to destroy anything, to the fairly cheesy monster-man that attempts to kill the hero. While the film is by no means something that will win any Oscars, it is still surprisingly entertaining. The plot is quite typical of an action/sci-fi movie, a respected hero loses his title due to an envious villain, then he has to regain it by a great deal of pointless killing. However, it is this that allows you to like this film, yes the plot is very cliché, and it is not a cult/classic but if you are either a geeky teenager who thinks plastic body armour and ray guns are awesome, or if you just like watching violent action scenes then this film is perfect.",Judge Dredd

No Anthrax??,5,27 May 2001,"I couldn't believe that Anthrax (who has probably done more to publicize the Judge in America more than any other entity before this movie) was excluded from the soundtrack.  ""I Am the Law"" would have fit perfectly in this movie...maybe they saw the movie, realized it wasn't that good, and backed out of it.  All in all, this is a pretty decent, standard action movie.  The ending was very satisfying.  See it if you're really, really into action flicks.",Judge Dredd
158,gothamite27,"Good, but not quite good enough",4,18 March 2005,"Judge Dredd is an awesome, British-made character that appears in a weekly comic to this day. 'Judge Dredd' the movie, is not Stallone's finest performance by any means. The irony is, that in the comic, Dredd is a battle-scarred character that is driven only by the law. In my view, Sylvester Stallone would have been the perfect Judge Dredd since he did so well in films such as the excellent Rambo Trilogy and 'Demolition Man' (made a year before this release). However, it would seem that Stallone was afraid of being typecast and so, he twisted the character and script around in awful ways, turning Dredd into an emotionless machine. If Stallone had stuck the script and played Dredd as the wise-cracking Dirty Harry type figure from the comics, the movie would have been far better.The story is slightly mediocre, and tends to emulate a lot from 'Demolition Man' (watch both films and you'll definitely see what I mean).SPOILERS Set in a futuristic 'Mega-City' where local law enforcement have the right to 'judge' in the field rather than let the perpetrator run free until a lazy jury finds them innocent, Judge Dredd is the best at what he does. However, in a plot perpetrated by a crazed fellow Judge to rule Mega City, Dredd gets framed for a murder he didn't commit.Dredd spends most of the film (WITHOUT HIS FAMOUS HELMET ON!) shooting 'Judge Hunters' (pretty self-explanatory I should think) whilst trying to make his way back into Mega-City from the ruins of the Cursed Earth (Rob Schneider helps him along the way)so he can apprehend Judge Rico (Dredd's psychopathic brother) and Judge Griffin (the brains of the scam).Visually, the film is excellent; but the mediocre storyline which bears little resemblance to anything from the comics really lets the film down. Another disappointment that really let down hardcore Dredd fans, was that for 80% of the screen time, he's not wearing his famous ornate helmet! In the comics, Dredd was never seen without the helmet (it added to the mystery, leaving the reader to wonder what Dredd looked like underneath), yet in this movie, he is almost never seen WITH it.Overall, I give this film 4/10. It was set up to be the perfect comic book movie, but was let down because of Stallone's fear of being typecast.",Judge Dredd
159,Chicky5150,A confused film that deviated from the source,5,24 April 2006,"One of the biggest questions I have when watching a film is determining which is more frustrating: a film with no redeemable value which does not entertain, or a film that could have been great with a few alterations. Judge Dredd is the latter. The director claims that Stallone overpowered the movie as it was originally done, and I wonder about that.One of the things that dooms the movie is its ignorance of the conceit of the comic book: Judge Dredd is not a character. 2000 A.D. was not interested in his background, he had no character arc, in fact, he never took his helmet off, and was never shown off duty. Dredd is an adventure story at its purest, filled with colorful characters, and fantasy/sci-fi locations.The movie mimics the non-stop mayhem of the comics books, something was always happening. Rob Schneider's character was an attempt to replicate the cheeky perp that always gets stuck with Dredd while he's in the middle of some adventure, except he was used sparingly and never got annoying. The film ignored that as well. Judge Hershey and the reporter character hold this film back as well, as part of a clumsy lecture on totalitarian justice, but that sort of thing has no place in a movie like this.Sadly, this is a film with really cool ideas, and great movie serial fun, that was hampered by a couple really bad stylistic choices.",Judge Dredd
160,MovieloverIreland,Judge Dreddfully average,5,29 December 2014,"Upon first viewing this back in the 90's I recall actually enjoying it somewhat. 18 or so years later as a 33 year old I just re-watched it with some mates and the feelings of nostalgia could not help me enjoy this revisit. The problems : 1 : Anyone can read trivia here on IMDb and see how difficult a time Danny Cannon had with Stallone . If Stallone wanted so much creative control perhaps he should have Directed and not try influence someone else's vision. 2 : The tone is all over the place, is it a comedy or straight action. Robocop 1987 got the balance spot on but here its uneven, it also feels like a PG13 film with gore. 3: The acting, can you keep a straight face when Stallone spits out ""I AM THE LAW!!"", The normally reliable Diane Lane also struggles in some scenes looking embarrassed, Max Von Sydow was only performance I liked, less about Rob Schneider the better. Pointless character. 4: Dated effects, The bike chase through the city skies is not cringe inducing as green screen is so obvious and distracting that I felt sorry for the actors. 5: The costume the Judges wore looked like cheap plastic props. 6: Keep your helmet on Stallone. But I sound like a hater here. It wasn't all bad. I like Alan Silvestri's triumphant score, Armand Assante is hilariously over the top and the production design is impressive eye candy.

This movie offers you a bunch of ideas about the future, Sylvester Stallone is really funny but the cast is great and believable. Don't forget, this is a comic adaptation and people act like this. It's a real fun movie and I often quote in real life: 'I knew, you would say that'. Ha, this movie is cool, intelligent and has an excellent and entertaining story. What else do you want? It is not serious about itself but like 'Fifth element' or 'Tiger and Dragon' it's just fun to watch. And it doesn't bore you, even you watched it five times.

166,coolmule,Fair Sci Fi/Action flick,6,13 March 2003,"Unless you're a rabid 2000 AD fan who can't get past Dredd taking off his helmet, this movie is marginally enjoyable sci-fi/action fare which should appeal to fans of the genre and certainly doesn't deserve all the criticism posted on this site.True, Sly Stallone turns in a woeful performance, and the script isn't really up to much, but this is compensated for with decent enough support from the likes of Max Von Sydow and some truly stunning visuals. It's this that saves the film from mediocrity, as we're presented with a visualisation of the future which is over-the-top but at the same time gritty and believable. The vistas of Mega City One are every bit as impressive as the city scapes in The Fifth Element and Attack of the Clones, and are alot more believable and detailed to boot. In my opinion, this is what is Coruscant should have looked like in the Star Wars prequels. Additionally, in the ABC Warrior, the movie boasts probably the most impressive robot ever to appear on screen. The special effects, with the exception of some truly awful compositing in the bike chase sequence, are all top notch, and have a warmth lacking in modern CG.The real problem with this film though isn't the acting but the length - at only 96 minutes it makes same the mistake as X-Men of having to set up characters and provide a resolution in far too short a space of time. It's just a shame that the technical skill and artistry that went into making this film couldn't have been provided with a better story.Rating - 6/10",Judge Dredd
167,frog663,"I'll be the ""judge"" of that!",8,28 January 2004,"Had I read the comic books, maybe I would be a much harsher critic of Judge Dredd.  Having not had the experience, I can only ""judge"" the film I saw. With the exception of a couple of lulls in the action that were necessary, I guess, to further the plot along, Dredd moved briskly from start to finish. Rob Schneider was the perfect foil for Stallone's Dredd, allowing him to play the character straight, while still recognizing the absurdity of it all.The rest of the roles were perfectly cast, as well (though I still don't see the supposed resemblance between Stallone and Armand Assante).  Diane Lane added a much needed voice of reason to the proceedings, and showed herself to be just as capable a Judge as the legendary Dredd.From other reviews I have read here, I have learned that the Angel family portrayed here was taken straight from the comic, itself.  I have no way of knowing if they were portrayed faithfully but, whether they were or not, they didn't seem to belong in this film.  While some kind of additional action was probably necessary, they came across as more of a cartoon than I thought necessary, even for a film based on a comic book.That criticism aside, I would still say that Judge Dredd is definitely worth watching.  It's fun to see Sylvester Stallone essentially send up his macho image and actually look as if he's having fun in the process!  The whole movie is over the top, from the opening street war, to the final shot of Stallone, in the distance, taking a page out of John Wayne films!

It's hard to put my finger on exactly where it falls short. The dystopian future world and MegaCity are convincing created, considering the movie making tech available at the time. The acting is OK and Diane Lane turns in a very credible performance (up until the ridiculous ending). The direction tries to get the most of the actors and script, but somehow falls a little short. The editing is uneven, and when it's tight it's tight. When it's not tight the pace starts to drag. It's hard to tell sometimes if the drag comes more from the direction and editing, or from the script. The repetitive tag lines, such as ""I knew you were going to say that"" stop working long before they keep trying to make them work. I wanted to like it, but I was just unable to do so by the time I got to the half-way mark. I soldiered through it for story line and to see if it was going to redeem itself, but ended up kind of wishing I had bailed. The ending was just stupid.I was left with the realization that I liked a different movie from a couple of years earlier quite a bit more. That film was Demolition Man. It was a sci-fi action rom-com, so very different but it was a hit with me on many levels. If you're just looking for a fun movie to watch and Demolition Man is an option, then I would try that one.

Worse, he spends much of the film without his helmet on. This might seem a quibble to anyone who didn't grow up reading the comic, but it's tantamount to making a Spider-Man film where his chosen form of transport is the bus.Yeah, there's some watchable action and humor here. But the lack of any goodwill this film stores up with the hardcore fans means that more than 20 years later, there is no core fan base supporting this movie.If you're a completist, sure - see this film.

The film was devoid of humour and human interest - why didn't they just cover what Dredd did in a duty shift? That's how the comic garnered readers.The only things worth seeing in the film were the depiction of MegaCity1 aerial & streetscapes, the block war at the start & the ABC warrior ('Hammerstein' without his hammer).

He's only a tough macho guy with a lot of sensibility very well in him.  Sure.There were reasons for Dredd not removing his helmet (one of them being that he was the LAW, therefore his uniqueness was unimportant), and not ever smiling (he was an instrument with little to no personal life; he was committed to be a cop/judge in a very probable future society of much unemployment, crime and misery; what's to smile about?).This film was a nice try perhaps, but not enough.

It's damn funny, doesn't take itself seriously and is just pure action.I'm a law student and really into legal theory although it's not an original idea of the movie makers since it was a comic before the jurisprudence of Judge Dredd is fascinating.The law has been deified in the future, the statute book is even has a gold edge to its pages hinting at the sacred status of it. The judiciary are subservient to the law, to the letter. There is no implied common law system but the 'good book' contains all that needs to be known. Summary executions are common and trials rare. The law cannot be wrong, it cannot be sorry it just is.17th and 18th century English legal history have come full front in the film. In that century Parliament enacted an ever greater number of capital offences for a perceived endemic problem of lawlessness. The bloody code as it was termed sentenced defendants to death for trivial offences such as wood taking, wrecking, and property offences. The law was deified, the judges helpless to her power to carry out sentences. The magic, mercy and justice of the law was admired by all from the working class to MPs. This is precisely what happened in the Judge Dredd verse.So yeah that's why I think the film is damn neat. And in the year 2005 in light of recent international and national law infringements of the governments of the west; we have to question - do we need to be completely serviant to the law, when those in charge of its administration have such wanton disregard for it? Indeed do we need Judge John Dredd to enforce the law and pronounce ""I AM THE LAW!"" in the UK Parliament and US Congress?! OK yah that's kinda lame but whatever it'd be cool.Dredd's opening line ""I AM THE LAW"", now that shoulda been up there with ""I'll be back"".",Judge Dredd
178,clive_slatter,Still can't bring myself to watch it,3,26 September 2020,"If you were a fan of 2000 AD comics in the late 70s and 80s then the anticipation of the Judge Dredd movie was almost palpable. Then we find out that Sylvester Stallone was starring as the lead character. Okay... a well established action star was probably needed to sell it. Rumours that Sly had read the comics and wanted to be true to the source material alleviated some other concerns.Then we watched the movie. Now, if you've never read the comics you are entitled to say you enjoyed the movie and may even be forgiven for saying it was quite good, I'm just not going to agree with you. They did, at least, manage to capture the essence of the mega-city but pretty much everything else was over the top. Karl Urban's Dredd was far truer to the character as was the violence.What we have here is a film that tries to splice together elements of different stories from the comics into one movie; Rico, The Day the Law Died, Angel Gang, Cursed Earth and even a little ABC Warriors thrown in. Rico in the movie was a wise-cracking pain the neck played painfully by Rob Schneider whereas he was a monster of a man from the undercity who played a pivotal role in the comics.Don't get me wrong, some of the casting was impressive but I think they were really up against it. They could have simplified the plot a great deal and avoid trying to stuff as much of Dredd's history into a single movie. 30% on Rotten Tomatoes (135.5k ratings) is probably about right compared to 72% for the 2012 version. If you were never really a fan of the comics and just wanted to watch an action movie then that's more-or-less what you got, but if you wanted a film that brought to life one of comics' most iconic characters then you may well have left the cinema very disappointed. Just don't mention the helmet... it's still too painful.It crops up on TV every now and then and I sit down to watch it just to see if I can and I just catch bring myself to watch more than a couple of minutes of it before switching over to something else.

I had waited for this movie for years.  When I heard that Stallone was playing Dredd I thought nothing bad of it.  I knew that with him in the picture it would be in wide release, and I knew that much like Batman, Judge Dredd does not need a great actor to play him.  Stallone seemed to fit the bill of someone who could be tough, have little dialogue, and shoot up the enemies.  Little did I know that Judge Dredd would be put into the same category as Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin, in that they are all ""disneyland"" versions of a much darker comic.In the comic, the future is a bleak place.  Comic books don't get much darker or bloodier than this one.  It is not a ""fun, happy go-lucky"" comic. However, it is extremely exciting and if translated correctly could be the perfect action movie.Showing a human side of Dredd was the worst mistake of this movie.  For one Dredd does not take his helmet off.  For two he does not have a sidekick.If this movie had been made correctly it would have received comparison's to the likes of Terminator 2 and Predator.

Ok, so Dredd takes his helmet off (the abstention from this was merely a 2000AD in-joke anyway); Griffin is a bad guy; the entire Council of distinguished judges is wiped out in an instant; Rico is not the identical twin clone of Dredd; Aspen is substituted for Titan; neither Fargo nor Rico have badges bearing their proper name (Dredd)... but all these faults pale in comparison to what the movie actually got *right*.The casting was absolutely spot-on: Dredd, Hershey, Fargo, McGruder, Griffin... all these actors looked and behaved exactly as their 2000AD counterparts. Fergie wasn't the same as his comic-book counterpart, but so what? The original character was such a caricature of a real person, had he been portrayed in that way he no doubt would have ended up the Jar-Jar Binks hate-character of the film. The costumes were also brilliantly realised from their comic book incarnations - something that is notoriously difficult to do, especially for a helmet design as impractical as that of the Mega-City One judge!The dark totalitarian political landscape of Mega-City One was admirably conveyed, particularly in the device used to convict Dredd (the assassination of ""pro-democracy"" journalists) and the underhand skullduggery of Griffin and his co-conspirators. The icing on the cake was the inclusion of the brilliant Hammerstein robot from the ABC Warriors, and that of the Angel Gang. A better screen portrayal of the Angel Gang simply could not have been wished for - Mean Machine was *exactly* as he is in the comic!My only real gripe with this movie is that the history of the 2000AD universe is significantly messed around with, but as I have said, this is expected of Hollywood and did not detract from this as a standalone film one bit. For me, the most disappointing change made was that of making Judge Griffin the bad guy. In the comic he is one of the most exemplary judges and indeed much admired by Dredd himself (as well as having an eye-patch for his troubles). It is a shame the film had to besmirch the good name of Griffin in this way - Jurgen Prochnow would have made a fine *upstanding* Griffin. That said, the changes are nowhere near as bad as those made for Batman where the origins of both the Batman and the Joker are changed in such a way as to spoil the entire essense of the Batman mythos.Brit director Danny Cannon can congratulate himself on having done a fine job of preserving the essense of the world of Judge Dredd in the face of Hollywood revisionism!",Judge Dredd
181,NCHaskew,I Don't Exactly Dread Judge Dredd,5,12 March 2011,"I'll start off this review with a simple statement: I actually do recommend this movie. That being said, let me explain the parameters of this recommendation: don't go into this movie expecting quality effects, acting, or plot. If you're looking for that, pass this film over. It's honestly just one of those guilty pleasures of being so bad that it's entertaining. I'll note some of the things that personally got me laughing.1.) The movie starts off with the classic cheesy 80s back story, shown in scrawling text (which is simultaneously narrated by James Earl Jones.) It describes that ""in the third millennium, the world changed..."" and is decidedly called ""Cursed Earth,"" which seems to only have two kinds of areas: Deserts and ""Mega-Cities."" The desert is actually right outside the Mega-City...trust me, it makes no sense.2.) The entire cast seems to only need to fit two requirements: -They are shorter than Sylvester Stallone. -They talk WORSE than Sylvester Stallone (just for fun, try to see if any one person in the film says ""law"" normally...I dare you.) Don't get me wrong, those requirements are no small feats to accomplish, but it just made the film more peculiar; but entertaining nonetheless.3.) They have the funniest names for things: -What would you call a big city? If you said ""Metropolis,"" you've clearly never heard of ""MEGA-CITIES."" Does ""Mega-City"" just sound more intimidating and dark and brooding? I don't know--don't spoil the fun. -Also, what sounds like the worst prison in the world? Something even more dark and shady than ""Mega-City?"" Think again; for the main villain escapes from the highest-tech security facility in the world, known as...""ASPEN PENAL COLONY""!!! I swear, I could not make this up. -Not to mention the main antagonist is none other than Judge Dredd (Sylvester Stallone)'s little brother: RICO DREDD!!! No, he's not a 10 year old Mexican kid, though he is about a foot shorter than Stallone and tries to talk like Hannibal Lecter...too bad he has a lisp...4.) The technology of the time period is some of the weirdest things I've seen: -There are droids that serve food who all the while say ""Eat recycled food. It's good for the environment, and OK for you!"" -There's also a droid which is basically a horrible rip-off of the Terminator, except incredibly rusted, much more gargantuan, and punches incredibly slow--yet it sends people flying. But don't worry: it can easily be turned on and off if you just switch ONE wire...ONE! I have a suspicion that this story must be where Terminator fails go to die. -The Judge's guns (which are handguns) have at least 10 different kinds of ammo in it: semi-auto with rapid fire, armor-piercing, grenade-launcher, double whammy (which is two bullets that shoot at the same time to hit two people.)...need I continue? Oh yeah, and every time a bullet is fired, the gun (and this just a hand-gun, mind you) is able to stamp on a DNA-identifier so that ballistics can say who fired the bullet....all right, now I'm done making fun of the guns.-Not exactly ""technology,"" but the Judge's suits are definitely not at police-standard: tights, helmet, gold shoulder pads, and (just for The Italian Stallion) a gold codpiece...I can't even go on.All in all, this movie is just kind of a cheap humor experience, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes to make fun of those good old cheesy 80s sci-fi flicks. Afterwards you may say that you wish there was a legitimate action version for the Judge, but don't worry: a reboot is approaching which stars Karl Urban as Judge Dredd. I'm hoping for the best.",Judge Dredd
182,mjm10000,don't dread dredd,8,17 August 2003,Most people feel that Judge Dredd was a really bad movie but as far as the genre goes it really wasn't that bad. sure the dialogue left something to be desired( I am the Law) but the story line was okay and the comic relief of rob schnieder was good too.so rent the movie and enjoy.,Judge Dredd
183,tinchimp,A slap in the face to Judge Dredd faithful - A waste of one of the Comic book greats,2,19 November 2002,"As much a fan of 2000ad and Judge Dredd as i am, I've avoided seeing this until it was shown on Network TV this weekend just gone... If only i could have gone for another 40 years, id have hopefully have died with JD still an Icon of mine...Admittedly, the opening scenes, flying over the Mega city were pretty awe inspiring, but we are rapidly bought down to Earth with a bump when Sylvester Stallone makes his on screen presence felt... ""I am ... The Law!"" - Ohhhh dear...Lesson no 1 for film makers, when attempting to portray the finest the future of Law enforcement has to offer, FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN SPEAK!!!! Sorry, but Sly Stallone is a terrible choice to portray JD, his on screen presence is pretty cool, but JD is kinda like a futuristic Dirty Harry, as in he's pretty articulate, whereas SS comes across as ... well ... slightly challenged. Bruce Willis, Steven Segal, Bruce Campbell - the list goes on, action Heroes can be literate!To base my hatred for the film soley on Slys presence would be a little shallow, so, we'll continue.Okaaaay, now, if they wanted to do a film about futuristic Law men, then go ahead, but please not at the expense of one of the Comic Book greats! Once a Judge has made a commitment to upholding the Law their personal life ENDS. Remember cadet Giant telling his father to go flake coz he was a judge now and didn't have time for him? If i remember correctly weren't there Judges facing getting the boot coz they were in love? Didn't JD get an admirer confined to a Psycho cube? Well, we get JD getting it on with Judge Hershey and being branded a freak because he devotes his time to being a Judge.. Hells Bells! If this was the Mega city there'd be a few people on a one way trip to Titan! The amount of inconsistencies with the JD we know and love is upsetting to say the least. True, certain artistic licence should be taken in bringing comic book heros to the silver screen, but to reinvent...I am sickened..Oh and the script is just bad! Terrible dialogue! Absolutely cringeworthy! I had to leave the room it became so embarrassing! I'm sure i didnt miss anything don't worry! The guy who played ""Fergie"" (excuse me, wasn't Fergie a 7ft tall Neanderthal with a Baseball bat - King of the Smellies??) is 1995s equivalent of Jar Jar Binks...One small saving grace was the appearance of Mean Machine Angel, who looked pretty gnarly -  he didnt get stuck on 4 1/2, but in context with the state of the rest of the film, i count my blessings... Otherwise the Angel Gang are completely wasted in the film...Overall, if you love the Apocalypse War, Judge Death, The Judge Child Quest and the Cursed Earth, please try and ignore this film... it really isn't worth tainting you image of JD. If you like cheezy Hollywood action films and have never heard of Judge Dredd, you may get along with this...A terrible waste of a great license 2/10",Judge Dredd
184,spiderangelwing,Worthless in every way,2,29 June 2002,"At face value, Judge Dredd isn't a particularly bad film. There's nothing that makes you want to take a sledgehammer to your television while watching it. There's nothing that will cause your brain to scream at you for exposing it to such trite.But then, on the other hand, there's nothing that could be considered to be engrossing, or exciting, or moving, or interesting, or worthwhile. This film is what you'd expect a computer to come up with when faced with the task of turning the Judge Dredd license into a film. Everything's there, it all fits together, but it's all cold, soulless and emotionless. This film displays no passion, no joie de vivre, no emotion, no humanity. It's a product churned out of a factory with the sole purpose of earning money. It's a slap in the face to cinema as a means of human expression, and as such completely, totally worthless and deplorable.",Judge Dredd

We prepare to see Sly so much, that we can't really participate in plot.On the other hand, there is something wrong with Sci-fi genre: while we've got only several true masterpieces, like Blade runner, Space Oddysey, Alien, etc., there is not much decent, average title to see. Compare it with horror movies - each year a hundred of new title is creating, and probably horror fans hasn't time to see it all. Sci-fi fans are discriminate. If you saw Star Wars and Terminator's fifteen times you know what I mean.But get back to Judge Dredd. It's rare example of decent Sci-fi movie. No, it not great, not really interesting. To be honest: it's predictable and often dull, but it's true sci-fi movie at least.Best part of movie is set and design: Judges (visually, not moral of course) are something between Nazi's officer and g.i.joe puppets. Yes, that's kitschy, plastic and looks artificial, so what? It's still great for people who loves Blade runner.The rest is... not so bad, but that's of no significance now.",Judge Dredd

I don't blame Stallone, but he dose not help (you never, and I mean NEVER see Dredd's face in the comic). The story is nothing like it is in the comic: Dredd never met Fargo, he new he was a clone, and that Rico was his brother.The addition of Hamerstine (the ABC Warrior, from the ABC Warriors strip) was a big mistake. He's a lot smarter in the comic, and he dose not have machine guns in his arms.Mega-City one is almost the same as it is in the comic, so at lest they got that bit right.I give it a 5 out of ten for effort, but I should have been better.",Judge Dredd

They capture, try and sentence you right on the street. C'mon!Also whats the deal with the old judges instead of retirement they are sent into the outside of the MEGA cities to bring justice to were there isn't any. Thats crap too!Sadly this is the best semi-serious acting performance by Rob Schneider. Either he needs to do a better movie or stick to comedy like Duece Bigalow.Terrible movie. I would give it one star out of ten because i feel sorry for the writer and Sylvester Stallone.

190,krainov-artiom,Judge Dredd is Sylvester Stallone,10,15 April 2015,"Excellent movie. Sylvester Stallone is the real Dredd, a cast simply magnificent, tremendous world of the future, pathos dialogs, it is a lot of variety, the robots, flying cars and other. I heard many negative responses that a pier the movie foolish and doesn't correspond to original comics, moreover John Wagner told it. I got the comics, both the earliest and more modern. Impudent lies! The first releases (1977-1978 - about 150 issues) absolutely same on the atmosphere to pathos and a visual row as well as the movie of 1995, the only thing just Dredd in comics doesn't remove a helmet, but it is impossible to consider only therefore the movie bad. All the rest if in the movie something isn't present that it was thought up much later, in the mid-eighties - if at all was. Danny Kannon made the screen version of original classical issues, the first issues, issues which were thought up from 1977 to beginning 1980s. Also it turned out at it perfectly. Moreover all humor in the movie corresponds to humor in comics, at least in the old issues. Sylvester Stallone has a unique charisma and voice, he was born for this role.For an hour and a half, director managed to acquaint the viewer almost and a half Dredd's huge Universe. He showed Mega City and block-wars in the lower part of the city and council and Aspen's colony and the desert of Cursed Earth and spiteful garbage which there live, various equipment from different futuristic planes and cars to fighting robots to which 50-60 years, work of artists and founders of special effects is higher than all praises. Cast simply ideal - Max Von Sydow and Jurgen Prochnow simply descended from the pages of comic books, Dian Lane as Hershi is very brutal, I like her command voice. Well and funny Schneider too very much in a subject. But the main thing is Rico in Asante's execution, it is so good that I simply have no words. The cast also is very good in episodic structure, from James Remar to garbage-people from the desert of a Cursed Earth. It is the best statement of the blockbuster, such good direction and casting happens usually only at theater, from movies I can remember only David Lynch's Dune, well and Danny Kannon's Judge Dredd. 10/10.In the comics a lot of extra, a lot of silly things, time travel and space aliens, totally inappropriate allusions to fascism - all this is not present in the film.And a shame on John Wagner for impudent lies. And the movie of 2012 which he ""consulting-produced"" at all wasn't pleasant to me. Here it really has mediocre relation to original and even to more modern Dredd's issues.",Judge Dredd
191,HOWLING_MAD_DOC,So much better Than the Karl Urban remake,8,15 October 2013,"First off let me state I am a HUGE fan of Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard H. McCoy of the Star Trek reboot. I think he got the feel, intonation and mannerisms of DeForest Kelley's Dr. McCoy right on the money.Although, as Judge Dredd I think Urban blew it. That is not to say that Sly Stallone's movie was perfect. It most definitely could have done without Rob Schneider! I think Stallone was more in tune with the Dredd of comic book fame. He had the kick butt attitude and mannerisms,to use a British phrase, Spot On, and who doesn't love Armand Assante as a villain. He does it so well.Gotta love the Judge uniforms in both movies, but I think Sly's is more impressive over Urban's. Not to mention the weapons and other great toys. I do prefer the 1995 Dredd Lawmaster Cycle to the Karl Urban bike.Enough for now.

I was hoping the film would reflect the serious detective based Dredd stories instead of the 'comic-booky) product released.It's not a bad film really, but it could have been a lot better if they had chosen a better director (Danny is from my home town and I've nothing against him...he just wasn't right for this film). Getting rid of Rob Schneider would have been a good thing too...he was just annoying and belongs in kids films.Dredd removing his helmet, killing half the council and the Angel gang didn't help either.Still, it's worth checking out even if only for curiosity.

195,nicholascamerontaylor,Judge Dreddful,3,18 July 2014,"Sometimes watching a bad film can be fun, it can be entertaining, Judge Dredd is not one of those films. To see a beloved character like Judge Dredd so horrifically brought to life on the big screen is a very uncomfortable experience. The film seems to believe that it understands the source material, we are shown a collage of Dredd comics in a somewhat tender homage to the comics but this film is anything but a faithful representation of the titular hero. The entire cast and crew of this film completely missed the ball park with this one, gone is the satire of American culture and the fascist undertones highlighting the dark path Western politics often takes, instead we are left with this confusing mess that doesn't know whether to go for authentic Dredd ultra-violence or to appeal to adolescents and idiots. Instead it manages to appeal to no one. Stallone is awful as Dredd, physically he could have worked but his monotonous drawl and hammy acting are blindingly apparent, not to mention the fact he spends 99% of the film without his helmet on, stealing the inhumanity that defines the source character. But Stallone is not even the worst actor in this film, hands down that accolade can go to Rob Schneider, who makes the obvious faults of this film even more obvious. He is the comedic sidekick for the hero but in true Ruby Rhod fashion he grates heavily on the viewers nerves and makes an unlikable film unbearable. The only shining light in this film is Armand Assante's turn as the villainous Rico. He does his best to make the character appear as threatening and maniacal as possible, but alas even he cannot perform miracles and the material he is given to work with is poorer than a Sudanese prostitute. Judge Dredd is a poor film and I urge anyone with a hint of intelligence to steer clear, let this film fade into obscurity never to be spoken of again.",Judge Dredd

But watching this movie, despite everything wrong with it, is a very enjoyable experience. I don't mean enjoyable like you enjoy it because it's bad. I genuinely liked it. I found the whole thing to be a good sci-fi action movie, with some mildly though provoking themes. It's a pity that critics didn't like it, otherwise I'm sure Judge Dredd would be up there with classics like Back to the Future, Star Wars etc. Although I'm definitely not saying it is as good as those movies. Definitely worth watching at least once. 7/10",Judge Dredd
197,clif-moberg,"A rising star but, alas, he wears it a little crooked.",8,4 September 2005,"My first reaction to the film was wishing I had a cycle like that and that I could fit into the uniform Judge Dredd wears. Totally cool, and in the future -- the time portrayed in the film -- that word ""cool"" will likewise still be useful. Then it hit me, that tell-tale sign I've adopted as a result of my watching many a film: when the name of the Lord gets thrown around EARLY in a film, it's just a short matter of time that any moderate reference to Christianity will sink to debauch at those hands of the movie screen writers. And case in point: when cannibals show up, they are New Testament-quoting fiends. The ""star"" of the film, I feel, must rise to the level of censor over the content (words, especially) that are thrown about by its speakers. Speaking of loud speakers, somehow -- it is said -- there was an off-stage, real life romp by one Mr. Stallone with a female who he gave the very loud special request ""Slap me, slap me"". A ""spoiler"" to this is that the entire crew heard his amplified voice during that sex. I like it when Stallone's cycle doesn't work, or start right up. It lets me know that the future won't be perfect, even if I don't -- and I know I won't -- live to see it. On this screen I always trusted Judge Dredd, though ""dread"" earmarks him as causing ""anxious or fearful anticipation"" to Websters readers. Comic or not, many of the scenes were, thanks to an artful sidekick whose stage entrance is from within a nonworking spaghetti machine. Max Von Sydow is wise and dignified but loses his Social Security benefits towards the end of the film. Since we can't ""audience participate"" and help with taking up a collection, we will just have to wish him well and give him comfort that his prize pupil, the eminent Judge Dredd turns out, in the end, in a way that would make him very proud. So, I give it an ""eight""; without the fore-mentioned ecclesiastical objection, it would have surely been, in my mind that is uncluttered by many ""tens"", a TEN!",Judge Dredd
198,I_Am_Legacy,"Love it, despite the haters this film is great.",9,27 September 2019,"I get that this film doesn't strictly follow the comics, however the film on its own is really great. I didn't watch this film for years even though I knew about it, I had heard it was terrible so I never bothered watching it. A few years later I am baby sitting the worlds most annoying dogs for someone and I'm bored outta my mind looking for something to watch when I catch Judge Dredd. I loved the Dredd with Karl Urban and with my own knowledge I knew this movie would be a lot different, for a laugh I decided to click over the channel and watch Judge Dredd. I watched a 15 minute segment roughly halfway through the movie and I thought this is pretty good and so I managed to find a channel which I could watch the movie from the beginning and it was glorious.I'm a huge Cyberpunk fan and this film had the right mix of cool retro-futuristic technology and aesthetic, the film isn't as dark as the comics and portrays Dredd as a sort of Buzz Lightyear hero figure in a dark but not too dark future, instead of the hardened judge forced to work in a grim reality, if you can look past the obvious disregard for some of the source material you can certainly enjoy this movie.There is a lack of Dredd related material out there, hopefully this will soon change and we will see that rumoured Dredd TV show and I prey to god Karl Urban plays Dredd, not once in Dredd 2012 did he remove his helmet for a cheap Hollywood face shot unlike Stallone haha, and he did the character justice. I'd love to see more of the Dredd universe on the screen from the Cursed Earth and the roving bands of ravagers that exist throughout it, to the other Megacities that dot the Earth and maybe a little of the supernatural aspect of Dredd?Anyway TLDR: This movie is fantastic in its own way but be aware it doesn't stick completely to the source material, if you can look past that this movie is a great example of an underacted movie, and well deserved of its cult following.",Judge Dredd
199,glen_is_cool,Just terrible. This film makes me want to puke,1,4 November 2007,"I felt i had to write this due to seeing a review on the main IMDb page saying good things about this film. The person who wrote that is a liar. Simple as that.The film is some sort of horrible amalgamation of lots of different 'judge dredd' stories and it feels like it. You get the impression that they tried to cram lots of stuff in for fans to acknowledge instead of spending some time developing characters or plot.Right from the opening, when there's a riot going on and dredd arrives, and the first thing he does is stand in the open and shouts ""i am the law"" like some crazy spoilt brat, you hate the character. You hate the stupid incoherent world he inhabits with it's horrible inconsistencies and terrible 2-dimensional characters. And it goes downhill from there. I know it sounds like a stupid cliché someone says to wittily highlight how bad a film is, but honestly, it really does get worse.The sad thing is that the world of 'judge dredd' had, at the point this travesty of a film was made, almost 20 years of history put into crafting a believable, complex universe, rich with complex political power struggles, class struggles, characters with strong, complex personalities, and much more than i have the talent to express myself; in short a wonderfully believable universe.And yet somebody managed to spew forth this rotting donkey (ie. ass) of a film, that i couldn't even finish watching.The only reason i've not thrown my DVD of this in the bin is because some of the effects are very good. The ABC Warrior was top (although why they have to put more fanboy rubbish in is beyond me. Why not just have a robot?) and the backgrounds were good in places.And that's all there is that stops me defecating on this stink of a film and hurling at the nearest solicitor. Honest to God.

200,kim-muca,Rob Schneider ruins EVERYTHING,3,8 February 2020,"This would've been amazing ""so bad it's good"" movie if it weren't for rib Schneider, Sylvester is a great ""holy good"" character. And his ability to toss one liners are a staple of his generations movie stars.But Rob's ability to completely wreck movies is unmatched by any human being ever. I GENUINELY believe that even I could act better than him.Even as a comedic relief character with the iq of a grape he can't even hold up. He genuinely has no role at all in the movie except to screw things up, and even then his acting abilities match those of a gradeschooler with severe adhd playing a tree in a school play that was planned in half a day.It's like someone picked up a random person if the street, and then asked them to be funny. And that's after said person had 3 aneurysms.Rob Schneider is an absolute disgrace to the movie industry. If I could do a Stalin I'd remove him from each and every scene. Hell, I'd burn his goddamn birth certificate.I've genuinely never been mad at an actor for being bad before. But Rob has no place at all in the movie industry and the fact that he somehow made it into several movies makes me doubt the industry as a whole.Other than that, the movie is pretty okay if you go in with the expectations of a cheap 90's movie. All action, the good guy can do no wrong and he's played by an a legendary action hero. Not because if the acting but because Sylvester is a living g.i joe. And a magnificent g.i Joe at that.Again, rob schneider is a damn disgrace and I wish there were laws against acting this bad so that we could sue him for what ever little scraps he earns for playing an idiot in every movie (I wonder why)The effects are perfectly camp and they bring back cozy childhood memories such as from Babylon 5 but with a higher budget. Sadly the other actors don't get much to say but for the movie they're in they're alright. Judging from a camp loving perspective atleast.

I've heard people say that Dredd should not remove his helmet, but that did not bother me one bit. The action in the movie ranks along side some of Stallone's best and the movie is entertaining from start to finish. I think that Rico is a good villain, played to perfection by Armand Assante and Diane Lane is superb as Judge Hershey, providing all of the emotion and human qualities that are devoid from Judge Dredd, therefore intensifying the character of Dredd. Fergie is also a good character, played well by Rob Schneider who creates a sense of humour, making the film not just about raw action. Judge Dredd, as a popcorn movie is superb, it was never going to win Oscars, but at the end of the day, that is not the point of the film. It is intended to be pure Stallone-fuelled entertainment and on this level it is a resounding success.",Judge Dredd

Judge Dredd has more in common with Robocop combined with the combat-hard badassery of Cable from X-Force. Stallone's version is rigid, borderline unlikeable. Granted he has his share of one-liners that completes any film to make it the more memorable. Something the 2013 version lacks. But I digress.The scenery is intriguing at best, but could've been filmed through a panoramic lens. Aspen and the Cursed Earth are just as interesting, it's a disgrace that we don't know more about this post-apocalyptic world, not to mention Mega City One. However it could be better. Why couldn't the Janus labs be located someplace like the Empire State Building in a undeveloped part of the city. I'm not going to be as forgiving with the characters and dialogue. The characters are one-dimensional and at behave like children. I have never heard so much shouting and hollering in any movie! If this were movie about psychotic drug usage it would be appropriate. Talk like adults. Act like adults. But here it doesn't work. This is only movie in which I'm more interested in the bad guys, since they look human and not like space Nazis complete with Jackboots, imperial eagle badges and authoritarian Homeland security polices.Strictly speaking this movie doesn't work...at all. Everything is half-assed, poorly planned and poorly timed. Here I was thinking that this would be better than Demolition Man. Oh, how wrong I was. This movie is so bad the projector in the theater wouldn't play it. Tips to make a better Dredd movie: use actual profanity ""Holy Drok"" doesn't cut it. Give the Angel Family a bigger role, while making that low-rent terminator a lot more intelligent rather than giving a mind of a goddamned 2nd grader! Not to mention giving a larger role to this clone army that Rico has created instead of them rise out of the chambers and doing absolutely nothing. This movie is bad chiefly because they left so many things out of it. This could've been the hit Stallone needed. But no it was Copland in 1997!",Judge Dredd
203,'C',Pathetic,3,18 February 1999,"Being a long time reader of 2000AD I found this movie a lifeless, shambolic attempt.  To my mind, Dredd is as strong a character as Batman, Superman or Robocop, all of whom have had decent movies.  Instead of exploring Dredd's world, its politics, and the almost fascist judges and the like, what we have here is a watered down standard action flick with some reasonable visuals. Perhaps there will be a sequel that will do the character some justice (no pun intended).  If so, I hope it's a hell of a lot better than this...",Judge Dredd
204,Stevester25,Horrible.,1,1 August 2000,The movie was horrible for all of the reasons previously stated.  I would like to add that the movie portrayed Christians as cannibals.  I have never seen a more offensive portrayal of evangelical Christians.  This movie will forever live in my memory as my all time worst theater experience.,Judge Dredd
205,eigerzoom,Holds firm to a true comic book escapade,10,16 November 2006,"This is a Stallone classic. I really felt this movie held firm to a comic book foundation. It envisions and instills what one might get from reading an adventure comic book for the first time. Follows through to the last page and leaves you with a complete taste...yet wanting another edition of this classic tale of the future. Stallone is a great 'comic book' character and perfect for this part. I get the feeling the public eye always holds out for something Stallone cannot offer...and so this film never surmounted with ratings, but this film was never meant to offer anything like that. A true hidden treasure that i would put up against any comic book derived movie. A great escape. And a great depart from modern emotional tugalongs more common at the theater.",Judge Dredd
206,Nameless1138,I am the.....HELL!?!?,1,31 January 2003,"To be certain, a film adapted from a comic book prior to ""Spiderman"" was often met with trepadition and curious sideways glances, a reaction similar to passing a midget on the street.  While we can now all have hopes for a future with faithful and enjoyable adaptions of our favorite colored characters, we must remember that, while the future IS bright, the past really sucks.  When trolling for worthwhile comic book titles, only pay attention to ""Judge Dredd"" if you are looking for reasons to shed this mortal coil.The film opens with a moderately interesting intro, showing page after page of JD comics.  Trust me, the only inspiration that the filmakers drew from these comics has to have been from the cover art.  Put simply, nothing in the movie actually reflects the comics.  Whereas the comics were dark and built for adults, this film was a fairly weak 'R' rating relying on twelve year olds sneaking into theaters to make a profit.You see, in the movie, Judges are pansies who run from every thug with a gun instead of doing their job.  The Judges body armor is made up of a bulletproof helmet and shoulder pads.  One can only assume that they will be playing the Raiders soon.  Judges also get voice activated guns that can do wonderful things, like fire flares, which actually has no use in their giant city where light exists everywhere.  Judges also get the ugliest motorcycles in the history of automobiles.  Simply put, their choppers look like amusement park bumper cars.  The fact that these bumper cars can fly seems to make wheels useless, but I guess the budget excluded any more than one scene of horribly blue screened flying bikes.Something else that the budget seems to have excluded is any mention of original design.  While this is an adaptation, much of it seems ""adapted"" from other, better, films.  Most of Mega City is right out of Blade Runner, while the police sets are essentially cribbed together from The Rock, Alien 3, and the Fifth Element.  I do consider Alien 3 to be a better film.  At least in that movie you can understand what people are saying.  When you have Jurgen Prochnow, Armand Assante, and Sly Stallone in the same film, some confusion as to what is going on is sure to happen.Sly and Armand probably gained thirty or forty pounds of beer gut, or maybe their are a trillion hot girls off screen, because they spend the entire movie sucking in their guts.  Maybe that explains their inability to say more than three or four words at a time without breathing.  Watching them reminds me of Freshmen Year, where every cute girl that walked by required you to suck it up, puff out your chest, and give your best lantern jawed grin.As a last note, look for some of the terrible dubbings done in the movie, Rob Schneider's on again gone again wounds, the ever changing Stallone scar, and the giant armor plated robot that is beaten by pulling a few wires. This is a definite three of ten film.Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge, Say no more, Say no more.",Judge Dredd
207,Lily_Park,Confusing gawdy caper,5,4 December 2008,"Confusing production which has the potential to be one of those great big-budget movie capers and on more than one front showed the potential to be a massive disappointment to fans of the 2000AD comics. The production design is in places brilliant, and in places shabby and cheap. Made before the use of CGI became prevalent in these kinds of movies, it has a feel of the highly coloured sets and costumes that the decade's other comic book adaptations (Dick Tracy) also fell for.... instead of the dark colours and slick style of Burton's Batman. In contrast this now looks and feels cheap and nasty, but it has a place in the history of comic-book adaptations, and even features set and prop design by Chris Cunningham (assume that's the good stuff then!)",Judge Dredd
208,aeon395,"Great movie, cheesy, but great.",8,11 September 2009,"Let me start by admitting that this movie is extremely ""cheesy"": you have the obvious action hero (Stallone), the comic relief (Schneider), and the clever remark (Lane) in almost every scene; not only that, the script stresses each character's role to (what may be for some) the point of nausea.Perhaps it is that cheesiness which so attracts me to this movie. There are no unexpected plot twists, simply a well mixed combination of decent storyline, semi-funny humor, and action sequences. The chemistry between Dredd (Stallone) and Fergie (Schneider) is surprisingly delightful as Fergie is so obviously misplaced in Dredd's world of ""the Law"".Another unexpected, yet pleasant, surprise would be the performance by Armand Assante; his part as the antagonist plays perfectly alongside Stallone's powerful protagonist role, offering what would seem to be a well-balanced opposition instead of a measly opponent to be easily conquered.I may have seen this movie a few hundred times since its release in 1995, and each time I see it, it's resonating effect is the same; it's a pleasant stroll down the 80's-90's action movie, easily grouped with others such as Predator, Demolition Man, The Fifth Element, etc... worthy of watching at least once, if not for the story, the humor, or the action then at least for the incredible cast.",Judge Dredd
209,missouri_reb,What A Waste!,4,22 December 2010,"Such a shame to see a creative comic series turned into another low brow Stallone vehicle. Could of been great. A very strong cast and great source material simply wasted. I realize this entertained many, so I guess it accomplished its purpose, but this had the potential to be so much more. If you liked the comics, I would think you would be upset to see what they spent millions to ruin. Stallone has made a few good movies in his career, but as a general rule, I associate his name with juvenile scripts and unimaginative action. This is no different. If you're a big Stallone fan, you should enjoy it, but I'm surprised at any Judge Dredd fan liking this. All the special effects in the world can't save a bad script. It is so rare that Hollywood ever does a book or comic adaption justice.",Judge Dredd
210,thriftymoviecritic,"A Dreddful, yet entertaining film.",3,26 May 2014,"Judge Dredd is one of the worst comic book movies from the 1990s in my opinion. It is dreadful to watch with all the hammy dialogue and terrible acting, but there is something about it that makes the film intriguing to me. One of the biggest issues that I have with Judge Dredd is that it has a hard time conveying tone. The comic series that is based in the UK was dark, melancholic, and full of dread while the film pulls a 180 on what could have been a solid action flick. Physically Sylvester Stallone was a good choice to play Judge Dredd. His muddled dialogue and hammy acting makes him more of a joke rather than a threat to me. Stallone is a tremendous actor in quite a lot of his films like: Rocky, First Blood, and even The Expendables. In those films his lines are quite simple and can be intimidating as well as understandable. In Judge Dredd I couldn't make out most of his lines throughout the film. Even the subtitles felt like they weren't really synching up with his mouth.Having a comedian as your sidekick in a superhero movie hasn't worked yet and it most likely won't. Richard Pryor was horrible in Superman III and Rob Schneider as Fergie Furguson was unbearable throughout all of Judge Dredd. Every time I see Rob on screen I don't envision him as the character he is supposed to be portraying. Instead I see him as Rob Schneider playing Rob Schneider. His acting makes the movie feel like a Saturday Night Live Sketch. At any moment Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, and Phil Hartman could appear with Adam playing Khan from Star Trek II; Wrath of Khan, Chris as Jabba the Hut from Return of the Jedi, and Phil as Flash Gordan from Flash Gordan. Taking Rob out of the picture entirely would have helped the tone immensely or if they got a different actor to play him like James Spader or Philip Seymour Hoffman as well as rewriting the dialogue than I would be more forgiving of the character.I can't take Judge Dredd seriously at all. When Stallone says ""I am the Law"" my insides hurt from laughing so hard. Nothing in this film makes sense, but it is too stupid to be truly mad at it. I am just thankful that the 2012 reboot Dredd is the gritty action film that fans of the series deserved.Judge Dredd is a dreadful film to say the least. It is campy and over the top unlike the melancholic comic book series that it is based on. This is a terrible film, but I still have a blast every time I watch it. I plead guilty to liking Judge Dredd and Dredd can by my judge, and jury for enjoying this film. I don't want him as my executioner though.For the full review go to: http://www.thriftymoviecritic.com/reviews-1- 5.html",Judge Dredd
211,zorbasag,A by the numbers action movie missing the point.,4,11 February 2017,"First I'd like to stress that I haven't yet read any of the original Comics, so things like Dredd taking off his mask didn't bother me as much as it would someone knowing the character.That said, the Positives: Although not particularly good the movie is still a Hollywood action film and it shows. The action is relatively good, the effects quite impressive for 1995 (expect for that flying bike chase scene), the cinematography is fine and the score while nothing spectacular well executed. Max Von Sydow being a great actor does well in his small part and Dredd's companion (I don't remember her name) is adequate. Armand Assante while not being able to be taken seriously really seems to have fun, as he cheerfully chews the scenery spouting off nonsense. One particularly great scene is when he has a shouting competition with Stallone on how to pronounce law, or as he put it: ""LAW!!!""The Negatives: They decided for some reason to have a very serious plot. Instead of showing Dredd doing his Job and then an unusual problem arises and he has to take care of it alone or with a companion (like in the remake) they chose to have an ""epic"" confrontation between him and an Rico, where the values of their society are at stake. While it wasn't a horrible plot per say it was kind of baffling how they chose such a big and ambitious conflict for a relatively simply character. Speaking of characters let's talk about Stallone. He is quite bad. Unfortunately. You would expect he would be ideal for the character of Dredd and while he manages to do some scenes fine as well as pull off the whole ""always serious"" shtick he is just interesting and in some cases, over the top. For instance in the courtroom scene every time there's a close up he extenuates his chin. It's ridiculous, it's like he knows he has a good chin and wants everyone to witness it or he's doing it as joke. Speaking of jokes the comic relief is Rob Schneider. He's talent-less, unfunny, annoying and a pain in the ass both for the audience and the characters them-self. Why was he even in this? Also that ABC robot or whatever they're call looks ridiculous thank's to it's chin. You can't really be threatening with a design like that. The suit the judges wear while looks the part is too over the top and glossy for it to be realistically used in the battlefield. I would have also preferred a bit more blood. It was the 90s, you could still make money with R rated films although that's really the filmmakers fault.In the End if you are a big Stallone fun and don't mind cheesy lines and bad comic relief give it a shot. If not you can still watch it as a bad example of a comic based film.",Judge Dredd
212,essopappas,Tragicaly inferior to the comic,5,31 March 2006,"Judge Dredd, one of the most brilliant and intriguing comic books of all times is effectively humiliated by this sad attempt at a blockbuster. The marketing necessity of showing Silvester Stallone's face led to the, unthinkable to Judge Dredd fans, crime of Dredd appearing without a helmet. His performance is, to say the least, sad. Equally, the inclusion of the otherwise not entirely untalented Rob Schneider as some sort of comic relief was a bad mistake, further cheapening an already problematic film. Jurgen Prochnow, a great actor by any measure, is condemned here to yet another strident ""baddie"" performance. Probably the only survivors are Max Von Sydow as Chief Justice Fargo and Armand Assante as Rico Dredd, although Diane Lane, a far better actress than this film would suggest does embellish the proceedings with her magnetic beauty. All in all what could have been a memorable film due to its first class source material, had it been given a batman type treatment, has effectively and rightly, been consigned to the cinematic dustbin. A great pity",Judge Dredd

215,OrigamiGypsy,Laughable...Really,6,30 May 2001,"*Hey, I guess there are NUMEROUS SPOILERS AHEAD*  So even though ruining this film may be an impossibility you probably should skip down to the end of the review if you haven't, and still wanna, see Judge Dredd.  You poor, poor individual.I saw this movie on cable the other day.  I'd imagined it as a kind of challenge to myself.  I'm telling you, except for the few times that I was sickened to the point of vomiting, I found myself laughing non-stop.  From the time I saw Sly dressed like he was ready for a rousing game of laser tag, to when Rico emphatically yelled ""Send in the clones"" and I answered blithely, ""Those laughy, daffy clones"", I was laughing so hard I got a cramp in the bottom of my foot.  I think that maybe I was amused by the way Stallone towered over everyone, when he's obviously not a tall man. Though the camera never really showed the platform shoes, they must have existed, and it was fun to imagine him stumbling about like a 12 year old girl wearing high heels for the very first time.  You know, just trying his best to make it look effortless but secretly worrying about breaking an ankle. Of course, the laughing might have come with the prospect of Rob Schneider actually being funny once or twice.(Though I should say he was hilarious in Big Daddy.)  The way he played the line, ""I'm alive! I'm alive! I'm alive! Oh, so are you."" was just priceless.I don't believe my laughter was a healthy laughter, though.  After the credits were rolling I felt oddly fatigued, even a little confused.  Not about the ending or any part of the movie, mind you, just confused in general.  It might have been the callous, numerous, bloody, sometimes-played-for-humor killings that did that to me.  Who really knows? All I know is I gotta come clean.  I was never really rooting for Dredd. In fact, I was quite happy when he was handed the conviction, wrongly or not, for First-Degree Murder.  Though innocent of that particular crime, it's fairly clear that he'd done his fair share of ""shoot first and ask questions never"".  I don't care if he was a combination of all the good council members and therefore engineered to be the perfect ""police, judge, jury, and executioner""; he was still a loathsome human being.  Yet, even when feeling sick to my stomach at the graphic portrayals of guiltless violence, I couldn't step entirely away from the humor.  With this bit of  engineering truth uncovered, I found myself being reminded of Dredd's absolute foil and archnemesis.  That is, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins.Throughout the rest of the movie I couldn't quite escape the desire to see a showdown between the two of them, you know, mano a mano; hand to hand.  No weapons, not even any closed-fisted striking; just little girlie slaps. Sadly, I didn't get my wish.  What I did get was a hastily applied ""romance"" and a stupid joke or two by the comic relief, who, by all accounts, should have been dead.  What a world.  Anyway, after a long nap for maintenance and defragmentation, I looked in the channel guide and saw that the day before, that evil cable channel had followed up Judge Dredd with Lost in Space: The Movie, and had preceded it with Blade!  What are they trying to do to us? It seemed to me like a ""Pinky and the Brain""-ish scheme by the Turner Empire to achieve world dominance.  But I'm afraid that, unlike The Brain, Hollywood (and Turner) is actually succeeding.*END OF SPOILERS*Though fairly stupid, I frankly quite enjoyed watching Judge Dredd, and I think the average viewer will, too.  It's strangely entertaining as long you go in expecting sub-par special effects and all-around suckiness.  Believe me, if that's your state of mind, Judge Dredd will not let you down. Actually I'm gonna give this one a 6/10.  I didn't laugh this much watching Blazing Saddles...really.",Judge Dredd

217,teddybear111,Puking,1,23 March 2008,"This movie has to be one of the worst I have ever seen. Its genre is supposed to be action, yet I found it to be more fitting in comedy. It could have been a great movie because of its neat and clever premise, but it was just ruined. The dialogue was awful. Sylvester Stallone said three lines three to six times each. Also, the guns were very obviously fake.Rob Schneider seemed really out of place as a man whom Dredd had convicted at one point erroneously and now one of Dredd's only allies. His attempted comedy was not funny and was really quite annoying because he just acted cowardly and stupid. Diane Lane's character was totally unnecessary and only acted as a filler and a short distraction from the violence. The ending was extremely predictable and clichéd. I would recommend it to someone who like mindless Sylvester Stallone movies or cheesy/corny action movies.",Judge Dredd

If you'd take it seriously though, don't watch it - it's a waste of time.The story is set in the future, where 'judges' - super policemen with the power to be the judge, the jury and the executioner all in one - fight against increasing crime in the overcrowded cities. Judge Dredd (Stallone) is the best and most feared of these judges, he IS the law.But Dredd is wrongly accused of murder. He is sent to prison for life, but because of seriously unbelievable circumstances never manages to get there.
Along with another extremely annoying, but very funny convict - Fergie - and later fellow Judge Hershey, he must fight against a corrupted government of Judges to clear his name and restore order.One slight hitch is that he comes up against his old friend and enemy, escaped from prison, who has an evil plan of his own.

219,JedaiBesk,Pure Fantasy,10,8 March 2005,"As far as critics go, the critics have lost the plot. Have they forgotten how to fantasise? The film follows several plots from 2000AD Magazine/Comic, call it what you like, re-enacted by real life characters. I don't see why it got such a bad review at the Cinema. LISTEN Critics. IT'S NOT REAL. It's just someone's imagination. Can't you see that?The violent content is no more than a regular 2000AD reader would see each in comic-strip-form each week, but this film is not really suitable for *younger* children.Sylvester Stallone plays a very commendable 'Judge Dredd', (although he does remove his helmet in the film, which never happens in the drawn stuff.)Christopher Adamson played the part of 'Mean Angel', but the splendid makeup job hid him completely, making him totally un-identifiable.My last acolade must go to Diane Lane (later seen in 'The Perfect Storm' as Christina Cotter,) for her rendition as Judge Hershey. Her attributes are very commending, and it's no wonder that Judge Dredd took his helmet off to her!""I am The Law"" comes across very well verbally, just as you might imagine from Dredd as depicted in 2000AD.In the futuristic Mega-City 1, there is only one law. Dredd. Basically, it revolves around him, and how he solves all the ongoing problems. To say anymore would reveal the plot, but look out for one amusing problem with a vending robot.Watch for a Cameo role from an old leader of 'The Blockheads'. (Ian Dury)Costumes are fairly authentic to the original artists' designs, but artistic license has been applied to the Lawmasters and Lawgivers. (Bikes and Guns) If you like following a visual extension to a weekly magazine series, then this film will work fine for you. If not, you must be a critic! All in all, a splendid adventure into futuristic fantasy, and more-or-less, it follows it's original background.Watch it more than once, because you'll see something new each time.",Judge Dredd

If you had never seen Stallone in a movie before I'm sure a lot of people would have been a lot more impressed with his rendition of Dredd. You didn't even have to read the comics to get who he was and what he stood for. Stallone was good choice for Dredd as his features can be very inanimate but still convey a sense of hidden emotion and conflict. Armand Assante as Rico was brutal! The rage and raw emotions he portrayed were chilling. Jurgen Prochnow also turned in another fine performance. The way Armand and Jurgen play off each other is electric!

The script writers have mashed about 5 or 6 story lines together to try and make one film. It would have been so much better with an unknown playing Dredd and maybe just picking one story line - maybe the Song of the Surfer, or the Return of Rico, or maybe even the Angel Gang.

227,sterlacchini,My two penneth,2,5 May 2005,"Judge Dredd and 2000AD represent my childhood inspiration for all things creative, accumulating in my career in the creative industry (I still have a full set of early 2000ADs in my studio). So obviously the film holds very personal emotions for me and as such I have to admit that I had a negative bias from the start. Anyway enough about me.The film started and I was very impressed with the visual effects and design. At first I thought Judge Dredd's uniform was way over the top, even more than the comic version. However after remembering the visual style of films like Flash Gordon (1980) I put that down to personal preference.One of the problems is Sylvester Stallone's Performance. I am not one of Sly's detractors, I have enjoyed his performances in films such as Rocky, First Blood, Paradise Alley, Copland and even Demolition Man. However this performance bares no resemblance to the character of Judge Dredd.Stallone's character lacks the authority and quiet confidence of Judge Dredd. Sly seems to have replaced these aspects with standing in a tough pose, looking intense and shouting were applicable. Needless to say I did not see the dark and gritty anti hero I was hoping for.I realise that this is a tall order for any actor and Sly in not helped by the films biggest problem, the atrocious dialogue. Clichés and over dramatic speeches destroy any hope of realism.My final comment... Judge Dredd's helmet.This should stay on at all times. I know this seems superficial, but it is representative of certain aspects of Judge Dredd's personality. Firstly Dredd's lack of personal ego, secondly his almost robot like dedication, determination and 'perceived' invulnerability and thirdly Dredd's function as an executioner.There, I feel a little better now I've got that off my chest. Cheers.",Judge Dredd
228,egor-ovcharenko,"Excellent entartaining action movie, but nothing more.",7,23 October 2018,"I first watched this film in my childhood at 13 years old, so everything below should be discounted for nostalgia.First of all, the film is very professionally made. The acting, while not exactly top-notch, is solid and fits the film. The camerawork and special effects are good too. Overall impression of the quality matches the budget (70M USD) quite well.Secondly, this title is based on comics - and it shows, in a good way. It contains memorable scenes, well thought-out action sequences, and somewhat hyberbolical characters. And I liked that a lot. Such films always have that non-monotonic style that is typical to good comics adaptations.Talking about characters, they compliment each other well. It is true they are not original, and you can see cliches all over the film, but it doesn't make them less appealing and less interesting to watch.What I also liked was that film never has too much of anything - action, story development, humor, dialogues. Just before you become tired with something happening for too long, the film takes a turn so that you are constantly entertained.But as you could guess from my rating of 7 out of 10, the movie is not perfect. What I didn't like was the story. It is predictable, flat, and non-memorable at all. While it's perfectly fine for relaxing evening, it doesn't aspire to anything above that. Typical action story - just enough to get you through the movie. However, it manages to throw a couple of interesting turns your way.Another thing I personally didn't like is too much gore in one scene, but it could be just my personal thing.I have rewatched this film recently, and was a little disappointed - turns out it's true that everything is much more vivid and fresh when you are a child.In conslusion, I find it to be an excellent choice if you are in a mood for watching entertaning movie where you don't need to think (at all). Otherwise, you could be disappointed.",Judge Dredd
229,kamfarooq,Damn good,9,26 November 2008,"One of the best films I have ever seen. OK,, so it does start Sly, but he does a credible job in the role of Joe Dredd. Juxtaposition is key.The fact of the matter is that based on Ezquerras strip from the 70's coupled with wangner';s artwork gives rise to a superhuman strength enhancing subtext on superhero reality. Give me I'm a celebrity anytime. This is the real strictly come dancing. Forsythe can it back and count his alaurels as far as i'm concerned. This is the real wheel comic deal. Realism, violence, and comedy all rear their fanatastic head in this capable sci-fi romp through space and time. There is no room for improvement as Joe takes to the skies in his power bike super yacht super flying machine. Accept no substitutes as we near the completeion of the fink brothers classic shoot em up. Oh, it's oh so entertaining.",Judge Dredd
230,chris-sheen,It's a classic,7,22 September 2021,"Don't over think it,made when movies could be just watched for pleasure in stead of everyone(myself included) being a critic,just watch it and enjoy.",Judge Dredd
231,idabpg,God awful,1,11 February 2013,"As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.",Judge Dredd
232,thatwildcard777,Sticks to the Comic.,9,22 January 2013,"After watching ""Dredd""(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. ""Dredd"" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. ""Dredd"" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.",Judge Dredd
233,jamiespilsbury-54955,An underrated gem of the 90s!,10,18 September 2021,"As someone who never grew up reading comic books, I absolutely enjoy this film! There's just so much I find fantastic about it. It's got great action sequences, a cool story and amazing use of miniatures. To me, Sylvester Stallone nailed it as Dredd, the whole removing his helmet thing doesn't really bother me. Despite the problems while making it, mostly due to the creative differences between Stallone and director Danny Cannon. A lot of time and effort went into making Judge Dredd, every credit to all those involved.I'm actually surprised it was filmed here in Britain, at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Very rare to see a Hollywood flick being made over here, especially nowadays. The film may not be perfect to die hard fans of the 2000 AD comics, but I love it for what it is, instead of hating it for what it isn't. At the end of the day it's an adaptation, it's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea and that's fine. I just don't think it's nowhere near as bad, compere to what some folks think.I've got quite a few memorabilia of the film. DVD, VHS, CD soundtrack and The Art of Judge Dredd book. Which is signed by actor Angus MacInnes, who played Judge Silver, one of the members of the judge council. I met him several years ago, at Wales Comic Con. It shocks me the film has never had an official UK Blu-ray release, only in Europe and America. I doubt this will ever happen, but I would love to see the original cut of Judge Dredd. In future home media releases, they could at least feature deleted scenes, such as the clones attacking Dredd and Hershey.",Judge Dredd

236,lasthornet,One of those films I can watch over and over again,10,26 July 2015,"I'm a big Stallone fan, have been since i was little and saw Rocky. A lot of people complain about this film, mostly the comic book fans and namely because Dredd removes his helmet and because it doesn't follow any of the comic book story lines. However, I thoroughly enjoy this film for many reasons. It's just entertaining, and overall well made in my opinion. Stallone fits the role of Dredd brilliantly, and Rob Schnieder is entertaining as Fergie along with Diane Lane as Judge Hershey. I have read that this film was originally supposed to have a darker tone than the one that ended up getting made which is a shame. I do feel sorry that Danny Cannon the director had creative differences with Stallone about this film. I can imagine dealing with an actor with that much star power can be intimidating and as much as I am a fan of Stallone I'm sure he can be very difficult to work with, at least I'm sure he was in the past.This film is a fun ride, and I never get tired of it. The special effects and sets are great for the times.You can tell there was a lot of attention to detail when they made this, and making it in the England where Judge Dredd was created was also cool since so many of these big films are made over in Hollywood.If you are looking for an entertaining action film with some comedy then check out Judge Dredd. Many people claim that the New Dredd film with Karl Urban is a better film since it is more closer in tone to the comics. Whilst it isn't a bad film, I found it quite boring and didn't buy Karl Urban as Judge Dredd at all, unlike Stallone who is clearly a tough guy and not just *acting* the part.Dredd is a good film. It was made at a time when the market wasn't saturated with super hero movies like it is today, and I think it has an originality to it along with nostalgia from seeing it when I was younger, and growing up with it very much like the Rocky movies.",Judge Dredd
