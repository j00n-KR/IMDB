0,TheLittleSongbird,More Tarkovsky brilliance,10,4 January 2015,"Stalker may not be my favourite of Andrei Tarkovsky's films, that belongs to Andrei Rublev, which is from personal opinion the greatest Soviet film ever made. It's also not his most accessible(Ivan's Childhood), if anything only Solaris is more divisive. However Stalker is still an outstanding film, it loses momentum ever so slightly at the end but not enough for it to hurt the film.As with all Tarkovsky films, Stalker is brilliantly made. It is grittier and more muted in colour than with his other films, but still maintains that hypnotic dream-like quality that the cinematography in his films have. The scenery is evocatively atmospheric, mundane but in a good way. Tarkovsky's direction again is nigh-on impeccable, showing a mastery of visuals and mood. Stalker is hauntingly scored but never in a too obvious way, while of all his films to me it was Stalker that had the most thought-provoking writing. Not all of it is easy to understand at first but a lot of the lines really makes one think a long while after. The story is not for everyone, with some finding the deliberate pacing too much for them but the storytelling is actually very suspenseful and there is a chilling atmosphere throughout, the film is slow but the suspense, atmosphere and cinematography kept this viewer glued to the seat. The acting's of the kind with the actors having times where they don't say a lot or anything but their body language, eyes and expressions communicate an awful lot, which is every bit as powerful as when speaking.Overall, an outstanding film if not Tarkovsky's best or most accessible. If you are a fan of Tarkovsky, or at least familiar with him ,you shouldn't have too much trouble getting into Stalker. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Stalker
1,Leofwine_draca,"Gloomy, depressing, and way overlong",3,2 May 2017,"STALKER is another long-winded movie from Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, this time a science fiction yarn in the same guise as SOLARIS. The setting is a post-apocalyptic landscape in which a couple of characters work their way through a devastated world looking for answers in a place known as the 'alien zone' which may contain extraterrestrial life. The best part of the movie is the authentic setting; word has it that the genuinely radioactive Estonian locations resulted in the early deaths of a number of the crew members, not least the director himself.Sadly, STALKER is one of those films that goes on interminably and as a mood piece this just doesn't hold the attention. Had Tarkovsky made the running time more reasonable (i.e. under half what it is) it might have been more interesting, but as it stands it's just an endless ramble through the wilderness with few answers at the end. I found it gloomy and depressing, not to mention sleep-inducing.",Stalker
2,SnoopyStyle,"long, surreal and Russian",5,21 February 2016,"The movie starts in black and white. The Zone has been cordoned off by the military and police. It's an area affected by something unknown or aliens or a meteor. Within the Zone lies a Room where wishes are granted. The Stalker is a man with special attributes who guides others into the room. His wife pleads for him to stop. He leads the Writer and the Professor into the Zone. The movie gains its colors after crossing the police blockage. The questioning Writer wants to regain his inspiration. The Professor is quiet and more concerned about his backpack.This is for people who love reading long, depressing, poetic Russian novels. The premise is very fascinating but it is way too slow and too long for me. I lost interest after the movie gains its colors and the three characters wonder forever in the Zone. It's a lot of long quiet scenes and dialog that doesn't interest me. It takes too long to get to the Room. I guess it is suppose to transmit the time and difficulty of the journey but I find it repetitive. I need it to have a much tighter middle.",Stalker
3,Horst_In_Translation,Not among Tarkovsky's worst or best,4,2 September 2019,"And if you put together this review with the amount of stars out of ten I give this film, you probably already know what my opinion is on Tarkovsky. He is a definite contender for being the most divisive filmmaker from all the highly successful ones. Some love his approach, others find it incredibly boring and for them it is not doing much. I am afraid I count among the latter. This Soviet movie in the Russian language (yep! don't mistake it for a modern mediocre thriller that may have Jennifer Lopez, mother of three, being attacked by a lovesick psychopath) that has its 40th anniversary this year is not gonna change anything about that. Like basically all other Tarkovsky works, it is incredibly long at over 2.5 hours and it feels that way I must say.I can't say too much about the cast here. Maybe Russian movie fans are more familiar with them. So let's talk a bit about the film itself. I would say that in terms of style and visual aspects, it is not a bad movie, so perhaps a bit on the style over substance side. I did like the beginning more than almost everything afterwards. This yellow-themed dangerous situation there with the three men being on the run and their hunters (symbolized by the motorbike rider) not far behind had a little claustrophobic atmosphere to it and I enjoyed that. After 40 minutes or so, there is quite a break thematically and this is mostly seen through color really entering the picture as the trio of ""heroes"" including Bill Nighy and especially Woody Harrelson Soviet lookalikes is somewhere in green deserted no man's land and all the danger and threats now mostly come from themselves towards each other as the group mentality is put to the test on several occasions. But there are other dangers too still like people being worried about mines etc. Let's keep in mind (no pun intended) that this movie is set during the days of big political/military turmoil. We have a lot of talk about ""the Zone"" and unfortunately as much as this is in the center of the film, it never really won me over as a crucial place or maybe even the big defining background of the movie, not just locally, but also in terms of political turmoil. I still think this part in the green was maybe when the movie was at its best, but far from great too, just because mostly everything else was so forgettable.As the trio progresses on the road to their target location, further obstacles arise. On one occasion, one of the characters is seemingly killed (I thought turned into a bird even) in a desert-like location, but not much later he reappears in what I would not exactly call the most realistic turn of events. Oh well. It is still a science fiction movie and this was probably, at least with elements, genre-wise my favorite from Tarkovsky, but I still would have liked better explanations on some occasions. This is also a problem I have with the filmmaker in general, not just here. He dives so deep into metaphors and symbolisms all the time that it feels he almost forgets to narrate a convincing story that could have you interested, let alone at the edge of your seat, and with these running times, honestly it is pretty crucial. It feels as if he implies that everybody in the audience is immediately fully aware of the characters and cares for what happens to them, but there is no profound presentation who they are and most of all why would we be interested in and care for them.Now when the gang eventually arrives where they wanted to get (or thought they wanted to get), it is all as bleak and unspectacular as it was all the time before. There is not really a sense of arrival, a sense of mission completed to it all, which honestly would have surprised me anyway. It would have gone against the style and tone of this movie, but it still could have been nice for a change. The way things actually turn out, everybody feels just as lost and on their own as they were during their journey and before that if not more. The frame with the woman from the life of one key character, who appears early on and very late too, is not bad, but also not too memorable. However, the ending with the child that has telepathic abilities was nice and even if what it did was a bit repetitive already, my eyes were glued to the screen there. Again though the problem is that there is no path leading us at all to this character and the gift. So overall, it just isn't my preferred choice of movies I must say. Then again, that is a subjective approach. If you like Tarkovsky, and I was genuinely surprised constantly how full the theaters were for his movie retrospective, then you will maybe appreciate this one here too. After all, it is among his highest rated here on imdb and also among his most famous, even if there is no way I can understand why it sits comfortably in the imdb top250. I also don't think it is a film that gets much better on rewatch. Don't watch.",Stalker
4,claudio_carvalho,"Without a Clue, An Intriguing and Metaphoric Movie Very Difficult To Be Understood",7,3 August 2004,"In a not specified time, there is a place called `The Zone', surrounded by the surveillance and protection of armed guards and forbidden to be visited. Its unknown origin is attributed to meteorites or aliens. Only some men, called `Stalkers', are able to successfully trespass its borders and reach a place in its inner called `The Room', where all the secrets and innermost hopes and wishes come true. A writer, who lost his skills, and a mysterious scientist are guided by a Stalker, when the journey begins. Today I have just seen `Stalker' for the first time. I found it intriguing, but unfortunately I have not really understood its essence. I became very disappointed, but after glancing other IMDB users reviews and the message board, I realized that there are indeed much more questions than explanations. Further, I found this story too much hermetic and boring for my taste and the images are not very clear in the old Brazilian VHS. I do not have much experience with Andrei Tarkovsky movies, therefore I intend to read some reviews, maybe see `Stalker' again and then I may write my own review. I do not want to be polemic, but I believe that a movie that needs additional reading or discussion to be understood has some problem in its development. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Stalker'",Stalker
5,classicsoncall,"""Don't stick your nose in someone's underwear if you don't understand it.""",5,13 November 2017,"How many of you kept waiting..., and waiting..., and waiting..., for something to happen - for the big surprise - for anything at all? When this movie finished, I had to concede that director Andrei Tarkovsky is perhaps the master of saying nothing in the longest amount of time possible. On top of that, the dialog was incoherent and went absolutely nowhere. If I wasn't a stickler for watching an entire movie for the sake of writing a review here, I would have given up well before the half way mark.Now lest I sound a bit out of sorts here, I'd like to point to a few other reviews by those who seemingly purport to understand what this was all about. One states ""It's like a poem written with objects. We must feel before we try to understand"". Another writer says that the movie has 'a well thought out and concise perspective'. And one more, who claims ""The scenery is evocatively atmospheric, mundane but in a good way"".Note that not one of these folks said anything that offers any help in following the story or what it's about. In fact, if you go to the FAQ page for this film on IMDb, there's not a word of explanation mentioned about what's going on, unlike other esoteric films that can be translated in some meaningful way. I would point to films like ""Inception"" and ""Donnie Darko"" to make my point on that.So what we seem to have here is an existential, dystopian Seinfeld episode about nothing. My summary line is an actual quote from the 'stalker' in the movie, warning his fellow travelers by advising them to stick close by his side, lest they fall prey to some hidden danger in 'The Zone'. By the time this thing was over, after all mind-numbing one hundred sixty two minutes of it, I had to concur with the words of The Professor who at one point near the end of the story said ""...it makes no sense to me at all"".",Stalker
6,gavin6942,Bizarre Russian Science Fiction,9,15 July 2013,"A guide known as The Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky) leads two men, ""the Writer"" (Anatoly Solonitsyn) and ""the Professor"" (Nikolai Grinko), through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.Can you believe the film contains 142 shots in 163 minutes, with an average shot length of more than one minute and many shots lasting for more than four minutes. There is no question that the camera lingers, and no surprise that the picture is considered to be slow by many people (early audiences and critics definitely thought so).Almost all of the scenes not set in the Zone are in a high-contrast brown monochrome. What does this mean? That is for you to decide, but it does add an element of fantasy to the picture.The director reportedly said, ""I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman."" Yes, folks, this is art and not entertainment. If you happen to be entertained, that is even better.",Stalker
7,lee_eisenberg,"somewhere between ""No Exit"" and ""Down by Law""",10,7 January 2017,"Andrei Tarkovsky is widely understood to be one of the most important directors in the history of cinema. His works often focus on metaphysical and philosophical topics. ""Stalker"" is an example. At first the movie reminded me of Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist play ""No Exit"" (about a bunch of people trapped in an existential hell), as the Stalker, Writer and Professor had trouble escaping the blockaded region of the Zone. As the protagonists headed for the heart of the Zone, the movie began to remind me of Jim Jarmusch's ""Down by Law"", about three men who escape jail and wander through rural Louisiana. Once the protagonists reach the Room, the movie really takes off.It's worth noting that this is not a movie for those who are used to action flicks. It contains long shots and goes long periods without dialogue. If you're going to watch this movie, you'd better have a long attention span. This holds true for the other Tarkovsky movies that I've seen. That's better, in my opinion. The last thing that we need is another movie contributing to ADHD.If I were going to postulate the gist of the movie, I would say that we have to seek our own answers for the meanings of our lives. These men go on an expedition hoping to have their innermost desires fulfilled, only to find that the place has trash everywhere. Maybe our innermost desires have to come from us directly, as opposed to some esoteric entity.Maybe that's just me. Whatever the gist is, ""Stalker"" is a great movie. One of the all-time high points of cinema, like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". Definitely see it.",Stalker
8,jboothmillard,Stalker,6,22 February 2015,"I remembered seeing the iconic image of the man with thorns on his head in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this Russian film was rated well by critics as well, so I hoped it was deserved as an addition, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (Andrei Rublev, Solaris, The Mirror). Basically near a grey and unnamed city is ""The Zone"", an alien place surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by soldiers, this forbidden and deserted wilderness has all sorts of strange things going on, including things moving about, but the place apparently brings the ability to fulfil people's innermost desires. A man called Stalker (Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy), over the objections of his wife, leaves early in the morning, leaving the wife with their disabled daughter, to meet with two men. He is one of only a handful of people that has the mental gift, and risks imprisonment, leading people into the Zone, taking them to ""The Room"", the place where secret hopes of someone could come true. The two men are known as The Writer (Anatoly Solonitsyn), who has a burned out popular career, is cynical and questions his talent, and the Professor (Nikolai Grinko), a quiet scientist concerned more about his knapsack than the actual journey. They have both agreed to put their fate in the hands of the Stalker who guides them into the Zone, going across the various landscapes and obstacles in their way, but to approach the Room they must be indirect, it is drawing near that the rules for them change when the Stalker is facing his own crisis. Alisa Freyndlikh as Zhena Stalkera, Stalker's wife and Natalya Abramova as Marta, Stalker's daughter. The cast are fine, the use of colour, going from muted sepia colour in the real world into bright colour for the Zone world is clever, there is certainly a sense of paranoia and a chilling atmosphere throughout, it does I suppose make you question one's own beliefs and values, it may be very strange and not easy to follow, but it is an interesting science-fiction drama. Good!",Stalker
9,Quinoa1984,"the most erebral' science-fiction film ever made, but also one of the rarest to challenge perceptions and stimulate the senses",10,16 March 2007,"Stalker is, based on the amount of science-fiction films I have seen yet, or at least those that could be considered true to whatever can be considered part of the genre, maybe the talkiest, the one with the least amount of any kind of action, and one that moves at a pace that might make Godard a little squirmy in his seat. These however are all positives for director Andrei Tarkovsky's goals with what could be considered a masterpiece, to use the term once again. It's a dense film, but within this density layers of interest that many of today's science-fiction films wouldn't even think to consider much less attempt are present and alive. Its visual prowess is another big piece of what makes Stalker such a triumph. Never do we get cuts too quick or shots that go by in the blink of an eye, far from it. Tarkovsky is putting the audience through long shots, as in surpassing five minutes, give or take a minute, and the craft is hypnotic; he uses his skills very simply in pans and tilts and subtle zoom-ins and outs, and there's even a few shots, like the pan up in close-up over the un-real/real objects in the river with metaphorical significance leading to the hand, that are some of the most haunting in all of cinema.It's not an easy trip through what is actually a very simple premise: a stalker, Aleksandr Kajdanovsky, is going to take a writer and a philosopher through the dangerous terrain to the zone, where anything innermost in said person can be realized. Aside from the surpassing of the guarded gates into the entrance, where there are gun-shots and the like, Tarkovsky isn't interested in ""action"" things happening, but themes expressed squarely through narrow, representative characters and mood. This mood is one that is wrong if looking at the back of the video box, which compares the ambiance and realm of science fiction to that of Blade Runner. In the sense of it breaking clichés, sure, it's similar, but that's really all on a shallow level. Tarkovsky's design for the picture is tantamount to being hyper stylized, but never too noticeable in the sense of it looking 'fake'. There may be a moment or two where the zone does look like a ZONE from a not-quite nuclear fall-out, like the one room with sandy dunes on the floor. But it's also right out of Russia, with industry and decay of the period all in direct view. The hopelessness is conveyed not just through the humorlessness of the characters, but in the zone itself, which looks like it's been not constructed completely by the crew.I was originally spurned on to see it not only because of seeing Tarkovsky's Solaris and Andrei Rublev- the former also an experimental feat of intelligent, emotionally complex sci-fi- but because of a couple of clips featured in the documentary The Pervert's Guide to Cinema. In it, Zizek uses Stalker to describe how there can be a world, or a form of a world, where the ideal of Godlessness is given full form into a world without belief, and where decay and industrialization are all there can be seen. But then there is also the 'Zone', which is also in line with the idea of there being order, of hope, yet also the total despair in getting something otherworldly. Does the Zone need human beings as much as human beings need the zone? Questions like these, as well as what it means to be a creator of art, as the writer goes to lengths describing, in a post-apocalyptic environment, or what it is to actually enter into an alien construct, or what may be an alien construct, as what may be illusion is stronger than that becoming a reality, or what the stalker has in responsibility to himself, others, and humanity at large, come up repeatedly. So, at the least, Stalker can't be considered as a work without a thought process to it. Quite the contrary, there's even a poetry to all of the thoughts and visuals that keep coming up, be they through the conversations on the way to the Zone, or in that ""climax"" on the precipice of the ""Room"" where the potential of destruction comes at a heavy price following all that's happened. Tarkovsky even tops himself from Solaris by making human need and suffering and, as a human construct, the fantastical imaginings of what is ""out there"" as here, paramount and affecting. Fear, greed and ego, and a desire for some minor level of any sense of peace through whatever medium is available, is what Tarkovsky suggests and prods, but never outright answers; it comes as a great shock and relief at the end, when the boy Monkey shows an unusual 'moment' at the table. This being said, Stalker won't be for everyone, surely not the Star Wars geeks looking for pomp and circumstance against motifs out of the old West. It might even feel too long and plodding by those who put 2001 at the top of their favorite movie lists. But it also has an astonishing appeal to those who may gravitate to it, where ideas and scenery, reflections on society and a specific take on a dark alternate future, get at a very high level of sophistication and artistry.",Stalker
10,sunwarrior13,Tarkovsky's Finest Work,10,25 October 2012,"Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, an allegorical science fiction film like his earlier Solaris, was adapted from the novel Picnic by the Roadside by brothers Boris Strugatsky and Arkady Strugatsky.This science fiction depicts an expedition led by the Stalker to bring his two clients to a site known as the Zone, which has the supposed potential to fulfill a person's innermost desires.It features Alexander Kaidanovsky,Anatoli Solonitsyn and Nikolai Grinko. The title of the film, which is the same in Russian and English, is derived from the English word to stalk in the long-standing meaning of approaching furtively, much like a hunter. In the film a stalker is a professional guide to the zone, someone who crosses the border into the forbidden zone with a specific goal.The film follows three men namely:the Scientist, the Writer and the Stalker as they travel through a mysterious and forbidden territory in the Russian wilderness called the ""Zone."" In the Zone, nothing is what it seems. Objects change places, the landscape shifts and rearranges itself. It seems as if an unknown intelligence is actively thwarting any attempt to penetrate its borders. In the Zone, there is said to be a bunker, and in the bunker: a magical room which has the power to make wishes come true. The Stalker is the hired guide for the journey who has, through repeated visits to the Zone, become accustomed to its complex traps, pitfalls, and subtle distortions. Only by following his lead can the Writer and the Scientist make it alive to the bunker and the room. As the men travel farther into the Zone, they realize it may take something more than just determination to succeed: it may actually take faith. Increasingly unsure of their deepest desires, they confront the room wondering if they can, in the end, take responsibility for the fulfillment of their own wishes. Stalker is a complex, oblique parable that draws unforgettable images and philosophical musings from its sci-fiction thriller setting. Challenging, provocative, and ultimately rewarding, it is a mind-bending experience that defies explanation. It is not an easy film, but almost certainly a great one.Like Tarkovsky's earlier and similarly enigmatic science fiction classic Solaris, this long, slow, meditative masterpiece demands patience and total attention; anyone accustomed to faster pacing is likely to abandon the nearly three-hour film before its first hour is over. On the other hand, those who approach this movie in a properly receptive frame of mind are likely to appreciate the film's seductive depth of theme and hypnotic imagery. Tarkovsky films their journey as a long odyssey, or religious pilgrimage, and center of The Zone is where each of these men hopes to find a kind of personal transcendence. Despite obvious parallels to The Wizard of Oz, Tarkovsky's film is devoid of special effects or any fantastical elements typically associated with science fiction or fantasy. Instead, Stalker makes astonishing use of sound and bleak-but-beautiful imagery to envelope the viewer into the eerie atmosphere of The Zone and the dank, colorless landscape that surrounds it. And while the film's glacial pacing may be off-putting to some viewers, there's no denying that Stalker has a mesmerizing power of its own, including a thought-provoking and highly debatable ending that propels the film to a higher level of meaning and significance. Visually unforgettable,this is possibly Tarkovsky's finest work.",Stalker
11,Theo Robertson,Meandering Metaphysics,4,9 January 2011,"Andrei Tarkovsy's STALKER is one of these films whose reputation is entirely confined to that of Universiy level film studies . It's a film that remains unknown to people who visit multiplexes on a Friday night to watch the latest blockbuster from Hollywood and is rarely shown on network television . I think its only broadcast on British television was on Channel 4 in 1990 or 1991 . Nevertheless it was well regarded enough to make it in to the the lower reaches of the IMDb Top 250 for a couple of years but I'm rather puzzled as to why ? It's not a film produced for the masses which possibly sums the up inherent irony of communism The story starts 20 years after a meteorite has landed on Earth and when people have started disappearing in the crash zone the authorities quarantine the area which is now referred to as "" the Zone "" . A trio of men sneak through the blockade determined to find out the secret of the Zone This is communist science fiction based upon a story written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky . Communist science fiction differs quite markedly from its Western counterpart by concentrating on metaphysics , man's relationship to the natural order rather than plot driven concepts . In many ways it's introspective humanism rather than mind expanding and imaginative . This type of story would appeal well to Tarkovsky since his volume of wok centres around elemental imagery such as water and wind . He is a film maker who is the archetypal auteur The problem with all this is that it makes for a rather unengaging piece of cinema . If you're expecting to see aliens you'll be disappointed . There is an argument that science fiction doesn't need aliens in order to work and this is certainly true , think of the number of novels by people such as John Christopher that feature Earth shattering eco disasters for a premise . But if you had three men in Soviet Russia escaping in to a forbidden zone where they walk around discussing the human condition for three hours then you'd have the exact same story devoid of any science fiction heading . In short STALKER isn't really a science fiction film at all At least the film sets out its stall right from the very beginning . We're treated to the type of camera work seen in films by luminaries as Bela Tarr where the camera moves about for several minutes without cutting . We don't actually get any dialogue until ten minutes in to the running time and if you're bored senseless by then then it's perhaps a good idea to watch something else because the pace doesn't really improve much One of the comments on this page states that STALKER is "" Like Last Of The Summer Wine set in Russia "" and that's a very accurate description of the movie . It's composed of three philosophical men wandering about the countryside making profound statements on the nature of existence . You might rub your chin and nod in agreement but you might also have to rub your eyes in order to stay awake too",Stalker
12,grantss,Brilliant - one of the greatest examples of cinema as art,10,17 March 2017,"In a small, unnamed country there is an area called the Zone. It is apparently inhabited by aliens and contains the Room, wherein it is believed wishes are granted. The government has declared The Zone a no-go area and have sealed off the area with barbed wire and border guards. However, this has not stopped people from attempting to enter the Zone. We follow one such party, made up of a writer, who wants to use the experience as inspiration for his writing, and a professor, who wants to research the Zone for scientific purposes. Their guide is a man to whom the Zone is everything, the Stalker.Superb, profound, thought-provoking movie by famed Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. If ever you needed an example of how cinema is more than simply entertainment but is art, holding the mirror up to nature, this is it. The movie starts as a science-fiction adventure, and a very intriguing and engaging one. While Tarkovsky develops the plot slowly, it is never dull. In fact, the slowness ramps up the suspense. It also gives you time to admire Tarkovsky's excellent camera work. Every shot is perfectly chosen and captured, resulting in the movie seeming more like a series of paintings than a film. This, despite the simple, basic production quality and the dearth of remastered copies (the version I watched was in 240p!).As the movie progresses it moves from being plot-driven to something much more metaphoric and ends up covering a multitude of macro-level societal issues.Most prominent, and important, is a debate around science vs art vs religion, each represented by the three protagonists. Tarkovsky doesn't take sides, but gives every faction a chance to state their case. What you end up with is a reasonable explanation for each side's value in society, and why there is friction between the three.This all said, the initial instinct with this movie may be one of disappointment. There is no great resolution in the end, either to the mysteries of the Zone or the debates between the three lead characters. For those expecting closure and a neat tying up of the plot, this is likely to be a let-down.However, if you think about it, this is perfect. Tarkovsky retains his neutral stance and leaves it to the viewer to think things through. More than anything, he is not providing solutions, or a ""winner"", but making you think about the issues, and life in general.",Stalker
13,bombersflyup,Just don't,1,5 March 2018,"My only guess is that this is some form of torture and people are rating it high to perpetuate the torture onto others.Starting with an annoying ten to fifteen minute opening sequence of people standing at a distance, then the camera moving slowly to a door, then a man lying in bed. The film's nothing more than three guys, who were all basically the same guy, walking, stopping and talking and repeat. I often didn't know who was speaking and I didn't want to know who was speaking. Nothing happens for three hours and it's about nothing. The scene where the guys get into the so called zone area, was mildly interesting. It isn't the worst film I've ever seen, because it isn't vulgar or anything, but it's pretty close. Walk forward, do something, something happen were my continuous thoughts. One of my favourite movies takes place in one room, so I don't need action to be engaged, but this simply has no substance.",Stalker
14,lasttimeisaw,Stalker,8,6 August 2013,"My third Tarkovsky's film (after SOLARIS 1972, 8/10 and NOSTALGHIA 1983, 8/10), STALKER is a startling eye-opener, set in a sordid clanking land of rural Soviet Union, after the falling of a meteorite, an enigmatic area ""The Zone"" has emerged, inside there is a room can grant incomers' innermost wishes, but cordoned by the government with armies, only with the guidance of so called ""stalkers"", one can reach the room. So the expedition involves one stalker and his two clients, a writer and a professor, one begs for inspiration and the other conceals an ulterior motive.As one can predict, the film is teeming with Tarkovsky's trademark static/panning long shots, mesmerizing and conjuring up a recondite sense of metaphysics, for example, a steady long shot of various items in the water finishes with the focus on a human hand, sometimes it's baffling, as viewers (as well as the two clients) have been warned numerous times by the stalker, the place is precarious, many a predecessor dies mysteriously in the zone, among a large chunk of the time Tarkovsky successfully maintains the stifling suspense to tally with the seedy locale, the movement is painstakingly strung out, so the audiences cannot shun the unknown danger but only succumb to a thorough wallow in the wasteland. Tarkovsky never resort to cheap horror to give vent to excitement or relief, instead, he utilizes a man-made natural surrounding to trap oneself in, and let our own inside demon out to divulge a sense of thrill and frisson. I don't speak Russian, so it probably hinders my apprehension of the dialog, only if the English interpretation could be better, nevertheless, STALKER seems bit chattier than Tarkovsky's other works, their debate ranges from the philosophy of human beings' psychological trials and tribulations, the socio-political radicalism to the awe and frustration towards the mystery and miracles plus the unselfishness of art, etc. I may not be able to fully cover all the implications from the first viewing, but one can not deny here the luxuriant imagery is louder than words at any rate.The cast is also memorable, the monochrome close-ups endow each character with a pictorial impact of their own resolution, the friend-or-foe association motivates the storytelling and excellently penetrates the harmony of the trio thus overshoots viewers' expectation. Myself find the supernatural elements have been fascinatingly deployed in this film, scattering into many inscrutable shots, sometimes only in a jiffy and most strikingly is the ending, with the daughter of the stalker, mind-controls still objects until one glass falls on the ground but the sound is drowned by the strident train running nearby, which ultimately veils the film with a stratum of mystique that qualifies Tarkovsky as one of the most unique and essential filmmaker of all time!",Stalker
15,cherold,"Oh my God, I just can't",4,30 August 2021,"For me, Andrei Tarkovsky has always been the guy who directed that slow and pointless version of Solaris that all the critics loved. I didn't really plan to every watch another of his films, but after reading an article in the New Yorker that suggested Solaris was far from his best and Stalker was great, I thought I'd check it out.The opening monochromatic scenes look stunning. It's really worth watching a bit just to see really great cinematography.Things move slow from the beginning, but then they pretty much grind to a halt when characters start having long philosophical conversations, something I associate more with French films than Russian ones.Tarkovsky seems determined to make sure there is not a moment of excitement in the movie. He takes a scene of people sneaking through a heavily-patrolled area to reach ""The Zone"" and drains it of every possibility of suspense, making the whole thing an endless slog.When they reach The Zone the movie goes to color and the cinematography becomes drab. So the last little thing that made the film worth watching was gone.So that's it for me. I don't care how many people love him, I am done with Tarkovsky. Won't get fooled again.",Stalker
16,gridoon,A couple of great moments in a really tedious film.,6,15 January 2003,"Well, the story of a ""Zone"" that makes your deepest, most unconscious wishes come true is one that holds magical possibilities, but you won't find most of them here. Someone else has already called this film tedious and pretentious, and I agree. Actually, not to call ""Stalker"" pretentious would almost be an insult to Tarkovsky himself! (He even brought up the subject of why music touches our souls at one point). And not to call it tedious would be the same as kidding yourself; the film is downright unbearable at times, and probably always deliberately so. Moments of beauty and revelation do exist (like the realization of the true nature of ""The Room""), but they are few and far between. Mostly the film will try your patience by having its three characters accomplish in more than two hours what they could've accomplished in less than 40 minutes. The ending is mega-disappointing. (**1/2)",Stalker
17,gbill-74877,Powerful,9,30 June 2018,"A movie of uncommon depth, 'Stalker' is poetic, philosophical, and brooding - and certainly not standard science fiction fare. In it, a guide (a 'stalker', Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy) leads a writer (Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy) and a physics professor (Nikolai Grinko) through a mysterious area of devastation known as 'The Zone', in search of 'The Room', which holds the promise of making their deepest desires come true. The Zone is said to hold mortal dangers to those within it, and is also reactive to their presence, shifting in unpredictable ways. The film is highly allegorical though, and while the trio face murky subterranean horrors, they don't seem to be of the alien kind, but within the mind instead, those associated with the existential condition, and living in a modern world under a totalitarian regime. In this the film seems to deviate, and in more explicitly dark, introspective ways, from the original novel by the Strugatsky brothers (who as an aside, wrote some fantastic fiction aside from 'Roadside Picnic' - check out 'The Doomed City', 'Definitely Maybe', and 'The Dead Mountaineer's Inn' among others). The film is Kafkaesque, and it's also slow and ponderous, too much so for some viewers. I found that the pace and visuals of devastation to be meaningful, underscoring the bleakness of their lives, and allowing for the quiet of deeper thought. The dialogue is fantastic throughout the movie, and clearly shows the struggle of the intelligentsia in this 'brave new world' of Communism. The writer observes that to be effective, he must be tormented and unsure of himself, that is, the moment he thinks he's a genius and has it made, he's no longer a great writer. Furthermore, ""It's impossible to write, thinking all the time of success or failure. But if no one is going to read me in one hundred years, why the hell should I write at all?"" He also describes being put through the wringer, at first thinking he will change the world with his words, and then finding out that the world has changed him, and will soon forget him, channeling the angst of Russian authors from Dostoevsky to Grossman. The physicist, on the other hand, fears being denounced by a fellow scientist, accused of disloyalty to the Party for personal reasons, which was a very real problem under Stalin. He wants to destroy the Room, recognizing that it will eventually lead to disaster in the form of absolute power granted to some lunatic, and how true this is. Meanwhile, the stalker is severely disillusioned by the cynicism and impotence of these intellectuals. There are few actors, but each turns in a soulful performance, including the three leads but also the stalker's wife (Alisa Freyndlikh) - check out her late scene speaking to the camera, and while emotional, getting around to lighting a cigarette. The scene where the stalker walks with her through a stark, desolated landscape, with their legless daughter on his shoulders, nuclear reactors in the background, and music playing that's reminiscent of Pink Floyd, is very powerful, and stuck with me. In my view, The Zone and the journey to get to it simply represents life in the USSR - a wasteland in the literal and symbolic sense, one with hidden dangers everywhere, and whose rules defy logic, and may change in an instant. One needn't look to extraterrestrials to have created such a place. The trio never enter The Room, but do you really believe it exists? A room where all one's wishes come true, while living under a soul-crushing totalitarian regime? It's a pipe dream. This journey to Oz is not along a yellow brick road, but through a nuclear hellscape.
And yet, there is hope, and a message of perseverance. Tarkovsky gives us the Buddhist concept that those that are soft and flexible will survive, whereas that which is hard and strong is close to breaking, and dying. ""When a man is just born, he is weak and flexible. When he dies, he is hard and insensitive. When a tree is growing, it's tender and pliant. But when it's dry and hard, it dies. Hardness and strength are death's companions. Pliancy and weakness are expressions of the freshness of being. Because what has hardened will never win."" In the little girl's paranormal capabilities following her reading Tyutchev's poem on love at the end, I also see a message of transcendence, that the youth of tomorrow will be capable of things that can't be conceived of today. Can miracles still exist, and will the Russian people someday be free? Powerful. A few more quotes:
On art:
""But imagine some antique pot displayed in a museum. It was used at its time as a receptacle of food leftovers, but now it's an object of universal admiration for its laconic pattern and unique form. Everyone goes oh! and ah! And suddenly it turns out that it's not antique at all, that some joker has palmed it off on the archeologists just for fun. Strange as it may seem, the admiration dies off. Those connoisseurs...""On music, and meaning:
""You were talking recently about the meaning of our life, of the unselfishness of art. Take music, for instance. Less than anything else, it is connected to reality, or if connected at all, it's done mechanically, not by way of ideas, just by a sheer sound, devoid of any associations. And yet, music, as if by some miracle, gets through to our heart. What is it that resonates in us in response to noise brought to harmony, making it the source of the greatest delight which stuns us and brings us together? Why is all this necessary? And above all, for whom? You'll reply: 'For no one and no reason.' No. I doubt that. For everything in the final reckoning has a meaning. A meaning and a reason.""On love, the poem 'Dull Flame of Desire' by Fyodor Tyutchev:
""I love those eyes of yours, my friend,
Their sparkling, flashing, fiery wonder; 
When suddenly those lids ascend,
Then lightning rips the sky asunder;
You swiftly glance, and there's an end;
There's greater charm, though, to admire
When lowered are those eyes divine
In moment's kissed by passion's fire;
When through the downcast lashes shine
The smoldering embers of desire...""Lastly, reflecting a sense of gratitude, but needing more, by Arseny Tarkovsky, father of the director.
""Now the summer is passed,
It might never have been;
It is warm in the sun,
But it isn't enough;All that I could attain,
Like a five-fingered leaf,
Fell straight into my hand,
But it isn't enough;Neither evil nor good 
Has yet vanished in vain;
It all burned and was light, 
But it isn't enough;Life has been like a shield
And has offered protection;
I have been very lucky,
But it isn't enough;The leaves were not burned,
The boughs were not broken;
The day shines like glass,
But it isn't enough.",Stalker

21,Bored_Dragon,Imagine listening to a cheap philosophical audio-book while walking through an exhibition of art photography with depressive motifs ...,7,31 July 2021,"This cult achievement of Andrei Tarkovsky is generally accepted as one of the masterpieces of Russian cinematography. When I had the opportunity to see it on the big screen, I couldn't miss it. Fortunately, the ticket was extremely cheap.""Stalker"" is based on the SF novel ""Roadside Picnic"" by the Strugatskiy brothers, who adapted it into the script themselves. Although its genre classification is the same as that of the novel, ""Stalker"" is a philosophical and psychological drama, whose SF premise is only mentioned, and I believe that it is no more than a mere illusion in the minds of the protagonists, so the SF determinant leads to completely wrong expectations.The film opens with a very slow but mesmerizingly atmospheric and superbly shot scene, each frame of which is an art photograph. Already in those first moments, I saw myself rating it a ten, but from there on the film only goes downhill.To be clear, the rest of the film doesn't visually lag behind that first scene, but too long shots that show totally uninteresting people who do more or less nothing, no matter how beautifully shot, are not enough to hold my attention for almost three hours. If I wanted to enjoy top photography, I would go to an exhibition and not to the cinema. Of those three hours, perhaps a third is filled with plot, which again is largely reduced to monologues, while nothing really happens. Essentially, this looks more like a monodrama than a movie.In the center of events is an area called the Zone, in which there is a room that, for those who get it alive, fulfills the greatest wish. The basic message of the film is: ""Be careful what you wish for it might come true"", because the Room does not fulfill the wish that we consciously ask for, but the essential one, hidden in the depths of man.This is an interesting premise from which you will not see anything in the film. We don't know for sure whether the Zone is special in any way at all, nor do any of the protagonists use the Room. The premise is only there to give us the background to study the personalities of the people who headed to the zone and their guide, Stalker.The plot itself can be told in a few sentences, while the whole story is reduced to a philosophical monologue by the author through the mouths of three protagonists. There are no original philosophical ideas or interesting views on life. Just a bunch of true, but long-worn philosophical and psychological phrases, pretentiously packaged so that they seem more profound and significant than they really are.General impression - beautifully filmed but pretentious and hard to watch, without the essential strength to justify the effort. Just because of the technical qualities and the atmosphere, I can't go below7/10""The photography, in this case, is like the wrapping of an empty present box."" - trans_mauro.",Stalker

While the change in scenery is welcome, the characters continue to blabber on and on and on, sprouting boring and pointless philosophy.

I appreciated Solaris but it wasn't done very well here. For sure, there are moments of reflection and deep visual symbolism but most of the time I was just watching pensive faces reacting to nothing at all, or repeated pleas from the stalker to listen to his instructions. There was a decent attempt at expressing some deep messages but these could have been done in a much more succinct runtime without any loss of meaning or effect: We all need some magic in the world, we don't always know what we truly want or need, we will never truly be satisfied with our searching, and so on.

24,tomgillespie2002,Possibly Tarkovsky's greatest film,10,13 February 2011,"Stalker begins in a black and white, industrialised, gated and despotic world. You feel the dampness permeated within the walls. Pools of water lay in mud; it falls from the walls and ceilings. This is the environment that we meet the main character 'Stalker' (played laconically by Aleksandr Kaidanovsky). His job is to guide people to their hopes and dreams. The place that he guides them through is 'The Zone'. The zone is the perfect juxtaposition of the dank world we are first introduced to. A place occupied by the elements of nature. However, this space is unpredictable.As the story goes, the zone is cordoned off to the masses as there was an unspecified 'alien' landing which, at its centre can give the answers – both philosophically and ideologically – to whomever reaches that core. Stalker is employed by people who want to find this out, as a guide through the treacherous landscape. They need a guide who knows how to manoeuvre through it as the land constantly changes, and can be utterly deadly. A writer (Anatoli Solonitsym) and a scientist (Nikolai Grinko), employ 'Stalker' as their guide through the terrain.This is without question my favourite of all Andrei Tarkovsky films (easily beating Mirror and the more well known Solaris). There is always a particular beauty with which he is able to film nature, and to transcend the normality of it, and present it as pure imagistic poetry. In the opening sequences, he conjures beauty from damp, decaying environments, and offers the most perfect of juxtapositions of our industrialised world, next to the beauty of nature. But in this filmic world, the natural elements seem to be the enemy; the alien 'other'. The answers which the characters are looking for become almost irrelevant, as the sheer poetry of the filmmaking transcends story.

26,eddie_baggins,Transfixes and frustrates in equal measure,7,15 March 2021,"More philosophical and ponderous than pure Sci-Fi, the highly regarded Andrei Tarkovsky film Stalker is a film that will either enthrall or bore as audiences are taken on an atmospheric journey to a landscape in an unnamed country simply known as ""The Zone"", a place where alien lifeforms once lived or do still inhabit and where a mysterious place titled The Room apparently grants wishes of the those that dare enter into it.Being someone with the middle of the range intelligence that I have, I don't profess to understand or fathom even half of the various deep life questions and ideals that Stalker is dealing with across its nigh on three hour run-time, a sometimes hard to endure trek through a Chernobyl like world that seemingly predicted the catastrophic Russian tragedy that followed in its path years later.There are countless elements to Tarkovsky's film (one that the director almost abandoned on multiple occasions, so hard was its production and budget constraints) that don't feel as though they needed the screen-time dedicated to them and the film could've easily lost 30 - 40 minutes off its final cut and still made an impact but despite its various inconsistencies when it comes to engaging the audience, the nightmarish and atmospheric presence of The Zone and the possibilities it possesses are reasons why so many have fallen under its spell and why its influence on pop culture and films/TV like Westworld and Annihilation is clear for all to see.It's incredible to think that despite its constraints as a film of the late 70's, its highly doubtful a modern dosage of special effects or technical wizardry would've had the chance to create a more engrossing playground of despair and intrigue with every single frame of Stalker drenched in foreboding and mystery, creating a character out of The Zone through ingenious and carefully considered production values.Initially neither a massive box office hit or even a genuine critical darling, Stalker's increasingly strong reputation as a piece of cinematic art and brilliance is a rare feat for a film with audiences from around the world seeking out its dreamlike qualities as they try and unlock the hidden meanings and ideals that lay within Tarkovsky's living and breathing Sci-Fi escapade.Final Say -The exact type of film that I'm sure intellectuals love to quote as a favourite, Stalker is far from a perfect film and one that clearly thinks highly of itself as it delves into the deep depths of the human condition and what it means to be a human being but its stunning atmosphere and unique sensibilities ensure its a film unlike any other and one that can transfix as well as frustrate.3 1/2 Nobel Prizes out of 5",Stalker

Honestly, I've not seen anything like this. Absurdly ethereal and existential. Set in a dystopian future where a meteorite has collided with Earth, a mysterious and ominous area called ""The Zone"" is left in is wake. An individual known as a ""Stalker"" guides two others to a room where your innermost wish comes true. Their journey, unbeknown to them, becomes an epiphany on humanity. Deconstructing what makes us human. Looking into our deadly sins. Contrasting articulation with beliefs. Stalker is such a unique experience, that I don't think I can fully grasp its magnitude. I will say it's not perfect and not Tarkovsky's masterpiece as many claim it to be. Separated into two chapters, part one was incredibly dull. I struggled to become invested in the few characters that are presented. Emotionally, they were empty. I felt nothing towards them. But, interestingly, I connected with the script. Way ahead of its time, and possibly one of the most thought provoking screenplays I've seen. It might take multiple watches just to truly appreciate and admire the complexity of the dialogue. One sentence can trigger multiple metaphors. Andrei Tarkovsky's direction was sublime. A ridiculous amount of long takes, slow camera movement and consistent scenes of minimal dialogue. The visceral imagery and hallucinogenic narrative assists in conveying the large questions that Tarkovsky wanted to explore. The dystopian environment felt authentically natural, resembled nuclear fallout. Also some genuine scenes of suspense, where the exclusive fear of the unknown sustains tension. Creatively crafted, given its time of release. It's just...a lot to take in. It's a shame about the first 45 minutes, but the overall mystery and elusiveness of the story appealed to me.

Brief Review -A slow poison on inner world of human's hopes, desires, disillusions and beliefs. Stalker came 1979, by then world cinema had up grown up healthily in Art Genre but still Stalker manages to stand in different league for itself and competitor to other Classic Art films. Stalker is focused on human depositions which are hard to understand and difficult to digest. The story is about a guide who leads two men, A Writer and a Scientist through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes. In this journey all three of them open up some unknown facts and intellectual thoughts about life and about each other which tells us about fabrical human emotions and shattering insights. The problem with Stalker is, it is very slow paced that might just force you to stop the film and leave it halfway. I personally felt like quitting it one or two times but controlled myself to finish it thinking that i may not give it a repeat watch in future. So, if you think you can hold your neves for 161 minutes then Stalker is a Must See and definitely gonna give you something on life. Stalker is blessed by concrete and unshakable vision of director Andrei Tarkovsky as he didn't even try to divert the film from it's zone for a moment. Many directors fail while trying to add some light weight stuff such as Love, Family, Romance or any of those elements which aren't really required in the specific Cosmos created in the film. But i am definitely disappointed by the slow pace and Tarkovsky is responsible for that. There are many scenes in the film which can be shot quickly and trimmed well but overlong sights and slow pauses made it slower than the usual. All 3 lead actors have been Good, cinematography is decent and dialogues are subtle. Overall, Stalker is a wide appealing film but unfortunately comes in the club where only limited art lovers could like the way it deserves, for others it isn't Recommendable.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Stalker

They walk around, follow odd rules laid down by the stalker, have conversations... and that's about it.Stalker is not a great movie to watch if you're simply looking to pass an hour or two. I've heard it said that it is not entertainment, and there's a lot of truth to that. You won't feel good after watching it. Rather you should feel thoughtful. What did it mean? Was it about religion? About time? About free will? There's no clear answer, but that's rather the point. It's a movie to guide your thoughts, but not one to provide you with ready-made answers.

As the movie opens, we get to know the ""Stalker"", a guy who guides people through the ""Zone"" towards a room that supposedly grants any and all wish. The stalker's wife begs him not to go, but he goes anyway. The Stalker's 2 customers are the Professor and the Writer. And off they go on their mysterious journey. At this point we are 10-15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: despite being a 1979 release, the movie was released in many countries outside of the USSR only in 1980 or even later. I happened to see the movie on its original release in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1980 or 1981. I hadn't seen this movie since then, so almost 40 years ago. Imagine my surprise when, during a recent family visit to Belgium, I noticed that the movie was playing in the local art-house theater. I just HAD to check it out again! Well, color me surprised and, frankly, taken aback at my experience watching this again. First of all, I had forgotten how slow-moving a film this was. In and of itself this is not an issue for me, but here it is taken to the extreme. I also found that the movie simply has not aged very well over the years, and looks very dated. On the other hand, I found a renewed appreciation for the photography (scenes outside the Zone are filmed in B&W, but in the Zone it's a lush palette). Also tops is the original score by Eduard Artemyev, the Russian electronic music composer (I am going to see if the soundtrack is available on CD). All that said, given that the movie runs about 2 hrs. 45 min., I had very mixed emotions about this as the movie finally ended. I honestly did not enjoy it as nearly as much as I had expected it. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Antwerp, Belgium was attended okay but not great (less than 10 people), and when the house lights came back on, I couldn't help but notice that several others seemed to have a bewildered look on their face as well. Bottom line: ""Stalker"" is bound to remain a cult classic, and I encourage you to seek it out and draw your own conclusion.",Stalker

You know the ones: come up in every conversation, is on every ""must see"" list, is referenced and quoted in every essay. It's also very good and very deserving of its attention. Tarkovsky's Stalker is the mapping of a labyrinth without walls. In a sort of Wizard of Oz style approach, Tarkovsky cuts between high contrast sepia and muddled green vegetation. The space in which this movie takes place is marked by water, fluidity, transition, rot, decay, and urban decay factors such as trash, abandoned guns, and hypodermic needles. The result is a mental, psychological space which is explored by a working man (the Stalker of the title), a writer, and a scientist, all to mostly open-ended and contemplative effect, though Tarkovsky does tack on an extra twenty minutes or so where he restates his themes, adds a confession, and then shows a bit of telekinetics, all of which I found to be entirely unnecessary, especially after the richness of the previous two and a half hours.

33,ackstasis,"""The Zone wants to be respected. Otherwise it will punish.""",8,26 May 2007,"Like a solemn and reflective piece of poetry, Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' moves forward slowly. Though loosely based on an undeniable straight science-fiction novel, 'Roadside Picnic' by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, the film is less concerned with science than it is with pondering the philosophical and metaphysical notions of personal faith and desire. 'Stalker' was released in 1979 after a trouble-plagued production, during which vast portions of the film had to be re-shot due to errors during negative development, and amidst crumbling relations with the original cinematographer, Georgi Rerberg.Most of the film takes place in a wilderness area cordoned off by the government, known as ""The Zone."" Strictly guarded by armed soldiers who fear to enter it, The Zone is believed to have been the site of a meteor strike, a nuclear accident or even a UFO landing (as in the original novel). One man, known as Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), living in a grey and dreary town on the outskirts of The Zone, makes a living out of leading men into the perilous heart of the area, specifically to a room with the alleged ability to grant a man's most innermost desires.On this occasion, against the wishes of his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), Stalker accompanies two men into The Zone, respectively known as Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn)  a skeptical author looking for inspiration  and Professor (Nikolai Grinko)  a man of science with ambiguous motives. Once they have bypassed the armed security on the outskirts of the area, Stalker informs his clients that they are to obey his every command if the three of them are to avoid the unspeakable perils of The Zone. These dangers do not appear immediately obvious, with the vast surrounding landscape seemingly peaceful and serene, with the quiet calls of birds and insects occasionally pierced by the distant howl of a wolf or dog. Indeed, it is here that Stalker appears to find complete and utter solace, stretching himself amongst the thickly-scented vegetation to absorb the sights, sounds and smells of the only place that makes him feel human.Writer is initially quite skeptical of the so-called dangers of The Zone, but Stalker's passionate pleas for cooperation eventually convince him to do as he is told. The characters make their journey to The Room slowly, sometimes infuriatingly so, but there is always an underlying sense of peril with every tentative step that they take. Out of a seemingly peaceful and benign environment, Tarkovsky has inspired foreboding. The slow and deliberate pacing of the film most certainly plays a part in this. Tarkovsky's characteristically long takes, coupled with the slow and subtle movement of the camera, successfully create a dream world, a perspective of the story that appears far removed from reality. The trio's journey towards The Room is not so much a journey into the heart of the forest, but a journey into the very depths of the human mind.Softly shot in a sort of dreary metallic sepia, 'Stalker' is a surprisingly beautiful film to look at. Through his extended takes  some as long as six minutes in length  Tarkovsky leaves every image on screen long enough, not just for us to notice it, but for its beauty to inspire, to inhabit us. Tarkovsky notably despised the use of quick cuts or montage to achieve artificial dramatic peaks, and, at 163 minutes, 'Stalker' is not the most accessible of films. Admittedly, I did catch myself sneaking a glance at my clock on a couple of occasions, but, once we reached that breathtaking conclusion, I couldn't help but think that the entire journey was very much worthwhile.",Stalker
34,mjneu59,"a cinematic endurance test, but worth the effort",9,4 January 2011,"The late Andrei Tarkovsky was sometimes called a poet of the cinema, which usually means his films are beautiful to look at but difficult to understand, and this striking pseudo-sci fi allegory is no exception. In a world without hope a mysterious region appears--simply called The Zone--where conventional laws of physics cease to function. With the help of a privileged guide (called a Stalker), two men, one a disenchanted writer and the other a scientist, gain illegal entry into The Zone in search of a fabled room where the heart's deepest desires are said to come true. The film demands complete attention but doesn't make it very easy: like every Tarkovsky feature it's complex and cerebral and moves at a snail's pace. The journey into The Zone is a test of faith and doubt for its three visitors and often a test of patience for theater audiences, but if you're able to have your imagination engaged without the crutch of high-tech special effects it can be a provocative experience.",Stalker
35,henry8-3,Stalker,5,13 September 2020,"In a dark barren future somewhere, 2 men - a writer and a physicist need to get across the Zone, a secret, securely guarded barren wasteland to get to the Room, where apparently your greatest wishes can be fulfilled. Taking them there is one of only a few stalkers who know how to cross the Zone safely.I has waited to see this apparent masterpiece of Tarkovsky's for years. Opinion on this varied from an existential masterpiece to a long bore (it does run for 160 mins) and I have to say I found it somewhere between the 2. The bleak land created by Tarkofsky is extraordinary to look at and the 3 men, all grubby and arguing about life's purpose are never boring. It is however not the easiest film to follow and there are immense passages of dialogue that possibly take longer than your average Joe has within the running time of this 'masterpiece' like myself to truly understand. I went into this never expecting a straight sci fi story, if indeed this qualifies as Sci Fi, and it was pretty much what I was expecting - so glad I've finally seen it, but I doubt I'll try and watch it again. I'm probably just not bright enough for this stuff.",Stalker
36,iquine,Cerebral Adventure,7,19 May 2017,"(Flash Review)This film was visually bold and cognitively deep and one of those films open to each user's interpretations to some degree. Lots of great long cutsmany up to 4min in length. Several poetic slow camera movements that tend to abstract the natural world giving the user ample time to think and ponder. The core plot is in a world lacking nature and under heavy authoritative control there is a place called The Zone that has some mystical aura about it as well as an extra special location. However, that land area is fenced off to everyone. There is a man known as the Stalker who can take brave people into The Zone who are in search of various things. Some people go for hope, science or to better understand their purpose. There are some religious symbolisms mixed in and one adventurer has to overcome many of his fears in search of this special location. Even the experienced Stalker is impacted during the voyage. There are many philosophical soliloquies, unusual spaces and places and at a lofty 2:45 runtime, ample time to soak it all in.",Stalker
37,barnabyrudge,"Fascinating, elliptical masterpiece which replays and resonates in the mind long after it has finished.",10,4 March 2007,"Taking its inspiration from an Eastern bloc sci-fi novel entitled The Roadside Picnic by Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky, ""Stalker"" is a film that literally typifies Andrei Tarkovsky's approach to film-making. Mysterious, personal, elliptical, beautiful, philosophical, disturbing, inspiring  all at the same time. But there are two factors above all others that make this film truly a work of genius. Firstly, if Tarkovsky ever intended the audience to glean one specific interpretation of his film he never shows his cards, thereby inviting every individual viewer to undergo an experience vastly different than the person sitting next to them. Secondly, ""Stalker"" is one of those rare films that replays and resonates in your mind long after it has finished. You may be driving along months after you last saw it, and an image or idea from the film might suddenly pop into your mind. You may be running a bath one morning and for no obvious reason find your musing about one of the many mysteries generated in the film.In a small, unspecified country, there exists a Zone where the laws of science and logic cease to hold true. The Zone was formed following a meteorite strike (or possibly a celestial visitation). Now, the border of the Zone is continually patrolled by armed guards with instructions to prevent anyone from entering. And there are plenty of people who WOULD like to enter, for rumours abound that at the centre of the Zone lies a Room where innermost wishes can be granted. Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky) makes a living by smuggling people into the Zone and guiding them through its hazardous landscape to the Room. His wife (Alisa Frejndlikh) has grown to detest his frequent absences on such dangerous jobs, more so because while he is away she must tend to their daughter Monkey (Natasha Abramova), physically disabled yet in possession of telekinetic powers due to her father's exposure to the Zone. Stalker finds himself taking two new ""customers"" into the Zone  Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), who wishes to find fresh inspiration, and Professor (Nikolai Grinko), who claims to be fascinated by the scientific mysteries within the Zone, but is in fact on a secret mission to blow it up in order to prevent the potential for an evil person to have their darkest wishes granted at the Room.Tarkovsky presents the outer world as an impoverished, litter-strewn dump, shot in endlessly dull sepia colours, while the scenes based in the Zone are filmed in striking colour to emphasis the lush greenery. But he also makes the Zone seem permanently dangerous, with Kajdanovsky uttering cryptic warnings about its ever-changing pathways and wearing furtive, fearful expressions upon his face all the time they are there. By having his camera more often than not positioned at some distance from the characters, Tarkovsky makes the audience feel like spies and this in turn creates paranoid suspense, as if the three main characters are continually being watched by some unknown force. In the film's stunning climax, Stalker assumes messianic characteristics - he breaks down in tears and laments the fact that nobody he has taken to the Room has fulfilled their dreams. ""Nobody believes. Nobody! Who am I going to take there? Oh, God And what's most awful is that no-one needs it. No-one needs that room, and all my efforts are just in vain"". Like Jesus, Stalker is trying to convince people that they MUST have faith. Tarkovsky's shattering conclusion is that he cannot win in the face of a cynical society, but the one redeeming fact is that his daughter's amazing powers may give her strength to succeed where her father has not. This is challenging, essential cinema.",Stalker
38,Cristi_Ciopron,The Widest and Most Substantial and Coherent Movie Ever;Stalker is so authentic that it's _perplexingly vexatious to the unprepared mind,10,29 March 2008,"AT's Stalker might be the best movie ever; anyway, it certainly is the movie that I respect the most. On the other hand, most of what I have read about it was sheer nonsense, mere junk. His detractors might as well have said that they simply don't like cinema; all the rest is redundant.I don't give crap about why was Stalker received with so much obtuse animosity and illwill and sarcasm by the extremely vast majority of the western public. The causes may be everso many; but they are also wholly indifferent. Now my small ""Stalker history""Stalker had on me, when I was 18, the same effect that ""Kane"" had had the previous yearwhen I was 17I found them revoltingly and even unpleasantly and confusingly shocking and vexatious. I understood nothing; I was almost enraged and perplexed. I felt highly indignant at them. I was too uneducated, too unprepared. The second time that I've seen each of the two films was better (and even much better with ""Kane""seen for a second time when I was 27, and so much better prepared and oriented and apt). The third time was the best; now, this did become a standard of value, a test for the movies. The slow delving; I'm a slow delver. This is a very trustworthy test for the films. The shock that ""Stalker"" gave me on the first seeing was the confusing shock of the biggerthanlife, not the conventional delightful shock gave by the serial products; rather it was the shock of the unknown. A sort of a perplexing shockthe shock of the unknown and of the compact reality not yet understood. Like a brink, like a jump, like an edge, and then after so many years when I saw these films again I was now ready and I've found them full to the brim. (A third, still very different example might be ""Vertigo""first I've admired it wronglyfor phony and unreal qualities; then I disliked it; then I disliked it even more""what a phony morbid decadent crimemovie!""; then I was as struck by its manifest beauty and truth.)Tarkovsky had, outside the sets, many interesting things to say; he was a cultivated and intelligent and perspicacious man and he moved through his life like a giant being. Nothing phony or extravagant with himeven to the point that this mere absence of defects becomes perceptible in him like a merit and like a sign of quality. His best film have infinite depth. Nothing in Tarkovsky, on the other hand, reminds the showman (as with the restwith Welles, Fellini, Mikhalkov, etc.), the entertainer; he was a thinker, and a lonely artist.His human quality was of the finest. Tarkovsky brought the best. ""Stalker"" is not a film a frond, but of thought and of a fore-feeling of the subtlest things. It is not SF; Creature from the Black Lagoon, Revenge of the Creature and The Creature Walks Among Us and the other '50s classics are; but Stalker isn't.",Stalker

It's extremely slow movie, but it never gets boring. The only thing which kind of ruins it a little bit is that Woman's philosophy at the end, it's kind of recap in short, explanation of sort, I find it quite lame, I disagree with what she said.

41,I_Ailurophile,Fantastically beautiful and ruthlessly dense art film,8,12 August 2021,"From the earliest moments the film is immediately arresting. The sepia tone that colors no small part of the feature inherently makes it weirdly haunting, even before anything meaningfully happens. That quality alone inculcates a dual notion that the picture is both very real, and very artificial. And the music of composer Eduard Artemyev is just as quickly captivating: He employs a combination of ambient synthesizer tones and traditional instruments - woodwinds and the like - that lends to that same atmosphere built by the hues infused throughout. That much of the sound in 'Stalker' is also a creation of Artemyev's whimsy only endears the film to us ever more.Even without the muted grey-brown tinge to the picture, every scene feels painstakingly shot and arranged, especially as many shots linger over long takes. One could be forgiven for thinking that every puddle, streetlight, dollop of mud, or piece of debris was purposefully laid out with precise intention. The camerawork is meticulous, deliberate, and altogether phenomenal. 'Stalker' is eye-catching to the point of being weirdly beautiful, in shots of characters, objects, scenery - every last detail being captured. Whether one is considering filming locations, set design, or production design broadly - any level or aspect of film-making - the movie is deeply entrancing, in every passing moment. There are precious few movies that are so utterly compelling just by the nature of their craft. Let there be no mistake: This is an art film, in the purest sense of the term.Examining content is more thorny, as like any true blood art film, the loose narrative is only a pretense for the meaning one derives from the experience. And the meaning one extracts could well vary even by how actively one is engaged with the feature. 'Stalker' is a dense, twisted knot about desire, and purpose; the difficulty of achieving or even knowing either, and the perceived value of doing so. One may read into it an exploration of how we all carry aspects that are contradictory - faith and knowledge, mystery and resolve, desolation and hope, will and confusion - but which are part of one another, and reliant on one another. It may be interpreted to impart that dreams exist hand in hand with uncertainty and belief, and may be dashed by confidence and skepticism. Or perhaps in a broader sense, the movie is a reflection of how introspection and personal pursuits are often placed off limits to us by the constraints of our circumstances in the world, yet to engage with ourselves is an escape, a journey, that will bear fruit of one kind or another no matter how it turns out.Maybe this is all true. Maybe none of it is. The joy and difficulty of features like this is that, especially when they're so expertly made, what we get from it depends entirely on us, individually. This much is beyond question: If you approach 'Stalker' anticipating a clear-cut sci-fi flick, with obvious peril and conflict, you will be sorely disappointed. The premise (...and production history), of an expedition into a dangerous place, belies a plot that is only the rudimentary structure upon which are laid boundless marvels for our eyes, and within which is spread a great feast for our minds. And just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and we all have different preferences when it comes to food, the worth of this picture is very subjective.For my part, I very much enjoyed 'Stalker,' but I also completely recognize that to truly reckon with it would require more than one viewing. Art films aren't always easy, and they definitely aren't intended to be; I admit I was perhaps unprepared for just what I was getting into. None of this makes it any less outstanding, or deserving. It's a decisively niche audience that will most appreciate 'Stalker,' but if you're receptive to an obtuse feature, a visual wonderland, or a buffet of ideas to take up as one will, then this is a must-see.",Stalker
42,truemythmedia,A Masterpiece,10,17 July 2019,"On its surface, stalker is a very simple story. A Writer, Professor and a guide, called a Stalker, journey to the center of a mysterious and alien 'Zone' which contains a room that grants people their desires.Entering the zone is restricted so they have to sneak in and the zone is large and confusing so it takes quite some time to arrive at the room. The bulk of the film is the characters walking together, talking, arguing, and debating the meaning of life, the existence of God, and what their desires and fears are.In a way, there really isn't much for me to say about the film except that, but in another way, I feel as if I have told you not even 1/100th of what is in this film, it is so complex and lovely.Tarkovsky is one of those directors whose works are many times not really about the plot as much as the characters and their conversations. Some directors see themselves as a guide on a road leading their audience to a destination town, a 'take away' message or thought or moral.Tarkovsky isn't like this. Instead, he invites the audience into a forest with no path and wanders around, looking at various trees and flora, in the form of characters and thoughts. He doesn't intend you to take the forest with you when you leave. He intends you to return to it over and over again to view again those thought you had, those ideas you had engaged with, and revisit them.It is this quality that make Tarkovsky a favorite amongst cinephiles. There are no easy answers. There are endless alleys of trees and tufts of exotic grasses to intrigue the mind but no mythical elf will hop out from behind a tree and tell you how to master the forest. There is no mastering it, only living in it.",Stalker
43,davidmvining,Faith against Silence,10,11 October 2021,"There's something about science fiction that really tries to mess with the audience's head that I really appreciate. These are stories that really try to create something different, something removed from our own experiences, that challenge some basic concept of perception. Part of doing that, I long ago figured, was tying these kinds of perception bending experiences with larger questions. You can imply the broken realities, but they also need to be tied to something else to give it greater heft. It should surprise no one that when Andrei Tarkovsky decided to very loosely adapt Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Stugarsky, making his second science fiction film after Solaris, that he would use it as a vehicle to pursue other questions that were important to him.Tarkovsky made slow movies. Let's just put it out there. His movies are not paced like a modern blockbuster. They are steady and contemplative, using long shots (often over four minutes long) that allow characters to move around in a space and behave in quiet and introspective ways. The film has, really, only four characters across its entire two-hour and forty-minute runtime, and that focus allows for real clarity around its characters, setting, and ideas. I know that Tarkovsky isn't for everyone, but for those who can take this sort of slow pace, Stalker represents a treasure of a film, a pinnacle of filmmaking from one of cinema's greatest.At some point in the future, a meteorite fell to earth in a remote town. People disappeared, rumors began circulating, and the authorities fenced off the entire area calling it the Zone. There are stories of a special room in the Zone that will grant wishes to anyone who goes inside. Arising to meet the demand for passage to the room through the military guard are stalkers, independent guides into the Zone.The story is about one stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky) leading two tourists inside. The Professor (Nikolai Grinko) is a physicist, practical and even headed. The Writer (Anatoly Solonitsyn) is a deeply cynical nihilist who doesn't even believe his own writing is worth anything. The Stalker has an incredibly dangerous job, getting people into the Zone, and he's just gotten out of prison for five years after being caught on a previous venture. His wife (Alisa Freindlich) berates him heavily before he heads out to meet his two charges, breaking down because she knows that she and their daughter (Monkey, played by Natasha Abramova) won't be able to survive if he goes away again.Out of everything that Tarkovsky made in the Soviet Union, Stalker is the most obviously religious film he directed. He struggled to include religion in his films as it was largely against the law under Soviet rule. He started Andrei Rublev before the end of the Cultural Thaw, but Solaris and Mirror were both wiped clean of any religious overtones to avoid legal issues. Working in science fiction, apparently, offered him greater freedom, so when he chose to adapt the novel he had obviously religious undertones in mind. It's kind of hard to miss. Stalker spends the movie with a white strip of cloth around his neck that is similar to a priest's Roman collar. There's much more explicit talk of God and faith. Even the writer, near the end of the journey, puts on a crown of thorns, says he's Jesus Christ, and refuses absolution for Stalker. So, what is the point?The journey into the Zone and to the room is a desperately dangerous one, but only by implication. Stalker creates a handful of markers, heavy metal bolts tied with white bandages, that he throws ahead of them to ensure that the path is safe. At no point is danger ever directly invited upon the party, though, as they march through first the fields and then the dark, dirty, and wet corridors leading to the room. All the followers have is Stalker's word that something bad will happen if they go off the path. There are moments that push and pull them into and out of belief of Stalker's warnings, like when the Writer decides to not go the long way but the short way across a field, and he suddenly stops because a voice commands it. No one knows where the voice came from, but they all heard it. Another time, the Professor falls behind and Stalker insists that you cannot go back the same way you came. They have to leave him behind, and then they just happen across him eating with a small fire made to keep him warm.It's amazing how much Tarkovsky can make out of so little. The feeling of dread steadily builds as the quiet of the Zone, the Stalker's warnings, and the overall sense of unease settles into the audience's subconscious. The height of this is when Stalker sends the Writer through the Meat Grinder, a dirty curved tunnel that leads to the Room. There's nothing but the dark corridor, lit by daylight from above in small squares that open up to the sky along the ceiling, and the feeling that there's something just out of sight. The Writer walks past the curve, and Stalker and the Professor run to catch up until they can see him again. This impending sense of fear is so complete and so effective, and it's literally one man walking down a tunnel.One of the main points of the film's steady pace is the focus it provides on its characters, and the central idea for these characters on this journey is what do they actually desire? The Room, it is agreed upon, does not grant explicit wishes like a genie from a lamp. Instead, it looks into the soul of the person and grants that which they want most. If the person says they want to live like a vegetarian, but their subconscious says that they want steak, then what does the room actually offer? Can they know what they actually want? And why does the Stalker refuse to ever enter the Room himself? Stalker tells the story of another stalker, Porcupine, who did enter the Room after sacrificing his younger brother in the Meat Grinder, and when he returned to the world he became fabulously wealthy, killing himself a week later. What did he really want? The Room could have provided him his brother back, but instead it showed that at his core he was actually a selfish man? Who comes to this place and leaves actually happy?The Physicist has a secret, though. He hasn't come to ask of anything from the Room. He's come to end it, and the confrontation right in front of the Room, as the three tussle against each other and question each other's motives, especially Stalker's.How is this explicitly Christian and religious? How is it not? Stalker is a priest, trying to guide the potentially faithful through life amid a series of unseen traps to heaven where they will get everything they ever desired. How can a priest lead like that, though? Through persuasion and parable. He must guide through invisible dangers to the soul, forcing the followers to investigate their own souls and desires before they can enter the Room, enter Heaven.There's a danger in using metaphor because it becomes about the symbols rather than the story itself, and here's where the delicate balancing act of Tarkovsky's talent with cinema really shines through. We have characters without names, and yet they extend far beyond just their mere symbolic natures. They feel like real people with real concerns going into a real place. On top of that, the actual filmmaking is impeccable. The movie looks gorgeous even in the dirtiest of manufacturing wastelands. The tension he can build in the smallest of moments is incredible. The performances are raw and believable as three men get torn down to their cores. The surface itself is compelling on its own, but the subtext is so rich that its easy to get lost in it at the same time.Another thing: This movie was irresponsibly made. I mean, this probably shouldn't have been made at all. Filming near Tallinn, Eastonia, the place was a chemical and radioactive death trap. There are shots where actors go up to their necks in water obviously filled with chemical waste. Tarkovsky, Solonitsyn, and several crew members all died of cancer within a decade of filming. As much as I love the film, it honestly shouldn't have been made. Imagine a world where Tarkovsky had another twenty years to make movies, going back to Russia after the fall of the Berlin Wall. That's an alternate timeline I'd love to see.That being said, even though Tarkovsky went to this toxic environment, the results (which he apparently filmed three times with a couple of different cinematographers for a few reasons including the Soviet labs not knowing how to treat new Kodak film stock) are often very beautiful to look at. From the deep greens of the exterior of the Zone to the dark and dank interiors, Tarkovsky films everything with a studied eye that brings in detail from all over, using vibrant colors to contrast with the sickly sepia of the look outside the Zone. There's a careful approach to the visuals, as in any film Tarkovsky made, that really helps to propel the story forward in subtle ways.There's something that cuts deeply and quietly about Stalker. Investing in the steady journey towards the Room ends up being incredibly rewarding intellectually and emotionally. It's a subtle and affecting film, that honestly never should have been made. However, since it was made, I do love it.",Stalker
44,Amyth47,Artistic-Humanistic-Poetic (but it's not Sci-Fi),9,26 August 2018,"My Rating : 9/10The dialogues and cinematography are hypnotic. It is a massive achievement for Tarkovsky to have made such a pure film - it's minimalistic and very philosophical in nature. This film is very similar to spending a couple of hours with some good friends.For those wanting to gain a deeper understanding of 'Stalker' -For Tarkovsky, 'the Zone' symbolises nothing - he wanted the audience to feel as though the Zone is 'around' them - it is everywhere - it represents merely a test of man's self-respect and his inner capacity for love. The Stalker in the film talks about another Stalker Diko-óbraz (Porcupine) who went to the secret place to ask for his brother's life who had been killed through his mistake however due to his inner greed he instead was given wealth (the secret place grants only your most heartfelt desire and not the wish that he had wanted to convince himself was most precious to him). And then Diko-óbraz hangs himself as he couldn't live with the guilt.The writer and professor reassessed themselves at this juncture and don't have the moral courage to step into the room because they have realised they are imperfect and hence horrified - they lack the spiritual self-respect to believe in themselves.In the end everything can be reduced to the one simple element which is all a person can count upon in his existence: the capacity to love (as seen through the Stalker's wife- in the end it is simply a woman who startles the Writer by her faithfulness and by the strength of her human dignity). That element can grow within the soul to become the supreme factor which determines the meaning of a person's life.I love Tarkovsky as an artist and filmmaker because he was interested in the 'realness' of his art - not fancy rockets and space stations in Solaris or the fantasy of Stalker's plot.A rare film.",Stalker
45,framptonhollis,a grand existentialist epic,9,23 September 2017,"I have just come home from a screening of ""Stalker""'s glorious restoration. Believe it or not, it was a sold out, packed house! Such a gathering of film buffs may seem like it'd reek of hipster, but, in fact, it really reeked of something much more pleasant, it was a gathering of intelligent individuals who set their differences and feelings and lives briefly aside to escape this cruel world and enter into the even-more-cruel world of the great Andrei Tarkovsky.Arguably his most famous and beloved work, ""Stalker"" appears to have the size and scope of an epic, but when one really ponders its actual contents, they will realize that if anything this is a work of minimalism. ""A minimalist epic"" may be the best way to describe the staggering masterpiece. It's a long journey the viewer must take, but it is not only worthwhile, but extremely addictive and engaging. I hesitate to use the word entertaining, but ""Stalker"" may just deserve that label. It certainly isn't ""entertaining"" in the traditional sense, but there is not a moment of this film that is ""boring"". It is very slow; there are long takes and depressing monologues and philosophical ponderings and poems read in a soft, sad V.O. narration...but I never once felt like it was too much. This film is but inches away from being totally flawless. Even within its brooding walls of existentialist pain and heavy tension are moments of wit and humor as well as visuals that are jaw dropping no matter how simplistic. There are moments that recall the best of Kubrick, Bergman, Lynch, and other cine- masterminds. The cold, dark heart of Russian cinema can only be penetrated by patience, but once this patience has settled in completely the viewer will likely be stimulated in such a way that is nearly unmatched by anything they've seen before or ever will see again.

47,lemon_magic,A somber masterpiece,8,20 July 2018,"I have a weird relationship with this movie. The first time I noticed it in a Blockbuster in 1985, the cover art and the description of the plot drew me in. But the VHS copy was really smeared and muddy, and in spite of the shocks and thrills promised on the box, NOTHING HAPPENED, and KEPT not happening for more than two hours, and I was at a point in my life where I had limited attention to give to movies like this. I don't remember even finishing the movie. But somehow, the movie haunted me. I found myself thinking about it now and then for many years after that (even though I could barely remember anything about it). And after a decade, I started looking around to see if I could see it again to reassess it. But watchable copies of ""Stalker"" eluded me (or cost at least $100), and the version I found on YouTube wasn't subtitled. And then one day while sitting on a plane waiting to take off, the in-flight entertainment display on the panel in front of me showed ""Stalker"" on the DirectTV feature, and I managed to catch about 15 minutes of it before the plane took off and I lost the feed (I wasn't a member of the airline's ""members program"", so I couldn't just pony up the fee to watch it). Encouraged that it was still out there somewhere, I looked for it later on Amazon Prime and found out I could actually purchase a copy for less than $20. So I did, and watched it before bed over the course of 3 nights (it's still quite long at 2 hours and 40 minutes). Wow. Nothing STILL happens except for a scuffle 50 minutes from the end and an eerie 2 minute finish that puts an amazing spin on the non-events of the past hours. No one's face gets melted, no one dies screaming in a Zone trap, no special effects at all (except for in the final minute). The screenplay is all discussion and exposition and character revelation. But...wow. The cinematography, art direction, sound design, sound track, the performances of the three main actors, the long tracking shots of water and nature and debris and rusted metal and abandoned war machinery....it's all amazing. Rarely have I seen such a mood of gloom, despair, bleak hope, and gallows humor sustained so well for so long. And the final speech by the Stalker's wife at the end somehow redeems everything, and the final twist (which I won't reveal) will somehow put everything than came before in a new light.I won't say that you owe it to yourself to see ""Stalker"".

48,valadas,Not my favourite kind of sci-fi movie,5,16 August 2015,"This movie is classified by the generality of critics as a masterpiece. I won't argue against this. A masterpiece must it surely be. Simply it is not my kind of sci-fi movie. My kind of sci-fi movie must have creativity and imagination in what concerns action and plot which this one hasn't got. It is something more like a philosophical or moral sci-fi movie taking place in gloomy and ugly sceneries and developing itself in endless dialogues, conversations and monologues. It has to do with the meaning of life and the moral human behaviour. The story is rather simple: a stalker who is a man that can enter an alien forbidden Zone guides hopeless people into a Chamber where they can have their wishes fulfilled. If it were not for the existence of the alien zone on an imaginary country this could hardly be classified as a sci-fi movie.",Stalker
49,Takethispunch,Good film whether sci fiction or nah,10,18 December 2016,"The ""Stalker"" (Alexander Kaidanovsky) works in some unclear area in the indefinite future as a guide who leads people through the ""Zone"", a vicinity in which the normal laws of reality no longer fully apply. The Zone contains a place called the ""Room"", said to grant the wishes of anyone who steps inside. The area containing the Zone is sealed off by the government and great hazards exist within it. At home with his wife and daughter, the Stalker's wife (Alisa Freindlich) begs him not to go into the Zone but he ignores her pleas. In a rundown bar, the Stalker meets his next clients for a trip into the Zone. The ""Writer"" (Anatoly Solonitsyn) and the ""Professor"" (Nikolai Grinko) agree to put their fates into the hands of the Stalker.

50,frankde-jong,"""Apocalypse now"" the metaphysical way",8,4 December 2020,"Andrei Tarkovsky is one of the most prominent Russian directors ever and certainly the most prominent director of the Brezhnev era. His films are not easily accessible, and certainly not in the socialist realist style the Communist party liked to see. It is therefore no wonder that Tarkovsky was an odd man under the Soviet directors (with the possible exception of Sergei Parajanov).Some people have tried to interpret the films of Tarkovsky, including Stalker, in a political way. This may be possible, but in my opinion his films are in the first place metaphysical, about human nature in general and not about humans under a specific political system. In my opinion this is also the explanation for the fact that the conflict between Tarkovsky and the government of the Soviet Union remained latent. Tarkovsky was not openly regarded as a dissident and he was allowed to work outside the Soviet Union.In ""Stalker"" a writer and a professor visit together with a guide (a stalker) ""the zone"". In ""the zone"" normal laws do not apply because of remnants of extraterrestrial activity (although the film is rather vague about the reason). At the heart of ""the zone"" lies ""a room"" that fullfils the deepest wishes of everybody entering.Also in other films there is sometimes competition between nature and humans, at least the characters in those films experience this as such. I had to think about ""White Hell of Pitz Palu"" (1929, Arnold Fanck & Georg Wilhelm Pabst), in which the mountain resisted being climbed by mountaineers. This sounds like ""the zone"" who can punish his visitors. However in ""Stalker"" the relation nature - human being is a bit different than described above. Nature not so much reacts to the human being but reflects its inner consciousness (the deepest wishes and ""the room""). This reflection on consciousness is seen in more Tarkovsky movies, who detested the growing materialism in society.In some fairy tales the main character may make a couple of wishes and, frivolously, makes the wrong wishes. In this respect ""Stalker"" is much darker. The main characters are not frivolous at all, they are afraid what their deepest wishes may be and they are thus afraid of their own core nature.""The zone"" is known for his supernatural character, but the only supernatural phenomenon that is shown in the film is outside ""the zone"", when (towards the end of the film) the young daughter of the stalker seems to posses of psychokinetic forces. Maybe to illustrate that (as said earlier in the film): ""When a man is born, he is soft and pliable. When he dies, he is strong and hard."".Sometimes ""Stalker"" is compared to ""Apocalypse now"" (1979, Francis Ford Coppola). Both films were released in the same year and are about a journey to the heart of an unknown territory. Although ""Apocalypse now"" contains much more action, ""Stalker"" is in my opinion more convincing. It also contains a couple of beautiful scenes.The decayed cafe where the stalker meets his clients reminds of the style of Bela Tarr.
Passing the military who are guarding the border of ""the zone"" is a relatively thrilling scene for a Tarkovsky movie.
Travelling inside ""the zone"" with a railway lorry is a monotonous but hypnotic scene.
In the neigboorhood of ""the room"" it suddenly starts to rain inside a building. This scene is just as incomprehensible as it is melancholy.
The difficulties by the production of ""Apocalypse now"" are widely known. I just have to mention the heart attack of main actor Martin Sheen. Also in this respect the two films are comparable. ""Stalker"" was shot in Estonia at two deserted hydro power plants at the Jägala river. In the neighborhood was a chemical plant discharging his waste on the same river. In the years following the film some members of the crew (among which director Tarkovsky himself) died at a relatively young age from cancer.",Stalker
51,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good,8,18 September 2008,"Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker (Сталкер) is not the great nor masterful film its most ardent critical supporters proclaim, nor is it the slow, boring Eurotrash that its most vocal critics counterclaim. It lies somewhere in between- a film that risks and occasionally fails, although it is far closer to greatness than trash. That's because Tarkovsky has crafted a film of unusual visuals with even more unusual power. There are scenes that recall the old telefilm The Lathe Of Heaven, released the same year as this film, 1979; Carl Theodor Dreyer's great Vampyr, in its use of shadows and fog; the 1976 sci fi classic Logan's Run, in that the three leads of the film are running away from their society; Tarkovsky's earlier Solaris, in its mix of color and sepia images; and, most of all, with Alex Proyas' 1998 sci fi classic Dark City, which, like Stalker, creates a wholly believable alternate world unlike any other put on screen. Visually, Stalker most reminds me of the human portraits of the great Austrian painter Egon Schiele, with its myriad of gaunt, pallid, balding, dirty, twisted characters.But, as in most Tarkovsky films, it is not the visuals that dominate, rather the philosophic depth of the characters. What they don't say or dream is almost always as important as what they do say and dream. Stalker succeeds because its ellipses are more brilliant than its fodder. Stalker misses greatness, however, because its fodder some times fails . Of course, there are the usual misreadings by critics, who praise the very things that do not work- like the ending, or imbue their own interpretations of Stalker as a Christ-like figure (his being a religious character makes him no stand-in for a religious figure), when the film is surprisingly shorn of any religious mumbo jumbo (humanist philosophy and religion are not analogues), and the three lead characters are in no way merely symbols- of Christian Wise Men, the Trinity, nor any tripartite invocation. Do they bear some symbolism? Of course, since they are known only by their professions. But, each is a unique character, not a caricaturization. Thus, Stalker achieves a rare intimacy in film, one absent from most films, Hollywood or foreign, and if not a great film, certainly it is an excellent film, and one of the most unique visions committed to screen. See for yourself how even failure can fail better than most.",Stalker
52,mstomaso,Lovely String of Soliloques in Which the Film's Subject is Actually Irrelevant,7,18 May 2008,"Stalker, like most of Tarkovsky's work, is almost unsurpassed in visual quality and sensory aesthetics. Also in-keeping with the great director's tradition, the film features a lot of philosophical discourses delivered in sombre, almost depressingly serious tones, and exploits ambiguity very well.Stalker develops a cyberpunk atmosphere but is much more than the standard cyberpunk adventure. A Stalker is a person who can find the path into the Zone and is able to bring people back from it. The Zone is a forbidden place from which most people never return. It is rumored to grant those who can reach it their most profound desire. Most of the film takes place en route to the Zone, detailing the journey of three men - a science professor, a writer, and our stalker. The acting is superb.Every scene is a work of art and the minimalist soundscape and very heavy dialog complement the visuals very well. The film's setting is a major component of its themes. The setting was inspired by an abandoned town which suffered a nuclear accident in the 1950s, and it seems likely that the film was actually made in that same location. Tarkovsky makes a point in this film, and unlike many art films, the point is really not very open to interpretation. It is also a little surprising given the content of most of the film. No spoiler - so I won't tell you what it is. Despite the fact that I recommend Stalker very highly for thoughtful viewers with good attention spans, I can not recommend it to the average film watcher - it can be tedious and confounding to those used to films which do not challenge the intellect.",Stalker
53,Snootz,One of the finest sci-fi art films of all time,9,4 December 2018,"Stalker is cerebral scifi. If you're not in to that, you probably won't like it. If one is an action junkie, this is definitely not your cup of tea; it is one of the slowest-moving films I've ever seen. The high points of this film are 10-minute monologues. The crux of the film comes in examining the personalities and reasoning of the characters.The concept of the plot: what if you could have your greatest desire handed to you on a platter... but you aren't sure what your greatest desire is? That's the premise of Stalker. Are you brave enough to face your true self, your deepest emotions-- so deep that you may be unaware of them?This is not a film to base on the first 20 minutes and then switch because you're bored. To absorb this masterpiece one has to be willing to sit through the entire film, listening to every word said, watching every nuance presented. Add a rather unique and unexpected ending, and we have all the makings of an art film that's well worth the time.CGI? None. Action /adventure? None? Sex, nudity, gratuitous language, blood gore? Won't find it here. What is found is superb writing, directing and acting in a film that stands unique not only in the genre of scifi, but in movies as a whole.I give it 9 stars rather than 10 because of one reason: it does start out very slowly, perhaps too much so. But if one hangs in through the slow start, then continues to hang in through the continually-slow rolling out of the film, if one endures and pays attention and waits... this film can be quite rewarding.Viewers will either love it or hate it. I'm one that found Stalker to be an uncommonly good film, one that I've watched more than once. I can give a film no higher praise than that.",Stalker
54,hte-trasme,Stalk it,9,28 November 2014,"In Arkadiy and Boris Strugatsky's excellent novel ""Roadside Picnic,"" which was the inspiration for this film, the perilous ""Zone"" where valuable but incomprehensible alien artifacts can be found becomes in affect a character all its own through the obsessive, ominous, and draining effect it has from afar on characters' lives. In this film, the Zone is again a character all its own -- but not from afar. It is constantly, oppressively present, and its effect is such that it seems just as frightful and mesmerizing despite the fact that in the film we are never told exactly why it is dangerous and why it is attractive. For the film media, the the Strugatsky brothers essentially created an entirely new work sharing a couple of key concepts with their novel. It's as much as anything a more formless and still very philosophical meditation on themes of their previous work, and one that (perhaps with the influence of its celebrated director) is acutely aware of the different needs that the film medium has as opposed to prose fiction. There are many people far more qualified than me to speak about just why Andrei Tarkovky's direction and camera work are as effective as they are. But they make this one of the most atmospheric films I havec ever seen. He has a very artful of making our views of things seems artless -- letting his camera remain still and wide for long periods of time so we can't escape the desolation of the landscape or cramped quality of the quarters. Characters move and interact within small spaces on screen, which makes for somehow more intense interaction. ""Intense"" intense is also the word to describe the acting, which rises to highs of drama, that, in contrast to the stillness of their surroundings, only highlight the desperation of the situation. The orchestration of this drama against stretches of stillness and silence is really a masterful handling of suspense. And it allows the moving and thoughtful philosophical discussions that its characters have to be charged with tension the whole while. ""Stalker"" manages to be that rare combination -- a deeply thoughtful mood piece. And it's done with high artistry in every aspect.",Stalker

Stalker follows three men; a guide, a professor, and a writer who traverse the Zone, engaging in many philosophical debaes along the way. Like I said, I won't give my interpretation here. It'll take more thought for me to come up with one anyways. Whatever you think it means and whatever Andrei Tarkovsky's own view was, Stalker is a slow moving beautiful film.

Tarkovsky's signature long-takes slow the movie down, but not enough for it to seem overlong. The film's overriding flaw is the lack of payoff; even with a modestly budgeted dialogue-driven film, Tarkovsky should have found a way for the Zone to live up to what Kaidanovsky's character built it up to be.

62,Imdbidia,Masterpiece,10,6 February 2011,"A Russian film by Andrei Tarkovsky loosely based on the novel Roadsine Picnic by Boris & Arkadi Sturgstky, who also adapted the story for the big screen.The film narrates the trip of a writer, a scientist and their guide -the stalker- to the Zone, an unpopulated abandoned forbidden area where there is a place where one can fulfill his/her most cherished wish.The characters are a writer (i.e. an humanist), a mathematician (i.e. a scientist) and the stalker (a believer), all complementary characters. They are archetypes what human thought basically is, and of the main human approaches and explanations of what life is. It is mostly an inner and initiation trip. In fact, if we were not given the initial captions about the Zone and the extraterrestrial landing, the movie could not be considered a science-fiction one but an experimental philosophical and spiritual one.Stalker and Solaris -also directed by Tarkovsky- share that magical approach to reality and to inexplicable events. In both cases what brings drama to the story is not what is factually happening, but how the characters see reality and the world, and how they project in them their inner fears, thoughts and feelings. In that regard, reality is just a personal projection, something that only exists when perceived in a certain way.The dialogs are brilliant, very philosophical and deep, and they reflect on the nature of science, literature, reality, beliefs and the unknown. They can be overwhelming sometimes, but they are worth the effort of paying attention to them. The silences are also mesmerizing and as relevant to the story as the dialogs, as well as the landscape and interiors where the action happens.Visually speaking, the movie is magnificent. It has that Tartovsky's almost metaphysical approach to Nature and to the woods, which are here presented both as beautifully welcoming and threatening evil. A Jeckil & Hyde of a landscape. The abandoned plant where the movie was shot, and the cinematography of it, provide the viewer with unforgettable surreal alien images. Some of the oniric scenes of the film are also extremely poetic and philosophical. The atmosphere, with changes between full color and sepia tones, the latter associated to a gritty reality deprived of hope and joy, are just masterpieces in themselves, with a masterful use of chiaroscuro, camera angling, and a great detail to decor and ambiance.The opening of the movie is unforgettable. Magnetic in away. The framing, the tones, the placement of the elements, the chiaroscuro, everything is artistic and almost pictorial. A little masterpiece in itself.The cinematography, lighting, use of the camera are superb in the whole movie, and the lush greens of the woods and the eeriness of the abandoned plant are turned into a magic powerful and disturbing world.The acting is terrific by all actors, but especially by Alexander Kaidanovsky as the Stalker, and Alisa Freindlich as his wife. However, the performances of Anatoli Solonitsyn (the Writer) and Nikolai Grinko (the Professor) must be praised, too.Stalker is a movie like no other. A slow-paced trip to the inner soul of their characters as much as an exploration of a forbidden and alien Eden without God. It is also a journey for the viewer, so be prepared and in the right mood before you seat in front of your TV. If you expect aliens, spaceships and other clichés of the genre you will be disappointed.",Stalker
63,asda-man,I'd rather get stalked than sit through this again,2,25 August 2017,"This was my first taste of the film geek's favourite, Andrei Tarkovsky. I knew that it would be slow, but I was hoping for something hypnotic rather than just plain boring but that's exactly what I got. Imagine The Lord of the Rings on no budget at all and replace the fellowship with three miserable Russians and you've got yourself Stalker.Many call it a masterpiece which isn't surprising. Any old foreign film made in the 70's with tortoise-speed pacing is considered a masterpiece to film snobs. No doubt some boring old fart will tell me that there's something intellectually deep about this drivel but life's too short to give a toss.I'll save you the time of watching it, unless you suffer from insomnia, in which case stick this on, it'll do you wonders. A miserable potato-headed Russian leaves his family to take a drunk writer and professor on a trip to a mystical place called ""The Zone"". Don't worry, it sounds far more intriguing than it actually is. It turns out that ""The Zone"" is just a dank field with a misshapen house in the middle of it. The potato-headed Russian keeps telling them how ""The Zone"" is dangerous and ever-changing. No one ever comes out alive etc. etc. but it's quite clear that the only thing mystical about this god-forsaken zone is that the producers could afford colour film stock instead of black and white.They wonder around this field and take many pit-stops to talk about rubbish which no one gives a toss about. At one point the potato-head lies in a puddle and harps on about the philosophical properties of music. You get the idea... I should also point out that it takes a good fifty minutes before they ever get to this zone, so we're treated to the three miserable musketeers evading the police complete with a seemingly never-ending shot of them all travelling on a train track.They bop about in a field, they bop about in a house. It occurred to me that this film could be watched on fast-forward so that's exactly what I did. Please note that I have only ever done this to one other film in my life, a Turkish delight entitled Uzak. If you enjoyed that one, then you might want to give Stalker a go too. I fast-forwarded only to find that absolutely nothing else happened aside from the threesome plodding around an empty house and some tunnels. I was only left with regret for not doing it sooner, realising that it took me 1hr 40mins to do so, although by that point I felt like I'd spent my whole life watching this film.You can call me a close-minded millennial for all you like, I don't care. I have a very eclectic taste in film, it was only yesterday that I watched an old Japanese film entitled Kwaidan which I enjoyed very much. It was the same length as this film, not terribly fast-paced in the slightest but it had a story to tell and was visually entrancing. I'm not one of these people who need quick-cuts and conventional plotting to keep me enthralled. David Lynch is my all-time favourite director and his films are often extremely slow but always absorbing, so don't disregard me as one of those hopeless kids who consider Transformers an artistic masterpiece.After I skipped through Stalker I felt empty. I grabbed myself a beer at three o clock in the afternoon and sighed. There's no denying that the film is powerful, as it drove me to drink. This was my first and last film by Andrei Tarkovsky. A director who makes Ingmar Bergman look like Michael Bay.",Stalker
64,bgar-80932,Overly long and boring,4,19 September 2018,The premise of the film is there's this zone where things are different and dangerous and people don't really go there. In this zone there's a room though that basically grants people's biggest desires. The main character is called a stalker which is basically a guide to get people to the room. He brings a professor and a writer with him for a price to the room. Most of the film is them walking through the zone and philosophizing about life. The dialogue is okay at first but it just grows so boring. I liked the writer and he had interesting thoughts of life. All of them have pretty depressing takes but the writer is kind of funny about it. The whole goal is basically to find happiness but nobody really finds it and nobody he's taken before has really found it. He said he takes people there then never sees them again but basically just assumes they found happiness. My take on it is they didn't. I did like the switching from the yellow tinted film to regular color though but that's one of the few redeeming qualities.

69,Al_The_Strange,Stalker Review,8,25 July 2017,"Next time you take a roadside picnic and throw something away in the grass, take a moment to consider what happens next. Ants will come out to pick up and carry the crumbs away. Birds will peck at seeds and fruits. Maybe some badger will grab a wrapper and get his head stuck in it. Suppose you chuck an alkaline battery away, or a canister of oil? Mere leftovers for us become mysterious and deadly artifacts for lesser creatures.This was the basic premise behind Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's book, Roadside Picnic. What if aliens landed on Earth and left some junk behind? People and governments would surely covet it. It could become a whole new kind of black market. But what effects would such artifacts have on lesser beings like us? 1979's Stalker adopts this premise into a one-of-a-kind vision. From its opening credits onward, the film is seeped in hard, gritty textures and drab colors. In this bleak setting, the nameless Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky, notably bald, scrawny, and kinda alien-looking) takes a job to escort two clients into the Zone--the place where a meteorite crashed and became quarantined by the military. One man is a writer (Anatoly Solonitsyn) looking for inspiration. The other, a professor (Nikolai Grinko) looking for scientific discovery. Despite the heavy guard and the threat of never coming back, the three break through and progress through the Zone. We never see any psychical threats, but the trio always react with fear and anxiety over invisible traps and unseen entities. Passing through dark corridors and ruins, truths are unearthed about each character, which puts their whole endeavor into question and endangers them all.This is a long and mopey film. Gone are the pulp fiction roots of the original story--Tarkovsky sought to craft a meditative experience out of this, sculpting viewers' time as he always did to draw out each moment and force you to think about what's on screen and what's being said. It might be agony for some viewers, because each shot lingers for long, long, long stretches of time. It kills the pacing, especially when the characters stop moving and decide to discuss philosophy for minutes on end.Fortunately, this film will reward patient viewers. The combination of dreary visuals and sharp writing directs the audience to contemplate greater implications of the journey. It's not so much about three guys walking through the woods--it's an allegory to religious pilgrimage, and synonymous to living life itself. The entire trip challenges each characters' faith, as they question the existence and validity of an all-powerful Room that promises them happiness and fulfilled wishes. Each performer puts on melancholy and understated performances, accentuating the stillness of the cinematography and the quietness of the soundtrack. The sheer mood suggests cynicism towards society, the arts, science, religion--the entirety of mankind. Viewers can infer any number of conclusions, as the Stalker himself distresses over how people lost their way.This is one of the ultimates in art-house cinema. Stalker has cinematography like no other, showcasing places and people so dark, but with a delicate touch that implies greater beauty in nature and power of forces above and beyond mankind. Best of all, the film offers content worth contemplating and reflecting on. Tarkovsky and the crew suffered toxic environments to realize this vision. Then, the film was destroyed--the Soviet laboratories were unfamiliar with the film stock and it was improperly developed. Tensions with the cinematographer (who was subsequently fired) only accentuated the frustration and cynicism Tarkovsky felt, before having to re-shoot the entire film again. What's left might be a reflection of his own anguish. And we are given a chance to stare into his abyss, to see what stares back at us.If you have the interest, the patience, the willpower, the film is a must-see.4/5",Stalker

72,blackmamba99971,Tarkovsky's Rare Gem,10,23 September 2020,"One the last films for Andrei Tarkovsky. In fact because of the extreme pressures to get it done, it caused his untimely death. It is not a science fiction film in the mainstream sense. It is a film wrought with eerie, gritty, dirty conditions set in a post apocalyptic city where supposed aliens have made earth their home. Set in a Zone, where humans are not allowed to enter... period.Yet curious minds always stir in the face of mystery, and for three companions set out to venture into the zone and find a particular room where if one enters with a pure heart, and mind they are granted a wish or desire. Still, the adventure itself is a task for the three men who begin to question their own existence and why it's so important to reach a room to have an easy life hereafter. Tarkovsky, brilliantly adds the existential flavors such as gloomy shots of barren plants or warehouses set in the middle of a nameless city.Ingredients such as glass, water, hazards, and unseen traps sets a pace for the mind to grasp and often makes a person wonder if there is such a thing as a miracle. Aside from the rustic sets, props, and loads of watery scenes, stalker played by Aleksandr Kaydanovskly gives a riveting performance of a man who has his faith broken because of the living conditions that he and his wife and child must live in. To make money in order to survive another day, he embarks on the journey into the zone with his companions.What they don't know, is that the zone although occupied is nothing more than a fantasy trip hosted by stalker. In a way he is testing them using charade traps, round about mazes to keep their interests open, alert, alive so that they don't lose perspective in their goal of reaching the hidden room, which of course does not even existThe zone is simply an off world asylum for aliens to dwell in, but human outsiders are not allowed entry. At least that's how I perceive the story. Every film by tarkovsky has been well written, and tagged with some of the most stunning camera shots I have ever witnessed. Stalker will leave you guessing even though my analysis might have some truth to it. You will just have to watch it for yourself. If not for the mysterious atmosphere, then for the grand scope of it all through Tarkovsky's lens. Mind boggling shots, and still shots mixed with an eerie cape of grime, grease and rusty set props. Incredible film.",Stalker
73,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"Breathtaking to look at, laborious to watch",5,4 March 2018,"First things first, Stalker is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The cinematography is all extremely disciplined and well planned, and the environments are breathtaking. The concept is also an intriguing one. The acting suffices on the parts of each cast member. However, this is where the positives end for me.It almost feels like a troll that Tarkovsky would make the conscious decision to prolong so many of the shots throughout the movie for as long as he does. For example, towards the beginning of the movie, we are forced to sit through a sequence that is nearly 10 minutes long, of three men riding a trolley, not saying a word to each other... we only see the backs and sides of their faces, so we are not taking anything from their expressions. The camera remains relatively tight on the men, so we cannot be entertained by the landscapes they are passing by. There is literally nothing to observe throughout these ten minutes. I cannot find a purpose for expansive segments like this other than to challenge the viewer's patience. I hoped that perhaps the movie would start this way, and build towards some sort of payoff, but two hours in (and it was a challenging two hours), I realized that most likely this was all I was going to get. That did end up being the case.I agree with many of the other naysayers sentiment in the regard that I think this movie would fare much better with a runtime that is dramatically shorter. But, then again, I almost feel like it would work better as a series of photographs. After making it all the way through, I felt that the plot served almost no purpose whatsoever as the movie entertains zero of the possibilities it sets itself up for. The whole Lovecraftian approach (talk about the danger, the fear and the worry, but don't explain how or why one should be concerned) works well to me in film format IF there is a pay off at some point, but, in this case, we simply receive over two hours of men walking around in real time, talking about how careful they need to be, but never showing us what makes this scared place so dangerous.From my perspective, there really truly is nothing more to the film than three men walking slowly and silently through barren but beautiful landscapes, and then the occasional break for brief existential conversation which could be seen as somewhat poetic, but none of this made me feel anything. The only thing I felt was wanting to go to sleep.This was my first impression of Tarkovsky. I will certainly not be rushing to see another of his efforts.",Stalker

Three characters: stalkers, writers, and scientists, representing religion, art, and science, respectively. Ta borrowed the writer's words to tell his plight Stalker represents the final idealism, evokes the enthusiasm of people's beliefs, but the final result is unsuccessful, the desire is too strong, the power is too weak.

75,rooee,In Tarkovsky's Zone,8,17 June 2010,"This is a typically challenging film from Tarkovsky: ponderous and bleak; demanding without being impenetrable; guilty of omphaloskepsis, certainly, but too intriguing and unsettling to be switched off. Plus it's split neatly into two bite-sized parts, so no excuses.This is true art cinema, insofar as it has the look of a dream-like video installation, whilst seeking some kind of truth about the human condition. It is also, in its own, understated way, extreme cinema: as the Stalker, the Writer and the Professor explore the mysterious ""Zone"", they are really exploring the outermost notions of the innermost mind.What is the Zone? Everything. Nothing. Maybe paradise. (When the trio find themselves back in the bar, one wonders whether it was all just one boozy conversation too many.) With its mist-shrouded crumbling monuments, the Zone could represent some netherworld between terra firma and enlightenment – and our nameless protagonists are struggling to bridge the gap. The tourists are deconstructing a place that already looks literally deconstructed.Through catacombs, we follow these protagonists, sharing their fears. Does one really want to discover what he truly desires? The film seems to suggest that to access to heaven is granted only to those willing to surrender a part of their humility, and dare to become as god is.Perhaps the film is about the limitations of the human mind. The Writer and the Professor constantly argue, fight and discuss, as if trying to pluck a revelation from the earth by its roots – but they never manage to feel, while the Stalker (the Preacher?) is destined to break down, crippled by awe. Ultimately, the Stalker fears the death of faith. It may be that the (writers) Strugatskys and (director) Tarkovsky are proposing the necessity of faith to fill the gaps in our minds that cannot be filled with terrestrial philosophy.Finally, fans of Half-Life 2 may find some interesting comparisons in Stalker's grim communistic dystopian cityscape, and subsequent escape to the eerie hills, with their dilapidated barns, full of muddy puddles and the plastic corpses of consumerism. Don't expect the gunplay of Gordon Freeman's adventure; do expect to see stark parallels in landscape and ambiance.",Stalker
76,daisukereds,Rather disappointing,4,27 August 2016,"Watched this movie after reading all the praise.. didn't quite like it due to expectations and how the story was driven.--- Rant contains SPOILERSSlow pacing (even for a movie from 1979), lack of revelations and lots of self-exploration.. but dialogue was not strong enough to evoke submersion. Most of the time, characters are talking about the 'zone', a seemingly normal place people don't dare enter but still talk about. What is in it? Apparently nothing! There is such a poor explanation of it that it may result in expectations not being rewarded quite harshly. But then it is quite possible that (after reading about it) it is a place where radiation exists due to a nuclear-related explosion, which the government might have covered for years! So there is nothing magical about the Zone, it is wishful thinking.. but, even if it isn't such a crazy ""revelation"", you'd have to think about it yourself and realize the people are ignorant of the fact by yourself (or someone on the internet claiming this relation), as the movie doesn't even go there.
Probably a message for the times.The rest of the movie-dialogue consists of quip-y quotes that, sadly, don't go well with the moments where you would expect some sense of what is happening and not a philosophical analysis out of nowhere. These characters don't mash well in this 'scenario', they either know more than us and do not share such experience, or are written to not ask questions.. well, until they do at the very end, when there is not enough time to give an explanation (though the movie doesn't seem to care to do so).
So, is this movie about the zone, or simply a tool to invest in these lacking characters with such poor/obscure motivations? Or is it as secondary as it seems to be? Why dedicate so much time to it if it's going to be ultimately useless or go unexplained? As a study of humanity, it is way to open-ended, and doesn't contribute strong ideas to help steer it, in my opinion.There might be a great movie underneath it, and hopefully someone will take this and inspire himself/herself to write a better and more coherent version. I don't like a story/journey that feels like a waste of time. A much better vehicle could be created to transmit these 'feelings' of self-investigation.",Stalker

Except for the hints at the beginning and the ideation at the end, it is not at all the same as a science fiction movie with space station rockets flying in my head. But a closer look at the big picture suggests that the label may be clever, because the film itself goes back to its roots. The lurker is like a crossroads, we stand at this point, two roads ahead, one is science fiction and the other is mysticism, looking back into the past, sometimes they are separated, sometimes they are interwoven. And my thinking on the meaning of science fiction has changed from focusing on symbols to focusing on ideas. Beyond science fiction itself, this is a movie that everyone in this world should see, because we are human beings.

78,OttoVonB,The most Humanist Film in Existence,10,16 October 2005,"Andrei Tarkovsky is a rarity among filmmakers in that he creates films that resemble elaborate (and always smartly written, beautifully shot and superbly acted) puzzles. The pieces are always scattered, and Tarkovsky relies on his viewer to bring the final element of the puzzle along with him. SOLARIS explores the boundaries of consciousness and the sense of grief (and it uses the titular planet as a metaphor for God). ANDREI ROUBLEV is a multi-layered voyage into religious belief. STALKER, however, is far more spiritual and existential than both of them.A teacher and a scientist wish to go to a restricted patch of nature - the mythical conscious ""Zone"" - to make their wishes come true. To enter the area and survive its numerous danger, they hire a man sensible to the Zone's thoughts and actions, a Stalker. What they find there turns out to be very different from what they expected, as they come to discover who they truly are.There's only so much you can say without getting drowned in details that would appear heavy-handed on paper but flow seamlessly on screen. Quite often, Tarkovsky reduces his characters to silence, letting their movements and eyes convey their thoughts and feelings and letting the viewer bring his own thoughts and beliefs to the film. One of STALKER's many treats is that it invites you to get carried away into your own thoughts, flowing with the images as it provides new questions to ponder... In that sense, the film is very much like a philosophical poem: a very simple surface covering innumerable layers of meaning. Yet the images Tarkovsky provides - whether filming landscapes or wide-shots or simply peering into his actors' extraordinary faces - make this almost hypnotic.STALKER is a treasure: an invitation to go on a mental ride with a poet and philosopher. A film that makes you wonder more about yourself yet without making you anxious. The few existing films like STALKER are the reason why cinema is called ""art""!",Stalker
79,XxEthanHuntxX,Stalker,8,13 September 2020,"Tarkovsky's images and sounds are so powerful that arguably every single frame is its own stunning work of art. Unlike (director S.M.) Eisenstein, who was a strong advocate for montage, Tarkovksy was the polar opposite. Most scenes in STALKER are expertly framed and last the appropriate duration, according to the emotional significance of their context. Many shots last long with the camera slowly creeping forward until the viewer become more intimate with the film's subjects. Every last shots, no mather its lenght, aid to allow the viewer to relish in its atmosphere. There is so much attention to detail in the film's set design, and point of focus. The beams of sunlight, the rippling pools of water, the uneven crackly rocks, the scattered cluster of moss, the industrial scraps of metal left around, the heavenly mounds of sand: it all culminates into a photo-realistic daze.STALKER is a science-fiction film, but it is so heavily rooted in a form of science-fiction that the genre does not usually encompass, and that is philosophical fiction. The film instead opts to be something else entirely. The philospical mediums that it explores largely overlaps with religion too, which draws a fine line between it and other science-fiction work. Alot of what is discussed is quite hard to comprehend, and the viewer has to form one's own understanding. A lot of the film also seems to serve as a metaphors in terms of Ideology. Much of the story revolves around the stalker, guiding the ""writer"" and the ""proffessor"" through the Zone, to find the room that would potentiallly grant ones most cherished desires. The blatantly theist tone of the STALKER presents the spiritual journey within one's own soul, to find God. And could be interpreted as: The pressure from the secular world, even though the opposers are embarking on their own jounrey to find the thruth, even if lack of faith leads them astray. Towards the end, the stalker, actively condemns the writers and professors, who not only lack, but actively avoids faith.The STALKER seeks people who believe in something in a world that no longer believes in anything. The film is about the existence of God in man, and about the death of spirituality as a result of our possessing false knowledge.But i think the problem with STALKER is, while still being very mature in its creation, is childish in its narrative and course of action. With a progressive repetitioun in its story, and a meaning, in my opnion, being a bit obvious. Which collides in being deficient in complexity in comparison to the grand layout of God.",Stalker
80,jackasstrange,An intense spiritual journey...,9,8 July 2014,"""Andrei Tarkovsky's"" Stalker is a long meditative metaphor to Christianism. ""The Path of Rocks"", the path of struggle filled with existentialism the three characters went through to finally reach the Zone and the device of granted wishes is one of the hints this film is about the Christianism and the guide of this journey, Stalker, alludes to Jesus Christ. The black dog; who shows up in the film at key moments, such as in the Stalker's memoirs of being alone laid in the dirty and flooded floors of the urban city (depicted in Sepia, to give even a deeper meaning of dirty and poverty to the ambient), who somehow can cross the entire Zone, and in the ending is shown drinking milk in the Stalker's house."" The Black Dog is the symbol of God"". A very convenient symbol, because God is an ardently refuted and underestimated character in this extraordinary film, and the dog represents that. He is always following the Stalker; the dog is always with him, when the Stalker needs God the most, the black dog is always next to him. The expressionist cinematography, common in Tarkovsky's films, depicts properly the distress, isolation, indecision and desolation of the characters, and gives the film an even darker and disturbing tone. Is a wonderfully crafted work, Tarkovsky's creative choice of making it deliberately slow kinda drags a bit but it never ceases to be a fascinating film. *9.5/10 *",Stalker
81,zeekwunlau,Tarkovsky addicted to non-narrative meditation,8,15 April 2020,"Tarkovsky's films always discuss the essence of religion, the meaning of life and other mothers from different angles. This stalker is the most straightforward and ideological one. The stalkers, writers, and scientists in the film all have their representativeness in this world. The stalkers took them both to the district to find a room. I feel that here is a metaphor for the road of salvation and the gate of God. The process is full of traps and temptations. Only by firming up your faith can you enter. Ta's concentrated the scenes on the waste soil, and the old iron and oil were everywhere, which may be a satire to the industrial environment at that time, but he had to admire his scene scheduling ability and photography aesthetics, even under such conditions. Can shoot the beauty of waste soil. This film also elaborates Tashi's view of modern society and intellectuals by using a lot of argumentative dialogues, thinking that people can be happy only by crossing the room, but few people believe that in the end even the stalkers themselves are somewhat shaken Until the last scene when the little girl was reading the scriptures, the cup moved, and then the picture slowly advanced to the little girl for close-up. I saw the waves on her face. This is the firm belief, just like Dostoev Skil wrote about finding must-see in sin and punishment. In such a landscape society, advocating industry and science, artists are selfless but also weak. They ca n't change people who keep eating. What should we believe? Tarkovsky made me understand that only by looking firmly can we find what we believe and what we should believe.",Stalker
82,GeorgeRoots,"Its Cinematography Is Astounding, The Narrative Is Scare",7,20 March 2015,"""Stalker"", I can only describe as a love it or hate it experience. Its narrative and hidden motif's I'll get to in a second, but what I want to say upfront is this. ""I enjoyed the ""Heart of Darkness"" like attitude in it, but I also think this movie is grossly overrated considering Tarkovsky's earlier works"". I want to say upfront immediately it is not because of the movies quiet, linear storytelling. I really enjoyed ""The Mirror"" (1975), and that was so ambiguous had you no knowledge of its autobiographical moments you wouldn't nearly enjoy it as much. It's not my least favourite Tarkovsky picture, but it certainly is an acquired taste and even its meanings remain shrouded today. Is it about the Gulags? The eventual Chernobyl disaster? Even some have made comparisons to ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939). What I can say with assurance, is that ""Stalker"" feels somewhat more connected to nature than any other fiction movie out there.An expedition takes place led by a man known only as the 'Stalker' (Aleksandr Kaidanovsky), who has the ability to navigate the ""Zone"", a site that has a specific area that has the supposed ability to fulfil desire. His task is to escort two clients into the area, one is a writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) seeking motivation, and the other a professor (Nikolai Grinko) seeking scientific discovery. The trio travels through these areas filled with ruins of modern society, whilst arguing with each other about the practicality of the ""Zone"", and the arguable aura around it.The infamous history behind this film is that Tarkovsky and Cinematographer Georgy Rerberg, had already spent a year filming all the outdoor scenes only to return to Moscow and find all the footage unusable due to a defect in film stock. Tarkovsky of course was despondent and wanted to abandon it, and soon Russian film boards were about to write it off until Tarkovsky hired Cinematographer Aleksandr Knyazhinsky, and began work again after making a deal with the company. The finished narrative was drastically different compared to the original vision. Its Sepia tones hauntingly fit its urban settings well, the ""density"" of time actually feels present and the colours of the natural world look astounding. I found the talks of philosophy nowhere near as deep as ""Solaris"" (1972), even with that movies large quantities of ""techno-babble"" I enjoyed them. I'll also admit that the payoff and my expectations on the discoveries made felt underwhelming. Tarkovsky was approached about the nature of the movie and how the audience may react to it, to which he uttered this quote I somewhat adore the man for saying: ""I am only interested in the views of two people: one is called Bresson and one called Bergman"".The film is crafted with particularly well executed long takes, and its sounds never betray the atmosphere the creators desired. The acting is strong and the dialogue is somewhat delivered well, given such an opaque narrative. There are moments where the fourth wall is broken both directly and ambiguously, and the film leaves many pleasant questions for you to decipher as Tarkovsky (I guess) intended. I suppose the final piece of trivia to mention is that several people involved in the film production including Tarkovsky, had met tragic deaths which has been debated that it was due to the fact this movie was filmed near a half-functioning hydroelectric station (Tarkovsky, his wife and actor Anatoli Solonitsyn all sadly died of the same cancer).Final Verdict: I believe it comes off as a little pretentious, but on repeated viewings I warmed up to it a little more. I stand by what I've said in this review, in no way did I hate it, but I would advise you to seek out the other directors work before seeing ""Stalker"". I don't know why, but a lot of production notes come into my reviews when it comes to Tarkovsky. All his movies are visually stunning works of art, but I also found his later pictures to be somewhat colder. 7/10.",Stalker
83,MogwaiMovieReviews,a sci-fi film with no special effects,7,10 January 2020,"Last week I rewatched Francis Ford Coppola's immortal classic Apocalypse Now, one of the great jewels of our world's cinema, a work of genius which is endlessly experienceable anew. And today I at last sat down to watch Tarkovsky's final Soviet film, Stalker, made the same year: 1979.It's hard to ignore the contrast between these two majestic accomplishments of the East and West, one being so flashy and widescreen, the other so ponderous, bookish, slow and quiet. One feels like a fire at Disneyland, the other a radio adaptation of War & Peace by Samuel Beckett. Apocalypse Now is loud and explosive, Wagnerian, lavish and decadent with no expense spared and no bomb left unblown. Whereas Stalker is a sci-fi film with no special effects at all, and only one trick shot. It is photographed beautifully, but other than that, it could probably be recreated shot for shot by a handful of film students for zero money. The last third of Stalker, especially, feels as though it could almost be a stage production, yet still somehow retains a mystical power that has transfixed several generations now. Because there is so little involved in its making, that would seem to come down entirely to the great performances and photography.I've seen so few Soviet-era films, but feel so aware with this that I'm witnessing a hidden, alternate 20th Century timeline of cinema, shaped without the forces of consumerism and teenage pop culture, and far more steeped in classic literature and symphonic orchestral works. I wondered if the Soviet lenses, film stock and camera cranes were different, too, and if that accounted for some of unusual qualities of the film, or whether that was all Tarkovsky.Two other thoughts: firstly, that the only other major director he seems truly comparable to is Ingmar Bergman. And secondly, it's impossible now to observe the overgrown, abandoned 'Zone' in which the film is set and not think of Chernobyl. The resemblance is not only surface: Tarkovsky and two of the three lead actors would all be dead of cancer a few years later, some say because of the chemical waste they exposed themselves to while filming Stalker.So yes this is a classic too, and as such it stands alone and apart from the others with a look and feel all of its own. As a story, though, I have to say the film does not seem to add up to enough, to deliver enough meaning to reward our time given to it, or even justify the genre label of sci-fi. And yet the mood, musings and dreamlike images along the way are unforgettable, and I would suspect reveal further depths upon repeated viewings.",Stalker

The story is linear and is easy to follow, very different from his last film, The Mirror, which was anything but easy to follow (indeed, there are multiple interpretations).Tarkovsky was one of the greatest directors in cinema and this film alone proves it. Each frame contains more greatness than many other films and impressively, this highly sophisticated work of art was viewed by 4.3 million people at the Soviet Union.I found it the most impressive of all six Tarkovsky films that I have seem (Andrei Rublev (third), The Mirror (second), Solaris(fourth), this(first), Nostalghia(fifth) and The Sacrifice(sixth)).",Stalker

87,noahgibbobaker,An important experience.,10,26 September 2020,"I found stalker to be a very overwhelming experience. It's an extremely slow, poetic film that invites your mind to wonder.The average shot length in stalker is 88 seconds with many shots lasting over 4 minutes. The camera lingers on every frame, immersing you in the film's universe. When a still shot lasts so long you can't help but think about what's been happening, what might happen next, you start to think about why characters are doing what they are doing and what ""the zone"" even is. I love that the film wants you to think as the characters are, my favourite examples of this are the dream scene and the rain scene, both are over 4 minutes long and I'd go as far to say they are two of the best scenes ever filmed. This very slow paced style of filmmaking might put some people off but I think it's genius.Stalker is a major technical achievement, especially considering the drama that went on during the production as well. Tarkovsky fired two cinematographers, one production designer, he fired his wife who was meant to play Zhena Stalkera. The first time the footage was watched was, for some reason, months into production and every shot had a dark green tint, as you can imagine Tarkovsky wasn't happy so he fired Georgi Rerberg the cinematographer, and his production designer Aleksandr Boym. Tarkovsky took on the job of production designer himself but he still needed a new cinematographer, he hired Leonid Kalashnikov, but didn't like what he filmed so he fired him too. Now Tarkovsky needed to hire a new cinematographer and shoot stalker for a third time, he hired Aleksandr Knyazhinakiy who's shots you see in the final product. I think the effort and passion really shows in the final product of this movie. When you take into consideration how much drama went on behind the scenes, I didn't get into half of it, the places they were filming in had poisons that lead to a few cast members and Tarkovsky's deaths, and after having to re-shoot so many times and using so much money for nothing the studio began to lose faith that they would make any money back. It's a miracle that stalker was released and is as masterful as it is.I find it hard to criticize this film at all but I have my issues with it. My biggest probably being the monologues, not the dialogue but how many there are, when there's a monologue every five minutes they begin to lose the weight they once had. I also think the first 20 minutes are far weaker than the rest of the movie. I think the writing is still good but there are a few moments I thought weren't great during these first 20 minutes, Alisa Freyndlikh was also kinda bad at the beginning. She's really good at the end though so I'm not sure what happened. Like I said this is a really hard movie to criticize at all.I believe it is human desire to believe that there is something that will make you give you the life you want to lead without putting the effort in. Whether it's a god or a room that makes your every wish come true, we as a species want something that could possibly make our depressing crawl to inevitable death a little bit better. No matter how slim the chances are everyone wants to have faith in something.Please don't get mad at me for not giving stalker a perfect rating, firstly I probably will next time I watch it, and secondly it doesn't matter what I rate it it's just an arbitrary number it's about what I say about the movie not what rating I give it. Anyway watch stalker it's really good.",Stalker

90,AndreiPavlov,No scary alien is present here but it still works,10,28 January 2008,"Why? Because it is a Russian film. It is our tradition to make deep as ocean films without insane cuts, deadly stunts, CGI, ruthless action, menacing aliens, wild explosions, bed scenes, etc. When I watch modern Russian movies and new wave of animation my organism refuses to accept them. It all goes on an unconscious level. Maybe, because bright lollipop-like flashy TV features are not our cup of tea. I hear people say something like: ""Wow! A great cartoon, like ""Nemo"". Finally we make it properly!"" Nonsense, to my mind. ""Alisa"" cartoons were great because they were so Russian-flavoured, so unique. And that's where the problem is. We always should keep our own route. If we try to make it in a western sort of way, we fall flat. We can (could, to be more exact?) create brilliant examples of entertaining cinema (cf. ""Volga-Volga""), we can (could as well, alas?) create stunning sci-fi features (""Kin-Dza-Dza""), we can (again, could, damn it!?) create wonderful films for children (""Buratino"") and I hope we still can make Russian films, which won't make us blush with shame in future. Our country has gone through too much gore and misery to just copy western culture. ""Stalker"" shows and emphasizes our genuine tradition and ability in film-making, the ability to create slow psychological dramas that go far beyond the reach of a common WYSIWYG TV. ""Stalker"" is an uneasy film to sit through but It definitely leaves a deep mark on the list of best movies created during the era of film-making. And if a movie is followed by a trail of sad happenings (it reminds me of ""Rosemary's Baby""), then it also matters. Life is no laughing matter wherever a Russian sci-fi drama is on.Pointless nature of science and literature devoid of faith. Man without faith resembling an empty dustbin collecting pieces of... Not very common subjects for cinema, especially for modern movies, I guess.10 out of 10, though I cannot say that I enjoy the movie very much - I just certify that it is an outstanding achievement in film-making with a very heavy Russian sign upon it (globalization is given a finger).

It's filled with so much social commentary that is notably effective thanks to the wonderfully crafted dialogue provided to us from Tarkovsky and the Strugatskiys. Stalker does however, suffer from a pacing that is sometimes achingly slow. Maybe one day I'll return back to this masterpiece of filmmaking with an HD copy and end of admiring it significantly more.

92,the_wolf_imdb,Definitely NOT for everyone,8,24 August 2008,"This movie is beautiful, stunning, disturbing and very artsy. It is incredibly slow and metaphysical too. This is not the sort of movie you would take to a party, it is depressing, heavy and almost post apocalyptic. Its best to be consumed on your low day with a bottle of vodka - when you watching alone, in complete darkness. Then you can really enjoy the dark atmosphere of the movie. I think there are different layers in this movie including religious ones (well, this has been shot in SSSR in deep communism so this must have been really risky for the author). I liked the atmosphere, collapsed roofs of the buildings, decaying rooms filled with water, strange dark dog which is supposed not to exist in Zone - all these stunning visuals which just seems to ""exist"" in timeless Zone. The philosophy in the movie is probably a bit overkill which makes it really hard to swallow for ordinary TV viewer who just wants to relax with some generic scifi movie. Overall I have liked the movie but I do not intend to watch it soon again as it is really ""hard to swallow"".",Stalker
93,krational66,Does God exist?,8,15 May 2020,"""
It's not that hard to understand. It's easy to understand the room in the ""zone"" as God. God promises to bring happiness to people and realize their wishes, and only those who are forced to get home can be fortunate to come to God. This can be found in the Bible. The road to salvation is not smooth There are various kinds of miracles, but the most important thing to pass is faith, hope, and love. A large number of bridges in the film can be verified. But the problem is that different individuals, different temperaments, have different attitudes toward God. One is the so-called God 's idiot, who believes that God can save lives in deep suffering, but finds that no one around believes that God has such divine power, but he dare not try it himself, because he is afraid of disappointment, or It is also because Christianity does not allow God to be tested; one is nihilism, denies the existence of God, believes that the individual is the most important, and life has no meaning at all, and everything need not be too serious; the third is the so-called antichrist, and He does not deny the existence of God, but believes that since God can fulfill human desires, both good and bad desires can be fulfilled through faith. Therefore, the God who claims to be the most good has just become the source of all evil, so bomb him. Finally, it does not matter whether God exists or not, and it is impossible to verify at all. Will it be possible to enter the room and realize the desire? What can be achieved if it is realized? Nihilists can find you a hundred kinds of explanations that do not assume the existence of God. It sounds more reliable than assuming the existence of God, or in philosophy, it is called the ontological Occam's razor, shaving off the existence of unnecessary assumptions. . The result of God's agnosticism is that each life is alive, and temperament and encounter determine everything.",Stalker
94,brianberta,A compelling and complex plot,10,4 December 2015,"Always happy to rewatch my number 1 favorite film. When I first watched Stalker, this was before I was fully accustomed to slow pacing, so I struggled somewhat with it, but I still appreciated it quite a lot. I couldn't explain why, but something about the film felt so alluring and kept inviting me back for more, whether it was the ethereal beauty found in the deserted environments or some various sequences which seemed to have otherworldly qualities. Everything about the pacing should've made me grow bored back then, but while this somewhat happened, I also felt strangely drawn to it for a reason I couldn't put my finger on. I didn't love the film after my first viewing, but what I knew was that Tarkovsky was a director who I should keep an eye out for in the future. Though I struggled with a few of his other films after that, like The Mirror and Solaris, both of which I need to revisit soon, I eventually got around to rewatching this film, which was when I fell in love with Tarkovsky.In many ways, this is more of a feel than a film. Initially, the transition from sepia to color when they enter the Zone makes the area seem like a haven as opposed to the drab outside world they're stuck in. However, the more we learn about the Zone and the various people who had ventured there prior to the film (like a previous guide named Porcupine who killed himself after becoming rich in the Zone), the more dangers the area is revealed to have, and the more omens they witness as they make their way through it (a group of abandoned army tanks, a black dog which recurs throughout their time in the Zone, or a human skeleton they pass by), the more apparent it is that the room isn't as fulfilling as it appears, thus making the initial jump from sepia to color a façade which conceals many darker undertones. This film has its fair share of ambiguity and every time I watch it, it always leaves me with some unanswered questions, but I never feel unsatisfied by what I don't know about the Zone or the characters. Contrariwise, part of me feels changed every time I finish watching it as the mysterious beauty the film gives off throughout their time in the Zone and, specifically, the tragically beautiful final shot (which would make a short list of my favorite film endings), is more than enough to move and devastate me. I also find many sequences in the film quite moving, like the initial railway car ride into the Zone which has some great, minimalist sound design, the dream sequence which doesn't actually show their dreams, but still feels surreal, and the inexplicably excellent tunnel sequence. Topped with an undercurrent of nuclear disasters and fallouts bubbling underneath the surface of various scenes (this undercurrent is heightened by how the toxic chemicals in the area this film was shot in arguably lead to the deaths of Tarkovsky and two of the three main actors in the film), this film makes for a profound experience every time I rewatch it.",Stalker
95,galensaysyes,One-third of a notion,8,25 August 2000,"Like the other Tarkovsky films I've seen, Solaris and The Sacrifice, this one boils down in substance to a film one-third its actual length, advancing three times as slowly as necessary. However, unlike the other two, this one didn't bore me. Why not? Because most of it concentrates on three excellent actors and some neat settings, and the part which doesn't is even more interesting. This is the first half hour, which shows the principal character preparing to leave home, fighting with his wife, meeting the men who have hired him, sneaking past armed guards across the boundary, etc. Suspenseful and saddening, it could be set in the real world, and it basically is; and I wish this film, and all of Tarkovsky's films, had remained there. He could have shown a lot about it if he'd chosen to--but perhaps he wouldn't have been able to, for political reasons. Or for emotional ones, since it obviously filled him with despair. He was always escaping--or, as his films show, failing to escape--back, outward, inward. Unlike Solaris, this film isn't really science fiction. Its script concentrates on the development of the three characters, not of the central concept. The Zone remains nonsensical, and at the end we discover that that was part of the point, but I think the point would have been made more strongly had the properties and rules of the Zone been more rigorously devised and given their own definite meaning, so that when they were exploded at the end, their antithesis had a definite meaning also, beyond mere negation. This negation is the expression of only one character, and so may not have been intended as conclusive. But we never hear any argument to the contrary. The only ambiguity the film offers is in the final shot of the protagonist's daughter. But I take it that this follows not from the trip to the Zone but from the family's outing (if it can be called so) on the beach: it's the first scene outside the Zone that's shown in color, and it begins with her ""walking."" And I take it that the revelation in the last scene is meant to be a sign of fulfillment of her father's--or perhaps her own--hopes. But how, and why? It seems as if something more were called for here. According to the video case, the film recalls Blade Runner and Eraserhead, but it looked to me very little like either, and was more interesting than both put together. The views of the locations or sets (I couldn't tell which were which) were fascinating enough so that most of the time I didn't mind their extreme length.But again, one hour would have been as good as three.",Stalker
96,Christopher_Reid,"Overlong, unengaging and pretentious.",2,5 September 2007,"Another one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. What I felt was worst about Stalker was that it came across as pretentious, a term I do not use lightly. Where normally a director would attempt to engage their audience somehow, to make their thoughts and ideas in some way accessible, Tarkovsky seems to have the attitude that there is no need for this, that people should patiently watch a slow, uninvolving movie and simply figure it out for themselves. Granted, I would agree that in general audiences should be patient and open minded with films and that very often, especially with ""great"" movies, the more an audience puts in, the more they get out. This was certainly not the case with Stalker which I felt practically alienated its audience rather than welcoming them in.I would like to be proved wrong and I'm sure I could have payed more attention in areas (although this is arguably the fault of the film to some degree). But even if I later find Stalker not to be so pretentious, it remains unnecessarily long and slow paced. Plus, there isn't any clear pay off at the end. No climax.For example, the cinematography was predictable and repetitive, and even worse, drew attention to itself. In the first 10 seconds of various shots you notice that you are (very very) slowly zooming in (or out) and you immediately know that for the next few minutes, that's all you're gonna get. It wouldn't matter so prominent if the film were more eventful and interesting. I felt that its style didn't create an atmosphere so much as it reflected the lack of creativity from the filmmakers.Nevertheless, I thought the acting was very good but it's hard to get into the characters if almost every shot is a wide shot and there are barely any close-ups. The music was forgettable, not necessarily bad per se but clearly lacking in power and effectiveness. Some of the locations were quite memorable and imaginative but I can't help but feel as though they were barely explored or touched upon. Some of the shots were nice and bring you into the movie's world quite well (for example, the abrupt colouration change) but these moments are unfortunately few and far between. Also, some of the dialogue was interesting but it never seemed to go anywhere.I have to admit, it is quite likely that I just completely missed the point of Stalker or that it's so different from what I have seen that I was unable to properly appreciate its merits. In that case I look forward to finally enjoying it some time in the distant future (I'm not keen to rewatch it anytime soon).Nevertheless, if I've established anything from watching Stalker in my personal quest to understand and appreciate film, it's the importance of the tone of a film. If a film comes across as at all pretentious, it is virtually impossible to enjoy, no matter what qualities it does have. In terms of measuring or defining pretentiousness, the best way I can think of putting it is that somehow one gets the impression not as much effort was put into the film as could have been and that instead the audience is expected to put it together for themselves; the filmmakers don't work for attention and appreciation, they simply expect it.",Stalker
97,Chance2000esl,Throw the TV at the Wall,5,5 October 2007,"After Tarkovsky's amazing adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's 'Solaris' (""Solyaris"" 1972), you look forward to this version of the great Russian SF writers Arkadi and Boris Strugatsy's 'Roadside Picnic.' (They even wrote the script!) You already know that he tells a story very slo--oo--oo--wly, with lots of philosophical speculation and beautiful photography, so you don't expect this to zip along.Then after having to sit through it, you think 'Oh no, it's going nowhere!"" Why? Because... The story is about a 'stalker' who leads a writer and a scientist to an 'Alien Zone' (created by aliens in the Black Forest) where they know they will find that 'wishes come true.' On and on they go into the maze, with puzzlement, discussions and physical problems approaching The Room of the Zone.Finally, after what seems like hours, as they are about to enter The Room, and considering the possibility of what they might find there, they refuse to go in, and decide to go back. The end. Maybe they don''t want their wishes to come true! Apparently this is an allegory about birth or about birth trauma. But it's an un-understandable ending.If you were reading it as a book, at this point you would take the book and throw it against the wall.

98,karl_consiglio,Welcome to THE ZONE,10,10 May 2006,"Probably my favorite Tarkovsky film. This is an examination of the conscience. He physically takes us to a place that represents our conscience, appropriately called The Zone. A place where obviously the government fears us entering. The Stalker here is a Christ-like figure amongst the two men, one is an artist, a writer and the other is a scientist, a professor, both characters questioning existence and the meaning of life from their own separate but not entirely different perspectives. The Stalker feels that they both have the ultimate potential to be fine candidates to enter The Zone, a place where for very intensely personal reasons only he can venture or escort anybody who he deems fit. The naive chick with her fur coat and sports car was told that she better go back to where she came from upon introduction. However even the most wretched must know how to behave themselves in The Zone. We are confused because we are not entirely sure what it is that we want due to the conflict between our mind and our heart. Our conscience plays with us, The Zone is tricky. A stray dog without the gift of human spirit is allowed to wonder freely. We have to be like children again in The Zone.....its all poetic and Biblical, an extremely spiritual movie. I like the slow pace in which he takes us deeper and deeper to find some understanding. This is the ideal way to approach and make a science-fiction movie. This is a spiritual experience.",Stalker
99,faraaj-1,No repeat of the brilliance of Solyaris,8,30 March 2008,"I was stunned by Tarkovsky's other famous sci-fi philosophical meditation Solyaris. Comparisons between Solyaris and Stalker are natural because of the genre and auteur.Tarkovsky proves again that he is a master of the visual and each frame is preplanned with the whole flowing seamlessly from seam to seam with long and languorous takes. Like Solyaris, Stalker is a deep, meditative work and a superficial first viewing is probably not enough to understand the significant themes of the film. I have only just finished seeing Stalker for the first time and it may grow on me. However, my first impression while watching Solyaris was intense interest coupled with a longing to understand more about this marvelous, enigmatic film after it is was over. In the case of Stalker I really had to plod through it at times. It was visually stunning but not beautiful. The characters may have been more autobiographical for Tarkovsky but they did not arouse empathy.There are may visual similarities between Solyaris and Stalker and if you've seen one, you can automatically detect the same visual style in the other. In Stalker, the scenes in the real world - first 20 and last 10 minutes - were black & white while the zone was filmed in color. The real world was cold, grey and ugly and in many cases e.g. the tunnel, so was the zone. The Stalker did not have the presence or the sadness in his eyes that the lead of Solyaris did which I see as another major shortcoming. I will want to let my viewing of Stalker sink in over the next few days and may change my opinion, so this is just an immediate reaction.",Stalker

It's overgrown vegetation with ruins that the characters wander and throw handkerchiefs around while having pretentious rambles and nervous breakdowns.This is a classic case of tell-us-but-don't-bother-to-show-us storytelling. The only thing science fiction-y is that we are told - in scrolling text - that the Zone might have been caused by a meteor or aliens. That's it.It's more minimalist theater of the mind, if anything.

101,Artimidor,Approach with care... don't forget your bolts!,10,2 April 2012,"Tarkovsky's second science fiction entry after ""Solaris"" needs to be approached with a good deal of caution - just like the protagonist navigating the zone with his metal bolts in order to reach his goal, that fabled room which grants your innermost wish. There's danger lurking everywhere, but in the zone's inner sanctum there is bliss waiting - or not, depending on what you want to get out of it. For sure ""Stalker"" is not the regular sci-fi tale, even though it was inspired by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky's novel ""Roadside Picnic"", who also co-wrote the film's script. Yet Tarkovsky made something entirely different out of the material: a slow, contemplative, philosophical excursion of almost religious proportions consisting of extremely long takes. ""Stalker"" is a mood piece as if it had descended from another world, the zone we enter is shot in lush colors, life outside in drab black and white. In this spellbinding composition an enigma is wrapped which has prevailed until this very day...So what exactly is ""Stalker"" all about? Some might say: Clearly an allegory about life in the USSR. An interpretation which Tarkovsky vehemently denied, even though there's strong subtext one can hardly ignore. On the other hand the zone of ""Roadside Picnic"" was inspired by the nuclear disaster in Chelyabinsk of 1957 - and after Chernobyl Tarkovsky's 1979 film feels like a foreshadowing and a déjà vu at the same time. And due to its unique place between history and fiction ""Stalker"" sparkles with a rare kind of magic. Aside from references to nuclear catastrophes there are also numerous religious allusions put in the film, most dominant being the repeated hints at the stalker's messianic role, even though he's just a human like everyone else, who refuses to walk the path. Discussions between the main characters circle around belief and hope, freedom and purpose in life, and poetry and metaphysics wait just around the corner to knock on your door and haunt or enlighten your dreams.

103,stimpy_tr,Strange surrealist movie,6,20 August 2020,"A strange surrealist movie is presented by Andrei Tarkovsky. A man named Stalker is hired by a writer and a professor to guide them into a room located in a forbidden zone. We understand this objective throughout the movie because the beginning is so slow with little conversation. In fact, the entire movie is slow-paced, the scenes are long and dark.Whatever has happened in the forbidden zone, it became magical and many people who entered couldn't get back because the routes to the room are changing constantly. Moreover, they have to throw forward a cloth tied to big locknut before going ahead, the reason of which is never explained. They perform similar irrational things all throughout the journey. That is why I categorized it as surrealist. Nevertheless the landscapes including artificial settings are work of great cinematography. The main line drawn in the movie by Tarkovsky is the philosophical discussions between these men and not how the movie ends. Although the acting of Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy is impressive, I have to mention that this movie is not for everybody (maybe not for me either).",Stalker
104,Come-and-Review,A film about faith,10,2 December 2014,"Stalker is my favourite Tarkovskij. Maybe because I can't fully appreaciate the greatness of his latter works, or because I particularly like post-apocaliptic settings, but I always felt attracted by this film. Visually, Tarkovskij's one of the best directors to date, so there's nothing to say there. The sets, if they were built specifically for the movie, looked incredibly realistic, if they were already existing ruins, they standed perfectly. The film is adapted by a novel, ""Roadside Picnic"", which has nothing of the spirituality added by Tarkovskij, and tells a different story. There have been various interpretations that critics way more important than me gave about the film, but I feel that mainly, 'Stalker' is a movie about faith. I won't do a synopsis to the film, but the Stalker brings two men, nicknamed Writer and Scientist to the zone, and during their journey the three discuss of various philosophical themes. His two clients represent the rationality of today. The writer simply can't believe in a room were wishes are furfilled, the scientist sees it as a threat. The Stalker is a lone man, who has faith in the Zone, and believes in the room. When the Stalker is at home, at the end, he asks something like: ""how can people live without faith?"" (don't remember exactly what he said, I watched it in Russian with hungarian subs). Even if the Stalker is sad at the end because of the others, and he and his family live in a decadent world, he's in peace. Writer's tormwnted with his anxieties, Scientist's firm, but lacks of compassion, on the other hand Stalker in the Zone lays down and breaths the air. I personally feel that this was the message of ""Stalker"", even though it is suggested that it is about humans not being able to reach the universal truth.",Stalker

Perhaps this is because the screenplay is written by the authors of the novel on which ""Stalker"" is based.It is a markedly slow film - and I feel like that is the exact point for the viewer, because the signature lingering shots from Tarkovsky and DP Georgi Rerberg force the viewer to feel like actually being part of the film.Also apparent in ""Stalker"", Tarkovsky's visual storytelling ability in unparrallelled. The cinematography is so wonderful and impressive, and again, as with ""The Mirror"", Tarkovsky hired DP Georgi Rerberg, and the film looks brilliant. It is simply mesmerizingly beautiful to witness artistic frames like they are portrayed here.I saw the film as reflection of life, and what hit me most, I wont spoil, but can highly recommend the patient to see this masterpiece of a film.",Stalker

A stone can be used as a weapon or a paper weight, a decorative piece, or a substrate for lichen growth, you got the idea, right? Now, in that vein, I would say that I found a perfect use for a movie like that. Is it a lesson in cinema? No! Is it a lesson in story- telling? No! Is it a well-crafted sci-fi story? No!Stalker is the perfect cure for insomnia. It works, it is fool-proof, and best of all, it is non-addictive. It could not be better!

And I think that this is the problem, I know people, lots of people that think that staring at an empty canvas is meaningful, enlightening.No wonder so many raving reviews of Stalker.Watching grass grow would be more interesting, at least you would be looking at something that is alive.ON the plus side (yes, there is a plus side) the photography is beautiful.

The film follows a Stalker i.e. a man who works illegally as a kind of sherpa, taking people into the ""zone"" a site that was hit by a meteor and has since been abandoned. On this visit that we accompany him on, the Stalker has chosen to usher in two men, one a writer, the other a scientist professor. Because what they are doing is highly illegal and dangerous the Stalker insists that they refer to themselves only by their professions. As they enter the zone we learn more about the journey, including why it is considered so dangerous and why so many are willing to take the risk to go there. The movie is not for the faint of heart. The short summary proffered above takes over an hour to explain in terms of the movie. Furthermore the shots are incredibly long, often lasting several minutes as we follow these men on their journey. But is it ever worth the ride. Shot mostly in long abandoned locations the film is brutally gorgeous.

108,toqtaqiya2,Stalker is compelling for not relying on a single gimmick or special effect to create its atmosphere of another world bordering our own.,9,10 November 2010,"Andrei Tarkovsky's most formally experimental film is certainly his autobiographical The Mirror (1975), which is the one that deals most directly with the realities of Soviet life. But his most durable blueprint for the cinematic imagination may be Stalker, allegedly an adaptation by Arkady Strugatsky and Boris Strugatsky of their science-fiction novel Roadside Picnic (1975). Stalker is exploratory in every sense - an undertaking in topographical cinema. In an unspecified future, a meteorite has created 'the miracle of miracles', the Zone, into which a haunted, specially qualified 'Stalker' (Alexander Kaidanovsky) guides two disillusioned men, a writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) and a scientist (Nikolai Grinko). The outside world, filmed in black-and-white, is a militarized region of checkpoints and freight yards, patrolled by police: to all appearances a classic dystopian image of the Soviet Union. But the pastoral inner haven of the Zone - shot in a faded, chemical shade of blue-green - is just as unstable. Stalker's universe is, above all, porous: water flows everywhere. Even the extraordinary sound design is prone to a kind of seepage. The film can be read as a political parable. A field of abandoned tanks swamped by vegetation seems a clear passage of the fall of power. Tarkovsky, who died in 1986, is widely considered a spiritual filmmaker, and often attacked as such. Now it's easier to admire his work.",Stalker

Stalker, a sort of urban explorer decades before it became little more than a meme, guides the desperate through a condemned wonderland searching for a legendary room that grants you what you desire most, rumors of which sprung up in the years since The Zone first appeared. The setting is as mystifying as the film. It is haunting. The geography shifts. You can't go back the way you've come. There are unnacountable voices. Animal calls where there shouldn't be any. Scores of people enter the Zone and never come out. The Stalkers who roam it give birth to mutated children (who have more attributes than at first glance). The Writer doesn't believe any of it, the Professor has ulterior motives, but the Zone lets pass not the most good or bad, but the most desperate. It Is a Wonderland, but a rundown, sad, believable one. Your belief becomes as suspended as natural law in The Zone. The characters explore the environment, and that's ultimately what it boils down to - exploration. Tarkovsky is interested, obsessively, in probing YOU, the viewer. When we reach the room, what happens? There are wonders, certainly. Peculiarities, but the characters seemingly walk away empty-handed. Tarkovsky gives us visions, and leaves you stranded in them.

It's all quite open to interpretation and has a loose, almost indiscriminate stature about it (which could be due to the on-the-spot script rewrites and changes). Upon reflection, I do think Stalker offers some reasonably interesting themes and thought-provoking allusions but I don't know if it's anything particularly deep or new or even very significant (or at least, it never feels like it, aside from the needlessly(?) weighty presentation). A further hindrance is the film's dynamic, or lack thereof. It's a tediously long, distant, drawn-out, mostly uneventful affair. The story is compelling enough, however, and The Zone locations, made up of some decrepit building structures overrun by lush wilderness, were effectively haunting.",Stalker

The movie has some brilliant shots of camera that draws a thin margin between figments of imagination and reality. The movie has a euphonious background theme.The men risk their lives to reach the 'Zone'. As the three men reach the 'Zone', an inhabited land with an ancient myth of granting one's innermost wish, disparate views emerge and each one confronts the other two. The men are convinced of their perception of 'The room' while the Stalker is still skeptical and rubbishes their thoughts.

112,ereinion,Perfect,10,3 December 2004,"Words are not enough to describe this masterpiece of a film. It requires a tremendous amount of concentration from the viewer, as any other Tarkovsky picture, but ultimately it is worth it. The film features the rather unknown Kajdanovsky and two of Tarkovsky's favorite actors, Anatoli Solonitsyn and Nikolai Grinko, who play very different characters as a cynical writer and a soberfaced scientist respectively. Kajdanovsky is THE STALKER, whose title is hard to understand or explain. But I think that indicates that he has been to the mythical forbidden ZONE and possesses special psychic powers which enable him to find it. He lives with a neurotic wife and a very special child that seems to possess some sort of telekinetic powers.The most stunning part of the film is the scene where the camera moves across the artifacts lying under the water, which go from usual domestic things to an icon of Christ, here given a very unusual portrayal. That scene sums up the movie very well. It is a glimpse of the life that used to be and the symbol of the downfall of the old world. And what about THE ZONE? Well, I see it as a last resort, a sort of forbidden paradise which ultimately turns out not to be what people expect or want. The three characters change as they progress through the dark corridor and to THE ROOM. All these parts of the zone are highlighted brilliantly in a way that only Tarkovsky could. What is THE ROOM? And what purpose does the telephone have? All these questions left me thinking and wondering for hours after.In the end, this film is not for everyone and perhaps 50% of those who decide to watch it don't make it till the end. And that's really a shame for this is Tarkovsky's second best film, after Andrei Rublev, and together with Solaris. The performances are all excellent and the unknown Kajdanovsky impresses the most. The music by Eduard Artemiev is haunting and effective. And the constant shifts from black/white to color enhance the visual majesty of this work. A clear 10.",Stalker
113,Scoopy,"Stunning, but overlong",7,18 October 1998,"It is a brilliant movie in many ways. The visuals are stunning and haunting. Several of the scenes will remain imprinted on your memory forever. The script is literate and thought-provoking. Like any great work of art, it is not pedantic, but open to interaction with the viewer.If it were 90 minutes long, it might be the greatest movie ever made. Unfortunately, it is 160 minutes long, and the extra footage can be tedious beyond belief and seems to do nothing to further the story or enhance the mood.Tarkovsky makes every point with a sledgehammer, never with a scalpel. This can be supernaturally effective. It can also impel you to yell ""get on with it"" or ""you already said that"" at the screen.I view this film as a great achievement, and yet a failure in that Tarkovsky's acquaintance with Western literature apparently did not include an encounter with the phrase ""brevity is the soul of wit"". As great as it is, how great might it have been!",Stalker
114,zolaaar,The Silent Monolith Needs to Be Explored,10,28 November 2005,"My first Tarkovsky experience, and I'm overwhelmed by its imagery power. The film is pure joy, which, admittedly, requires some time and open mindness.'Stalker' begins when the camera navigates into a room as if we are entering an art gallery. In those images of introduction there is a strange tension between calm, peace, but also a threatening feeling of mysteriousness. It is a feeling which goes throughout the whole film, some sort of a basic flow or vibration which keep fantasy and thoughts of the viewer always busy. The picture of the three persons in the bed, the Stalker and his family, appears as a painting or a collage, showing primary luck and happiness but being now doomed to downfall. This extremely intense atmosphere is capturing and therefore very 'joyful' to watch and go through.I won't get into plot details. Just some things on the characters first: The three persons who enter the Zone are representing different kinds of human ideologies, coming along as a soul trip. We have the Stalker, the one who leads the other two into the forbidden area. He stands for individuality. He is an obsessive, a desperate who escapes his real life and believes he can only exist and unfold himself in the Zone. The writer, cynical and sarcastic, a quitter, embodies the nihilistic ideology of the civilization. The professor represents the scientific conscience.The Zone sometimes appears to be as not real, but maybe also shows the inner cosmos of the three men. Tarkowsky kind of abolishes the difference between inner and outer world by permanently switching from monologues to dialogues, from black/white to color, from close-ups to totals and the other way round.That's not it, not only a soul trip of three failed men (and in that respect of human conscience), but it's also the urge to get to the insight, the truth, the veracity of the damaging progressive human civilization. You see rotting industrial constructions and instruments, you see how the nature takes back what it has lost, captured in beautiful picture compositions (i.e. the fish in the river, surrounded by cans, a Christ figure, coins and oil).What makes the film quite intriguing is that it's not only an apocalyptic description, not only all negative. In the stunning imagery, especially the image of water, you see the miracle of life, something wonderful and esthetically very appealing.At the end, the wife of the Stalker asks him 'What would be life without harm?' A life without harm would be also a life without happiness and hope. She, who didn't want him to go, welcomes him again and brings him to bed.His daughter without legs (and that is the most powerful and enthralling shot I hardly have seen before in a film) sits at a table, we see her profile of the face, and she is silent. She looks at three cups, moves them with the power of telekinesis, one falls on the floor and breaks into pieces. Is that the will of God? The power of free will? The influence of the Zone? Do the three glasses represent the traveling men? Maybe this picture alone is the expression of the mystery of life, the question on how we effectuate, what we cause and what we shall effectuate in this world and in it's nature. Maybe it is the question on the ranking of love and passion when Stalker's wife doubts a life without harm and happiness and hope. Maybe Tarkowsky hits on his own society in the communist totalitarian Soviet Union. Maybe the film goes beyond that and doubts other promises of fortune of other societies. Maybe. Certainly.",Stalker

Fascinating atmosphere, unfolded slowly and with patience, full of contemplative images and symbols.

"" Artist is not responsible for his perceptions and purposes "" No need to explain those thing's ! There's no symbolism in my films. I make films which inspires people and their emotions that's it ! Don't know why people are trying to find meanings in my films !The dialogue, then, is throughout magnificently ambivalent: witty and fantastical beyond measure.

The film contains 142 shots in 163 minutes, with an average shot length of more than one minute and many shots lasting for more than four minutes.( In Wikipedia ) !More than anything it's a Tarkivosky film !

Or perhaps this film is not quite all it's cracked up to be. Some silent films have been able to say more about the human condition with constraints that this film did not face. It seems to have a message, but unlike Waiting for Godot - which is the only comparable work I've seen - it does not exploit it's medium. Waiting for Godot invites endless speculation about interpretation, but is entertainment in itself. With Stalker, Tarkovskiy somehow manages the opposite - there is some wonderful imagery, but slow laboured intensity generally without fulfilment - a painting would offer more because of its sensory constraints. The film moves through a succession of imagery linked by character and dialogue. What does it all mean? By the end of the film I didn't really care.",Stalker

I first saw ""Stalker"" on VHS in the late 1990s and you could barely tell the movie goes from sepia to monochrome, then muted color, and finally full color. You see it as a projected film and it is like watching a ballet going on in the background. I saw a ""new"" print in 2006 at the International House of UPENN, up in their rickety folding bleacher auditorium and it was a revelation......like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", this is not a movie to be seen on the small screen if you really want to appreciate the artistry involved in the color timing of the picture. I know it sounds bizarre writing about the color shift alone, but it's an intrinsic component of the film, and one of the possibly overlooked elements of it.",Stalker
122,MooWoolf1,(the story is) very good and original,7,3 November 2018,"The basic idea of the movie is incredible. The story itself is incredible.
I love movies just like the ones that are rated it with 10s.BUT!I highly doubt that anyone on this planet can possibly enjoy watching those parts where nothing happens. Those parts do not add to the story. That was just waste of film and money. This was a very low budget movie back then. They made it out of less than a million dollar in today's currency (I think it was about $300.000).So my point is that nobody can honestly enjoy something like that in it's entirety.
I really loved the idea, the story, the point of the movie BUT THE WAY I HAD TO EXPERIENCE IT, the way how Tarkovsky showed it WAS NOT GOOD. Not at all.This is first a sci-fi and a drama. Being a drama does not mean that it has to be boring with full of unnecessary shots. The movie shouldn't be SLOWED DOWN. It should flow. When they add those parts it not just slows down the movie but also breaks the flow. Making it boring.My ratings are public. Almost seen the top250. About 25 missing. In overall I've seen mora than 2000 movies. I can watch any genre, I have a good tase, I'm always fair and I only rate movies with 10 that are perfect in the way they exist.Because of this I rated this movie with a 7 which is fair compared to that how boring it was. Tarkovsky was a good one in picking the right story but wasn't a good director at all without any kind of self-criticism.All the 10s on this movie are coming from people that want to make themselves seen special by liking super boring movies.
A very similar movie the Annihilation is by far better than this.",Stalker
123,EyeDunno,"An Eerie, Dreamy, Isolating and Dangerous Search (Mild Spoilers for Film Explanation)",10,8 March 2017,"For those who feel that Stalker is a waste of almost three hours of time, perhaps they haven't really looked into the back story of what inspired the film (and its locations) in the first place. Many cinematic features today want to keep up the pace, and it's easy to count to four seconds before having to restart the count whenever a scene cut is made in modern cinema. Stalker isn't about picking up any pace; it relies on IMMERSION. And it's easy to give up on Stalker as a waste of time. Honestly, I started thinking that at the very first portion of the film. Here I am, watching a sepia-toned feature that has possibly two minutes before even the first cut changes perspective. By the time the scene reached a bar, I was finished with it.... for the time being. There was something that told me to revisit Stalker when my mind and time frame were clear, and I'm glad that I did. Embrace the concept of emotional immersion when viewing this film, when you're awake and you have nothing pressing to accomplish. It's not for those who want a story line dealing with heroes/villains, rite of passage, or gaining popularity. It's bent on personal turmoil and a quest of inner peace, acceptance, or even what the existence of life is all about. Stalker reminds me of Wizard of Oz (1939) insofar as its structure, relying on film stock to highlight location, yet there are also subtle comparisons regarding what the three characters (just like Oz) hope to find in their own searches. The film starts in a community that has been cordoned off, similar to actual Russian events of chemical/nuclear disasters, prior to Chernobyl, and by the time the film winds up, you'll see some instances of dismal foreboding (which occurred seven years later in Chernobyl), as well as with the demise of a number of cast and crew of Stalker, who wound up succumbing to bodily poisons incurred through the production of the film. While they shortened their lives making Stalker, it's a visually stunning and eerie masterpiece, which live on. I speak of these radioactive events - Kyshtym (1957, at Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast) and the Leningrad Nuclear Reactor (1975) which must have inspired director Andrei Tarkovsky. The child in the movie acts out a debilitating condition that many people affected by these disasters had actually suffered, in large part because government officials refused to acknowledge the disaster and fallout quickly enough to evacuate many people in time. I think that Stalker was written to tap into those events as well as dig into the minds of a dreamer, a writer and a professor, each seeking something very personal, and yet they have to ask themselves how genuine their soul-searching is. The long, deliberate lack of camera movement used in Stalker has been abandoned today for a quick-pace editing, which makes viewers not think so much. Tarkovsky relied on the snail's pace approach, which compel an audience to reach into their individual senses of sight and sound which will help or disturb the viewer's inner peace. And there are so many things that give viewers a sense of unease, which is so effective: Sounds don't match sights throughout the film. The dialog was completely rerecorded after filming. You'll hear birds, waterfalls, wind, and the clickety clack of the work car they ride, all which simply don't match. This is a film technique that adds to an underlying state of mental instability for the viewer.One particular scene is also subtly jarring, when the ""stalker""walks away from the writer and scientist, going to a grove of trees for a monologue; upon his return, the scene behind the trio has become shrouded in a fog. The trio leave a community to journey to a fenced in Zone, but are they prisoners both where they live, as well as where they travel? When you review every shot of Stalker, you'll realize that no scene has a sense of unconditional beauty. There is decay, desolation and a sense of infectious isolation that pervades, starting with the family scene. I bring these to light to help those who shrug off the film as worthless. But ultimately, however, Tarkovsky only cared about what two people in the whole world thought about Stalker : Robert Bresson and Ingmar Bergman. By the time the dust (or fallout) settles, we are somewhat like those three who find themselves searching in the dreamlike world of The Zone: what is this all about, how did we get here, and what should we gain - or lose - from the experience. Stalker is a keeper.",Stalker
124,kuciak,Watching Paint Dry,2,23 April 2008,"When I saw Tarkovskys film Solaris I was very impressed, I thought Ivans Childhood was good. I didn't like Mirror the first time I saw it, but when I saw it on TV some many years latter, I changed my opinion of it.Many years ago, as a very young man, I watched a film by Arthur Penn called Night Moves. In the film Gene Hackman is asked if he would like to go see an Erich Rohmar film (Sorry about the spelling), he replies that the last time he went to see a Rohmar film, it was like watching paint try. The same goes for this film. It is one of the most excruciating film experiences that I have ever gone through. I had taped it from TV, and just could not get into it. I felt as if I am being dragged through the mud. That some value this film enough that it would be in the top 250 films of all time is baffling. But I don't want to be too critical of those who think this film is a masterpiece, because we are of all different minds. We are all affected by films in different ways.Perhaps this movie was not for the TV screen, but for the theater, it truly needed what is called a 'captive audience'. But sure wouldn't take a date with you to it, she might say she has to go to the bathroom, and you would never see her again.I've seen five of Tarkovskys films, I think he only made seven features.

The transition to color and back again created a nice mood. The camera movement was effective and the angles as well. Too bad it was all wasted on a story which is a piece of crap.Even decent acting couldn't save this picture. The psycho/philosophical/pseudo-intellectual babble or attempt at such was worse than reciting a telephone book - at least the latter makes no pretense at deeeep meaning.There is an intellectual challenge to this film, though.

127,ConsistentlyFalconer,True filmmaking art.,9,22 September 2015,"Apparently Tarkovsky had to reshoot a large portion of this film after the original stock was damaged. What was actually released is such a striking piece of work, it's hard to imagine what the original version might have been. There is a plot: in a post-apocalyptic world, the ""Stalker"" is a man who guides people through a restricted Zone where the usual laws of physics and reason don't apply, and in which a room is said to exist that causes a man's deepest desires to come true. There is character development and gripping performances, particularly by Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy (Stalker) who really does seem to carry the weight of the world on the shoulders... ... but for a moment, forget all that. Instead, try watching Stalker as you'd watch, for example, a David Lynch film: think instead about the images presented on their own terms rather than trying to attach a conventional meaning to them, or put them into context.

130,Richard_vmt,Great Art Film,8,11 May 2008,"The best introduction to this film is to say it is an art film. So saying may conjure up past experiences where entertainment takes a back seat to artistic expression. This is not true with Stalker. It maintains suspense and interest throughout the film. The story involves a strange journey into a heavily guarded Zone to which strange things are attributed, including possibly an alien landing site. But the journey in involves viewing nature and the ravishment of man's industrial footprint and nature's natural tendency to erase it, with fresh objectivity. It is a rather schizophrenic vision in which phenomenon so common as a gust of wind are perceived with the primitive fear of a savage. Or a dry wind of dust and leaves blowing across quivering quicksand. Nothing about it supernatural but so strange!In the long run no ET monsters or anything else is discovered. To borrow the words of Bob Dylan: Nothing Is Revealed. And so, there is a letdown in suspense, but the letdown is not without dramatic meaning. It is the letdown of a man unable to prove that he is not insane.I have to think that even in Russia--a land known for its industrial pollution--the makers of this film must have spent a lifetime scoping out potential visual material. To watch the camera pan over the submerged items left there by man and nature is to stand in the shoes of an alien ourselves. This is a great film for sensitizing one to man's effect on the environment.",Stalker

The debates between the characters are intriguing. The journey into ""the zone"" is one of the finest dream pieces I've ever seen on film. The problem is that these parts cannot save the whole. STALKER contains far too many mood sequences in which the plot takes a break and poetry takes over. The film's symbolism is all glaringly obvious and can't justify the monstrously bad pacing. The ending is also a major let-down. What the hell happened? Tarkovsky started his carreer with brilliant promise. Then it all went to hell with SOLARIS. This is better (in spots) than SOLARIS, but not much better. The story could have been told more effectively in the space of 85, just over half its running time.

133,cablooie,My number 1,10,16 February 2014,"We all have a number 1 film, a favourite which we HAVE rather than want to watch over and over again.Stalker is that number 1 for me.The evergreen, like that very tshirt you resent being in the washer.Every time I watch it I get new details, explore new shades and colours, as it happens with any multi layered work of art.That said, I am not going to waste words offering my personal interpretation of this masterpiece, there are a lot around already, some good too.I can understand, let me add, why some people didn't quite get the point of this incredible journey inside and across the humans spirit.I'd say 2 are the main reasons why people might not like this movie: 1) they read the book and could barely find tiny similarities in the story, although the Strugatskiy brothers had a big part in putting together the script (incredibly, they insisted in spite of the countless differences from their book that Tarkovsky's story was ways deeper and important than their own); 2) more likely, people were simply expecting an action packed sci-fi flick and had to go through a slow paced introspective expedition, and most people don't like to do that, especially when it's least expected. They find it inconvenient and disturbing. They rather choose movies offering a vacation from their lives, so they don't have to think of anything while nibbling at popcorn.Sometimes I got sort of punked too in the past, I was all charged and ready for an action flick with my popcorn, drink, laser sabre and ended up getting involved into a slow spiritual-psychological story instead.

134,mukherjeesubham93,Tarkovsky adds philosophy to Sci-fi,9,11 August 2018,"There are times when you wish to say a lot, but you're short on words. This sums up my feeling on this 1979 movie, 'The Stalker' by the great Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky. This by the way, was the first movie of his which I saw. Bergman once said, ""Tarkovsky for me is the greatest, the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream."" You have to see a Tarkovsky movie to believe these words. It's a whole new cinematic language which stains your mind forever. Coming back to this movie, It's a Sci-Fi drama set in a post apocalyptic world( set 7 years before the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, eerily foretelling it) about a man who takes two other men into a territory named 'Zone' (supposedly there was a alien invasion there) which has a 'Room' which fulfills man's innermost desires. Forget flying saucers, deadly creatures. This movie essentially raises philosophical questions and embraces metaphysical themes. It is no doubt, symbolic. Simple, yet full of resonance. The movie is bound to leave you puzzled, but Tarkovsky offers no explanation. It borders on ambiguity and let's viewers derive thier own conclusions. What's most impressive here, though is the gorgeous yet bleak cinematography. The zone is represented in vivid colours while the world outside the zone is represented in bleak sepia tones.The movies has extremely long scenes which add a hypnotic feel to it. Shot in highly contaminating conditions in a Chemical plant, many of the movie's crew including Tarkovsky himself succumbed to cancer later, due to high exposure to such conditions. This was Tarkovsky's last movie in USSR before he moved out of there dissatisfied, and this was truly something very unique, unlike any other movie I've seen till date.P.s. People who get annoyed by art house movies, please stay away. The movie is self indulgent and with scenes of extremely long takes and silence to build up dramatic tension. It's a movie which almost borders on the level of meditation. You've got to give yourself up and forget about time while watching it.",Stalker

137,Global_Marketing_Pros,Risk assessment for Omen Geni profiler team,9,17 July 2007,"Stalker is a unique film about risk and the assessment risk while working with people who have strong desires to undergo dangerous conditions. I think the film has many concepts under the central theme of risk and who is willing to discover.Discovery itself is the assessment of phenomena. In Stalker it is the phenomena related to different character types or profiles. First, a guide who is knowledgeable about evading military and police security. Second persons who have money, or inherent value, to promote themselves for the new discovery. The promise is that the new discovery will alter their lives with new hope.I use the summary title Risk Assement for Omen Geni Profiler Team, because the military assesses the area of discovery to be off limits to the public. The so called zone in the film where risk takes place is a figurative psychological state that incurs transition. Thus my interpretation of uses of transitional film color from black and white to full color. The induced para-psychology undergoes different effects pertaining to the character. Which is symbolic in the film of how they proceed in the figurative metal state with taking turns with direction, how they proceed as individuals, what precautions each member of the team is willing to use. ""Omen Geni"" is a Russian term used by military to make diminutive or few, this idea is common to a regimental system of military or police state psychology due to the need for order. Thus, any ideas which may stray from that order need the assessment of the ""Omen Geni"" profiler to determine there risk to the social order. It is this paradox that given the human nature that the film mocks as a para-psychological thriller of color contrast as the human spirit is adulterated by the new ideas of Gods world.I think the director and producer are also saying that the most relevant conditions of the environment while in the zone represent reality in the sense of destitute and disaster. The presence of environmental un-natural debris, litter, and or destruction of society as known to man-kind is their acknowledged presence of where the zone actually occurs in reality. Meaning that discovery itself from man-kind given any psychology to produce un-natural surroundings to the natural environment is most noticeable without utility. Even a simple spoon under water is a good utensil, but not properly used obviously out of its place in society.Since I myself am a natural scientist for both humane and military essences the truth to a well documented discovery lies in the least amount of risk; first for reproduce-ability, and second for the inherent quality. Thus the making of diminutive risk is best for any conclusion by the objective of this film concerning discovery.",Stalker
138,auberus,Stalker is more than a film; it is an act of Faith.,9,5 May 2008,"Some say the zone was born from the crash of a meteorite, some say the zone is a gift from an Alien civilization. Whatever they say the zone is a miracle.An unnamed rainy city and in its surrounding is the Zone, in this Zone is a Room, and ""here we are at the threshold. This is the most important moment of your lives. You have to know that here your most cherished wish, the most sincere one, the one reached through suffering"" is about to come true.If we don't make the effort to change our point of view we may pass on a tremendously poetic experiment. In fact ""Stalker"" may very well appear as three hours bore fest... But if we take five minutes of our precious time to confront our questioning then we would witness how cinema connects directly with our heart and maybe with our Soul.In ""Stalker"" we follow three different persons who share a unique goal, reaching the zone but have very different reasons to do so. The stalker is a guide who takes the willing to the 'zone'. One is a professor. It seems his motivation is to see the scientific significance of the area. He believes in science and in science only. He is a realist. The second is a writer who wants to recover his lost inspiration. He only believes in facts and in facts only. He is a cynic. They are both hopeless and looking to reveal the secret of the zone...But does the zone bare any secret? And if so how could someone incapable of Hope, reveal a secret based on a simple wish?The film is a voyage not only from a town to the zone but also from monochrome browns to realistic colors and more importantly from shadow to enlightenmentAs mentioned the stalker is the guide, he is genuinely searching for the right path through the zone and to the room. He is pondering every decision he takes, not rushing through the zone but testing the path and approaching side ways. He proceeds in a caution manner guided it seems only by his intuition. It is so irrational that it irritates the writer who decides to go through the zone in a more straight forward fashion. But as we understand the zone like Life is not straight forward, not always rational as it reflects our fears, our despairs and our disbelieves. In short life is dangerous and so is the zone... The professor says it himself ""going forward is scary but going back is shameful"" so maybe the stalker's way is the only possible way. Unlike the two intellectuals he has the intuition of what reality is.Eventually it seems our three protagonists are involved in a spiritual struggle. The problem is the scientist and the writer are in denial of this spirituality and the stalker is an intuitive being who can't put a name on his spiritual search. For them Reality ""is at best the result of the soul rubbing against the material world"" and at worst sequences of facts. So in essence if you go looking for something you don't really believe in or you can't apprehend...would you find it?At the doorstep of the room our three protagonists refuse to go in. The Professor wants to destroy the room; he is scared of what he can't comprehend. The writer endorses the Professor's choice to destroy the room. He is scared of facing his own shadows. They both lack Faith in Humanity. The Stalker doesn't go in either. His place in this world is to guide people his hope lies in others not in himself. He has Faith in Humanity. But the Stalker can't let the so called intellectuals destroy the last place where people can hope and believe again. He reminds them that Hope is ""all people have got left on this earth"". Hope is what makes us HumanThe disappointment of the Stalker is as big as his hope in the professor and the writer was, he had chosen carefully those two in the hope they will be able to put a name on his Faith, unfortunately they can't as if science and intelligence have nothing to do with Faith.A thunderstorm breaks out and rain starts to pore from the roof. Our three searchers sit down behind a water curtain reflecting on their incapability to hope and believe in the better of themselves. Everyday when I wake up I have endless doubts but every night when I go to sleep I have recover my Faith in me, in othersEveryday I search through the Zone of my Life and every night I stand at the doorstep of the Room",Stalker
139,jmalmsten,Infinity... Of... Something?,2,22 October 2018,"I know it's highly influential. I know the body of work of its director. I know how highly regarded it is.I know all that. But... For the life of me I cannot see what everybody else seem to see in this nearly 3 hours of a contemplative roadmovie of enlightenment.I remember stumbling over an old VHS cassette in a local library as a teen. I loved sci fi even then. And strange takes on cinematic language has always fascinated me. The blurb on the back intrigued me but when I saw it... All I could remember was boredom and endless shots of the three men doing nothing.A few years later I tried again, this time a DVD from another library. But again. It was a chore to get through. Though I remember that something was strange with the encoding that maee certain elements wiggle slightly compared with the rest of the scene. The Bed of the beginning and ending for example.And once more, today, I felt suddenly like I should give it another chance. I had obtained a nice Bluray in a boxsset of Tarkovsky blurays.I am intrigued by the elements that this film consists of. The enigmatic environment of The Zone, the boy with telekinetic powers, the hallway covered in sand dunes. The mysterious black dog that befriends the titular stalker... The haunting music... There is so much here that should work. So much I should loveBut when it comes down to it. It breaks apart. Its an endless series of excruciatingly long shots where the characters mumble half baked philosophies at each other. Each one uttered is worse thought through than the next. The Zone itself is reduced down to the most boring countryside imaginable. Everything about it is talked only about. Nothing is really ever shown. The stalker insists that the path constantly changes and any deviation from his instructions is mortally dangerous. And we are just supposed to take his word for it. Because god forbid we get to see the environment alter itself.. to see that there is any danger.. to see anything other than the endless takes of them mumbling during their travel toward The Room. I hesitate to say what they do when they finally arrive, in the interest of not spoiling too much... I'll just say that the runtime by then felt like an insulting waste...Very few films feel so long to witness as this one. Sure it is 2 hrs 45 min. But it felt more like 12 hours.Your mileage may vary of course. I may be in the minority. And I don't want to call the fans deluded. I just wish I could see the film you saw. I have tried three times now. On as many formats. Over 15 years. The ideas they are working with are fascinating , to say the least, which is probably why I have refused until now to give up on the film. But there is simply nothing here. Or at least, what is here have been explored by other filmmakers infinitely more efficiently.Show... Don't tell... That's a mantra I thought was well accepted by well renowned filmmakers and critics alike. I am not so certain any more.",Stalker

141,sean-curtin-517-748378,Has some interesting footage of a run down Russian town but that's about it,2,12 June 2013,"PLEASE NOTE: Spoiler alert(if that's possible).OK. Here's the movie in a nutshell. Man get's up in the middle of the night, wife get's cross and worried he'll get thrown into jail. Man leaves, meets up with a couple of people who have organised to meet him. They make there way through a curfew section of the city patrolled by police/law enforcement, in a Range Rover. They swap to a train car, that they use to get them out of the city into 'The Zone'.The Zone is simply outside the city and is beautiful simply because it's nature and scenery. There's objects such as concrete blocks, tunnels and misc run down rooms they walk through, there journey ends in a room where they all sit and throw rocks into the water.Then it cuts back to the city, man goes for a walk with his wife and kid, they talk, then his daughter puts her head on the table looks incredibly bored and appears to move some glass wear with a psionic ability. One glass falls off the table, the others stop, camera pans to her almost bored to death face end of film.Yes, I get that the poetic points that are mentioned and in particular the message: ""Weak is beautiful and strength is nothing, in that when a child is born it is adaptable and flexible. When the child becomes a man it get's hard and set in it's ways, therefore weak is far more beautiful than strength"", is a worthy one but hey 3 hours for that? Other points like this but ultimately nothing to do with the overall story which is simply that 'The Stalker' is simply someone who walks people through the zone which is essentially like a walk in the country in an effort to expand there minds from there otherwise pointless existence(talk about ironic, the Stalker is beyond pointless in himself to say the least). For some reason there not meant to go there. Why not is not really explained.(More than likely because some Russian dictator declared it was off limits to ordinary civilians for some reason(we see various signs of war amidst the rubble, bunkers, a gun etc but overall just a lot of pointless walking around scenes with absolutely no meaning, not even poetically).Overall this is an incredibly boring film and I have no idea why it get's such a high rating. As for watch it again. NO WAY, I'd rather stick red hot needles in my eyes.Seriously, don't waste your time, I only gave it 2 stars because 1. The scene in the practically war torn Russian streets was interesting and 2. for the finale at the end of the film which showed that had the movie focused on the talented young girl, it might have been great. Instead she was really depressed because her whole role got 1 minute at the end of the film and the rest of the film was essentially a tangential screed of rubbish.My strong recommendation for a movie with poetic license and far more impact and strong points but still has a great story and is actually endlessly re-watchable(especially if you get the Criterion Collection edition with the bonus versions), is the Terry Gilliam film BRAZIL.Watch that instead, you'll be glad you did.",Stalker
142,Oblomov_81,Journey into Fear,10,8 February 2003,"The characters at the heart of Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" are people who embark on an arduous journey only to discover that they had no idea what they wanted to gain from it. The central character is a ""stalker,"" a man who makes a living by illegally escorting people through a restricted area to The Room, a place where their greatest wish will supposedly come true. Exactly why the area is restricted is never made perfectly clear; in the novel this film is partially based on, ""The Roadside Picnic,"" it was a site where aliens briefly landed, and The Room was an object they left behind almost as if it were refuse. But Tarkovsky would rather not settle for such a flat explanation. To him, The Room is a place that means different things to the people who journey there, and the stark, ravished landscape they must journey through consists of the phobias and anxieties that they can hardly bear to face. The expedition the men experience is a long and often maddening one, and there are many scenes where the camera lingers on a beautifully composed shot so that the viewer can take time to understand how the characters fit into the settings and how those settings form both natural and supernatural obstacles.Andrei Tarkovsky was an artist who did not like giving solid answers to the questions his films posed. He sculpted his stories so that viewers who had the patience and self-discipline to stay attentive all the way through could draw their own conclusions. If there is any specific meaning to ""Stalker,"" it is that we have to fully understand anything for which we are willing to alter our lives.",Stalker

Don't even think about the S.T.A.L.K.E.R game series unless you really want to get confused. If you're a lazy asshole that you are, you could read the Wiki summary of the book (not recommended actually).
The book is actually offering you a lot of information about what's going on, with really solid details concerning unnatural phenomenons and the effects on human beings; sometimes it feels more like a synthesis - the book is pure science fiction and somehow it focuses less on human psychology; the movie is the opposite - it's all about human nature, and barely sci-fi; actually, it feels more like fantasy due to the low level of information. Everything in the movie is pretty confusing and it clearly follows a psychological path... it even reaches psychotically disturbing levels (more or less). Also, it's incredibly slow-paced - full of stunning visual captures; it really is a cinematic art... if I have to associate a musical genre to this movie, it would undoubtedly be funeral doom metal; another reason for that is the pessimistic and desperate nature of this movie.
So... is the book better than the movie? I don't know... maybe; but it really is the same thing looking through two perspectives - the book is specific and with a more scientific approach, and the movie takes everything to a metaphysical level. Both are good in different ways.",Stalker

I just wanted to address the debate on whether it is a science fiction film. In my view, it's a collage of multiple philosophical/ideological branches of thinking, while the science fiction story is merely a way to tie everything together in an interesting, dynamic way.

150,mariammansuryan,Changed me from outside in,10,20 August 2018,"This is the film that me think. Truly think. First it was a bore to watch but I would attracted to it afterwards like it was ecstacy or something. I wanted to see that smooth camera pan over the lake and feel the emotion of withdrawal and loneliness. In the future, I made many references to this movie in reading especially, like in Isaac Asimov's The Gods Themselves. The empty cave of unfulfilled dreams guided my life philosophy. We always want something, don't we? But all we really want is to know what we want, plain and simple. It's a search for purpose.The imagery here is magnificent, the world is a pathetic fallacy to the inner universe of a person, how those three decide to travel deep within to find some secret that will make all dreams come true. At least that's how I saw it for in my opinion as much as the Zone is an external space, it is equally internal too.In terms of cinematography, the film was spectacular. Tarkovsky had no unneeded shots, he was not afraid to have long, sometimes devastatingly long periods with nothing really happening. Of course music helped very much to alleviate the boredom, but after starting to gain some wisdom in this life I realized I was stupid to think anything here is boring. It's not boring, you call it atmospheric. Stalker is not a film for impatient moods, it's a film full of meditation, Stalker is a powerful work that's meant to be felt at least during the first watch and only then understood.Sometimes only the color, or the texture, or the sound or the dialogue would be the prominent feature of the scene, this way, Tarkovsky forces the viewer to concentrate on only one single thing, it's very minimalistic in a sense, and dissociating too.

152,vdg,Masterpiece or failure.,9,9 August 2004,"There are just two different ways of cataloging this film: a beautiful, poetic masterpiece, or a big failure from one of the most artistic director of all the times. Yes, both affirmations from above can be quite true. 1.	Masterpiece. For an art lover, or a good connoisseur of Tarkovsky's films, this movie comes floating like a dove on the water. The techniques used here are never the less brilliant, and Tarkovsky-an, if I can say thatThere are moments in the film that makes you say: STOP, rewind, PLAY it againand again..and again..and again!!! Even for me, with so many art movies that I've seen in my life, this one is difficult to fully comprehend. I've read the novel that this movie is based on, before seeing the movie, BUT, Tarkovsky doesn't follow the book too much, so it didn't really help me understand itOh well, after seeing it the fifth time, I can say that I have a better idea than the first timeJ 2.	Failure. Closed, hermetic, snobby, pretentious, boring ..etc. All those adjectives can be found in so many reviews about this film, and is quite understandable why. Tarkovsky did want YOU to understand so easy, he wanted to make YOU think about it, more and moreand in the end to still have more questionsComparing with all the other films by Tarkovsky, Stalker stands up as the most `difficult' one, and maybe that's why most of the critics are having hard time recognizing its true value!I have just one recommendation: watch the movie alone, in a dark room, with tons of volume from your receiver (get the 2 DVD version, with the newly re-mastered 5.1 sound). Watch it in one night, and then the second night do the same. Then take a pause of 2-3 days, and do it AGAIN!! After that MAYBE you can comprehend what this movie is all about.",Stalker
153,gatsby601,Fodder for the Film School Fops,6,14 August 2016,"Stalker is one of those 'important' films that people who call movies films are very serious about. I mean, they LOVE Stalker and if you don't LOVE Stalker the way they LOVE Stalker it's because you don't UNDERSTAND Stalker. As in, you like spolsions and car chases and all those western cinema (oh, they call movies cinema a lot as well) clichés while they appreciate mood and lighting and probably opera.So, to be clear, I understand Stalker. I understand the journey the characters undertake and why. I just wish they arrived at someplace a little bit more - ambitious.The fun takes place in a future time in an unnamed country (Estonia). One day, a meteor strike destroys most of a small community and leaves behind a danger zone called 'The Zone'. The cool thing about the Zone is the rules of reality don't apply there and it even features a special room called 'The Room' which grants wishes! Highbrow!That's all preamble, the story proper begins with the title character Stalker saying good-bye to his very unhappy wife and setting off on his latest guided tour of the Zone. The two members of his party referred to simply as 'The Writer' and 'The Professor', cause, you know, names are dumb, both hope the Room will grant them what their hearts desire, in their cases to be relevant and famous.The journey that follows is populated with series of long conversations about the meaning of life. Interesting I guess, except the topics soon become repetitive and the mood sullen. These are not nice people. The Writer stating all human actions are selfish except for the creation of art is as debatable and it is smug. The Stalker claims his motives for guiding people through the Zone are purely altruistic yet he routinely sends his clients in first when exploring a dangerous path while he brings up the rear. And the Professor has a hidden agenda which I won't spoil for you because if you make it to the third act you deserve some sort of reward.At about the 60 minute mark it became clear to me Stalker was going to be about the ride and not the destination. That's fine and as other reviewers have said it is a very, very pretty film to look at I just wish the characters had moved beyond the trite 'What's it all about anyway?' Sunday afternoon coffee shop chit chat and actually tried to come up with some answers for themselves.Near the end of the film Starkers party is able to deduce (based on nothing) what the Room really offers people. This reveal serves the plot but it's no great insight into the human condition. It certainly isn't worth the 2 hour wait it took to get there.",Stalker
154,tintin-23,The Zone,10,2 March 2008,"This film is loosely based on Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's ""Road Side Picnic,"" and Tarkovsky tried, as he did with his ""Solaris"" (1972), to downplay the science fiction aspect of ""Stalker."" Except for a brief explanation at the film's beginning, Tarkovsky chooses to ignore the speculations as to what could have created The Zone, and the changes within it.With ""Stalker,"" Tarkovsky marks the shift toward his later style, with the long takes throughout the film averaging one minute in length, with many four minutes or longer. These long scenes in turn rely heavily on the talent of the actors to sustain the mood, like Writer's long monologue in the sand mogul room. In ""Stalker,"" Tarkovsky is definitively more systematic in his use of black-and-white (sepia) and color stocks than he had been in his previous works. In the swamp scene and Stalker's dream, Tarkovsky reverts to is more usual convention, where dreams are shown in black-and-white, and reality in color. However, the last scene is in color, implying a leakage of the powers of The Zone into the outside reality.As always in Tarkovsky's films, the natural world is present. Water, which used to be the source of life, a redemptive force and a center of regeneration, is now mostly a symbol of decay and pollution. The only exception is in the dream scene in the swamp, where the water is somewhat restored to its positive symbols. In the last scene in The Zone, the men, resigned to their limitations and weakness, sit outside The Room, as the rain falls inside, gently blocking them from entering.The wind is associated with the spiritual, and the earth is a positive force. Upon arriving in The Zone, Stalker's first act is to lie down and embrace it, and in the swamp, all three men lay on it. Like a miracle, there is the luxuriant, if dangerous, Nature ever present in the Zone, in contrast to the polluted outside world, where it is totally absent.And then there is the mysterious dog, which first appears in the swamp scene. Up to this point, the men felt totally alienated from their environment, outside and inside The Zone, and it is at the very moment when they start to meditate and remember, that the dog appears: The Zone is its territory. But at the end of the film, the dog has followed Stalker outside the Zone, showing that even there, the hope that the men were looking for inside The Zone must somehow also exist here, outside, as the dog establishes its own space even though it becomes domesticated in the process.Although Tarkovsky usually favors classics by such composers as Bach, Pergolesi, or Purcell, the musical score in ""Stalker"" consists almost exclusively of Eduard Artemiev's electronic music mixed with some folk melodies, contributing efficiently to the hypnotic atmosphere of the film.The performances of Nikolia Grinko and Anatoly Solonitsyn, as two lost souls in search of an answer, are convincing. Aleksandr Kajdanovsky is outstanding in his role of a tormented and somewhat pathetic Stalker. Although Alisa Frejndlikh's appearance in the film is restricted to only few scenes, there are most powerful.In ""Stalker,"" Tarkovsky opposes a world in decline, polluted and sterile, to a verdant Zone, which has gotten the better of any human enterprises. He portrays a society which has severed all links with nature, with its own past, and lost its spiritual or moral bearings.""Stalker"" explores the conflict between science, rationalism, materialism, and cynicism versus spirituality, faith, art, and love. The three men embody different philosophical principles. Professor is a rational being who tries to understand the world according to the law of physics. He justifies his going into The Zone as purely scientific curiosity. Writer belongs to those people who cannot accept the world as it is. He is well aware of humanity's decay and of his own as well, but he abhors science, which he does not understand, and would rather look for answers in the supernatural. Writer believes in the redemptive power of art, but he has lost his own inspiration.Stalker is alone in showing an inclination toward faith. He knows The Zone and has total faith in it, speaking about it as if it were a living being. Stalker respects and fears The Zone at the same time, as he recognizes its potential to provide comfort to the wretched ones who, like himself, have lost all hope, but at the same time it punishes who so ever infringes its rules. This, of course, is how most religious people see their own Gods.The redemptive power of love is personified by Stalker's wife. Her love and devotion is the final miracle which opposes cynicism and the emptiness of the modern world. All these ideas are clearly expressed at the film's end, as she addresses the audience in her heartfelt monologue.As the three characters reach The Room, they can ask for their dearest wishes to be granted, but this would require a painful and searching self-examination, with the realization that what they thought they wanted was not exactly what they now really want. For Professor, his true aim was to destroy The Room, which was beyond his scientific understanding. Writer had said that the purpose of his journey was to regain his genius, his inspiration. However, on the threshold of The Room, he realizes that he may not worthy of accepting The Room's gift. As for Stalker, he asks for nothing of The Room, his only purpose to make the trip being to bring hope and happiness to those most retched than he.""Stalker"" is certainly Tarkovsky's most complex and most beautiful film, and is worthy of many viewings to appreciate its aesthetic and depth. Unfortunately, the word limitation of this review does not allow one to explore all the intricacies of this extraordinary film and do it justice.",Stalker

I guess you have to be of a somewhat poetic and gloomy disposition to really appreciate Stalker to its full.But it will take you on a journey you won't want to miss. I hope there will never be a English-language remake of Stalker(like Solaris).It's supposed to be in Russian,let it stay that way.",Stalker

In an unknown country and unspecified time, two men are led by the Stalker into the forbidden Zone, where a room exists that grants your deepest desires (known or unknown).  In plot terms, very little happens.  Yet Tarkovsky skillfully builds tension throughout, using some quite startling imagery.  The pace is definitely slow, but I found it quite gripping.Recommended.",Stalker
157,Darren-12,Even Heisenberg Would've Loved This Movie!,8,1 July 2003,"Dream-like story of a mystical room within a cordoned-off wasteland at the heart of run-down society. The room is supposed to fulfill the wishes of anyone who goes there, but is very difficult to approach and requires a guide (or ""stalker"") to help reach it. The film follows the progress of one stalker and his two latest customers (a scientist and a writer) during a day's journey through ""the zone"". Deeply philosophical themes of human desire and meaning are addressed, leaving the viewer with a LOT to think about, both during and after the movie.Tarkowsky was apparently obsessional about every single tiny detail of what appeared in every shot, and this resulted in the most visually perfect film I've ever seen: the stark black/white ""real"" world contrasting with the lush colours of the wild vegetation and crumbling buildings in the zone. The mood is set by the opening scene where the camera, VERY slowly, tracks into a bedroom, towards a chair being used as a bedside table, and then across the faces of a sleeping woman and child and then a man who is awake and looking back across the bed... so the camera tracks back the other way so you can re-view the scene in the knowledge that it is also being observed by the man. This is the only example I can think of in cinema of an attempt to address Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! And this is only the first scene! There are so many other stunning scenes, but one that stands out in my mind is the slow close-up tracking shot of discarded objects and debris in the bottom of a very shallow, slow-flowing stream of water - a microcosm of the whole film, and of human life in general - this is a scene that only Tarkowsky would ever have thought of doing.This is a ""proper"" film, a work of art, that will still be watched and appreciated in a thousand years' time.",Stalker

It is kinda nostalgic.The setting of the Zone is great, it is beautiful and creepy at the same time. The fog is amazing, the setting is really amazing. It doesn't feel staged, it looks really natural.Stalker is movie with gloomy mood. The director, Andrei Tarkovsky is Ingmar Bergman fan-boy....so yeah, now you know why and I hate Ingmar Bergman, so for me Stalker is just an OK filmBut I think he made better story than Bergman, his setting and cinematography arguably better than Bergman.If you are a movie fan that interested in the history of movie, yes you should watch this.

159,asen-75377,Master's finest masterpiece,10,17 May 2020,"Possibly Andrei Tarkovsky's finest work, 'Stalker' is the pinnacle of career-long preoccupation with memory, trauma and relationship between individual conception and physical reality.
This 1979 film his 2nd movie in science-fiction genre but very different from the 1st sci-fi Solaris (1971).The movie is an adaptation of a novel called Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers, Arkady and Boris. The film follows the story about An illegal guide called as Stalker(Aleksandr Kajdanovsky) leads a writer (Anatoliy Solonitsyn) and a scientist (Nikolay Grinko) into the heart of the devastation, the fiercely protected post-apocalyptic wastelan d called as 'The Zone' ,in search of a mythical place known only as The Room. Anyone who enters The Room will supposedly have any of his earthly desires will be fulfilled. Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere.
A haunting tale about journey into the deep of post-apocalyptic wasteland and it offers visual grandeur, mystries, premonitions. All I can say this is an emotionally and physically intense experience which wants repeat viewings. The more you watch this movie, the more you understand and enjoy it. The movie is like a hypnotic pull, drawing its viewer more and more deep into its own world.
Afterall, Stalker is a complex and indirect allegory that gives unforgettable images and philosophical meditation. A pure masterpiece which is visually remarkable and carries a poetic atmosphere with the presence philosophical thoughts.The basic idea of Zone-
It is brought into being years in the past by an incursion of aliens, and full of mysterious dangers that have been explored, illegally, over the years by freelance agents called stalkers (offering themselves, sometimes, as guides to doughty tourists)-is common to both book and movie.though there are some other theories about zone_
The Zone of the film was inspired by a nuclear accident that took place near Chelyabinsk in 1957. Several hundred square kilometers were polluted by fallout and abandoned. There was no official mention of this ""forbidden zone"" at the time.
The Gulag was the government agency which was in charge of the Soviet network of forced-labour camps which was set up by order of Vladimir Lenin. Some say that actually 'The Zone' was a representation of Gulag.",Stalker

It does have some incredible imagery and an intriguing concept. But wow, they couldn't have drawn this out more if they used a pencil. Crazy idea for editing this film.. but take each scene (with no dialogue, as there isn't a ton to begin with) and take them from 50 seconds to 5 seconds.

162,alexeykorovin,"As a true masterpiece, it's quite demanding to the viewer",10,6 May 2014,"As a teenager I recall not liking this movie. I found it too slow. E.g. in many points of the movie you'd be looking at a nearly static image. In one case, the main characters ride along the railway and the viewer has to watch the same scene for 2 (or maybe 3?) minutes.One certainly has to grow up and mature enough to be able to understand and then to enjoy the movie. Re-watching it in the age of 26 or so I liked it much more. Maybe I will like it even more again when I'm 50. That's exactly the pattern which works with the greatest, classic works. There are lots of messages in this movie including: 1. weakness is great, not strength 2. when the characters reached the room where wishes come true, they didn't wish for anythingInterestingly enough, this movie manages to create suspense and horror feel with very little means.",Stalker
163,De_Sam,Beautiful and thought-provoking,9,10 October 2015,"The first time I saw Stalker, it was a version shown on the television channel Arte (a high-brow culture channel originally available in Germany, but later in France and Belgium). As a native Belgian I know some French, but with the subtitles of the film in a language I did not fully understand I could not follow the dialogue quite as intended. However from this experience I could tell that the cinematography was excellent and more than enough to intrigue even the most confused viewers (as myself). Tarkovsky uses camera-movements with utmost effectiveness; only when necessary and with elegance. The acting is also very immersive, not under- or overplayed but just right.Having it seen again today, with subtitles in my mother-tongue and for a second time, I understood more, yet not everything. I believe Stalker to be a film you can watch many times and still not completely grasp it, if that were even possible.The philosophical questions it raises, the critique it expresses, all are left half- written, for the viewer to be completed. This leads me to my opinion that Stalker is a subjective experience when it comes to the story (and I know some people who judge a movie solely on this aspect).All that is written above is the pseudo-objective review on the film, what follows is my subjective interpretations, read on if you are interested in mine as to compare them with yours, but do not expect to find criteria with which you can judge the film. I am intrinsically introspective and look for meaning even in the most abstract forms -i.e. music. What I experience when watching Stalker may differ from you.The first thing I noticed was the heavy sepia-tone used in the 'outside world', an extension of the idea that in fact ""everyplace is a prison for me"". The only exception to this rule is the 'outside world' through the perspective of 'Monkey' the child. I interpreted this as an externalisation of her youthful naiveté, still fostering hope, in contrast to the protagonist who experiences the need of man to control and command nature, leaving no room for doubt, irrationality or hope. This abandonment of faith leads to despair, the fear of the nothingness and the conclusion that we are meaning-seeking creatures in a meaningless world (Camus). The protagonist tries to revive faith through the Zone and the Room, but in doing so the participants -not by change secularised intellectuals, have to believe in something they do not and are incapable of holding any faith; themselves and others. The 'professor' does distrusts others, leading him to destroy the chamber, the 'writer' does not trust himself, as shown in his refusal to enter the room after his deduction that only hidden desires are fulfilled ( the terrifying prospect of knowing your true shallow self).The inability of the professor and the writer to place confidence in themselves and others raises the question if faith in anything is even possible, ending the film on a rather nihilistic tone.",Stalker
164,poewilson,Poison and Humanity,9,4 October 2017,"The P.H. Metric 88/100Directing: 9/10The directing is sublime yet minimal, the Hitchcockian long takes are beautiful and really set the tone for the film, in addition these long takes allow for fewer continuity errors and keeps the film on point and in focus. Couple all this with the fact that this film is an art piece the direction truly deserved to be praised.Acting: 6/10Acting takes a hit, even though there are very few roles to fill, we can see the actors that are used are not truly in their prime, however Tarkovsky uses this to his advantage and uses their less than stellar delivery to provide an earnest performance that feels natural and powerfully human.Cinematography: 9/10I am a sucker for a long take (Rope is one of my favourite films simply because of long takes) and Stalker uses the long take to create a beautifully drab portrayal. Especially near the end of the film the camera lingers reminding you that pain anguish and suffering are not something that are truly expressed in modern jump cut terms.Editing 8/10The editing is far simpler in this film than most, this is again due to the long takes. With far less film to connect together it makes it easier to make the edits seamless.Score: 10/10The natural tones and sounds are perfectly cued and match the film's tone perfectly. In turn it is hard to fault a film that uses only natural sounds to highlight nature.Visual Effects: 9/10The visual effects are limited to increase the natural aesthetics of the film.Writing: 9/10The writing is superb. The tangents that each character goes on are cutting and to the point, but with a poetic essence that rivals a work of literature. The words that spill from the writer's mouth are by far the best in the entire film and speak of the hopelessness of humanity as well as its desire to continue on.Production Design 10/10They shot in legitimately toxic locations for authenticity. How can you fault that other than saying that is insane, but artistically beautiful.Costume Design 9/10There is not much in the way of costume designs, save for the military figures, so there is nothing truly to complain about. What is delivered to the viewer is authentic and visually pleasing.Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10See costume design.",Stalker

This movie is no different than AK's other movies, The movie is about aliens, zone but you wont see anything which is usually expected in this genre, like too much make up, cool gadgets, aliens and what not..but instead here these are just in the background for three mens to search their souls, find the true meaning of life and being human.

While the excellent novel by the great Soviet SciFi authors, the brothers Arkadi and Arkadi Strugatski, was a robust and irreverent adventure story, Tarkovski's version gets stuck in the typically ponderous territory Tarkovski seems happiest to inhabit. Instead of a relatively straightforward, intelligent scifi story, Tarkovski delivers endless discussions on theology, science and art from the three main character -- often while they lie down in puddles of mud. As much as mainstream critics love Tarkovski, I have to admit that this time he went in a different direction from what I would have preferred. Maybe I'm just an ignorant barbarian, but people lying down in puddles whiling about their misery is no replacement for an actual plot.",Stalker

168,ryancarroll88,"With ""Stalker"" expect to be absorbed but not fulfilled",9,16 October 2010,"Andrei Tarkovsky is by all means an impossible director: his meticulous long-shots seem to unravel time itself; his sparse philosophical dialogue creeps into your vacuous head and spins around; his characters seem to be more caught up in themselves than in the world around them. All of this together creates a necessarily cerebral product, a film that both requires and repels your attention. With this methodology, Tarkovsky created some of his greatest masterpieces, including ""Andrei Rublev"" and ""Solaris,"" and it is a methodology that does not exist whatsoever in Hollywood (the closest resemblance might be Gus van Sant's ""Gerry""). Because of this, watching a Tarkovsky film is always a change, a change that I usually welcome.OK, now that that's out of the way, on to the movie. ""Stalker"" is a film that stretches the definition of sci-fi and fantasy. The setting very much relies on the viewer's imagination; it is clear that the actors are just parading around the Russian wilderness and a dilapidated country town, but the mood and atmosphere created by the long shots transform these common sceneries into mysterious territories known as ""The Zone"" and ""The Town."" The Zone is sanctioned off from the public by the government, but people known as ""Stalkers"" guide people through the zone. We watch as one Stalker leads a writer and a scientist through The Zone in search of The Room, a place where your wishes come true. Nothing in the film is given a definite label - descriptors are essentially proper nouns and the world is left too ambiguous for proper definition. This sparseness is actually what gives the film it's strength, because it plays on the exact idea that Tarkovsky is trying to display - a blend of the conscious and subconscious. On their journey to The Room, the characters reveal themselves to us piece by piece, what they desire and what their life means to them, but rarely is it through direct action, and most of the time the camera isn't even focused on them. This leads to a hypnotic composite of fantasy and reality, a confusion of what the character can and cannot control. What we are supposed learn is that our deepest darkest desires always betray what we want. What we witness for our characters is a loss of self and place in a setting that we don't understand.The plot of ""Stalker"" could easily be compiled into a 15 minute short and contain the same message, but that would betray the beauty of the film. However, I don't think that Tarkovsky's devices are necessarily to be praised for the film's effectiveness - like I said before, the craft of the movie was simply enough to make a cerebral product that will infect your brain, but the substance leaves a little to be desired. The writing itself is not that great and seemed to be checkered throughout when Tarkovsky felt like something needed to be thrown in. I also can't necessarily affirm that I understood the movie; still, the thought of watching it all again to understand it more fully seems a little too daunting right now. If you do watch it, expect to be tantalized, but not to be blown away.",Stalker

He's a serious movie buff and knows more about movies than anyone else I know, and he's recommended many good movies. He totally missed the mark on this one in my opinion. First off... it is long! Almost 3 hours so watching it is a commitment. Second... It's boring! Mind numbing boring! These guys spend this whole time wandering around the woods talking.... and talking... and talking. thirdly, the ending is pretty much absolute non-sense in my opinion. They are headed to the ""zone"" where all their wishes can be obtained in it. Some magical mystical place on earth that grants wishes. The director builds up getting to this magical place only to reach the ""zone"", and the plot takes a twist and getting there becomes this MASSIVE non-event.After wasting close to 3 hours of my time on it... I was pretty upset at the ending and the fact I even watched it. I really felt that I was duped. When I saw my friend next I pretty much went off on him over his recommendation... he laughed at me but completely understood why I was upset... but stood by his original statement that this is one of the best sci-fi movies out there...

170,maryolalov,Not a typical science fiction movie,9,13 February 2017,"Tarkovsky has made many movies but in my opinion Stalker (1979) is his best work. This movie isn't a typical science fiction, it's something more. It shows us the pain of the characters and how hard their life is. Of course thanks to Tarkovsky's great directing we can experience all this. A glaring example are the contrasts in the movie - in the beginning the movie is black and white but when the stalker enters the Zone the movie suddenly becomes ""colored"", this little detail shows the audience how hard and painful is the stalker's life outside the Zone and how happy he is inside. Stalker was inspired by Strugatsky's book ""Roadside Picnic"" and the Strugatsky brothers are also the writers of the movie. Still the movie isn't a book adaptation. In my opinion this movie is worth watching. The great directing skills of Tarkovsky are combined with the great writing skills of Strugatsky which makes the movie great. It's really emotional and dramatic but still it manages to keep its fictional character.",Stalker

Second because the director managed to set a philosophical debate that doesn't get you bored (and the film is 3h long). I think the 'journey motif' it's what moves the action forward, and keeps you watching. Also the mood and the jumpy characters contribute to overwhelming sensation of unknown to be discovered. This film leaves space for interpretation and character analysis. It does not serve 'fast processed food' but let's you indulge in the cinematographic feast. Third because 'Stalker' was made in social realism period in USSR and somehow it gives me an impression of much freedom. I think the director managed to compromise without loosing his integrity.

172,miagy,"An Unknown area, The Zone or The Path to God ?",8,28 March 2005,"I have seen Stalker just for one time and have to say here that I was almost confused in some parts of the movie. Too slow camera motion , worded conversation and many more ( now I'm not speaking about the art level of the movie - it is great) . But it could be due to the fact that I watched it when I was tired and maybe I couldn't focus on it. But now when I have already thought about it I suppose I can see the point of it. Next to the drawn human minds and men's deeds and instincts I found the similar path to the god. It is also guarded,it is hard to reach , not for everyone, but finally you feel heavenly great and your dreams come true. Some people are afraid to come in to the chamber - they are not prepared or are feared - the same with reaching the God. And when you want to destroy it - all for you the mythology or fairy tell - in your eyes - those who live only for it will try to stop you by any means that necessary. They blindly believe and don't hesitate to sacrifice a man - friend , brother . But after reaching that final point that can see their former deeds and than the suicide it the only suitable choice.So it was what I found in the Stalker. I believe that it is unnecessary to prove the artistic value of the movie that is something that everyone will feel while watching it. The acting was also very good but what impressed me the most was the chosen scenery where the story took place. It was - I believe - common heritage of the former industry in Soviet union - heavy industry factories break down by nature.",Stalker

If you see a movie labelled as Sci-Fi do you expect space action? If so, then this is not for you.If you have seen Tarkvosky's Solaris and enjoyed it, then you will appreciate more of the same.

This is the same sort of ""science fiction"", although Man from Earth is a lot easier to consume.Every word counts in this movie. This is all the more challenging if you are reading subtitles because they are doing their best to call out key thoughts and philosophies. There are barely a handful of sentences throughout the movie that explain what happens at the end, so if you don't pay attention you might miss them.Note that although the movie is very closed related to Strugatskiy's ""Roadside Picnic"" (Strugatskiy was involved in the screenplay), it is not a movie version of that book. There are significant differences between core characters and final outcomes, however there are also some nice references to incidents that occurred in Roadside Picnic.I rate it a 9 for bringing philosophy to the screen, for it's long, silent cuts, and incredible visuals on a small budget.",Stalker

I doubt I could be that brave were I to make a film.

I had read the book by Brothers Strugatski before seeing the movie and I think those two narratives are quite different. The book supplies us with the necessary background as Tarkovski never bothers to give any explanations in his film. I will not try to persuade anyone in 'Stalker's virtues - this film is way beyond that. I am sure it will be hated by many, but - with no intention of sounding rude - I couldn't care less. There have only been a handful of movies that, in the process of me watching them, have given me the intense feeling of penetrating to the essence of things - and God at its heart - thus bringing tears to my eyes.

176,pixfarina,A master class of story telling and film making.,10,10 January 2021,"Tarkovsky's Stalker is a truly beautiful film. Relying on a mixture of script and wonderful cinematography portrays the mysterious 'Zone' and a bleak dystopian world that surrounds it. A large part of science fiction is analogy, and in Stalker Tarkovsky uses the Zone to portray and explore the human heart, a common feature in his work. At it's core Stalker is a movie about hypothesis and realization, and if that puts you off, then this film if probably not for you.The acting is great and Tarkovsky's mixture of lingering and continuous camera shots creates space to explore the thoughtful subplot of the movie, which revolves around the what peoples inner most desires really are.The Zone is a cordoned off and forbidden area where some past alien event created a strange and as yet not understood environment. The 'Stalker' is a guide to this 'Zone', a man who was born there, and he is employed to illegally bring a scientist and writer to the center of the Zone where a room exists, a room that if one enters can fulfill their wishes. However the wishes are the afore mentioned inner most desires and these are not always what people think of realize.The spoiler is this; the Stalker believes the room does not work for him and so feels like his life is empty and defined only by his ability to enter and guide others into the forbidden Zone. But his wife explains in an address to the 4th wall that she chose him, despite everyone knowing Stalkers were strange and had odd children. In her confession she reveals she has no regrets, but it seems obvious that she is what the Stalker wished for, a companion and someone to love him. His inability to see that and instead see himself as an unhappy and unfulfilled being is proof of what the 'Writer' talks about as they travelled together through the Zone; about human's ability to author their own misery by not realize what fulfillment actually is.At two and half hour Stalker is a wonderful and thought provoking journey from the mind of a director who it has to be said, has a marvelous sense of mystery, the extraordinary and story telling. Stalker is a classic that perhaps only Russian cinema could have made. The art of cinema is not all about block busters, big names and huge budgets. Stalker has none of those things, yet explores areas of human experience using the art of film making in a way that few other movies have.The 2018 Hollywood film 'Annihilation' is obviously a take on Stalker, but is a radically different film. Tarkovsky's other sci-fi masterpiece, Solaris, was also remade by Hollywood, and that too is a completely different film.

I can't figure out how to put this (I think this will probably be one of my shorter reviews as a result). It's a masterpiece. Hands down, one of the best science-fiction films ever. Everything I've had issues with in my other Tarkovsky reviews have become mastered (besides Andrei Rublev (1966) because I had no issues from that). It perfectly - perfectly - balances entertainment and art. The story is so engrossing, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Each line of dialogue was informative, realistic, and poetic; being executed to perfection by the actors. Every performance was top notch. The cinematography blew my mind - there were moments (a lot of them) where I could not figure out how they filmed complex sequences. The amount of meaning in every shot, action, and detail in frame brought me to tears. Tears simply because of how incredible this film is. (I'm sorry but I really can't find the any other words to describe this film.) You can't describe the Sistine Chapel in words. You have to experience the Sistine Chapel (trust me I have). That's the feeling that was imprinted on me when I watched this film. You can't describe it, you have to experience it. And when you do, it'll leave you speechless. Great art doesn't require explaining, it requires feeling. This film has that feeling. Every person involved with this film sacrificed it all. Tarkovsky, his wife, and Anatoliy Solonitsyn (definitely one of my favorite actors of all time) sacrificed their lives to make this (see my Tarkovsky biography for more information). Stalker (1979) stands as a testament to what an artist is willing to sacrifice to create art. Art that pushes the boundaries of human nature, thought, and life. Tarkovsky has done it again.",Stalker

I hope I get the chance to see it in the theater or a released on DVD because the video version is of a horrible quality not giving it any justice. I always talk to my friend about Tarkovsky and he appreciates him, respects him, but hates watching his films.  They are very long, very slow, and can be very boring. But in this time of compressed stories with meaningless one liners and fast paced action and cutting he stands out as a testament to a higher potential for filmic story telling.  I have seen a couple of his other films but Stalker is my favorite. An excellent brainy sci-fi flick which can be enjoyed on a base level or ridden out as intellectual head trip. The choice is yours to make but I recommend seeing it at least once, and if you did not like it the first time then please watch it again.",Stalker
181,mligorio,The eternal quest for fulfillment,8,9 January 2012,"The Stalker is one of many itinerants who spend much of their lives wandering through the Zone. It is an area that has been strictly quarantined by authorities due to an unexplained disaster that may have been caused by extraterrestrial beings or some unforeseen cosmic event. Due to his special knowledge of the area, the Stalker agrees to lead two men, a Professor and a Writer, through the Zone to a special place called the Room, where it is believed that one's most cherished wishes will come true.Much has already been said about Tarkovsky's 'slow motion' cinematographic style. Many like it, and, not surprisingly, many find it boring. However, judging from some of the other reviews, it appears that very little may been said about what the story actually means.On a symbolic level, the zone represents the mysterious workings of the human psyche and all the chaos and confusion therein. The professor represents logical reasoning, which, unfortunately, has been corrupted by a penchant for self-destruction. The writer represents our ability to dream and create things of beauty, however, he lacks inspiration. Unfortunately, despite being highly conscientious, humanity has nevertheless failed to achieve a harmonious relationship with nature, in particular, our own. It is to achieve this natural harmony that drives the Stalker to return to the Zone time and time again. To the Stalker, waterfalls, wild herbs, and warm sunshine are paradise compared to the dull, drab atmosphere of an industrial district. It is an emotionally inspiring experience he needs to share with others if only to make his own impoverished life meaningful. Yet, even he does not dare to take the final step towards eternal bliss.Like many of us, the three travelers don't actually know what it is that will truly make them happy, but it is certainly not the amenities of a technologically advanced civilization. It seems that everything that they had worked so hard to build, including social relationships (love affairs, friendships, families, professional partnerships, etc), lies about them in ruins, shut out, abandoned and left to waste. And, even though their goal appears to be only a short distance away, they cannot truly reach fulfillment unless they take the errant journey through desolation and despair that will bring them to a better understanding of themselves. However, the Stalker's companions are reluctant to take this circuitous route, partly because it requires a great deal more mental and physical effort, and partly because of an almost superstitious fear of the unknown.Is there any hope for these hapless itinerants, or are they doomed to wander aimlessly for the rest of eternity in a vain search for truth or some purpose to what would otherwise be a meaningless existence? By the end of the film, perhaps you will agree that there is still hope for humanity. That we are resilient enough to endure whatever hardships may befall upon us, and that because of the power of the human imagination, we will ever be capable of raising ourselves to still higher levels of conscious.",Stalker
182,Alexandar,"Mesmerizing, intelligent and haunting yet overlong and inconsistent",9,11 January 2005,"Stalker (1979)***½ Stalker is rich, spiritual and contemplative journey through the fantastic inner world of human's hope, desire, disillusions and believes. Main characters, Writer (as incarnation of irrational, imaginative and emotional aspects of our nature or subconsciousness) and Scientist (rational, logic forces or consciousness) are guided by Stalker (symbolizing our desire, will and everlasting search of meaning) to the mysterious Zone (which may represent all our spiritual goals, meanings, struggles to achieve them and barriers in our path). Breathtaking and mesmerizing images and sounds, witty dialog and strong concept are the major virtues of this feature. Writer's monologues are among the most meaningful, thought-provoking and spiritual moments I ever experienced in any art. But the movie is overlong losing its powerful initial momentum and becoming inconsistent in it's final message (by final I don't mean last in chronology but overall). Tarkovsky's earlier SF drama ""Solaris"" is more structured and fully developed. Nevertheless, Stalker is an outstanding piece of art movie that puts its director among the few true cinema masters.

183,MightyAlz,Perhaps the quintessential ART movie...,4,6 September 2007,"You know, I love art-house movies - Jodorowsky, Anger, Bertolucci, Wenders, Warhol, it's all good. But there's a line which mustn't be crossed. That's the line between justified and unjustified pretension. In other words, when does your film become arty without being entertaining? Well, for me, Stalker crosses that line.OK, the good points. It's wonderfully shot. The contrasting colour and B&W works well at differentiating between the industrial landscape of the city and lush green growth of the zone. Some of the images here would work better hung in a gallery So what's my problem? It's slow. OK, let me rephrase that - it's so slow I think I could see my hair growing faster than the film was moving. Compared to this, Paris, Texas was a mile-a-minute riot.I mean, what can you say when one plot element means it takes about 15 minutes just to cross a field? It would be something if the film was actually going somewhere, but the film just ends sort of inconsequentially. No re-balancing of equilibrium - they just go from nothing to nothing.So call me a mainstream sellout if you want, but I like plot, I like colourful dialogue, I like characterisation, all to a moderate extent. Oh sure, you can analyse this film all you want, but you know, you can analyse Warhol's Empire to death too; nothing changes the fact that it's just the Empire State Building doing nothing for 5 hours.I dunno, maybe it's just me, but this is exactly the kind of ""art"" movie that Monty Python was always so good at ridiculing.",Stalker
184,SusanHampson,Strangely compelling,8,24 August 2014,"HORRIBLE SPOILERS (well just my take on it really) but please DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT.Whoa. This is a strange one. I watched it at a small viewing in London. The film is slow but strangely compelling as the imagery is nothing short of sublime. Who cares that nothing is happening when every screen shot is more vivid and haunting than the last? A truly strange picture postcard offering of a film. And it's offering a truly surreal world within a silent landscape - the characters are almost unnecessary. I was happy just watching each eerie frame, each one eerier than the last.The three main characters however all share a rugged appeal and after about an hour (I know that seems a long time) I started to realise that ""the zone"" that the stalker (for stalker read guide) takes the two fee-paying intellectuals into, is in fact their own minds. And when it comes down to it, their minds are beset with all the ignorance of the true intellectual. This is a mind-bending watch but enjoyable nevertheless. My take on it is that I think the stalker represents a therapist and he is trying to help the two characters but they don't want help, and rail against true healing. After a lot of travelling through a wild, dangerous landscape, when they are actually on the verge of that happiness that they have paid to find, they reject it. As they sit outside the door of enlightenment, they are so shaken that one tries to blow it up (a professor) and the other denies it (a writer), who prefers to hold on to his own misery - not as if his life depended on it - but his life does actually depend on it. This part of the film was frustrating to me as I realised the two men were cowards.This is a truly deep meditation on being human and how some (maybe all of us?) will choose misery over happiness as we are comfortable with it, we know what it is, it is life, is it not. Anything else is just plain scary and too daunting, however much we think we want change. This film is a true masterpiece. This is the first film I have watched from this director. I hope all his films are as deep and as mysterious as this one. 8/10 from me.",Stalker

186,WeHaveSixFeet,The most unutterably boring picture I've seen this year.,1,13 August 1999,"Based on a kind of neat science fiction story, Tarkovsky has made an unutterably boring, molasses-slow, dreary film full of portentous babble. The story is minimal, oozing out slowly over 160 incredibly long minutes. If you watch the film on fast forward, the plot picks up a bit, but not much.  Don't be confused:  this is in no way a science fiction picture. It's pretentious, talky navel-gazing by an over-indulged director.",Stalker
187,Sheol1812,Walk Away from the Abyss,10,23 October 2021,The beauty of this - and every other Tarkovsky film - lies in its simplicity. Stalker is one of the most brutally honest films I have ever seen. It does not try to hide things from the viewers. It does not try to set up the viewers. Stalker simply guides the viewer to the edges of human nature (more so than any other film) and leaves them dangling there to reflect. It is a film of Shakespearean proportion with all the perks that come from the designation.,Stalker
188,eblien,Impossible to rate,7,28 November 2014,"Should you see this movie? Definitely YES, but you have to be aware that this is a 70'es Russian movie, a classic one, but the way to tell a story is slightly different from what we are used to in the west. Not in a dramatic way, though.First of all: This is not sci-fi, not a bit! Yes they mention aliens as a possibility, but that is not important, and there is no ""science"" here at all. Not that it matters. Yeah, and there are ""traps"" but I feel this is more psychological things, not literally. In a spiritual way.On my first attempt I was bored like hell, I found the dialog to be disjointed and weird, like when the woman says ""Why did you take my watch? Where are you going, I'm asking you"" or later on, a character called The Writer is trying to be philosophical: ""There is no Bermuda triangle. There's only a Triangle ABC that equals Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim"". Like he is trying to be technical in a childish way. And why did the lady drive off with his hat on the roof . ? Then the slowness, the not very excellent sound effects and three people seemingly getting nowhere. I switched off after nearly an hour and was ready to give it up and forget about it. I totally understand some of the bad reviews. Then I started to think and I wanted to give it another chance. No matter how bad it is, I cannot rate something I haven't fully seen, right? So the next day I sat down with an extremely open mind, played it from the beginning, paid attention to all the dialogue, tried to absorb and understand the emotions. And it paid off! I am not yet a huge fan, but somewhere in between. Definitely a decent experience. All the good outweighs the bad.The story is linear and quite easy to follow. The dialog is something else, the talk is not always very clear, but pay attention to it nonetheless. And there is use of symbolism all over the place. But look at it this way: Like a dream. You may not always understand the meaning of it all, but it affects you. Probably you will understand more deep down than you could express in words.Give it a chance, but only when you are wide awake, with an open mind, and do not expect to understand it all. Never mind the occasional weirdness",Stalker
189,souplipton,"A Top 3 Films of All Time, If Not the Greatest Ever Made",10,22 July 2015,"Stalker is a work of art, one of the supreme creations in the medium. This does not only refer to the visual mastery present in the film, but also to the profound ideas discussed in the narrative. Visually, the film flows beautifully, with long takes throughout, often portraying the faces of the three main characters, giving us a glimpse into their inner worlds, or of the zone itself, alive and lush in contrast to the drab sepia toned world portrayed at the beginning of the film. The sound design is spacious and echoing, giving the world an alien feel which perfectly fits with the stalker's reverence for the zone. Anatoliy Solonitsyn is perfect as the writer, and the performance of the professor is very good, but the stalker delivers a performance which feels sadly desperate. The narrative itself discusses topics such as the meaning of life, mankind's true desires, the goals of the artist and nature of belief. If you want to find a film to change your view on the potential of the medium to work as art and as profound commentary on philosophic ideas, look no further. Stalker is essential cinema.",Stalker

I watched it in Russian dubbed English, but this isn't a film by anybody's standards.It's a journey (3hrs).

And I did.It simply and modestly ashames every directors I've enjoyed so far. They saw it, and copied the excellence. To a lower extent. Where did they film this (Estonia)??? What budget??

This is a movie with long shots, a lot of philosophical dialogue and very little action. After watching this movie you will probably need to sit down and write all your thoughts and theories you have about the movie to fully grasp everything you managed to discern. After that you most likely need to rewatch the movie to confirm or reject your theories and to see if you have missed anything.

This is not my type of movie. When I watch a movie I want to feel something. I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to shout at the characters, I want to be appalled, but this movie offers almost nothing of that sort. This is, in my opinion, the only flaw of the movie, but it is a crucial flaw.

195,BodhisattyaPal,My Interpretation,9,16 January 2020,"Stalker(1979) - Andrei TarkovskyAn unusual setting, a mysterious stalker, a forbidden area - 'The Zone', a professor & a writer, a journey to find the truth, a wheel of events, a drenched conclusion - A legendary filmmaker with his most complex work - 'Stalker'.Tarkovsky, one of the greatest filmmakers of Russia, loved to stay neutral & give audience an open ending cinema. His works are complex, tangled yet poetic, lyrical, spiritual and metaphysical.Stalker - the so called sci-fi drama is a slow paced poetry full of metaphors which is both weird and stunning, art at its best. Both time & patience is needed to understand this deep work of art. But as they said that you have to first feel a film, before understanding. It's really just beyond understanding, it's an otherworldly experience, you have to live it.So no individual interpretation matters here. You should experience this monumental work yourself and explain as you like. That's why Tarkovsky made it like that. As he used to say -
""A book read by a thousand different people is a thousand different books.""Still, I tried to interpret it in my own way. You could have absolutely different thinking, you should! And there lies it's legacy. So experience the film & then proceed further to check if we have any similarities of thoughts. Discussions are always thrilling!COLOURS & HUES: Tarkovsky shoot 'The Zone' in vivid greenish colour but rest of the film in sepia. It was like our dreams. The real world seems to be full of despair but our fantasies are always colorful. Also, this serious contrast indicate that in the zone, there was no human to pollute the air, so it stayed colorful & full of green.A JOURNEY: As they said, journey is more beautiful than the destination.. 'Stalker' is a story of a journey. In the zone there was river, tunnel, desert, greenery. The revelation of human mind, intention & moral through a journey, where outcome doesn't matter.HUMANITY: Tarkovsky is famous for humanist theme in his film. We could see three characters; the professor - representing the logical part of human, the writer - representing the artistic & intellect part, and that mysterious stalker - the perplexed mind. They wanted to fulfill their wish, they wanted to reveal the truth. But both the logic & intellect failed to believe in miracle, they failed to enter in 'the room' (a mysterious room which can fulfill one's innermost wish). The doubted if there was any darkest of wish hiding in them. Through lots of philosophical talk, Tarkovsky unfolded the complexity of human mind, the depth of human desire but the lack of believe.FAITH & HOPE: It was absolutely the central theme of this movie. To experience a miracle, you have to first believe it. We can see lack of believe lead the writer & professor to a unsuccessful journey. But the stalker has plethora of faith & respect in 'The zone' & 'The room'. At last he laments - ""they are born to some purpose! That
they 'have a calling'! For they live 'only once'! How can such ones believe in anything?............ And nobody believes. Not only those two. Nobody! Whom should I lead in there? Oh, God... And the most
terrifying thing is ... that nobody needs it anymore. And nobody needs that Room. And all my efforts are worthless!""Also there was acts of hope. The stalker's wife said, ""It's just such a fate, such a life, such us. And if there was no grief in our life,
it would not be better, it would be worse. Because then there would be ... neither happiness, nor hope. That's it.""SPIRITUALITY & RELIGIOUS RELEVANCE: In the film, the stalker was almost like a priest who was leading people to the Supreme & telling them to keep faith in God. In several scene the spiritual nature of the film is evident. From the picture of Jesus under water to those Christian cross like electric post - all are pointing same, as the believing in God is fading in front of technology & intellect!UNPREDICTABILITY: Surely there is not much turn & twist, it's an intense art house film, so it's unlikely. But it still so much unpredictable. You would always keep expecting something coming. A chilling mood was always intact. When you are expecting something fast, it's really slow then, and when you are ready for some slow moment, it's lighten fast there. Also it's genre is sci-fi, but don't expect any thing like typical sci-fi movies. There is no mind blowing concept, no hybrid technology & no extraterrestrial engagement. But still it's among the most significant sci-fi movies, you will understand after experiencing it.THE ENDING: 'Stalker' have an absolute bizarre ending scene where the abnormal child of stalker practicing 'telekinesis' with three glasses on table. It may be just because of the trains, as we saw in very first scene if the movie. But probably it's a deep metaphor indicating that what science & intellect can't do, believe alone can. And this is the most vital theme of this work of art.TRICKERY: Now, at last, think what if 'The Zone' was nothing but a creation of the stalker himself, everything related to zone was only his fantasies & he did it because he wanted a place where everyone will obey him & he will be only one to know the place, kind of emperor! There were no fifth man to justify anything. Think about that dog. Where did it come from? Was it stalker's pet? In the last part the dog was behaving as stalker & his wife are familiar to him. Not impossible. That's why it's a masterpiece!LEGACY: There's a horrific side of the coin. The shooting place was a abandoned nuclear factory, so the lethal radiation summoned cancer in Tarkovsky & some other crew members, which ultimately lead to death. The film was shoot under extreme conditions. But the exceptional point was it predicted the sinister Chernobyl disaster 6 years before, astonishing! And now 'Stalker' is regarded as one of the greatest sci-fi art film.Let me know your personal thoughts about the masterpiece. Thank you.",Stalker

I couldn't even figure out how that shot could have been made -- regardless of how long you worked on setting it up and how much resources you put into it. It's as if Tarkovsky had a huge team of painters and sculptors who could see and create his vision so that it could then be shot.The sets, the photography, the pacing, the music -- the CINEMATIC quality of this movie is incredible.

I was not able to forget this great honest minute in cinema, and I am very happy having seen this before my children became eight, nine, ten years old. Yes, I felt something, back in the days I was watching ""Stalker"", and 'understood' the lines by Khalil Gibran ""Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself."" But my culture had taught me: I have to preserve my children from something, keep them away from my feelings. Marta's father simply did nothing to her...That most people don't know what hope is, what wishes are, and that there is no need to do anything to ""make it come true"" - these issues I had understood instantly; I had anticipated most of the upcoming events in the story because there was enough time while watching this film. The lack of surprises was not the 'boring' aspect - that was to stand the lies and how they eat up the power from the men. Through ""Stalker"" I learned what boredom is to me - simply the lack of truth. Since truth is always within myself boredom is the barred inner paths. Another film I saw that days, ""Teorema"" by Pasolini, was like a supplement to this inner knowledge. Both cleaned up something for my whole life.I gave the movie a second title: ""When three liars go for a walk"".But there is a look in the girls eyes at the end that cannot be played, that is always there in the eyes of children who had understood that they will die. (In ""Nostalghia"" they are missed.) Don't fake yourself with discussions like ""Is this science fiction or not"". Every movie is fiction and this has not much to do with science although there is a professor on the phone.In ""The Sacifice"" (""offret"") Tarkowski solved his own riddle. Marta knew, and nobody was able to listen so she had nothing to say. May the water pour into our rooms of wishes. May there sometime be someone who covers us. Before the last rest.",Stalker
200,phobonnika,The greatest film of all time.,10,2 February 2013,"What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? A guide leads to men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes. To show no respect for this film is to sin. From a cinematographic viewpoint looking in, it's most certainly close to flawless. Tarkovsky presents to us a journey into the heart of darkness, through the eyes of the breathtaking decadent beauty of the Soviet Union's cinema, by way of what could be an exhibition in a gallery for us to breathe and to absorb. Tarkovsky is one of the most impeccable and original directors, if not the most, of all time, hailed by Ingmar Bergmam as simply: 'The Master', and Stalker represents the height of what the human mind is capable of casting on a screen. Many a time has Stalker been criticised for being too slow paced, too drawn out; but my goodness does it work. It will weld us to our seat with some sort of invisible energy the poetic acting, an awe-inspiring location, and engrossingly reflective concepts throw at us. Such wisdom, such aura, such an off- the-wall perspective laced with metaphor. An encapsulating quote from Stalker reads as follows: ""While I am digging for the truth, so much happens to it that instead of discovering the truth I dig up a heap of, pardon... I'd better not name it. A man writes because he is tormented, because he doubts. He needs to constantly prove to himself and the others that he's worth something. And if I know for sure that I'm a genius? Why write then? What the hell for? The Zone wants to be respected. Otherwise it will punish."" The nature of the zone itself: its mystery, its tantalising fear and its stagnant silence elevate to one of the greatest fictional supernatural worlds of all time: alongside the ranks of Narnia and The Galaxy.Looking back at some of the great moments in cinema history: the horse's head in the bed, the twist to 'You Never Can Tell', few are left out of the dust by Stalker's 'dream sequence', whereby the characters balm us with a beautiful and thoughtful script whilst the camera pans over a river filled with objects in sepia, each representing something so different, and inviting a convention of interpretation: is the Zone's room an allegory for the threshold of heaven, because there is a picture of St Peter in the river? Or is the Zone's invisible and mythical aggression a metaphor for nature's reclaim of the abandoned and the inhospitable, as the dust and sediment covers a sunken syringe just upstream from St Peter. The significance and depth of this film is otherworldly and almighty. Eduard Artemiev's score is in perfect balance with the images shown to us, mixing a sensual blend of eastern and distant melodies with the screen's mists, mosses and relics. Few films which specialise in the power of one specific emotion can conjure as much effect as Stalker does for suspense (specifically the phenomenal scene in the tunnel/meat grinder), philosophy, fear, choice and anguish.",Stalker
201,simonize850,A film worth banning in its homeland,9,27 July 2017,"It is a struggle watching the film and its opening sequence beginning in the bedroom of the Stalker, continuing to the tavern where the three men congregate, and following their evading their pursuers, and finally entering the Zone. Such ugly ugly colours as though one is watching ""scorched earth"", harking back to the tactics the proud Russians took to leave their various invaders nothing to forage. I think back to those American Civil Wars photos and how their stack sepia hues captured the sad humanity of those years.But note how life and colour return to the screen when the three come to a stop in the Zone. Was Tarkovsky using cinema to show us how dreary and hopeless was in the Soviet Union through this device, and of course, the strange dynamics that characterize the relationship between the Stalker, his wife (and of course his daughter>?Was Tarkovsky saying, Despite everything, we love our homeland?A virtue of this film - not pure cinema, spun by imagery, one with a provocative script with that peculiar Russian sense of (dark) humour, is there is so much that can be said about it, and it is a film warranting multiple viewings.I was fortunate to see this on the big screen at Cinecenta, the student run theatre at the University of Victoria, where they had access to the same Criterion Blu Ray I am expecting shortly. w",Stalker

203,bl-11,"A pompous, interminable bore",1,9 March 2016,"Expect hours of endless philosophical and sociological rambling. Things like out of nowhere a character starts blethering 'why do we enjoy music? do we really need it?'... Except for a young teenager encountering this for the very first time (to whom I intend no disrespect), many of us will have passed this kind of talk years ago, and is not anything profound, but supremely trite. Repeat ad nauseum.The idea of 'Zones' is a good one, but their unusualness is not displayed. And while there are a couple of lines about people having suffered because of, and in, the Zone, none of that fear is conveyed well. Characters staring past the camera for minutes is not the same as building suspense, tension or fear.Aside from a rather flat confessional from the 'stalker' at one point, the film's characters do not seem to have any substantial reason to enter the Zone. Nor is there any wider context, of the Zones, the town, other townsfolk, etc, anything that might help you care at all why 3 guys go into a dangerous, restricted area.This film is pointless (and a sad waste of good source material in the book). Basically three guys you won't care about enter a Zone, stare blankly a lot, pontificate insufferably, then the film ends. At last.",Stalker

It is a truly philosophical movie, but one which relies as much on the meaning of the imagery presented as of the dialogue, a kind of visual poetry. If Tarkovsky has been credited with uncovering a truly, purely cinematic language, this film is perhaps the clearest, most compelling example. The spiritual guide promises to lead the scientist and the cynical writer to a room in the Zone that will grant them what they truly desire, whatever that is, but the journey itself is a sort of test of their character, along with responses to the stalker's stories, particularly the one that describes how another stalker, Porcupine, may have killed himself because he ended up wishing only for money.

Tarkovsky produces images of laden beauty and poetic vision. The film is a quasi- religious sojourn into the ""Zone,"" where dreams may be realized for the patient few. But as with all Tarkovsky films, the theme here is a conceptual and philsophical dialogue among differing positions, in this case a spiritual guide, a writer, and a scientist. Tarkovsky makes you think, though, through his images. Here they achieve exquisite slowness, time squeezed as if from a stone to create an atmosphere of sublime expectation. I can't overstate the artistic achievement this film represents. It's simply a must-see. Do yourself the favor and watch it. I've shown it to many friends and never have they been disappointed.",Stalker
210,acole0228,Too Much is Left Abstract,6,25 May 2020,"One man leads two others into a place called The Zone. This man, called a Stalker, is an expert at navigating the treacherous area. The others are looking to reach The Room, where when entering will fulfill their greatest desire. Much of the film involves the journey in The Zone. The Zone itself is auspicious enough, but there is a nervousness around that reminds you of the danger. The cinematography is the highlight of this film and it perfectly captures the delicate nature of The Zone. Despite this, it still feels like something is missing from this film. Maybe because it feels like at times it is about 3 men we do not know much about travelling an area with a danger that cannot be seen seeking something that can not be felt. Perhaps that is the intention. Most of the film's tension comes through dialogue, often consisting of dense philosophical monologues. This is probably where the film suffers the most. I generally dislike theatrical/Shakespearean aspects in film, and this is how the dialogue usually comes off as. Ultimately, film is a different medium than theater and has different qualities and features to present the drama. In essence, Film shouldn't be asking philosophical questions, it should be presenting them through action. In other words, show, don't tell. Overall, while being well shot, the film often fails to fully capture the tension in a compelling manner.",Stalker
211,timucin_savas,Not as brilliant as touted!,4,28 August 2021,"Stalker...Tarkovsky...One of the most talked-about films in the history of cinema. This is the first Tarkovsky film I have seen and I know that both Tarkovsky and this film are highly regarded by directors, movie professionals, cinema students and film critics and connoisseurs.But here I am on IMdB as a movie fan and it is good that I can also contribute my two cents into this discussion. First off, there is a sense of ""pretentiousness"" about this film from the get-go. Maybe I am wrong and this is the director's style. The camera is very slow and there are lots of long takes. I mean I don't necessarily have a big problem with this, however this style is more akin to stage play and for filmmakers it is lost opportunity. I guess you can have a big screen at the back of a stage and then some cameras to reflect the play on the big screen. This is used in concerts but haven't experienced it yet in a theater, maybe Broadway does it.Again, I love the long takes in a movie, but where the scenes allow the audience devour the images and action on the screen. Not in any way related to Stalker but recent films like Victoria (one shot) or Extraction (one long take of 10 minutes scene) come to my mind.Of course, I understand that the stuff I talk about above is more related to the technical side of movie-making and that Tarkovsky is more about high art cinema. Yet this film doesn't hit the right notes in that respect as well:Acting is mediocre at best. There is no way the audience can identify themselves with any of the characters on screen. One can say the director's name is so big he won't allow the actors to hijack his film. Noted!Script is not good. The ""pretentiousness"" that I mentioned early on invades almost all the dialogues in the film. It is not the characters that are speaking, on the contrary all voice belongs to the director or the scriptwriter, which is by the way again Andrey Tarkovsky.As if it is not sufficient for the director to have conquered all the dialogue, certain characters talk to the camera directly in order to make some explanations. This is like Picasso climbing on the stage and talking about one of his paintings for two hours, explaining the meaning behind his painting.Art is mainly about feelings, sorry, if the director is unable to instigate the feelings in me which should lead me to question the meaning of life, what is right and wrong, who are we, then that director should better keep quiet.Yes art is also politics and one can think about the circumstances at the time of this film's production. It is the communist Soviet Republic where regime critique is frown upon so artists need to shroud their artwork in a way to reduce potential oppression by the government. That is why allegory and satire has become so popular in such countries.Fine but what is the film talking about then? On the face of it, it is wailing about the lack of spirituality and religion in the USSR. The stalker is a priest or better yet the ""messiah"" trying dangerously to show the truth to the interested but materialistic intelligentsia. And actually this is it: There are hardly any elements of sci-fi (except for the very end of the film) and I am not sure if there was ever any consideration for environmental pollution as this is still pre-Chernobyl time.Now coming to art as politics again, was the director justified in his soul-searching exercise? After the turbulent 80s and the collapse of the Soviet Union, although god and church and religion returned to Russia, the society didn't heal. On the contrary today it has become a country where inequalities are emphasized and creating lots of Russian billionaires with the rest of the society not doing well. Again, one can be a good director, but apparently not a good visionary.Aesthetically, were the scenes or photographs appealing? Not really, you can play around with black and white and color and then back to B&W or you can shoot good photos, but overall it wasn't inspiring.",Stalker
212,lefty-11,"Fatuous and nihilistic, Tarkovsky's vision remains constrained by difficult conditions",6,10 January 1999,"Perhaps not as open to interpretation as commonly assumed, Tarkovsky might make more sense if one sees him exploring similar territory to numerous films, such as ""Contact"". The malaise is over whether the dichotomies of Western culture such as intellectual/emotional, scientific/religious, and the cognitive/aesthetic should be exploded or inverted. Tarkovsky portrays a familiar society, increasingly secular/dominated by Reason- which has unintentionally increased meaningless through its ability to question everything (aware of this, the society here has become more totalitarian to prevent the rebellion of its freethinkers), leading to a return of/to the repressed Other of Reason as an alternative source of meaning i.e. the appeal of the Zone. The journey of the rebels to the Zone parallels that of the main character in ""Contact"" (another ambivalent scientist), who similarly threatens the ""national security"" of a militaristic society. Tarkovsky is ultimately confused and conservative, arguing that the inversion of the dichotomies is no solution (even the guide to the Zone, the Stalker, is disappointed by what he finds being no better than the society left behind), without indicating the alternative in ""Contact"" which explodes them. State censorship may also have prevented him, for the alternative argues that only a revolution of values and institutions can influence Reason to create a different future. ""Contact"" may be dubious in its privileging of the rarefied experience of a unique individual as the catalyst for change, but seems preferable to Tarkovsky's suspension in ambiguity.",Stalker

214,MuckyMuckMan73,Slow & hard to comprehend on 1st viewing,7,4 December 2019,"After my second Andrei Tarkovsky experience (my first being Ivan's Childhood) I'm coming to learn that his style is of the slow and contemplative nature.
I went in to my first experience of Stalker expecting a film of science fiction but came away deflated and somewhat confused. I say experience instead of viewing because Tarkovsky films are deeper than just 'watching' a film. Narratively Stalker drags it's heels in the damp swampy environment of a dystopian Russia.
Stalker is atmospherically shot partly in sepia, to distinguish the real world from that of inside the zone, it's beautifully grim and reminiscent of the silent movie era. Giving it an eerie & haunting quality and feeling much like that from the fallout of a nuclear apocalypse as our protagonists wander around the gulag like industrial train yards looking for a way in to the zone. Once inside the zone we are transported into the contrast of full colour as Stalker guides Writer & Professor on a journey through the labyrinthian delapidated buildings and wet inhospitable countryside in their quest to reach 'the room' where their inner most desires will be fulfilled.
Tarkovskys film is philosophically profound and resists interpretation which makes it a challenging watch.
I also thought considering how much Stalker warns of the dangers of the zone there is unfortunately no sense of dread as we see absolutely nothing that puts them in peril on their journey (other than their own imaginations), although quite eerily the exclusion zone reminded me of Chernobyl even though that disaster came years after the film was made.
Stalker also reminded me of Alex Garland's 2018 film Annihilation which I'm sure was inspired by this bleak film.
With a surprising ending that explains both the opening scene and why Stalkers don't have normal children I did get enough closure that satisfied me but due to its extremely slow narrative, long runtime and not enough tension my first viewing was somewhat dampened.",Stalker
215,kovandac,Russian Philosophy not Science Fiction!,3,8 September 2010,"I bought this movie for 25 dollars based on the fantastic reviews and high rating that this film received on this site. Very disappointing. Perhaps my tastes are not cerebral enough for this audience. I am a science fiction and horror fanatic. I have been watching films since I was a little boy. I think myself a good judge of a movie. This film had potential! The director did a wonderful job shooting this movie. The actors were phenomenal. The plot was ambitious and intriguing. But it never took off. It was very boring. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken, the climax, the satisfaction of being mesmerized by a cool idea or twist...... anything! Instead, it was a lot of Russian philosophy. Honestly, I was upset. I had such high expectations. This is a long movie. The boring dialogue and material made it seem even longer. These Russians would literally stop and discuss their different opinions on philosophical matters and religion and politics, blah, blah, blah. This occurs, literally, about 15-20 times throughout this movie. I could have saved myself the 25 dollars and read some Plato or Aristotle or watched C-Span or something. Not to say that I do not like philosophy or such. Not like this, not in my sci-fiction film. Not that much of it. I don't understand all of the high reviews.

This movie can both be seen with religious Christian interpretation and a separate story where ""Z***"", where all your wishes becomes true, is only psychological and something fictional.

Another thing, one may not understand the movie as whole with first view. One may need to rewatch it a second time, or maybe two more times to fully understand the movie.Personally I loved the movie.

218,Ledwek,Thought provoking,7,29 May 2020,"This film takes the saying ""be careful what you wish for"" and turns it completely inside out. I like the questions it puts forward about humanity, morality, and its complete breakdown of how we'll never understand the blurred line between our subconscious motives and conscious decisions. It's certainly a thought provoking piece of cinema that needs to be rewatched for me to build up more of an understanding.I do have some beef with this movie though. It's too slow. I can stomach artsy filmmaking, but I felt like I'd had more than enough by the end. You can't argue that a six minute scene of characters silently trudging through a tunnel is ""challenging"" me in any way, nor that there's any logical need for shots to be that long. Also, I would have preferred to be shown more than I was told. I wish I could have seen what makes this ""Zone"" so unsettling and dangerous, rather than repeatedly be told ""it's dangerous, be scared."" There's even a part called the Meat Mincer, and we're never even told what makes it so deadly. This ambiguity is intentional, but it didn't really work for me.This movie takes a lot out of you, which at times is really a blessing, but has moments that feel genuinely exhausting. Tarkovsky's Stalker and Solaris have parallels in themes and narratives running between them, and at the moment I prefer Solaris.

Anyway, the movie is a must see, it is quite long, yet as I have read Tarkovsky, this was his intention.

221,Nymphocat,Like A Jellyfish In The Sun,9,2 September 2021,"I would just leave a silly joking review saying that ""It's just like Wizard of Oz, except more existentialist, with almost 100% less music numbers and 200% more slav 70's Jason Statham"", but that would be a disservice to my enjoyment of this film.As my first exposure to the cinema of Tarkovsky, it's an interesting journey to get used to. The ominous silences, the long static camera, the reflective feel of it all... Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of those kinds of things, but for most of the run time, it really felt like this film was going nowhere, with the expectation of a retro take on the wonders of the unknown brought by the vastness of space on a meteorite. At most, I was expecting this to be like an episode of The Twilight Zone, away from the silly sins of our modern perception of the sci-fi genre due to the date and birthplace (1979, Soviet Union).But much like A Clockwork Orange, it's sci-fi in name only, using the genre's tendency to displace the human being on a situation of alienation as a mere vessel to detach the characters from any sense of normalcy and logic, no more than that. It felt as if the film was playing me a trick, as if it wasn't as simple as it seemed, as if it demanded me to look closer, to review what I had experienced so far. And I wasn't wrong to do so. Beneath it's ""boring silence"" lies a sombre and quiet journey to one of the most mystifying places ever committed to film, The Zone, a place where your wildest dreams come true. To guide you through it is The Stalker, a broken man with a broken life left with only a sense of selflessness and purpose, to guide the souls of the miserable men of the world into the alien land of The Zone as a guide of sorts, a man that, instead of displaying the wisdom of an elder, feels at times like a virgin to The Zone, no more than the people he brings in, implying the place is as much of a mystery to him as to anyone else. He's not a Miyagi type of character, but rather the perspective of a survivor, a man no more human that his guests. But one that, at times, seems to reflect the sentience of The Zone, to mirror its purpose, using him as a vessel for metaphors and abstract visions.What ultimately is The Zone, then? Everyone is eternally engulfed by this film's main location, so I'm more than compelled to give my own take on it, due to its subjective nature, adding to the legacy of thoughts this film has left behind since it's release. It isn't a land of aliens, or surrealist visages, it's not a tourist attraction, or a gateway to another world. It's the resting place of the damned, of which only those fully in despair would take the hike to reach it, let alone learn about it. It's a living metaphor for the concept of inner silence, the inspiration the Writer yearned, but not one provided by some unspoken entity from outer space, but one born from the detachment of one self, an answer we all know but refuse to listen to, stubbornly. It's merely a field, surrounded by mental caverns and abandoned structures that merge with the blooming grounds, places that were seemingly once manned, but were abandoned, existing only as a warning of the dangers of it, how men of stronger poise might have fallen for their surrender to hubris or destructive weaponry. There are tanks and guns, and despite there being nothing to shoot, they all lay inert, destroyed somehow by a force greater than gunpowder. A force only relatable to the human spirit, no lesser than a nuke. It's a place as real as any dream we've had. It contrasts with the dead colours of the real world, ""so unutterably boring, ruled by cast-iron laws"", a reality that drowns the human being to a useful tool of a inertia-driven society, the colourful soul that we all bear, The Zone then almost painting the image of the truth found within, a escape of the imprisoning mundanity that creates doubt about our purpose. Dead within it, as the camera pans through submerged rubbish of travels past, we can imagine The Zone replenishing its flower beds as noted by The Stalker as the sepia fades away, burying old doubts and rejoicing in the fulfilment of its new visitors, placing a brand, vast new world ready to welcome them, almost like a theatre performer cleaning the wounds of a previous tragedy, ready for the next play. It reflects those who visit it, almost akin to the TARDIS in Doctor Who.The Zone is the living embodiment of human self reflection, and therefore, one of its greatest cinematic depictions.Personally, I was fascinated by this experience. The simplicity of its craft tricked me into thinking this film was way older than it actually is (Star Wars was already out then, which is fascinating to consider), and its way of performing exposition is pretty exquisite, delivering dialogues that work in the supposition of a prior understanding, only to be established later. It does slip a little bit into ""le random"" territory sometimes, specially at the end, but it gets the point across, and that final scene, with them sitting at the puddle, is still one of the most harrowingly human images committed to fiction. What a surprisingly good film.All in all, Stalker is not a film about funky costumes, paper mache sets, laser guns, people in lizard costumes, or the Earth ceasing to spin, but rather is a cinematic experience of self-reflection, of silence, of stale doubt led by a very relatable feeling of personal emptiness pleasured only by the mysticism of the unknown. It's a hard, patient watch, and it will probably not be a hearty recommendation for a Netflix-and-chill (chances are you'll be making out while the film is still in sepia), but it is a thing of beauty for those who enjoy cinema. One that, like any art form, becomes each artist's personal Zone. So who are we, the audience, then? A Writer, a Scientist, or a Stalker?",Stalker

Loosely adapted from the Strugatsky novel, Roadside Picnic, the writing found in Stalker is amongst the most compelling found in contemporary film. The dialogue seen throughout the course of this film cleverly knits existentialistic riddles through a series of whimsical tiffs between its players, ultimately creating a landscape for intelligent and thematic monologues to still come across as believable snippets of everyday conversation.As in most Tarkovsky films, the acting here is top notch. Aleksandr Kaidanovsky plays the role of Stalker, a deeply inverted bridge between the common world and the surreal Zone, where one's deepest wishes come true. Here we see a dash of religious imagery as the two ""loyal"" followers of the Stalker, The Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), and The Professor (Nikolai Grinko), struggle with belief and faith before entering this holy sanctuary. While these three characters take a good 80% of the screen time exclusively, they are immediately recognized as separate entities and are figures one does not tire of while watching their journey.The excellent performances and execution of Stalker is further complimented by its beautiful cinematography. The common world is introduced in a mish-mosh of grays and blacks to truly raise the impact of the colorfully vibrant Zone when its cast arrives. It seems as though film stocks are changed in mid-shot during a selection of the longer takes providing the ideal suit for what the film itself calls for. Stalker truly builds a foreground for its immense weight for when it finally reaches its once-in-a-lifetime climax. The concluding shot of this film might be payoff enough for its entire runtime as it burns an image in your short term memory that you'll think of weeks later continuing your own ritual.",Stalker
229,ThomasStone,Wishes do come true,8,8 May 2017,"It has become a tradition for me to watch Tarkovsky films in slices, as its pace is so peaceful that it makes my young body prone to sleep. This process however gives me time to go back, repeating dialogues I didn't understand and forgetting the subtle introductions that often inspire bookends as many films do. And so it is here also that I forgot we are supposed to be following a stalker, guiding two fellows through The Zone, a place where nature has taken over civilization that acts as a trial on humanity. If they succeed in this trial their innermost wish will become reality. It has spread by rumors to be a sacred place but as we learn it is of little significance to the scientist and the writer. They don't respect the rules the stalker sets out for them either up to the point of bringing along weapons into this sanctuary. The writer brings a gun to protect himself, the scientist a bomb to destroy what he cannot understand. However, when they finally reach the room where their wishes are supposed to come true they find absolutely nothing. Water falling from either the sky or through a ceiling and the three of them stare into this void along the camera floating away from their expression. Whether or not they believe is left open and so they return leaving The Zone intact. The screen has turned back to monochrome, they're in the café where the journey began. The stalker is obviously upset, his faith being disturbed by these two characters. As he goes home with his wife and daughter, his faith weakens. Rambling on about how he will never bring anyone to The Zone ever again, that it is of no use as no one seems to find hope while his wife tries to restore his faith that his work is actually doing good to others, we are left with the question whether or not his work is actually useful. We doubt as the stalker does, yet it is exactly in that moment where the stalker sets off with his family that there is a close-up on the writer's face - looking at the family - that reveals the answer to this question. We can see a marvel on his face, turning from an old and strong tree back into a young and pliable one, as if he were falling in love for the first time. It is here that the writer's innermost wish - finding a reason to keep on writing - is granted. He suddenly understands the stalker's faith in The Zone, as it provides his family and grows a respect for this man who will be shriveling only moments later in his bed by his doing. I am certain that this small anecdote after the journey will inspire the writer to create a new piece of literature or, as we spectators have witnessed, a film that can be called a work of art.",Stalker
230,emmathornston,One of my all time favourites,10,16 January 2019,"The characters at the heart of Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" are people who embark on an arduous journey only to discover that they had no idea what they wanted to gain from it. The central character is a ""stalker,"" a man who makes a living by illegally escorting people through a restricted area to The Room, a place where their greatest wish will supposedly come true. Exactly why the area is restricted is never made perfectly clear; in the novel this film is partially based on, ""The Roadside Picnic,"" it was a site where aliens briefly landed, and The Room was an object they left behind almost as if it were refuse. But Tarkovsky would rather not settle for such a flat explanation. To him, The Room is a place that means different things to the people who journey there, and the stark, ravished landscape they must journey through consists of the phobias and anxieties that they can hardly bear to face. The expedition the men experience is a long and often maddening one, and there are many scenes where the camera lingers on a beautifully composed shot so that the viewer can take time to understand how the characters fit into the settings and how those settings form both natural and supernatural obstacles.Andrei Tarkovsky was an artist who did not like giving solid answers to the questions his films posed. He sculpted his stories so that viewers who had the patience and self-discipline to stay attentive all the way through could draw their own conclusions. If there is any specific meaning to ""Stalker,"" it is that we have to fully understand anything for which we are willing to alter our lives.",Stalker
231,njaffe-604-968961,"Atmospheric, weird, intelligent, a little too slow",8,15 April 2013,"Stalker is quintessentially Tarkovskii and stagnation-era. Tarkovskii's extended silences, slow painting-like shots, color filters, and obsession with dripping water permeate the film. From the stagnation era, Stalker borrows middle age, cynicism, nihilism, listlessness, and unfulfilled desire. The film is remarkably atmospheric; aside from a few strange occurrences, nothing actually corroborates the titular Stalker's claims of supernatural danger in the Zone, and yet the fog, the ruins, the unearthly electronic music, and the apprehension of the characters gives an air of ominous oppression to what is objectively a very simple film. Alienation is a constant theme. In one sense, the Zone disobeys physical laws, traps and kills, and inspires introspection in a terrifyingly sublime way. In another sense, the Zone is the most ""real"" place in the film – it is in color, it is a place of hope, and it is the only place the Stalker claims to be at home, in opposition to the muddy-brown drudgery of the outside world. The dichotomy of Zone and reality, hope and cynicism, comfort and danger, unconscious desires and active passions are constantly at play, and often flipping. I couldn't shake the feeling that the film had something to say about communism and the stagnation period: the Zone is a place of refuge and also a place of weirdness, it attracts the hopeless, and yet offers possibility. One character wants to destroy it, due to the terrible power it might give to bad men. Another character argues that this cannot happen, because man's inner desires will always trump their ideological positions. The Stalker wants only to bring visitors to the Zone for hope and happiness, and grieves at the inability of ""intellectuals"" to give it their faith. His wife narrates, ""If we hadn't had our misfortunes, it would have been worsethere wouldn't have been any hope."" Whether or not these stagnation themes were deliberately placed or an osmotic result of the era is irrelevant – the film is imminently malleable in interpretation. Stalker is nothing if not strange, and there are scenes that cannot be described with any justice in writing. The atmosphere is beautifully wrought, and the film thankfully does not spoil its own premise with over-exposition or ludicrous elements, as science fiction is often wont to do, but scenes tend to drag, and the film might have benefited from some more judicious editing. The most striking and well-timed scene in the entire story occurs in the last two minutes, and one wonders what Tarkovskii might have done with a little more money and a more hawk-eyed editor. Overall, Stalker is strange, atmospheric, introspective, and a little too long for its own good.",Stalker
232,EyesWideClockwork,Subconscious Realm,10,1 April 2017,"A film from another planet?This is a pure stream of profound consciousness. Each frame is created to the highest possible artistic quality.I just love the notions, and musings, behind the subconscious; how our innermost feelings, and desires, are even unknown to ourselves; we can fake what we think we want to feel, but we can never shake what we truly desire.This is hardly a film, more, something much more; a philosophical and psychological out-worldly piece of expression.Like others have said, hardly any words are needed to describe this.

233,gorgeous_blackman,Trite,3,7 August 2006,"Don't be ashamed to dislike this film. Don't be ashamed to call it slow. I like many slow films--to complain that something is slow is not a sign necessarily of stupidity or impatience. I've read the Bible, for example. Now THAT is slow. But it's also GOOD. And that's the problem with this film: it is slow AND bad. I suspect that this is what people who call it slow are really complaining of. The ""philosophy"" or ""meditation"" of the characters in this film is trite and full of bathos. It's straining for deepness, and many a viewer will constantly feel this strain. Almost every monologue or long exchange is weepy and overdone. The story would be much better captured by a novelist. Some people, apparently, are content to watch a bunch of mesmerizing images flicker by on a screen, but that's not enough for me...so I didn't like this.",Stalker
234,jesus_ninja_pants,A work of art; truly captures part of human nature,9,5 April 2007,"This is a very odd film in the sense that very little happens yet simultaneously almost too much happens to keep track of; The plot is fairly simple, a group of people move from point A to point B then back to point A again. However throughout this long journey(almost three hours i think) reality, purpose, existence, desires, and fears are discussed in an oddly matter of fact casual manner. This combined with the sci-fi twist of ""The Zone"" makes for a truly bazaar but fascinating film.For me the film taking place in ""The Zone"" truly made the movie. The Zone is shrouded in mystery; there is no explanation to what it is, where it came from, or what the dangers of it are. Yet this eerie setting is the ideal place to examine something even eerier and more mysterious: people.There is little or no character development but yet by the end of the film you truly feel as if these characters have shown you a part of their souls.There were two things i disliked about this film: the beginning and the end. The beginning because there is a very long scene where the camera never moves, there is no dialog, and very little action. It is just not a good way to pull a viewer into a film. I also disliked the very end where the little girl is moving objects with her mind; It does not seemingly relate to anything else that has happened in the film and greatly contrasts the rest of the film in the sense that there is little apparent meaning.If it sounds interesting from what you have read here, then watch it; i recommend it as a good movie to watch while getting better from a hangover.",Stalker
235,bdos,Not a sci-fi at all,10,18 September 2002,"This movie, despite its categorization, isn't a science-fiction at all. It is about the human being in its purity, told in form of a tale, but the meaning is far behind. This is a movie of patience and calm. Stalker and his mates never hurry anywhere. They simply sense their environment, and it's changing with themselves slowly as they advance. No matter where they heading, the supposed end of their way is just a vision of some goals, aims...Stalker is the movie of human admiring on nature and the existence itself without any conclusions to satisfy the viewer. There's no foggy ideas to follow or to get somewhere in life; the existence itself the miracle is. There are some breathtaking scenes of nature in the movie; their travelling with the rail-car into the Zone is somewhat a masterpiece of filmmaking, the slow rolling, the close-up of faces and the surrounding passing by with the music is perfect together. Also something to mention is the alternating of bw and color film techniques, which makes the difference between the inner and outer realities of human existence.

237,shaolinstylin,...,10,25 June 2012,"This is a subtle film. One of the most gripping scenes is a half-asleep conversation between two characters, with eyes closed, great distance separating them, but the eerie quietude of the forest carrying their voices. The shots are long and sublime, and the camera obsesses on the juxtaposition of industrial ruination and nature. If you haven't come to terms with life you probably won't come to terms with this movie, because it enriches and examines life, rather than distract or provide escapism from it.Stalker almost becomes ""stagey"" at times with its emphasis on monologues, but retains a purity of meaning in every sense. A seemingly never-ending, close up pan through a gentle, golden stream full of mechanical debris, religious symbols and fish seems to suggest vast, vital universes hiding in every corner. Weather and environment become coloring for the individual plateaus of a shared spiritual pilgrimage. The wordless ending is somehow one of the most disturbing I've ever seen. This film is not just a vehicle for abstract philosophy, it is very pure and unpretentious. However, it does not pander to low attention spans.",Stalker
238,dminkin,stalking the truth,10,14 April 2013,"What is happiness? What is the meaning of life? What is the Zone? And what exactly is reality? These questions and many more you will find yourselves asking as you enter the Zone, a place with a Room where all wishes come true. Don't expect too many answers, but try to enjoy the journey, even amidst the decay and ruin of both man and machine.Tarkovsky's Zone is a place of magic, a place where ordinary physical laws don't apply. If one is skeptical that the scenery is what it is, and that there is nothing more to it than what you see with your eyes, the camera in conjunction with the dialogue works hard to convince you otherwise. Distance, scale, and position are all warped, not by any special effect of the camera as in ordinary sci-fi movies, but by the positioning, angle, and movement of the camera within a shot.To take one harrowing example: In the early part of the journey to the Room contained within the central core of the Zone, the small company of travelers, the Stalker, the Professor, and the Writer, pass a blackened trailer containing intact fleshy skeletons. The camera tracks the travelers as they move from a vantage point that deliberately inserts this trailer of death in between. Ever so slowly it creeps up to the scene of death, enlarging and magnifying the details of the decaying corpses, until the camera, having just gotten past the point where it has crept so far up, then overshoots the dead. But it stops; so that while the travelers contemplate the fate of these dead ""tourists"" to the Zone, we are aware that we are actually sitting on top of them.Metal armor, assorted trinkets, and other material possessions that man has donned or created all fall by the wayside and are discarded and rusted at the bottom of pools of water that saturate the Zone. Man's life and possessions are ephemeral and in a constant state of decay in our industrialized, bleak world. Man is removed from Nature, not just in Soviet life but everywhere we look. It becomes apparent that the only way to survive such ruin of both spirit and home is with faith and hope.But we don't always know our innermost desires so a trip to the Room is fruitless if we have a specific goal in mind. The central dilemma is that the Stalker's faith is predicated upon his belief that the inner desires of most people are good. However, the Writer and Professor, from different but not necessarily opposing perspectives, espouse a view that their deepest desires may not necessarily have the best intentions, despite a basic sense of morality that pervades their respective consciences. This is what I think Tarkovsky was trying to depict, without giving an answer, since there may not be one in this brilliant, philosophical, haunting, and beautifully poetic meditation on what it means to be human in a particular reality that we can see but not really ever grasp.",Stalker
239,crewbie,"Artfully shot, but boring",2,14 February 2021,"Just because a movie is shot artfully and scenes are drawn out way longer than necessary, doesn't make it good. I liked the sepia/color switch at first, but by the end the back and forth just became distracting. Because there were so many looong scenes of people walking slowly (supposedly to increase the suspense, but I lost my patience for this strategy long ago), it allowed me to start nitpicking a few things.The sound effects are absolutely terrible and do not match what is happening on scene (why are his footsteps so echo-ey when he's out in the open???), and the vocals seem to be dubbed as the lips don't match exactly. I also often could not tell who was speaking. The makeup effect Tarkovsky seems to like where the skin around the hero's eyes gets increasingly dried out as the movie goes on, which seems to be aimed at underlining his exhaustion, makes no sense here as the atmosphere is quite moist and he even had a nap in the middle! These are things I wouldn't notice if my attention was captured, but since so many scenes dragged on, they started to annoy me more and more.The point of the movie seems to be that men should learn to be happy with what they have, which is fine, but women are specifically excluded from the thesis, as he refuses to take women to the room where desires are grants for some unstated reason. The glimpses at the end of the stalker's wife and daughter were actually the most interesting scenes and made me wish they were used more in the bulk of the movie. It also would have been more interesting if there was more dialogue and less monologue. The monologues ended up sounding disconnected and self-indulgent to me, since there were so many.For a movie where literally, nothing happens, the length was not earned, in my opinion. If it had been cut by an hour, I would probably have given it 5 or 6 stars for cinematography and decent acting. As it is, I cannot recommend it.",Stalker

If there's somewhere ""Top X by sound"" list, this movie has to be in it. I hardly can recall another movie where the sound is truly, 100% surround 100% of the time - rather than occasional isolated explosion or some such.

242,Lennie_G,A depressing movie without it setting up a point or lesson,2,21 October 2021,"There are those who seem to celebrate movies that are complex and cryptic. Stalker fans must be among those. The movie itself didn't have much to offer to me beyond a vague and depressing story. Seen without having first read the book on which it is based (Roadside Picnic 1972), the plot emerges vaguely in references to the forbidden ""Zone"" and the Stalker's desire to take two men to a portal within it which will somehow take them to a beautiful reality. We never get to see the ""door"" or what lays beyond, but eighty percent of the movie consists of the Stalker's struggle to get them there. The movie begins and ends in a sepia colored Russian poverty stricken and depressing town. The furniture is scarce and broken. The floors and walls are dilapidated, peeling, and stained. The ragged looking men wear clothes that are worn and dirty.When the director takes his three characters into the zone, he switches to color. Then their odyssey progress through junkyards of abandon military and other equipment partially covered in grass that the director obviously found as inexpensive location. They nap beside, (and in) a stream, trudge thru scum covered ponds in abandoned buildings with broken tiled walls. They argue to no conclusion while they walk through underground tunnels that drip water that have garbage and junk strewn everywhere. At one point it looks as though the director has used an abandoned salt mine as a set, which seems completely incongruous.Coupled with the use of a ugly junkyards in the movie the director makes use of the slowest zoom ins, zoom outs and pan shots that I've ever seen in a movie. Far from exciting interest in the plot or compassion for the characters, these shots slow the story to a crawl and beg the viewer to bail out from watching. Alicia Malone on TCM wants us to be impressed by this kind of film making. I question whether she saw the movie or just read someone else's description. There's description of the characters in the synopsis as ""Time Travelers"". Other than the stalker having made multiple trips to the zone, there is nothing exhibited in the movie that time is somehow transmuted.The movie is certainly not entertaining, and not evocative of something unseen. I suppose one could stretch the imagination to reveal an allegory about our search for heaven or a better life. I couldn't see it.",Stalker
243,wideawake-1,"Green, green.",8,13 September 2008,"I felt let down by this film. It seemed as though shot on a small plot of waste ground. Dialogue is largely banal, the characters stiff. Afterwards, my abiding memory was of the background vegetation, mostly scrub and bushes. I found myself wondering what it would look like in winter, frozen solid. Then I remembered Tolstoy's description of the unfreezing of the land at the beginning of spring, how it seems to happen in an instant.Years later, I played the computer game called STALKER. Wonderful environment and atmosphere. I was entranced by the background world, even as I fought my way through the Zone around Chernobyl.The film, I found, explained something about the computer game (obviously the film was an inspiration for the game). Not the Zone and the pseudo mystical stuff, but the Russian land. Something about that annual regeneration after the harsh winter. And, I suppose, something also about the Russian character.Is that good? I'm a writer. What slips through despite the artist's control is always worth something.",Stalker
244,joberthefboom,One of the most profound experiences ever put to cinema,10,14 June 2020,"I consider Andrei Tarkovsky to be the most unique filmmaker there is and cinema's ultimate poet. Granted, his style isn't for everybody. His movies are very slow with long, silent shots and this will bore the impatient viewer. The ones that stick around however will be rewarded with a highly profound, beautiful experience. Much like the characters in 'Stalker', the viewer will go on a spiritual journey that will question one's faith, values and desires.We get introduced to a man who is referenced to as 'Stalker'. At first glance he seems like a pathetic person. A Stalker is someone who guides others into the 'Zone'. The Zone is an area that has gotten completely untouched by humans. Time seems to stand still and almost no one dares to go near it. Somewhere in the Zone is a place called the 'Room'. This place is said to make a persons deepest desires come true. The two people who go with Stalker are the Writer and the Professor. They both have their different motives of wanting to go to the Zone, and we learn of these motives as the movie progresses. They manage to evade the military and enter the Zone. From this moment on the three characters embark on thought provoking conversations about their own desires and about who they really are.During the journey 'our' Stalker talks of another Stalker, who accidentally guided his brother to his death in the Zone, he entered the Room, and obtained a large sum of money, shortly afterwards he killed himself. This story tells us no one knows what his deepest desires are, and therefore no one can say whether their desires are good or bad. We have to understand ourselves fully before we are to make such decisions.At the begininning of the movie we don't think much of Stalker. The Writer and the Professor seem to be the intellects, but throughout the story we learn to see their shallowness and blindness. The Stalker however turns out to be the wisest of them all, who has faith and dares to see what others won't.
After their return from the Zone, Stalker explains to his wife how humanity has lost the faith that is needed to life a good and purposeful life.In the last scene we see the daughter of Stalker sitting at the kitchen table. She seems to move three glasses around with her mind. Shortly after a train passes by, loudly. Did the glasses move because of the girl? Or because of the train? Here the viewer can make the choice, to have faith or not.The long beautiful shots of the Zone that effortlessly flow into one another, combined with the profound conversations makes the audience contemplate their own lives and believes. Tarkovsky never put his own ideas into his movies. He doesn't give you an answer to the questions he poses. You're to figure the puzzle out yourself. I'm guessing he believed the less he put into it, the more the viewer will get out of it. It's what makes this more than just a movie, it becomes a meditation.",Stalker
245,nima-azad,We are all Stalkers,10,14 January 2007,"Stalker is the one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. There is a strange zone with high security levels to keep out the ordinary people. It is said once a mysterious crash from outer space happened there. It is also said there is a strange room some where in that zone with power to fulfill every dream. There are only few men how know where that room is and know the zone well enough to avoid all its tricks and dangers. These men, these guides, are called The Stalkers.This movie is a bout two ordinary men who want to go into that zone with the help of a Stalker. One of them is a writer who has lost his inspiration and ability to write. The other is a scientist who seems to be curious about the room and its mysterious power.The journey begins and we see them enter and pass through the zone. The world outside the zone is black and white but after they enter the zone every thing turns to be colored. It clearly shows the differences between the two worlds. One of them is boring and frustrating but the other has some kind of spirit inside. However we never see any other life in there except the three travelers. It is completely a new world by its special rules and order. The silence of the area by itself heightens the tone of mystery. All the time we feel like somebody is watching us, but who? Maybe because we are afraid of something that we don't know what is it.Finally when they reach the room struggles between them arises. The scientist carries out a small nuclear bomb to destroy the zone. He believes any dangerous people and rotten politician could get there and make a bad wish. Who knows the next person who wishes to go there? But the power of the movie I think starts to reveal itself here. The stalker explains this room could be a hope for many people. His life has been spent to guide people there. This room is a symbol of hope more than any other thing. At this point we start to think: does the room really have a super natural power? It seems the two travelers wanted to see that room more because of their curiosity than their believe in it.I think even the two travelers are signs and symbols. The writer is a representative of the artistic feelings of human. The scientist is the representation of logical aspect of human. Both these two parts can't find their way in the modern life. Which one could lead our lives better? Both the writer and the scientist seem confused and helpless in that room. At last they reach an agreement to leave that room alone and don't ask anything form it.They seem more like the Stalker after they have nothing to do with the room. The rain finally starts to fall over them maybe washing their sins and make them ready for a new life. The rain and water are among the key materials in all Tarkovsky's movies. I guess they are the symbols of life and its continuity.The three wretched men are the main subject of the film not the science fiction background and the story of the zone. The director wants to show us their deep emotions and feelings but not to analyze them and clarify who they are. They are like us with their ambitions and hopes. We all might be happy if we could find our own room of dreams. But after all, do we dare enough to go there and make a wish? That room is us in the mirror. It only reflects our deep thoughts, feelings and fears. It shows what we want to be or afraid to become  It's not a usual movie to watch. All the Tarkovsky's movies are great mysteries. He is a modern poet who does not impose his ideas. It's more like an open text to read freely and with different kinds of interpretation. Tarkovsky's films are new worlds to face and would never repeat again anywhere. I think this film should be regarded as struggle of life to find a meaning for itself. But whether there is a meaning or not, no one knows the answer.At the end of the film we see Stalker's paralyzed little girl moving objects over the tables by mental power. Maybe she was able to do that because his father believed deep in his heart that room had the power to fulfill his wish. That room made him to move on and show the way to others. It is a strange end like all the other Tarkovsky's films.I rated this film 9 out of 10 and I'm sure it is well worth it.",Stalker
246,tlewen,"Long, boring movie with nothing that even resembles sci-fi",1,12 April 2018,"Sci-fi? Really?
No, this was a movie with three guys walking and talking through a green landscape with some ruins. Utterly boring and uninteresting talk. 
This is not a sci-fi movie. Nothing strange, out of the ordinary happened. There were a lot of talk that the Zone is a dangerous place, but heck no. 
Ok, maybe I watched the movie 39 years too late? Maybe in 1979 this was in fact a creepy movie? But,... nah, I would not think so. Remember the Alien, from 1979. That was a really creapy move. Ok.. so.. this was a really great art type of movie then? 
Nooo, it wasn't. Unless Sepia is considered enough for a movie to be considered art? Or unless never keeping a camera still is art? The camera was shaking during all scenes. My first thinking was that they must have done this movie in a hurry because the camera man did not even have time to fixate the camera. And you know what? Half of the movie was re-shot, because the original footage was damaged when they developed the film.So of course they was in a hurry. 
And maybe that is explaining the amateurish feeling of this movie. From it's dialogue to the actually filming and even direction. 
I don't know russian at all, and relied on a kind of strange english translation. Not even sure that was the official translation. But anyway, I felt the actors were poor, and the dialogue had no real depth. It was kind of a forced dialogue to create a sense of urgency and mysticity, but since the movie did not show anything that seemed unnatural or strange (except for the telekinetic in the end), it was just plain boring and pompous.I am sure there are people who like this movie, but because you are suppose to like a movie by I think they are far less compared to the people who pretend to like the movie.

247,kaymages,a film to be seen mainly for what lies behind its curtains,8,14 December 2012,"even if those curtains include the aesthetically appealing scenes and the overall ""masterfully"" lets say displayed cinematography. what makes me rate an 8 at this film is the philosophical background which i find quite deep and rare. it is quite disappointing that many people with the negative critics (and some of the positive unfortunately) didn't even grasp the meaning of this film (or scratched the surface of it). here i will briefly try to explain the message of the film and i really wish people would think it twice before being naive but harsh on judging something they didn't want or couldn't understand. **contains spoilers**so we have (really briefly): the stalker , the scientist and the philosopher. the stalker leads the two men in the zone that can fulfill their desires. they all depict different aspects of human perception of things. the stalker told them a story about another stalker called by the nickname ""hedgehog"". a hedgehog is an animal with spikes all around it but a soft warm belly beneath. as egoistical humans act for themselves, being harsh, suspicious and taking advantage of others but good with their precious self. true self awareness is very hard to achieve. he thought he would go in the room and revive his brother. but the room saw deep in his soul and when he returned home he tragically realized his true deeper desire was to be rich and comfy. so he hung himself. the two men were discussing and thinking in the whole course but when they reached near the zone a true fear started to strike inside them. as we people avoid looking in ourselves and ""our mess"", the two men where afraid that the thing for which they firstly thrived so much, will reveal their true selves and desires. faith is also a key element to the whole concept. don't forget Tarkovskiy is an orthodox Christian and his, allow me to say ""masterpiece"", is deeply influenced by his beliefs. the protagonist, stalker is almost an idealistic figure like don quixote for example who is not willing to betray his beliefs. the raw logic/ tender belief dichotomy is emphasized through the ""clash""/""meeting"" of these different characters and the value of love highly exalted in a tragic world that seem hopeless to explain itself without the existence of necessities.",Stalker
248,dr-mutallimov,PHILOSOPHICAL ART,10,4 May 2018,"Tarkovsky shot one of his best films, which, in my opinion, is quite capable of turning someone's world outlook.Stalker - a unique film in its structure, not a verbatim adaptation of the famous novel Strugatsky brothers, but only a film based on the motives that allowed the directors to bring something to the known universe.Undisputed pluses of the picture are: excellent cinematography, brilliantly selected acting and magnificent dialogues, some of which can be disassembled into quotes.In my review, I will not discuss the meaning of this film, but only because, as I have noticed, everyone in this film can find something for themselves. The main issues raised in the film are: the question of faith, the question of the strength of the spirit of man, the question of how there can be interrelated science and faith and having moved into the picture from the Strugatsky brothers novel, the question of what people really want.The story told by Tarkovsky surprises with the simplicity of the narrative. The trip to the Zone is presented as something practically, everyday. Despite this, the viewer quickly understands the basic concept of the story being told and begin to worry about the main characters.For me of course 10 out of 10.",Stalker
249,astaknut,Read the book instead,3,20 October 2019,"I just saw this film on a big screen in a cinema. Though I didn't hate it like I did a certain overrated Antonioni film, it's still very dull. Having read the book I couldn't help but compare it to that and the book is much, much better. The film takes certain elements and characters and puts them in a completely different story. If you can call it a story. The absence of a progressing plot, the absence of anything interesting happening, is a major problem.I may not have fully grasped every reference in the film because I didn't grow up in communist Russia. If my fellow moviegoer hadn't pointed it out, I wouldn't have noticed why the scenes with the daughter would not have made it past the Soviet censor. But that still doesn't make it a good film. If you think 3 characters talking in monologues for almost 3 hours is cinema than this is your thing.I was reminded of Bette Davis who said something along the lines of ""No audience will cry for a character who cries for themselves"". This movie is every character crying, wailing, literally rolling on the floor out of pity for themselves. Besides the use of black and white (sepia) versus color, there was nothing cinematic about this movie. I highly recommend the book, it's got an actual plot and the atmosphere and world are much more interesting.",Stalker
250,patriciasmaynard,Parable on a grand scale,10,4 November 2017,"Stalker is more of a spiritual parable than a science fiction tale. It's been advertised as a story about a zone inhabited by alien forces, but whatever the original sources of inspiration, Tarkovsky has clearly turned this into a metaphor for a spiritual journey through landmines and war torn areas.It may be too slow for mainstream viewers but the slowness of the camera movement, the way the images are captured are perfectly in sync for me. The cinematography is incredible from the early black and white footage, darker in style to the colour sequences in the zone, dominated by greens. This represents to me the beauty of nature mixed with the dangers of the apocalypse. His characters faith is tested with their journey through here and I believe that these characters are not black and white either. Tarkovsky writes them very deeply, expressing intellectual views on man's role as an artist/writer and scientist within a world pushed to the limits by the madness of man. The madness is what we've become with war and technology. Through all this you wonder if Tarkovsky sees any hope for us, the way Kurosawa did in Rashomon? I see it in the character of the Stalker himself. Despite his seemingly desperate nature, he is a sacrificial figure, almost Christ-like in the way he's given up finances and a good family life, to go into the zone when everyone else is mocking and looking lowly at him. Most moving to me is the pain he feels for all those without faith, and this is why he is a Stalker, a humble man to lead men but without force. One wonders how much of Tarkovsky is in the Stalker.",Stalker

The movie really scared the hell out of me for some reason. The dreamlike atmosphere and the intentional slow scenes, sets up this unnatural feeling I've never had before. It's visual poetry of both desire and dullness in Tarkovsky world.With his accurate composition of sound and visuals, Tarkovsky is able to put the audience into the moment unlike no other film makers I've yet seen.

It's a film that you have to see multiple times to try and get the message it's trying to send. The director, a sheer genius, made a film about what he saw in humanity, thus producing this masterpiece about mankind's struggle to face reality. Not only is the message driving, but every scene from beginning to end is art. One scene that especially stood out to me was the sand dune scene in which the writer confronts his own soul and questions his intelligence and ability to write. Another would be the dream sequence that the stalker has, though slow in pace, it is a brilliant scene that will leave you wanting more. Through out the entire film, if you have the patience to sit through this two and a half hour work of art, you will ponder and think and try to make sense of this film.

253,aremeny,"A huge disappointment, as a book it could be great",3,29 May 2011,"This movie is a typical example of the over-hyped, trendy movies of what (almost) on one dares to write negatively about out of fear of contempt. I'm not doing this because of defiance or because I like to go against the flow - but because sadly this really isn't a good movie.I'm well aware that this movie was made in 1979, so you can't expect mind-blowing special effects, CGI images that would have turned this movie into a visually stunning masterpiece. What I usually say is: don't attempt to shoot a sci-fi with a low budget.If we put aside the story (which is great), the characters, the symbolic meaning - then there's absolutely nothing to appreciate in this movie. The actors aren't given much opportunity to show their talents, mostly they stare blankly into the camera if they aren't talking to each other. The backgrounds consist of grassy fields with debris, ruined town sections, narrow interiors mostly set in bunkers and sewers, all that could be quoted as ""great and retro looking"" by viewers from Western Europe, but actually if you come to Eastern Europe, you notice that you can find these locations (literally) everywhere.Also the authenticity of the movie suffers, because we never get to see why the Zone is so dangerous (as the Stalker claims it to be) or how it makes people disappear. All we see are rust-eaten tanks and some bodies long since dead. Neither we are allowed to see what happens to the nuts they keep throwing around to check whether the area is safe or not, if they throw one into a ""wrong"" place.I liked how the burnt out Writer is allowed through all the traps because of his nihilism, the Professor whose goal is to blow up the Room in order to prevent it to fulfill the wishes of evil people, the Stalker whose sole purpose in life is to guide those who are willing to the Room through the Zone and of course how they all become enlightened towards the end about the purpose of their lives.It would have made a brilliant book and instead we got a plain looking, boring movie with almost no reason to watch it - you need more than just audio in a film. Otherwise the camera work and the soundtrack - that can be heard quite seldomly - are pretty good. So many movies are being remade nowadays, I believe that this is the one that definitely deserves a remake and a bit of a genre makeover (into horror/sci-fi) and a bit more clarified ending. Let's hope someday, someone is going to discover it as it happened to Solaris.",Stalker
254,mina_legolas,Excellent atmosphere/direction but meddled and unclear in many aspects,8,13 February 2013,"To say, this is the first and only Tarkovsky film I've seen for the time being. It was pretty damn good but it has it's faults. I'll start by saying the positive factors.The film has an excellent sinister and mysterious atmosphere/mood that is developed sublimely throughout and makes you want to keep watching. The direction from Tarkovsky as he guides through this visionary world into the Zone through the conflict and relationships between the characters is superb. The acting is also very convincing and interesting to watch as their characters develop, save for the over-the-top excessive performance from the stalker's wife. The film also creates a great deal of mystery around the Zone, through the several disappearances of past visitors as well as its unnatural forces, which is intriguingly powerful to watch. The camera-work is also simply perfect, creating many memorable and unique mixture of tracking and still shots.Now onto the negative points. The film is extremely slow paced which at times was quite compelling as it created a great deal of tension but at some points, certain scenes and shots went on for too long needlessly or became slightly dull. 2001: A Space Odyssey had a similar pace yet it never ceased to be interesting for a moment; the same cannot be said for Stalker. Now onto my biggest and most significant problem. The film, despite being well crafted for the main part, seemed like it wasn't exactly sure of what it was trying to say overall. It had a great build up and everything but concluded in an anti-climactic fashion as it didn't end on a strong note or left any last compelling or unforgettable sequences (especially in the Zone); also the journey of all the characters seemed kind of pointless by the end. I may be mistaken and may see something new in Stalker if I ever re- watch it when I'm older but for now, all I can say is it's a very well made film in many aspects but it lacks good pacing, can become often too slow and most importantly doesn't have a true point or purpose to the journey of the characters or the story itself overall. Throughout I was often compelled though but from the last part of the film and by the end I found myself going ''Was that it?'' Although I am still interested to see Tarkovsky's other work. This one - worth watching but didn't see the masterpiece that I've heard so much about. 7.5-8/10.",Stalker

256,rageeth,Poetry in motion,9,30 January 2021,"My first viewing of a Russian film and of course it had to be a Tarkovsky. "" Stalker ""is poetry in motion. Every frame is so beautifully shot that they are akin to moving photographs.
It was a joy to watch the visionary craftsman at work. One of Tarkovskys signature moves is the delibrately slow takes, sometimes lingering on for minutes. An example is a shot of the three main leads traveling on a rail cart which goes for on for over 5 minutes. To any other filmmaker , this might seem pointless and risky. But for Tarkovsky, there's a method to the madness, there's a rhythm that is almost hypnotic and trance like.
The film is also beautifully written and is poignant. A theme which is true even now. The screenplay is written by Andrei himself .
The soundtrack from Eduard Artemyev is also haunting and leaves a lasting impression.
The movie is definitely long at 2 hours and 41 minutes of run time, but in essence only feels like an hour due to the captivating nature of the cinematography. You truly feel like you are with the three leads in their search for the strange and mysterious secretive place called zone. All of the actors are in superb form playing their roles to the tee.Sadly, by many popular reports, this is also the film that caused the death of the legendary filmmaker and few others as well . This was supposed to be one of Tarkovskys grandest films. Shot on a large scale canvas and with an experimental film roll. However, once finished, they realised that it did not provide the desired result. Instead of the brown tint that Tarkovsky wished for, the end result was dark and unusable ( atleast in the 1980s). Tarkovsky, being the perfectionist that he is, decided to shoot the whole film all over again. Only this time, it meant limited budgets. This forced them to change the location to near a chemical plant. The surrounding area was so toxic that it was said that many of the actors had allergic reactions . And after a few years Tarkovsky and few others died of cancer.
As for the original film that was shot first, the film was sadly destroyed in a fire in 1988.
Stalker is a must watch for any movie lover, especially if you are a student of the movies and plan to get into it.

257,dinaabatematteo,Utterly utterly brilliant,10,12 January 2019,A master storyteller and a visual genius at work. Tarkovsky creates fear in the audience without showing a damn thing. It's brutal without a single act of violence. It's spine tingling without a single stock shock effect and it is esoteric and out of this world. The ending bores right through the soul.

260,centurymantra-2,Poetry...? Alchemy...? Or something else?,8,13 January 2001,"This film seems to occupy a realm of perception akin to that of the prismatic reflection of light cast across your kitchen counter as the sun plays through it; or that of the whispering angular shadow of a swaying tree outside your window, beamed onto your ceiling & slowly drifting across the room with the track of the sun.  Both are singular phenomena and abstractions of light which one can embrace and perhaps even acheive some level of revelation through if the mind is allowed to 'lose the moment' as it were and embrace the uncommon beauty and inexplicable strangeness that such a simple event can generate.  Just as easily, one can simply cast it aside; leave it unnoticed and nothing more than a wisp of light at the peripheral edge of vision.  Stalker is, as well, one of these ""abstractions of light"", a flickering presence on the screen open to interpretation.  One that may be fully absorbed and  taken to heart as an illumination of the soul or brushed aside as nothing more than a faceless and futile attempt at 'nothingness'. Perhaps one may find their focus drifting in such a way that only a few fragments may be fully digested, comprehended and sifted through the back door of the intellect; vague impressions of no particular form or figure.  Perhaps one could watch (and re-watch) this film and adopt all of the above viewpoints.  Stalker is ""that kind"" of a film and one which is bound to polarize viewers.  Unquestionably slow and brooding, yet uncommonly strange and beautiful by turns.  It's meaning is shrouded and the ultimate resolution is tied up in metaphysical abstractions whose meanings are not entirely clear.  One of the most impressive aspects of the film (and much of Tarkovsky's work) is it's ability to render the simplest images in a manner that transforms them into poetic distillations of a very high order. Tarkovsky is truly a visual alchemist of the highest order, as this film will certainly attest.  Watch this film, take it for what it is, and leave with whatever impression and/or opinions you see fit.  You may find yourself thoroughly bored or completely enthralled, but there is one thing that is certain.  Whether you know it or not, a transformation of some order will have taken place.  As the alchemists of yore would tell you, though the transformation of lead to gold may seem an utterly futile, unrewarding and ultimately impossible task, it is the transformation of the self during this process that really counts.",Stalker

My own would be that the room represents the innermost parts of the mind. When confronted with the opportunity to explore the innermost reaches of themselves all the main characters in the film back away. Perhaps the most significant element of the film for me was the manner in which reaching the room was made so difficult. Perhaps this is also the case with many people, who cannot understand the world they live in because they cannot undertake the arduous journey into their own mind to understand themselves.This is a truly thought provoking film.

Not because it's almost unbearably boring and overrated to a ridiculous extend. No, Mostly I hated it because i just finished reading the book it's based on, ""Roadside Picknick"". I love this Book, because you rarely come across a more chilling or atmospheric story about an alien culture meeting ours. I thought, a movie made from this book must be great, because you could do something outstanding even on a low budget. So I really looked forward to watch this one. What did I get? 3 Guys talking endlessly. It felt like being back to school and forced to watch a philosophical stage play of three hours length. The worst thing is that the strugatzki-brothers themselves screwed this up. It almost seems as if they wrote the screenplay with the intention to eliminate everything which was great about their own novel. I keep it short and give you a list of the outrageous decisions they made:IN THE BOOK the main guy, Roderic, is a hard-arsed scavenger who is sort of addicted to the bizarre Nature of ""the Zone"". IN THE MOVIE, he is a whimsical, bible-quoting coward in search of some sort of divine illumination. IN THE BOOK, you experience the deadly traps and anomalies of space and time the ""Zone"" is contaminated with. IN THE MOVIE, you don't see SH*T and nobody even hurts his ankle -- despite HOURS of dialogs emphasizing how dangerous the slightest movement can be. IN THE BOOK, the Zone is a lifeless industrial wasteland where not even birds are to be seen. IN THE MOVIE you have the impression of a nice stroll through a green landscape with some bunker ruins in it. IN THE BOOK, there are lots of alien artifacts that most effectively create an impression of their culture and technology. IN THE MOVIE, you get some strange sounds, also the aliens are completely reduced to a humble meteorite. IN THE BOOK, Roderics Daughter is disfigured by the strange effects of the ""Zone"" on human beings. IN THE MOVIE she's mentioned to be mutated, too, but looks perfectly normal. IN THE BOOK, you have really creepy stuff like ""the meat-mincer"" or the walking Dead - IN THE MOVIE you don't.I could go on like this for hours. Let me just put it like this: If they just had made a lousy B-movie I would be perfectly OK. I don't blame anyone for screwing up, it doesn't suit me.

Stalker is science fiction in the vein of the genres greatest writers like Phillip K. Dick and Stanislaw Lem.  It's pure science fiction, based on science, metaphysics and speculation, not some action fantasy or space opera that fits into the genre on the technicality that it takes place ""in the future"" or ""a long, long time ago"".   The film is slow...very slow but it has to be to put you into the mindset of the film.

Classics can do this, but this film definitely does not. Few will have the patience for this film with its self-indulgent, ages-long shots, terribly mismatched sound effects and long and boring scenes without plot or character development.Having said that, connoisseurs of truly obscure projects from Eastern bloc countries decades ago may find some value in learning about what niche audiences once may have put up with.",Stalker

The incredibly high ratings on all the review sites are usually not to be ignored, but in this case I can't explain the 10star ratings one bit.

For a little known Russian film from 1979 I'd guess not.As a movie nerd myself I'm always up for a challenging film. Dune is one of my all time favs, and Dead Man perfect AFAIC; some found it boring. This film is boring, I'm not ashamed to say that. A 3 and a half minute shot of a flatbed leaving the camera (static by the way) does nothing for the film but bore the viewer to death. Now, used sparingly there's a place for this style, but it's like this movie was filmed by security cams half the time. Some of the shots were done quite well though, it's just all over the place. And the acting? I've read many reviewers complain of 'wooden acting,' here we have Robotic Acting. Really, the lines felt like they were just recited page by page, each character taking turns on heavy philosophical stuff with no conversation. It was like a high school debate club.My last criticism is petty, but really, this is supposed to be one of the best films of ALL TIME and it employed a cheap gimmicky trop from the Wizard of Oz; B&W to full color to emphasize the difference between """"worlds.""""

The dream sequence with the little girl whispering and the camera showing different objects in water is just fantastic. There is something about the scene in the Chernobyl-like desolated building when a bomb is put into pieces and water starts dropping from the roof like rain for minutes. You'll never see something like that except in a Tarkovsky movie. The four elements are always present.

This is about human nature. What does a human being want? When a normal person is asked about his/her biggest wish, they will tell you that it is to be a great person, do good things for humanity, win the nobel prize and such..But in reality, these are only expressed out desires so to conform the society, in reality, human is an animal whose only desire is to survive and satisfy its greedy desires. actual desires of people involve wealth, power, lust, gluttony that leads to violence..The scientist says that his motive for the journey is scientific discovery and his desire is to win the nobel prize while the writer says he needs inspiration.. Then when they come to the threshold of the room, we learn about the true story of the previous stalker, that he lost his brother in the trip and after getting into the room he committed suicide a week later. Because the room fulfills ones innermost desires and his desire was to be very wealthy instead of saving his brother. At that point the scientist and the writer understand that the best thing is not to pass the threshold, because they know that their real desires are different. The writer already confessed earlier that his intention is not inspiration, and the scientist makes it clear that hes not on an expedition as he stated earlier but he wants to destroy the room with a bomb. It seems they have the destructive desires just like most of people. . Actually the whole zone is full of remnants of violence; abandoned tanks, armory, and wastes as metaphor to man's sins. and most people couldn't make it because the room made their desires to destroy themselves; just like great dictators were swallowed by their own power, or greed and lust and other sins created ones own end..The stalker never trespassed the room because he knew the fate of the others. He had a crippled daughter at home. What would his innermost desire turn out to be? to cure his daughter? to give happiness to his loyal wife? to save his family out from their poverty and misery? or, well, is it some other desire, that he is afraid to face.It is interesting that the zone is perfectly analogous to religion. the stalker is the religious figure who guides the people along the way. zone is metaphysical and miraculous things are supposed to happen. note that almost nothing extraordinary happens though..and people are suspicious about the zone and its ability to fulfill desires..

In the first section of the film, where everything is yellowish, we know about the stalker, a bald Russian man who lefts his wife and daughter in order to go to hiking to the fields with two men. He expresses his desire to hike, as he used to do before. The spectators know he left his family before and he did not come back home for a few years, therefore his commitment to walking in the fields is not ordinary, but steadfast and rentless. The wife moans about her unlucky life, as she does not share the passsion for hiking of her husband.Still in yellow, the protagonist arrives to a bar where he finds another two bald men, one of them is a writer and the other one is a professor. They discuss about their long-lasting passion for hiking and how they enjoy being outside civilization with a few other men to enjoy themselves.The group of three bald Russian men take a mini train in which they barely fit and they arrive to the zone where they intend to hike in peace. The area is unpopulated and therefore convenient for their intentions. Once they arrive, after near fourty minutes of film, the film starts to have colours. In this second section everythings goes to green, blue and grey tones.It is unclear if the men are intented to pick berries and mushrooms or just they want to spend sometimes together as a mental refreshment from a hard life as bald men in Soviet society.They are wandering around for about two days or so and they arrive to a tunnel that possibly represents their feelings when they started losing hair when they were in the late-twenties. After the tunnels, they arrive to an abandoned industrial building that is a symbol of their lifes as bald grownups who enjoy hiking in company of other men. Finally they arrive to a magic room where you can make a wish. It is unclear but some people argue they ask for hair. They argue about the convenience of using the room or not for a quite long time.Going back to the bar, the film goes back to the yellowish colour. The stalker arrives to his home and goes back to sleep, exhausted after the trip.",Stalker
273,serriricky,"This Movie is ""poetry on screen""",9,15 April 2021,"Few films have impressed me and made me think as Stalker. This film tells of three men who want to enter in the ""Zone"", an area manned by soldiers inside which it is rumored that a room is hidden that can make the wishes of those who enter it come true. The origin of this area is not clear, there are those who say that it appeared after the fall of a meteorite in that place. The 3 protagonists, including the Stalker, or the guide who takes customers to the aforementioned area, overtake the military to enter it. The suspense is palpable. You have to follow exactly the path that the ""Zone"" wants you to take to stay unharmed. Once they arrive in front of the room, none of the three men is able to enter, reasoning about the consequence that this action would bring, because in this case they would be confronted with their true essence.I think this is one of the most introspective films I've ever seen. It is not a film that uses symbols to tell its own story, which is very clear as it is. Tarkovskij has put all his poetic vein in this film, making the various chapters interspersed with his own compositions. This vision can be heavy at times, but I think it all serves to immerse the viewer in the situation that he is only seeing, allowing him to hear every single sound, every breath of wind and every breath of the protagonists. The characters want to perfectly represent the archetype of the individuals who make up society. The man who uses reason and a certain method of thinking, represented by the Scientist. The man who relies on inspiration, estranging himself from everything else and capable of using the light of creativity, represented by the writer. It is the man now destroyed by life who no longer finds any reason to live except the ""Zone"". This film, despite its apparent banality, manages to make the viewer think and put him in the same situation as the protagonists, leading him to ask himself ""What would I do if I were in their place?"".",Stalker

281,matthewboddy,What a waste of two and a half hours,3,8 September 2009,"I am tempted to give this 1 star to bring down the overall score as much as possible, but truth be told it wasn't that bad.I'll go into what I liked first, which will be very limited, and into what I didn't like afterwards.The good: The cinematography was stunningly realistic compared to the overly commercialized Hollywood BS we see nowadays. Have you ever noticed how every character in American movies is rich and drives a beautiful sports car? Not like real life at all. The characters in this movie are poor Russians living in Communism. Pretty realistic.Also the film had good acting. I don't know who any of the actors were but I believed them, and they did a fantastic job telling a story on what looked to be a pittance of a filming budget.The bad: Far too long. This could have easily been told in 90 minutes or less. The director was far too indulgent with non-essential elements of the film.Far too boring. For so much of this movie, nothing is happening at all. The director will do these long still-camera shots of someone's head. Or a puddle. Or some trees. It contributes nothing to the story, and doesn't even look good. At times I felt myself thinking ""what the hell is he trying to show us here?"" In good storytelling, a writer or director should strive to eliminate redundancies. If something isn't essential to the story, cut it. The director obviously isn't familiar with that concept.All suspense, no reward. The ending is a huge letdown. I won't tell you what it is, but let's just say the movies keeps you waiting and waiting and waiting, and then in the end you're left to wonder: ""What the hell was that?"" The Zone itself was also a huge letdown. It's literally just a bunch of fields somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Russia. The Stalker keeps warning them: ""Oh the Zone is powerful. The Zone will punish you if you disrespect it. Don't back-track... The Zone will kill you!"" And then nothing ever happens. No matter how the Writer and the Professor screw up or disrespect the Zone, nothing even happens to them.Summary: If you want to try something off-the-cuff, and totally non-mainstream, give Stalker a whirl. There are worse ways to spend two and a half hours of your life. Like waiting in line at the post-office. Or stuck in a traffic jam. Or going into labour before giving birth. Hmmm on second thought, maybe I would prefer the traffic jam.",Stalker
282,IlyaSverdlov,"Excellent, better than its source",10,9 October 2002,"Contains SpoilersThe film is big, there is no denial. The discussion of what Tarkovsky film is his best may be unending, but he is one of those rare directors who only film chef d'oeuvres. What makes it especially Tarkovskian is the presentation of the principal hero, the Stalker. The source for the film, as is well-known, is brothers Strugatsky's novel ""Picnic on a roadside"", whose protagonist, Roderick Schuhart (the film's Stalker is the corresponding figure), is as simple a personality as one may expect. He's, essentially, nothing more than a street bum, just the sort one encounters in Dickens's taverns for poor people, he is quite ready to do as much law-breaking as required of his ""profession"", he is quite ready to take the young son - a completely innocent person - of his ""colleague"" to death (there is an obstacle on the way to golden ball of the book's Zone, to which an unsuspecting companion of a stalker must be ""fed""), etc. He, actually, has no respect for other humans or mankind whatsoever. His ""twin"" the film's Stalker is a complete difference - he is human, yet he is the medium for other humans to the fulfillment of their deepest desires. What he suffers from, and deeply, is the kind of deepest desires these humans have, their inability to see what is there in human life. He doesn't hate them at all, that is important; he, maybe, even loves them as they are human, he despairs that, even as he shows a man his way to happiness, this man cannot see where his REAL happiness lie, cannot see what he is to do with his life. The suffering and weltanschauung of the Stalker is, as I see it, the principal theme of the film; no such thing for the book and Roderick Schuhart. So one may say that the film Stalker is, from art's point of view, a far greater success than the original book.",Stalker
283,kevin-milant,Mind blowing!!!!,10,19 January 2010,Same level of complexity as in Bergman's persona. I believe all of the plot elements and dialogues and dreams in this have symbolical meaning driven from inside. Who and what stopped writer when he is trying to enter the building? How can the professor over take other two? Why is a Black dog accompanying all three people? What can be interpreted by items laying in water surface in the dream sequence? Why there is a telephone inside the building? Why does professor want to destroy the room? What is the real meaning of the room? why doesn't the writer want to enter the room? Why the Stalker trying to grab the bomb from the professor? What can be interpreted by mutant child's last action of moving three glasses and one is forced to drop.? What is the symbolical meaning of the zone? Who is the Stalker anyway? Is he the human desire?I believe highly attentive viewer of Stalker can answer all these questions by their own way and make a unique decision.That's what the director's achievement,Stalker
284,mtthwibrahim,Brutally Misunderstood,10,30 July 2012,"I don't think I've had a more infuriating experience than I have reading reviews for ""Stalker"". Every single negative review I've read so far basically boils down to ""it's slow/boring/pointless/pretentious"". I feel I need to shed some light onto this whole subject. ""Slow"" is not by nature a bad thing. ""Stalker"" is ""slow"", in the sense that it builds atmosphere and disregards a standard narrative. I feel the world created by ""Stalker"" is probably the best thing about it. It's incredibly engrossing, it blocks out everything else around me. I'd take this over any action movie that leaves me yearning for the end. The ""boring"" part is a totally subjective , but what exactly do people seem to find boring about beautiful imagery and poetry put to screen. Every second of the film is crafted so perfectly by Tarkovsky, who just put everything he had into this one. As for ""pointless"", I find this criticism to be utterly puzzling. ""Stalker"" has a very clearly defined plot that is developed completely. Did these people not pay attention because there were no fight scenes or large breasted women. More than that, though, it also expresses religious philosophy. It's a film about belief, what exactly is pointless about that? The argument for it being ""pretentious"" is easily the one that angers me the most. I have to wonder if the people using this word even know what it means. What pretense does ""Stalker"" hold? It's a pure example of film making, where the director spares no expense to realize his vision. A pretentious film is something like ""Fight Club"", a film with no genuine content designed to appeal to the masses, while building itself as a pillar of truth that brings light to difficult subject matter, when the party involved isn't even intelligent to understand why a difficult subject matter is difficult.In short, ""Stalker"" is a beautiful film. It is pure, unpretentious, and subtle, but incredibly gripping. It will not, however, pander to low attention spans",Stalker

We often assume that reaching our dreams will give us eternall happiness.When we try to reach our dreams - room in a dreamy colorfull zone - we are accompanied by reality (professor) and our ability to narrate/describe (author). The closer we get, the more we are ourselves haunted by our doubt that realizing our dream will turn things better (dog). No one of course understand what we are trying to narrate and our mind tells to blow up the dream - as a dream is a fairytale, not reality.When we are close fulfilling our dream, neither the professor or author or the dreamer in us wants to enter - as it would destroy the dream we search for. With our dogs we return to where we started, though still having faith (supernational abilities).The film itself is difficult to interpret and rich of anecdotes.

I actually arrived to this movie because of the game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. which derived its name and setting from the book Roadside Picnic and this movie.To be honest, though, I'm disappointed. The movie lacks focus - as if the director tried sending out too many signals, too many messages, and they all feel too jumbled to strike home. The characters are not realistic - they are nicknamed to represent an archetype - the 'professor', the 'writer' - and their goal seems to be just to get across this message the director has in mind: the pursuit of happiness & the value of hope.Really, the *idea* of Stalker is a good one - the idea of a Zone where strange things happen is mesmerizing except nothing DOES happen in The Zone. Half the movie is spent tiptoeing through the Zone, the viewer waiting for *something* to happen but it never does. The stalker seemed like a madman who believed in invisible ghosts - a simple sewer pipe becomes the ""mince-meater"" and according to him, it claimed many visitors but it boggles the mind how it possibly could. I actually started to question his sanity! I understand there must have been budget constraints but leaving the viewer hanging like this is criminal. I didn't expect Alien-like gore but I did expect *something*.Besides the confused message the movie sends out, this is the vital mistake made: too much time of the movie is spent creating a tension that never gets rewarded. Why do they throw those nuts around? Why the whole story about ""respecting the zone or it will punish you"" when nothing of the kind happens? It feels like a ton of hot air with nothing to back it up.I'm eager to read the book since it seems more fleshed out - hopefully it will answer some of my questions but I have to say, this movie was a disappointment.

297,vivalarevolution-marxwas,"His storytelling is sublime, but it needs to mature",9,23 November 2009,"Tarkovsky's film Stalker is unusual to jaded Hollywood eyes. The average shot length in a contemporary Hollywood film is three seconds. The average shot length in Stalker is over a minute. Some shots exceed four minutes in length. Not only this unusual, but the way the story is told does not progress at the same rate we are used to blockbusters proceeding, delivering plot like a machinegun.I didn't like this film to begin with. The first time I watched it I was totally nonplussed. The second time I watched it, I was alone and I devoted three hours attention to something I found beautiful and mesmeric in its power. The visual medium is the one that Tarkovsky works in. Particularly beautiful is the shot of the underwater debris and detritus shot from the top-down. I found the use of sepia tones while outside the Zone was stylistically interesting and the use of long and careful panning to take in the surroundings was beautiful and allowed the viewer to soak up to atmosphere and mood of the film.I find Tarkovsky to be like Sergio Leone in that his storytelling needs time, needs depth to make it effective. I have heard that this film could take place in one episode of Dr Who, and I suppose that is true. But the length helps to add to the depth and the power of the beautiful visuals being displayed.Based on the novel 'Roadside Picnic' and written for the screen by the author of the novel. Fankly the film is not a patch on the novel in my opinion, but what film is?

The survival techniques the characters in the film achieve is unlike anything I've seen in film. Much like Kubrick in terms of directive style and character study, Tarkovsky puts the viewer in a kaleidoscopic landscape of mood and emotion. No clichés here though. I have not read the story which the movie is based upon, but from what I understand the characters in the film all develop a healing understanding of each other.

In Fight Club, things HAPPENED while men fought. In this film, nothing happened while three guys walked, and sometimes just sat, in a field or building. This film was painfully boring, and takes the 3rd spot on the list of films to actually put me into a deep sleep (along with Citizen Kane and The Seventh Seal). It's not that I don't like films most people would call boring. Werckmeister Harmonies is ""boring"", Begotten is ""boring"", 2001: A Space Odyssey is ""boring"", and Enter the Void, my favorite film of all time, is ""boring"". The problem with this film is that absolutely nothing happens for the entire 2 hours and 43 minutes. There is a complete lack of buildup to a nonexistent climax, in which (spoiler alert, I guess) three men sit down, talk about going into a room, and then don't go into the room.Many reviewers absolutely love this movie for philosophical and intellectual reasons based around what the characters say. That's all fine and dandy, but you can't analyze dialogue when you're sleeping.

303,envergulsen,great masterpiece from greatest director,10,26 August 2004,"i want to say somethings about the most poetic,philosophical and intuitive director, tarkovsky and his movies ,especially Stalker.first of all, we must all know that, tarkovsky is not for all. his poetic understanding of life and human and putting this understanding to his movies is unique in the world for my opinion. one of the most poetic and philosophical movies of him, Stalker is that kind of movie. it is like a poem written with objects. we must feel before we try to understand.opening sequence of film contains some kind of expressionist objects with related the moral and inner conditions of the people living in the town . the ""dirty"" black and white take gives the viewers ,the mood of people having nothing to live, nothing to believe and nothing to give others.and the aggressive green take in the ""zone"" gives another vision of the life. the camera moves very slow to make us to go into to film and feel the film. tarkovsky's usage of objects and colours is very different and that is why i think he was a cinema poet. on the other hand, in addition to this ""poem written with objects"", the film also has very deep philosophical content. what is life,what is human, what is goodness, what is selfishness, what is devotion, what are the bases of our civilizations etc. and people are made to think all these things, not mostly with dialogs but with objects and colours and complete vision. for example, the three objects shown while the camera goes into the water ,but actually to the heart of human being and we see one cringe, one gun and one religious icon. and these are the metaphors of the human civilizations for my opinion. and all the journey into to the ""zone"" and finally ""room"" , actually done into the human being. into our selfishness,into our subconsciousness, our badness,our goodness, our weak and strong parts. actually i can feel that , the things searched in this movie are our lost innocence . the stalker is the only people who believes something and needs to believe .and actually the journey itself is a fake. to go to the truth,faith,justice, goodness are being related with innocence in that movie. the microcosms shown poetically in the water is another metaphor shows human being's selfish behaviour. because human, destroys the things,destroys the innocence, destroys the world living around them.our today's civilization broke our strong cooperation with nature and changed this relationship to a nature disaster. the movie gives the message of the need of mercy to all the living and even non-living things in our nature. because human being's salvation is only related with that.and the need of hope, need of believe is human being's basic needs. and our modern world destroyed all the hopes and believes. the movie contains metaphors making us to feel and think about those needs.and the most critical thing is felt in the film that self-denial is the basic need in our world.and unfortunately this value is lost and needed to be re-gain.i can tell about all the metaphors in the movie but no need. because every person understand those things different like kafka's novels. and we just need to watch the movie with no prejudice but with open heart.i recommend this film to all the cinema-lovers. i recommend also not to try to understand this film. only leave yourself to this great poem and it will give you all you need.",Stalker

There is no meaning. There is no drama. There is almost no story. Nothing is explained. It is tedious beyond belief. The mis-en-scene which may have seemed innovative in 1979 is now tired and done far better in many recent film and tv dramas. How did the director of Andrei Rublev sink to this?,Stalker
305,itsmikegregory,Excellent,10,15 February 2014,"Stalker is a wonderful science fiction movie from the 1970s made by a Russian director who is apparently quite famous there. Tartofsky or Tarkofsky? I should have looked before I started writing this review. Anyway. I obviously am not a huge film expert or critic or anything because I haven't heard of this movie before until a few weeks ago when my friends who were shocked I didn't know it or the director demanded that I stay and watch it with them. This movie obviously is well known to people who like movies that is to say people not like me! I don't think I have anything of value to say other than that it is an excellent movie and I recommend watching it! I wish it was in English because sometimes I felt like when I was reading the subtitles I missed some cool visuals. The movie is about a stalker, a guy who illegally leads people through a strange wilderness where bizarre things happen to get them to a special place where they think wonderful things will happen to them.

308,squealingbernierubber,"Weak, meandering religiosity - with some redeeming features.",3,13 June 2018,"Let me start by telling the reader that regardless of what you might have been told, this film is neither cyberpunk or dystopian(unless you consider the USSR in the 70s a dystopia in its own right).I have heard that the film is based on the Strugatski brothers' story ""roadside picnic"". I can offer no opinion on this piece of literature as I have not been able to get hold of a copy, except to say that the work of theirs which I have read is all solid, consistent SF. The Strugatskis also wrote the screenplay for this, which surprised me.As this film was banned in my country(Reason being 'glorification of communism', which is a joke), and seems not to have ever been released after the unbanning, I watched it on the Internet. I am sorry I blew a lot of data on a film of such low merit.First, the film is inordinately long-winded for the story it has to tell. Certain narrations and self-indulgent bits of cinematography could have been cut without harming the look of the film and tightening the storyline considerably.The conceit of shooting urban sequences in monochrome and the parts happening in the ""zone"" in colour is utterly pointless and adds little but confusion.Shortly, the story concerns three people.Introduced first is ""the stalker"", a tolkach(Soviet Russia: person who does illegal or borderline illegal free market transactions for which there is a demand). This gentleman's speciality is escorting people into the aforementioned ""zone"", within which a room is found which has the power of granting the deepest desires of those who enter(according to rumour, which the stalker obviously does nothing to dispel).Said stalker lives with his wife and daughter in an extremely dilapidated set of rooms which is open to the elements and situated next to the railway, whose trains shake it about. Later we hear that he has no real work and has been in prison several times for penetrating the ""zone"", and that his child is malformed due to the zone's action.His two customers, the ""writer"" and ""professor"" arrive. The writer is an alcoholic and the professor an academic nonentity.After much palaver the three set off into the zone. evading the police barricade. Apparently the zone has aspects of intelligence, killing people who disturb it excessively. The ""correct"" route to the room also keeps changing.The trip through the zone is the weakest part of the film. Although the two customers keep messing around, nothing happens to them and the ""professor"" even manages to find a short cut by ignoring orders.The ""writer"" and ""professor""(who detest each other) indulge in endless disquisitions on the purpose and nature of life, with the stalker joining in on the pseudophilosophical talk by perpetually alluding to religious themes, quoting the Bible, and minutely discussing the fate of another stalker called Porcupine, who got rich by using the room and later hanged himself.A ridiculous scene before the three discuss entering the room shows the professor calling his boss and insulting him, and the writer turning on the lights, showing the long-abandoned zone to have power and telephones working, which is almost impossible.The professor decided to blow up the room because it will attract dangerous types of people. Eventually he changes his mind and dismantles his A-bomb. The writer has decided that the deepest desires of people are debased and refuses to enter (The case of Porcupine is used as an example). Both insult the stalker, saying that he is addicted to playing God and uses the Zone and his clients for the purpose.Although the religious talk may have been very transgressive in 1979 Moscow, it is dated and boring now. ( A film about the rise and fall of Porcupine would have been more interesting.) This film preaches at you, it does not show you, and that is its failing.Positive points are the accurate depiction of a Pripyat-like area six years before Chernobyl, and for showing the living conditions of the most benighted class of people in the USSR(former prisoners).Recommended for fans of religious cinematography and the Turkish dross propaganda film ""Kod Adi KOZ"", which it is far better than.",Stalker
309,Sky-11,A tapestry of beauty and sorrow,8,26 January 1999,"""Stalker"" is a tapestry of beauty and sorrow. Tarkovsky's visual introspection of human life and hope is hauntingly realized through a journey into the Zone--an enigmatic area encircling a room which will fulfill any innermost wish of its vistors. In the wake of the three protagonists follows the breath-taking dreamscape and their fear of facing the essence of life. What is hope? What is love? What is our reason to live? All of the questions echo through this heartbreaking journey.Highly recommended for those who seek profound sci-fi matter. Also check out the beautiful poems from Arseniy A.

310,Mefisto-4,waiting for the end of the film,2,31 March 1999,Tarkowski is one of the most praised Russian directors but I can't see why after watching this film. The photography is bad and the story itself is worth nothing. the film is full of symbols and hidden meanings and it is to the spectator to reveal them. That's why intellectual people like this film because they can say that they understand it and so make impression on their fellow intellectuals. But symbols on itself don't make the film more valuable. It is just a boring film. The characters are not interesting and the story is stupid.,Stalker

313,chas devlin,Absolutely one of the most singularly beautiful films ever made,10,4 May 2001,"This film is absolutely wonderful. Tarkovsky actually manages to film images that we have never seen before: glowing fogbanks, dreams, unnatural sunlight. His use of an undefined deteriorating industrial landscape is delirious; his use of extremely slow and long camera movements creates a non-pulsed filmic time in which hallucinations, dreams, mystical visions can be inscribed into the diegetic space of the film, as integral to the film as any conscious subjective action/narrative, in much the same way Nicolas Roeg used the lush, drugged-out decor in Performance to display subjective, psychedelic mindsets. And the sleeping scene with the waterfall: nowhere have I seen images like that, they are simply riveting. Master! Praise!",Stalker
314,gabrielpoma,9/10,9,11 May 2020,"Alright, this is my first review on IMDb. I think that the best aspect of this film is the cinematography. The way the lense captures nature itself, the atmosphere that it creates and the colour textures derived from the environment makes this film one of the best ones I have ever seen. Timing is essential here as well, Tarkovsky plays with innovative angles that focus on a specific part of the set for a very long time, not to even mention the ridiculous amount of care for details overall, which make the scenes immersive and evocative. Now I realize scenes might be too slow at times, but I guess that is the whole purpose of this movie and Tarkovsky does it brilliantly.
Now on with the plot of the movie, which I consider to be secondary although still important and very interesting. I think most of the movie makes a play on symbolic aspects of human nature, including life, death, pain, etc. On the other hand, I think what Tarkovsky tried to do with the characters was to make them part of a play on the Aristotelian triad of rhetorical speech: ethos, logos, pathos. The writer as the confident pragmatist, the professor as the structured person and the Stallker as the emotional idealist (always wanting to help people). Now, we know that throughout the film the three display a range of emotions and communicate in diverse fashions according to the scene but, overall, they generally represent each one of these elements. The writer, for instance, seems to be the most nihilistic one of the group, so he takes on a more passive but at the same time fatalistic worlview, expressed in the film in the way he reacts to his environment, he does not care about the dire situation he is in. The professor has devoted his whole life and career to logic and reason, but the film makes it implicit that this ""hasn't saved him"", since he resents someone he worked with apparently, and went to the Zone just to find the bomb he created, claiming he would use it eventually. The Stalker, although mostly caritative and helpful is rather persuasive and seems to be at conflicts with himself deeper than the other characters, he hates that he might be perceived as a crook. More than make a statement on the notions of truth, I think that the message here is that individuals are always seeking for help, especially in dire situations like this, and they will seek it regardless of the sanity of the person they are seeking such help.",Stalker
315,gabrielpoma,9/10,9,11 May 2020,"Tarkosvsky also tries to delve deeper into some of the facets of the human experience. And he does it wonderfully by using the Stalker as a link between the ""lost"" individuals (the other two characters) to the spiritual world/psyche, which in some way is sadly unattainable from this perspective. I also think the movie tries to represent the concept of ""existential void"", ""emotional void"" or the lack of ""closure"" we all probably have faced at one time or another in our lives. He depicts a fatalistic/apocalyptic scenario where the individual has no means of achieving control over his life, let alone self-actualization. In fact, all there is, is self-abasement and lack of meaning. And these men feel it deep within their core, because it affects their identity, perhaps to some more than to others, but the outcome is always the same. I really ""liked"" the scene where the Writer confronts the crying Stalker about a secondary character's suicide. In a way, he wants to prove the existence of the ""Room"", so he questions the Stalker's beliefs as well. Finally, he implicitly says that Room grants (mostly) deep desires, not the superficial desires we usually like to think about. In other words, the Room would be the man's worst enemy if it actually existed (just as the Professor's bomb), as it shows the dark side of ourselves we don't want to see (that Unconscious Mind Freud talked about many many years ago).",Stalker

I agree with other postings that this film is beautifully staged. The scenery, and in particular the transitions between the various environments, is striking. However, this is very much a non-plot driven movie, relying more on character soliloquy and the genesis of deep introspective thoughts on man's relation to nature and himself (though in a much more abstract way). I would liken this movie to the second half of Logan's run and 2001: a space odyssey. We all need a place to meditate, get in touch with ourselves, and leave behind the rusty gears of our mind/society. In the USSR, a place like this is guarded with barb wire and guns.",Stalker
317,steelman1-1,A journey through Life and the Body to reveal the Soul,10,1 September 2002,"Stalker is a visual delight and another Tarkovsky masterpiece.  It would be a stretch to call this a ""science fiction"" film.  It seems to me as a story about faith, love and how a person truly sees themselves when there is no way to hide what really lurks in their soul.""Stalker"" is a man who leads people into a mysterious area called ""The Zone.""  The Zone has been cardoned off and protected by the authorities after many people had entered the area and vanished.  We are told that ""The Zone"" was likely created by a meteor that fell to the earth and could be controlled by aliens or a strange lifeforce.On this occasion, ""Stalker"" leads two men, ""The Writer"" and the ""The Professor"" into ""The Zone"" in search of ""The Room.""  It is a place in ""The Zone"" where one's innermost wish is supposed to come true, whether you want it or not.  ""The Room"" is a place that intrigues and terrifies all of the characters.  However, they must try and reach it and find out if the strange stories about ""The Room"" are true.Along the way, we see some incredibly long, but beautiful takes.  We also see the shots outside of the zone done in monochrome.  It gives the viewer the feeling that the world outside ""The Zone""  has become a colorless, cold place.When the men arrive in ""The Zone,"" the world suddenly becomes alive with color and it gives the viewer the impression that incredible things could happen in this mysterious place.  One's faith about the world and the beauty of life come alive again.""Stalker"" guides the men through ""The Zone"" by taking strange routes toward ""The Room.""  He throws bandages weighed down by bolts as a guide and is respectful of not taking the easy, direct path to ""The Room,"" almost as a tribute to its awe and wonder.Both of the men trying to reach ""The Room"" are doing so for entirely different reasons.  ""The Professor"" questions whether such a place can truly exist and cannot see how all of this can be.. he cannot understand the supernatural.. it is not within his framework of knowledge.  And he seems afraid of that which science cannot explain or understand.  ""The Writer"" seems to be looking for inspiration.  Along the way he begins to question whether or not he will enter ""The Room.""  Does he want his truest, most sincere wish?  Does he have any idea what his mind and soul truly desire? It seems in the end he questions his own faith and whether or not his wish would even be anything he WOULD want or could LIVE with.In my opinion, ""The Stalker,"" takes people on this journey because it is the only place where he truly has power.  He describes himself as a ""louse,"" but in ""The Zone,"" he is the guide who knows how to avoid the traps and mysteries of the region and takes people to a place where they can believe and have hope.The journey itself seems to be the story here.  It is almost as if the characters must explore their own lives and question their motives along the way to find out if ""The Room"" is even a place they WANT to enter.The visuals are highly symbolic.  They stop to rest.  Lying by, or in, still water which shows the stoppage of time for reflection.  The icons, needles and weapons submerged beneath the surface of the water show all of the things humans must contemplate throughout their own lives.  The characters even have to ""wade"" through water to get to ""The Room.""  It like they're wading through life itself.. asking questions about faith, science and philosophy along the route.  They almost have to wade through chest-deep water (like a baptismal) to get to the treshhold of ""The Room.""  ""The Writer"" even wears a Christ-like crown of thorns as he reaches the room.. but only temporarliy.  Is his faith to weak to become ""Christ-like"" for even a few moments?In the end, the fascinating thing about this film is whether they will enter ""The Room"" and if ""The Zone's"" powers are real?  Or all in the mind of their mysterious guide?  It is for the viewer to decide.And the closing shot of ""The Stalker's"" mysterious daughter, ""Monkey"" is brilliant and puzzling.  ""Monkey"" is an unusual child who cannot walk.  The impression is that it may be due to ""The Stalker's"" repeated exposure to ""The Zone,"" but we do not know for sure. We do see at the end that ""Monkey"" has special powers.. moving three glasses along a table (symbolic of the trio's journey into ""The Zone""). Is it telekenesis? God? The Zone? We do not know.  As with most of Tarkovsky's films, we are left to decide for ourselves.  And figure out ""who"" these characters are and what the film stands for.Each of us will come up with many different answers.

There are some great characters here but they don't seem to interact and there is not much by the way of development (is that the point?). I saw lots of references in the film but in many ways it seemed like a remake of the Wizard of Oz, attached to a Chernobyl style nightmare.

321,Heisenberg-Azazello,This is a political statement rather than a SF movie,9,17 December 2009,"After watching this movie for the second time, from the political point of view, it makes a different sense to me.The ''Obama mania'' that appears after the American elections, introduced a rather forgotten political myth, myth called by Raoul Girardet ''the myth of the savior hero''.In the collective imaginary the hero possess all kinds of ''special powers'' but in reality he is only a man, a mediocre one, a man who doesn't distinguish himself from the others.This hero appears only in dystopia times with many social and financial problems, in which people are putting all their hopes.Like the savior hero of the mythology, our hero, Stalker, discovers that he has a an unusual destiny and feels that is his obligation to save the people from all the mediocrity and the trivial of the everyday life. The similarity of the Girardet hero with Stalker comes from the fact that they both belong to a family, to a civil status, to a certain special environment in which he supports the burden of the family responsibilities.In the life of an apparent quiet city or country, his apparition is a tragic one. He addresses to those who are not respecting the established order, the normal course of life and the normal course of the time. For these men he is the ''providential man'', a ''leader'' a ''savior'' or a ''guide''.The challenge and the disruption that the ''guide'' makes in the ordinary life of the 2 men, is like a withdrawal in a fantasy world in which they can dream about everything ( i.e . Nobel prize ), and with the help of this savior guide all their dreams may come true. All their self confidence is restored and together they can face all the perils of their journey.In the journey the 2 men could be compared with ''new men'', because the journey itself has a initiation role and the guide has the all the power in their initiation, for them he is a role model which amazes and captivates them, and his every word has an important resonance for them.In the end we found out that one of them wants to destroy that mythological place, which can be viewed from a pure political perspective in which a man trapped in a close society is rather a destroyer than a builder, and in a society ruled by fear, the fear is the only weapon and the only logical judgment.From this judgment i made now i gave this movie 9/10.",Stalker
322,teo876,Words are not enough......,10,26 October 2009,"After so many wonderful comments it is difficult to say something else. Anyway, I cannot stop myself from writing few words for this amazing movie. It is probably one of the best ever made movies in its genre. Here it is, in few words, what the movie suggested to me. The whole movie is a metaphor to the human being, the passing through life and memories. I would like to consider it more philosophical than science-fiction. The human being is represented in this movie by the three characters: Stalker (The Human Instinct/Subconscious), The Professor (The Human Rationale/ The Reasoning) and the Writer (The Human Imagination/Humanism).All three are going together in the Zone and they never go one without each other. The target is The Room where you can have all your wishes come true. This Room would be like any ideal in life, you try to achieve it but you will never be able to do it. The whole trip to the Room is like the way in life. Never straight and clear, with a lot of strange things and a lot of details. The wolf in the movie represents DEATH. It comes closer to the Stalker when he sleeps ( I understood that when we sleep, we are the closest to the death state). I am not quite clear what represents Stalker's wife and daughter. Maybe somebody can give me a hint. Anyway, the movie is hypnotic. Just simple the best that can be done. I advise all Hollywood fans to not waste their precious time on this movie. They would have anyway only bad comments about it. Remember, the movie is almost 3 hours and is not an action movie. On the other hand, I advise all the open minds in this world to give it a chance and to try it once in their lifetime. Hopefully, they will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed it. Too bad that Tarkovsky did not leave more movies like this. Anyway, all his movies are masterpieces in their own way.",Stalker

I can appreciate that this is not a movie to just sit back and passively be entertained by. This is a movie that encourages you to be thoughtful and observant, kind of like a Professor and a Scientist. There are scenes in this movie that made me question my beliefs about what motivates humans to act, faith, and what in life is actually worth pursuing... those are some deep and big questions to arouse in a viewer and for that I definitely appreciate the film.It is definitely beautiful. The camera movements make you feel like you are watching a dream and pretty much each shot looks like it could be framed and hung at an art exhibit.The acting, while confusing at times, was very good.Now, the bad. It is long and confusing. I understand that some people love to let their imaginations fly when finding meaning in these ""art"" movies. I can appreciate that to an extent. However, I prefer to have some level of cohesiveness and direction. I could not care about any of the characters because I was not given anything to care about. Since I did not care about the characters or understand what motivates them, I could not care or understand their actions or how they interacted with the other characters. When a dog shows up, I attempted to interpret the meaning... but I simply lacked the information to make any sense of it. My point is, I prefer to have at least some context in order to interpret and prescribe meaning to what I'm watching. I like movies that make you think and are up to interpretation, but I this was just too abstract for my taste.My wife saw me watching this movie. She sat down and watched 10 minutes. She then got up and asked me why I do this to myself. ""This"" meaning watching boring old movies. I usually don't answer he because she wouldn't understand anyway, but with this movie I wouldn't have been able to respond even if I wanted to. Her question actually posed the most meaningful and philosophically challenging question of the night. Why spend my time after work fighting sleep and working to understand a boring old movie when I could be doing something fun or productive?

324,dominique1842,Masterpiece,10,9 April 2014,"This film is a moral film in its profoundest sense.Two men are called to believe in themselves, instead of believing that man is only selfish and worth nothing - a belief which is revealed here as a lack of self-respect of man for himself and as the source of the unhappiness he causes to himself and to others.They are asked (and so are we) to become aware of that thing, which is most important to man and which is unequivocally positive: love.This film thus is not a science fiction movie (there's no fictitious science in it), let alone plain entertainment. It is a work of genius, showing the way to happiness. And as a work of genius, it cannot be measured (e.g. being called 'flawless' or 'perfect' (not to mention other characterizations)). One can only admire it and be grateful for it.It is also not metaphorical or things don't symbolize other things than themselves. Then you are still looking at it from the outside and constructing a parallel story, which probably is much less relevant than the material it is constructed from. For example: how could water, being one of the foundations of our life and of all life on our planet, symbolize anything more relevant than itself? It is simply given its due place here, i.e. being valued for its own sake. And as such, this is simply shown, as opposed to being said or symbolized or meant, and for the viewer to experience, as opposed to construct or infer.

326,peeter-piiri-001,Stalker is not boring,10,19 December 2004,"It seems to me that I see Tarkovsky' movies differently from many other people. For me this film is not ""too long"" or boring. For me this is one of the best movies ever made.Western culture has a very long tradition of film-making. Usually typical western movie is focused on ""story"". (Of course - not always) The sharpness and tension of the movie are achieved by the big number of cuts or by the fast varying of shots or by the sudden varying of plans or by some surprising angle of camera etc. Tarkovsky don't like cuts. The number of cuts is minimal. His camera is moving like in dream (Bergman envied Tarkovsky for that), it has no angles at all. Colours are pale, ""dirty"", very tender, soft, almost black-and-white.In a typical western movie dialog is followed by the camera. Picture is illustrating text and is subordinated to it. In Stalker text and visual image are coexisting, cooperating with each-other. Both are moving on their own ways but at the same time, somehow - harmonically. Text and picture are not subordinated, they are both independent.Why is Tarkovsky using such a weird language? Surely not only because he wants to opposite the dogmas of western cinema. He has a positive message too. Audience of his films has to understand his films not only at the level of thinking or emotions, but at the level of much deeper consciousness. Therefore watching his movies means rather meditation than watching-TV-and-eating-popcorn. The purpose of Tarkovsky's films is to loose the mind of audiences, to wake it up to much deeper attention. So that audiences can simply watch and see.Stalker is not an entertainment and is not supposed to be. It means there is no sense at all to watch Stalker, when you need some amusing entertainment. Stalker is a serious movie. It is very narrow-minded to evaluate movies on the assumption of entertainment only. Of course, we live in the world of movie-consumers, produced by powerful film-companies, demanding more and more and more exciting entertainment. Consumer doesn't understand this movie. For him it is big bore.",Stalker
327,domboy100,"Some good dialogue and cinematography, but generally boring",2,6 January 2014,"I just read from Tarkovsky's bio that this movie ""had to be completely reshot on a dramatically reduced budget after an accident in the laboratory destroyed the first version"", which makes a lot of sense considering it was based on a book where, well, things actually happen. In this version of the movie, a ""stalker"" is leading two tourists through the countryside in an area that is supposedly ""the zone"", an area contaminated by alien presence. However, in the movie, it is just standard countryside. The Stalker, who in the book is supposed to be a rugged survivor, is portrayed in the movie as a wimpy conman who could well be making up the supposed danger of ""the zone"" to charge his guide fee (I kind of thought that was the point of the movie). The movie never shows anything actually dangerous or alien. Some of the cinematography of the green countryside is nicely shot, and there are SOME interesting exchanges in dialogue, but after the first hour this has gone seriously stale. My recommendation would be not to waste your time.",Stalker

329,tobias-hollinetz,The best film ever made,10,3 March 2019,"Stalker - a film by Andrei TarkovskyWhen talking about the best films of all time, Soviet work is often overlooked, although there's some of cinemas finest work hidden in history - 1979's Stalker might be the very best of these masterpieces.If I had to name one perfect film, a straight ten out of ten, in my book, that medal would definitely belong to this piece of art. This is by no means too high praise, as Stalker is nothing else but art - you could pause this beautifully shot film at any second and would receive a picture worthy of being put on a wall in your living room.But what would a wonderfully cinematographed film be if it was shallow, plotless and without meaning? This certainly is not the case here, as Stalker has excellently written, poetic dialogue, a story so deep and philosophical that every scene, every rewatch grants a little further insight into the secrets of the human psyche, as well as oneself. In fact, this film affected me so much, I would say it marks a turning point in my life, as it showed me how calmness and piece can succeed in creating a better world for everyone.I do understand that a lot of people think it ridiculous, that a nearly 3 hours long film ""doesn't really show anything"" and I do get those arguments, but it's impossible to see the greatness in it, if you go see it with the same expectations you would watch an American blockbuster with, there is no telling what and how here, there only is pictures, concepts, poesy - created to be interpreted based on individual experiences and beliefs. There is no defined message to find in this film, but neither was that what Tarkovsky intended.Stalker is without a doubt my favourite film ever made and I hope that it will be watched by more avid fans of well-made cinema, as well as be recognised for what it is - art.",Stalker

There are no monsters or aliens in film, which the viewers are expecting. Threre are only 3 people & nature.. full of strange artifacts and phenomena that apparently defy physics. But not only the idea of the film, which has actually something to do with reality(Chelabinsk-catastrophe, Tunguskij meteor) is good, but also way it is made from Soviet Union film director Andrej Tarkowskij.

Wow, remaking a film as perfect as Solaris feels like a misdemeanor. While remaking it into a barely technically adequate ""movie"", more like a felony. Just a crime against humanity I guess.Anyway, this movie and Solaris have got to be the two best films I've ever seen. Used to have Solaris a nose ahead. But after viewing them both again recently, Stalker edges in front.Seriously, the second scene blows my mind. It is a gorgeous, stunningly filmed scene of people living in absolute squalor. And the film only gets more mind blowing from there.I guess the reason it's so extremely low rated (yes 8.anything for this film is an extremely low rating), and the reason for the remake are one and the same. Short attention spans.Both films require patience. Not a great deal of it mind you, because every scene no matter how deliberately paced is a visual feast (no, not due to CGI, due to amazing directing and camera work. Fascinating concept, someone today should try it), and there's a lot to think about. The reason for the sepia tone in the first act is awesome, for a minor example.But even the little bit of patience this films requires seems beyond most people these days.And yes, I am a touch older (47).

332,nima_azad78,A way of finding hope in this world ...,9,15 June 2014,"Stalker is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen. There is a strange zone with high security levels to keep out ordinary people. It is said once a mysterious crash from outer space happened there. It is also said there is a strange room somewhere deep inside the zone with power to fulfill any kind of wish. There are only few men who know where that room is and know the zone well enough to avoid all its tricks and dangers. These men, these guides, called Stalkers.This movie is about two ordinary men who want to go into that zone with the help of a Stalker. One of them is a writer who has lost his inspiration and ability to write. The other is a scientist who seems to be curious about the room itself.The journey begins and we see them enter and pass through the zone. The world outside the zone is black and white but after they enter the zone everything turns to be colored. It shows the differences between the two worlds. One of them is boring and frustrating but the other one has spirit and hidden live in it. It's a world by special rules and orders. The silence of the area by itself heightens the tone of mystery. All the time we feel like somebody is watching, but who? Finally when they reach the room struggle between them arises. The scientist carries out a small nuclear bomb to destroy the zone. He believes any dangerous people and corrupted politician could get there and make a bad wish. Who knows the next person who wishes to go there? The power of the movie I think starts to reveal itself here. The stalker explains this room could be a sign of hope for its seekers. His life has been spent to guide people there. This room is a symbol of hope. At this point we start to think: does the room really have any kind of power? It seems the two traveler's wants to see that room more because of their curiosity than their belief.the two travelers are symbols. The writer is a representative of the artistic feelings of human. The scientist is the representation of logical aspect of us. Both parts can't find the way in the modern life. Which one could lead our lives better? Both the writer and the scientist seem confused and helpless in that room. At last they reach an agreement to leave that room alone and don't ask anything form it.Rain starts to fall down . They washed out of their sins. They are ready for a new start. Rain and water are key materials in Tarkovsky's movies. They are symbols of life and its continuity.The three wretched men are the main subject of the film not the science fiction background and the story of the zone. It ties to depict deep emotions and feelings but , but avoids to analyze . We all have our ambitions and hopes. We all might be happy if we could find our own room of dreams. But after all, do we dare enough to go there and make a wish? That room is us . It only reflects our deep thoughts, feelings and fears. It shows what we want to be or afraid to become  It's not a usual movie to watch. He is a poet who does not impose his ideas. It's more like an open text to read freely with different interpretations. Tarkovsky's films are new worlds. They won't repeat again anywhere. I think this film should be regarded as struggle of life to find a meaning for itself.At the end of the film we see Stalker's paralyzed little girl moving objects over the tables by mental power. Maybe she was able to do that because his father believed deep in his heart that room had the power to fulfill his wish. That room made him to move on and show the way to others. It is a strange end .I rated this film 9 out of 10 .",Stalker
333,realx-1,"Very profound and difficult to understand without a ""key""",10,14 January 2006,"I read all the previous comments, and I noticed very few were close to the deep (2nd plane, I could say) meaning of this movie. Andrei Tarkovski use the Strugatski Brothers' novel just as a pretext (or, maybe just to give the ""superficial"" - 1st plane - meaning of the movie). Maybe not many people are aware of the fact that Tarkovski was a devout religious person, an Orthodox Christian (as he declare himself in one interview). So, the whole movie is - in fact - a parable about the Orthodox / traditional Russian perspective of the life, man etc. We can equate the characters as it follows: The Zone = The Faith, the Path to God; The Meteorite = Jesus Christ; Stalker = Priest, Spiritual Father; Porcupine = Judas etc. The final monologue of Stalker's wife can be related, in this context, with the religious persecutions in Russia.I spoke of the movie as having two layers of understanding; I think it would be more accurate to say it's n-layered, as it can be understood in many ways - as these pages of comments proves. Nevertheless, I think the most closed one from director's perspective is the religious interpretation.",Stalker

I didn't hate it but also didn't even know if I liked it. But it just stayed in my mind. I was thinking a lot about this movie even a week after I had seen it. Why did I do that?After watching it a second time I still couldn't get it out of my head. Stalker had gripped me and wouldn't let me go. It's almost as if I went on a journey to The Zone myself. What would I do if I went there? What would happen to me if I made it? Only for that reason I can say that this is a extraordinary movie. This movie isn't about what secret lies at the end or what The Zone actually is. It's about the sacrifices you are willing to make and the dangers you want to face if you could have everything you wanted. But what if it's not enough? What is the thing I want the most? Stalker will drive you insane just like the characters in this movie.Yes, this movie is very slow. But does it really matter? The Zone is such a mysterious and eerie place, so why would one disturb it? Upon watching this movie a second and third time, you feel like you are the Stalker. You've seen it for the second time and therefore you know what it is about, but just like the Stalker you have no idea what The Zone actually does. This movie has a mystery that will never be revealed and that's why it's so gripping. Please watch this movie even if you're bored after 30 minutes. It will have an impact on you even if you dislike it and that's more than what most movies do.",Stalker

I was further astounded by Tarkovsky's ability to create this new world using natural sets and a minimum of effects (currently the standard approach).  Whether you like, appreciate, or feel comfortable in this alien world, this movie provides you with a unique opportunity like no other experience ever may; this is what it is like to look directly into someone else's brain (or soul, persona, etc.).  Some have criticized the movie as being slow, but the process of transforming yourself into someone else takes time.

Granted, it was well shot, but good direction alone isn't enough to save a movie. I found the constant philosophizing pretentious. The characters were unlikable. The dialogue was too heavy-handed and completely unrealistic (maybe this aspect was lost in the translation, but I doubt it). There were no special effects.  I appreciate lyrical films, but after two hours of watching these guys wander around a wasteland, I was sick of hearing every detail of the movie being questioned and I wanted some kind of payoff, anything, which never happened.

342,bogdancon-1,The Zone and the Kingdom of Heaven,10,25 May 2006,"There could be many things to say about Tarkovsky and his films. The most important (which could be found in many comments ) is that he does not offer us a very clear interpretation , leaving us to guess, wonder and question ourselves.My interpretation of this film is that the whole trip to the Zone and to its core, the Room its a metaphor for the dangerous trip the human soul takes in searching the redemption and finally the Kingdom of Heaven. Stalker (like Jesus) is the one who shows the way to this kingdom - and there are some arguments to this idea. First, before entering the dangerous Zone, he lies on the grass thinking (or praying?), just like Jesus did in the garden of Ghetsimani before being crucified. Stalker is the one who shows who could reach the final point of this trip: not the good or the bad, but the desperate ones. Stalker is the one who fights with the professor (another metaphor for the rational and logical part of our minds) who wants to destroy the Zone, and also Stalker is the one who in the end laments over the lack of will people have to enter the Zone and to believe in its powers.There are so many powerful shots in this film and I choose only some who really got to me: 1. the destroyed tanks in the first part of the trip are for me the communist weapons who tried to destroy the faith and the church in Russia and in the other communist countries. They failed. 2. the objects shown in the water when the 3 heroes sleep near it, the money, the weapon, the tiles under the water describe the precarity of our material world. 3.the water in the film, from the beginning until the end - it is pure poetry. 4. one dialog between the writer an Stalker, the writer is saying: ""who needs your room, i don't need your room"" - it reminded me the dialog between Ivan Karamazov and Alexei Karamazov, the first saying to the other: ""I don't need your God""But this is only one interpretation, and if it would be the only one, we would not be talking about a great great film.",Stalker
343,ahmedmmameen,"A Philosophical, Psychoanalytical Pursuit of an Elusive Truth",8,23 September 2019,"First of all, I think the idea of the 'Zone' is inspired by the real 'Tunguska' event that happened,predictably enough, in Russia, in a small eastern Siberian village in the year 1908 leaving behind a post apocalyptic landscape similar to that depicted in the 'Zone'.But apart from where the inspiration for the zone came from, using a post apocalyptic ambience as the dwelling place for a presumed truth/miracle is instrumental to the fact that it is impossible to reveal truths in the so strictly constructed social/urban/civilised system of our modern world where the human soul has been tamed,programmed and reduced to mechanized,predictable,readily manageable,repetitive units.This idea is reinforced and made clearer by the fact that access to the 'Zone'(truth) has been prohibited and even punishable by imprisonment by the wardens of the social construct (the government), for the revelation of an individual truth poses a threat to the mechanical harmony brought about by the individuality-crushing social constructs.Another praise-worthy detail of the narrative is the choice of the three main characters( a scientist, a writer, a visionary) conglomerating three different yet complementary approaches to knowledge and truth giving the narrative an epistemological touch.Throughout the journey, philosophical issues are brought up for discussion, posing plethora of questions rather than giving answers, prodding our existential senses, tickling our numbed self awareness and evoking dormant, long-oppressed doubts and insecurities.Examples of these philosophical issues include:
*The nature of self, is it the conscious, the subconscious, the archetype or something else altogether?
*Aesthetics and meaning through contemplating the mysterious, soul-moving enchantment of music.
*Whether the human soul is innately good or evil or neither, whether predestined to a purpose or synthesizer of its own purpose(the timeless existential dilemma), questionning the motives of the human soul which are more often than not ulterior masquerading as altruistic.At the end of the journey, we are left compounded, disappointed and ashamed, knowing that truth is so intimidating and baring that we,humans,symbolised by those three adventurers balk at it and cower behind our intricately sewn pretences, succumbing to a comforting lie in lieu of a disconcerting truth.Such a pessimistic and cynical scene has been compensated for, however, by the telekinetic powers of the daughter that, I think, symbolizes the perpetuation of hope/sacred fire down the generations.I would like to view the character of the stalker as an old testament prophet with a vision, trying vehemently to proselytize as many followers, guiding them to the spring of truth, but ironically enough, the prophet himself, knowing more than anybody else the enormity and gravity of the vision, is the one to manifest the most fear vowing to never enter the room!A final note is that as a Russian movie, the theme is no alien from a highly esteemed, dearly exalted heritage of Russian literature that has always had a penchant for digging deep in the human soul exposing its darkest pits while prospecting its elusive treasures, a theme that could be epitomised by the works of Dostoyevsky.",Stalker
344,hernandezaroberto,A pretty face with no story structure or respect for the viewer,2,23 August 2020,"If you want more out of a film than beautiful lighting and an obscure premise look elsewhere. I'll break down my criticism into 3 basic ideas, first that this film is pretentious beyond measure, second disrespectful of the viewer's attention, and third does not contain the deeper levels of meaning its fan claim. If you have 3 hours to kill for a movie that should have been 70 minutes at most, be my guest, but do not sit there and explain to me how important or meaningful it is that there is a dog in the final chapter of the movie drinking milk from a saucer. Neither can you argue that the inconsequential bolt throwing for the first hour and half of the movie added anything to the plot. Nor is there any build-up to most of the ""high points"" - if you can call them that - of the film.For the majority of the film we have long, and I mean excruciatingly long cuts of people sitting, laying, walking, thinking, or doing absolutely nothing. The very first shot of the film takes two minutes just to pan from the Stalker's wife to the Stalker then back to wife...WHY, for the love of god just show me a ten-second clip of he sleeping and the Stalker watching her sleep, mission accomplished. I appreciate a good lingering, but for the love of Christ panning to a river, or zooming in on someone's face for three minutes when nothing is happening, please don't think I can't absorb a shot in the first minute I see it.This points to another objective fault to the film it's level of pretentiousness. I speak Russian and watched the entire film in its original language, which leads me to think who wrote this dialogue? No one, speaks the way the people in this film speak most of the time. Their lines read like a novel or text pulled from a Nietzsche passage, how am I supposed to empathize or believe the struggles of these people when they talk like the first page of a Philosophy 101 textbook.*Minor Spoilers*
One scene in particular just really drove me bonkers as the level of emotional outpouring from the Stalker toward the end of the film. Why is this person having a mental break down if this is the Nth time he's leading a group of tourists to the Zone? Has he not dealt with these issues before? Why are they so important now, why does he try and stop the scientist from blowing up the room if he believes its pure evil and can grant the wishes of immoral people? This movie makes absolutely no sense from any logical point of view. If you want to argue it's a work of art, then I'd recommend anyone to go stare at a Pollock painting for 3 hours I guarantee you'll get more value out of it. Also, why are we told to screw ourselves as a viewer that we need to watch this movie for two and half hours and not even see what's in the room, or have any of them make a wish at the room, or have any meaningful outcome? The room isn't destroyed, a wish is not made, and the three decided not to do anything after having not really discussed the importance of this decision for the majority of the movie. Not that they discussed much in the movie anyway, I'm spitballing here, but there might be 40 minutes of dialogue in the whole film so do expect much exposition on a hugely complicated Sci Fi movie - I know, great tactic to use on obscure premise.2 Stars because it did look beautiful as a film, but a movie is a not a painting.",Stalker

Those who find it too long or boring are standing outside the experience, looking on. Stalker is like an ancient spiritual or healing ritual. It offers you the opportunity to enter into the process and by joining in at each step, allowing the carefully crafted pacing to work on you, come to a point of transformation. Each person has a different understanding of this film because what's in the Room is different for each of us. Every one of us has a deepest wish, usually unconscious, around which our entire life revolves. It drives all our decisions and relationships with people, things, society. And as the film makes clear, our goading wish is quite often not what we think it is - and not what we want it to be.Entered into in the right way, this film can bring you to a new understanding of yourself. You may learn something you wish you hadn't. That's what happened for me... but I'd rather know. Others may choose differently. Others may choose not to even enter the journey into their personal Zone, in which case this film will seem long and boring, like someone else's dream.Experiencing this film was a pivotal point in my life.

350,iraimonds,"Quintessential Tarkovsky. A must, if you can cope with a slow pace",10,10 May 2011,"This is a very special film for me. I first heard of it when about 10 or 11, and already then it had a mysterious aura surrounding it, the words ""zone"" and ""stalker"" just stuck with me. Then I watched it in my mid-teens, a time when I idolized Tarkovsky but of course missed much of the philosophical musings. Still, as a youngster already trying to comprehend this life, I found many ideas—and many expressions of the characters—thought-provoking. So, in fact, this film left its mark on forming my personality.That was back in the 80's. Today, I still consider ""Stalker"" one of the highest achievements of cinema, and to me it belongs, with ""Andrei Rublev"" and ""The Mirror,"" to the Tarkovsky ""top three."" A firm 10. Tarkovsky's hypnotic filmmaking literally draws you in, and it has always been a mystery to me how people can find this film boring. For me, it feels like barely an hour or so. I think, the reason is that the characters' spiritual journey finds a perfect expression cinematographically. Tarkovsky's art is pure cinema, he is interested in this kind of artistic expression, by which I mean that everything in this film (dialogues, camera work, music, acting, and so forth) works together to create a piece of art of cinema. It's never just ""talking heads"" reciting some ""profound"" truths, or just music trying to evoke some kind of ""deep feelings"" in the viewer, or anything like that. It's cinema. Of course, to relate to these particular characters you will need to relate to their journey into themselves. Because it is deeply emotional one too, not only spiritual. And yes, for many the pace will be too slow, sadly.Tarkovsky was never interested in an ""experimental"" cinema. He insisted that the artist must witness to the ""truth,"" as he sees it, artistically or otherwise. It seems to me that in this film this approach in a sense has taken the art to its limits. Because they are only a step away from the revelation, from a possibility of learning something deeply important. However, we can never learn the full truth about ourselves, and the art, in fact, can only ask questions, not give answers. If it starts giving answers, it steps over into the realm of religion, or philosophy. I love the moment toward the end of the film (you can consider the rest of the sentence a slight SPOILER) when one of the characters, losing his balance, almost steps into the desired room—and he almost panics. Even with the ""outer layers"" of their inner selves, those to show others and themselves, stripped down, there is still so much more to discover.This film also features some outstanding acting. Kaidanovskiy in the title role is one example, and of course, a Tarkovsky regular Solonitsyn, another. What a great actor he was. Although Tarkovsky's films can usually be appreciated quite well without knowing Russian, I doubt it is fully true in the case of Solonitsyn's lines. But I have never watched a Tarkovsky movie subtitled, only in Russian, so it's just my assumption.To sum it up: A quintessential Tarkovsky, a definite must-see for every movie lover. More importantly, a film which can make you learn more about yourself, or at least want to learn. If you are willing to.",Stalker
351,badbro13,insufferably boring and egotistical,1,21 April 2007,"This was in fact the most boring film I have ever seen in my entire life. I am not a hater of slow paced movies-- my favorite film of all time is 2001: a space odyssey-- but some movies, like this one, manage to drag you through what seems like five hours of mud without any payoff that you expect from a movie directed by a snail. This film very easily could have been a short story or a novella as the whole film was just simply walking and walking and then an occasional pause that the characters would take to reflect on universal truths and the meaning of their lives. Two hours could have been edited out. There are shots that last over five minutes where the camera does not move the least bit, and there seems to be no motive whatsoever for this decision. I felt many waves of pretentious as I sat through these laboriously long takes that gave the impression that the director did not in fact no how to build tension or emotion in a scene, except by letting the characters handle it. This works in Woody Allen movies, but in this film since the dialog is so repetitive and there is rarely any dramatic movement from the characters, you are left with the urge to gouge your own eyes out. I would rather eat my own flesh than watch this pointless exercise in pretentiousness and boredom. This film could have been a short play or a magazine article, and saved us the pain of watching three characters do the same thing over and over again in a series of mundane and repetitive shots. The lighting was awesome.",Stalker
352,cmxfanNO1,Stalker shaman mind Jesus Christ,10,8 April 2007,"First consider the Christian metaphor of the human mind, the clay pot (or the wine container, wineskin). You cannot put new wine into an old wineskin. Then think about one of the books of the greatest writer ever, Philip K. Dick's Intergalactic pot healer(=Jesus, or who else he could be?). You can even extend your mind to more straight forward text of the book The Divine Invasion. Sorry to tell you this folks, but PKD was a Christian and a believer of Jesus Christ as his personal savior and the complete sacrifice lamb for PKD's sins in front of the Father, or at least I do think so (am I right or am I right?).Then compare Stalker to a shaman. There is a gate to an area where most people dare not tread. There are gate keepers at the entrance. There are strange things to be found in the area, both good and evil. Some can even survive back home and only a few have things to bring back home with them. Many die trying to walk the area (therefore be aware and do not try this at home). Not unlike a shaman and the mind.The nuclear blast was only a cover up for the writer and the director; You could not shoot a picture like that under a communist regime.And finally, what did they find in the movie/book in the end? Think about that and compare that to the Christian meaning of easter.Feel free to disagree, but I am right anyways ;-)",Stalker
353,valera-12,"Stalker is based on ""Roadside Picnic""",10,10 April 2007,"I'm surprised so many people from outside the former Soviet Union were able to understand and appreciate this film. But anyway i just wanted to add that the movie ""Stalker"" is based on an incredibly deep and tragic novel ""Roadside Picnic"" written by the Strugatsky brothers. For anyone who hasn't read that book - find it and read it. It is a must.The characters in the film are actually based on characters from a few different Strugatsky novels. For example the writer clearly comes from the novel ""Ugly swans"" which is totally unrelated to ""Roadside Picnic"". The Stalker character in the book goes by the name of Redrick Schuchart and the story takes place in some imaginative East European town, which was turned into a filthy capitalistic city by the mere presence of the Zone and its artifacts that became an object of heavy trade. The film and the novel are correlated mostly in terms of surroundings. The rest is quite different. But both - film and novel - are probably among the best pieces of art ever created by human kind.By the way there's also a computer game out named ""Stalker"", which is based on both the film and the book. More so on the book, I would say, but still pretty far away from the original concept.",Stalker
354,karim-ratib,Looking for meaning,9,12 April 2007,"A childhood theme was discernible in this movie, and it has been picked up by other viewers. The fact that the child, Monkey (is that a boy or a girl? I got confused) is both unable to walk but able to move objects at a distance, struck me as bitterly ironic. And both these conditions are caused by the Zone. It seems to act like a destiny machine for children (out of control of course). But as to the view on childhood this suggests, I'm blank.The other point concerns the Room. Neither the writer nor the scientist enter it, in addition to the stalker doubting it would work for his own wife - or defending her for some other conjugal reason. To me, that means the Room is fake. And thus, the stalker is deluded, and is indeed seen feverishly complaining about the ""non-believing"" writer and scientist (to his same wife who's tenderly minding him). The writer and scientist did seem to me, on the whole, more balanced than the stalker, struggling with their own demons perhaps but at least consciously so. Still, they are not taken seriously, since neither enter the room, and the scientist actually defuses the bomb. It would have been an interesting experiment to go into the room, wish for the bomb not to explode (in an ""innermost wish"" way to keep the fairy-tale aspect), and then detonate it.By the end of the movie, we as audience have outgrown the Zone, just as the writer and scientist have. Still we're looking for closure for the stalker, and the only resolution I could find is that the dog comes back with him to the city. Perhaps the dog will remind the stalker enough of the Zone that he doesn't need to go back there, and can finally move to the suburbs with his family.So if the room is fake, and the stalker wants desperately to believe without finding a suitable object of belief, and the other guys going home to resume their lives, where does that leave us? It left me with a sense of awe for great cinematography. Those long shots allowed one to immerse himself into the scene and make unseen, imagined connections. And there are plenty of jokes too. I liked the one where they are sitting in front of the room and the stalker says he'd like to get his family here because they'd be safe. At that very instant, thunder roars and a torrential shower fills that room, drowning them in the noise. The scientist throws parts of the dismantled bomb in the pond.",Stalker

358,eveningrecords,Welcome to the Zone.,8,25 August 2014,"It looks and feels just like ordinary places. Places you may know even, or have visited before.But you must proceed with great caution. Every step you take re-shapes the very reality around you. Beware of traps, of fruitless trails, of dangers and treasures that swap disguises at every turn. Beware of yourself. You are different here too. The Zone is a place that exists both inside and outside of your mind. How you manage that fact will mean the difference between a beautiful adventure and a funeral dirge of apathy.The way in which Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' has the potential to re-inform and re-excite your relationship with reality is in my view one of the biggest selling points here.The film follows the journey of the Stalker, a guide for hire who leads his two 'thrill-seeking' clients, a writer and a professor, on a quest for wish-fulfilment through the mysterious 'Zone', a place only he can navigate and that the state seeks to quarantine from civilians. The Stalker's profession seems to draw both respect and derision from society. The writer cheekily refers to him as 'Chingachgook'. Both the writer and the professor express doubts about the Stalker's true qualification for this adventure, and about whether or not there is indeed any actual adventure to be had. Only the Wizard of Oz style transition from monochrome to colour strengthens our presumption that the Zone is a genuinely special place. This magical sense of uncertainty, present throughout the first part of Stalker, is intoxicating. In fact, it's like the best drunken and rainy afternoon in the park with your friends that you ever had.The second part of Tarkovsky's 'anti-quest' tells us more about the agenda and sensibilities of the writer and the professor, but there is the distinct possibility that you will find none of what they have to say very interesting.The philosophy showcased in the dialogue is of an elementary sort, and a seemingly reckless amount of screen-time is given to it. Perhaps Tarkovsky wants us to find their ruminations frustrating. Indeed, as the grand design of the screenplay is revealed to us, the message seems to be that Tarkovsky's Russia is being crippled by intellectualism.By the time the writer and professor arrive at the 'very threshold' of the Zone's supernatural core, they have Hamletized themselves into positions of zero actionability. It's another bitter failure for the Stalker, whose profession is also his spiritual calling. Few people are interested in the real gift of the Zone, Even fewer are worthy of it. And those few who show promise have a depressing habit of talking themselves out of their own worthiness at the last hurdle. Perhaps reason is the true opium of the masses...So for me, the engrossing and lyrical first part of Stalker gives way to a difficult and annoyingly elusive second part. But the film is very much like the Zone itself. Different for everyone. Well. Isn't everything. You take it and shape it and model it in your mind, trying to follow what you think are the rules.But what you get in the cave is a reflection of what you brought with you. Not what you 'thought' you brought with you. What you take home might not be what you wanted or expected, but nevertheless, you will take something from it. Even if it's just the same thing you started out with.",Stalker

360,jam457,Whats with the reviews for this film????,10,9 April 2008,"Reading the reviews on IMDb has cemented what I have always felt about this film and about art in general. It is not always about a ""product"" that sums things up in a tidy sentence or a two hour film. It is possible to criticize this film based on the conventions of the medium, but thats besides the point. Sure the stalker is the only fleshed out character, but the writer and the scientist are not even supposed to be characters to begin with. I think its fairly obvious they are archetypes that represent a conflict. Some people have said that the science versus religion thing is tired, this is missing the point completely!!!! Its the absurdity of trying to reduce any conflict to a duality to begin with. The scene where we observe them sitting together makes it all very clear. We are observing them from the very room itself, where our innermost desires are laid bare and revealed. With this insight we can see that there is no duality to begin with, but only different ways to strive towards an understanding, the characters are joined together, their separation dissolves. Someone mentioned that this film is ""straining for deepness, and many a viewer will constantly feel this strain."" They seemed a little confused because most films strain for this, as do most people!!!!! A successful film will always have this strain because that is part of our existence. Stalker evokes that yearning and allows us to feel it, and that is one of its best qualities I think. To actual visually embody the yearning for meaning, thats what A.T. has done here.Stalker vs. Solaris: Another point of contention on IMDb, Most people seem to like a Solaris more...all I will say is this: Solaris is much more obvious and much more straightforward. I guess people find it easier, but in its supposed ""humanism"" its actually quite sterile, its clean. It presents human problems but through a haze of ""greatness"" that you will find with a lot of art. Its filmed from a further distance is what I am trying to say.Stalker is the down and dirty, the swamp, the overgrowth, insects, water, rotting, rust. Its a much more dynamic world, just like our striving is much more dynamic than duality. Its dark, confusing, musty, a little frightening, but extremely beautiful. I would like to mention the use of the word pretentious. If you have you used the word pretentious in your review please read a dictionary and understand a word before you use it. That word is used constantly to instantly demonize something. It is the equivalent of calling someone an anti-semite. It is loaded and works against serious discussion and observation. THIS FILM IS NOT PRETENTIOUS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS OR HOLD ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE!!!!!!! It just exists as it does and its people afterwords that attach importance to it. A.T. refused to ever state clearly what this film is about. So you can discount everything that I just said and anyone else said about it.

Stalker lasted about four hours, and over half of that time there was no movement and very little sound. I can understand desolation, but there is a point where as a director you should say, what is the story I am trying to tell, and will this story come across. In that respect the director failed.

364,ieva-masyte,The search for hope,10,3 April 2011,"Former prisoner, nicknamed Stalker, earns money by leading people into the mysterious place called ""Zone"". This area is protected by the police, though even policemen are afraid to enter it. In the movie Stalker guides two men, professor of physics and writer, through Zone in order to find a room that is said to make the biggest wish of a person come true. On their way, Stalker warns visitors to follow his orders, because everything in the Zone is always changing, old traps disappear and new emerge, safe spots become impassible, and they are not able return the same way they have come. The shortest way to the room is not safe therefore they have to make detours. While characters slowly move towards their destination, everything in the place indicates wild nature's victory over human beings, represented by shabby remains of human technology (hooked electricity pylons, abandoned tanks overgrown with grass, weapons drowned in the river, all kinds of scrap metal, broken glass) and several human corpses. In this hostile environment the fear of death is always present, which makes the movie even more scary than most of the horror films I have ever seen. The most interesting part of the movie for me was to follow philosophical insights of three characters, all of them being totally different in their backgrounds, having different perceptions of the world, but all of them being somehow equally desperate in their lives. The writer is disappointed with the selfishness of the mankind and regretful about the bad things he has done in the past together with his current inability to write. The physicist, who most likely has lost his job and has unsolved disputes with his former colleagues, comes to the Zone with a purpose of blowing up the magical room in order to prevent bad persons with mad wishes entering it. However, his real purpose of this act is probably to create some meaning in his life, or, what is even more likely, to kill himself. And, of course, there is the former prisoner, who has achieved nothing in his life, is unable to make the lives of his wife and a handicapped daughter at least a bit better, but tries to find the satisfaction by guiding other people, who are as hopeless as he is, to the room, and giving them hope. Several other things I liked the most about the film were its beautiful shots and creative use of colors. The black and white scenes reveal how dull and dissatisfying is Stalker's life at home, and the colorful scenery of the Zone shows the only place where he can feel happy. There are also some colorless scenes in the Zone, representing Stalker being not sure about where he should go or about the way he should act. The only colorful exception of life outside the Zone is two scenes with Stalker's daughter, but they represent not Stalker's world, but rather the more interesting life of the girl. I admire the film of being able to clarify, strengthen not only the hopes and feelings of characters, but of the spectator as well. By watching the scene in which the three characters are sitting in front of the magical room and are staring at it, I could not stop thinking about my own biggest wish in life and what it would take in order to make it come true. Though the blowing up of the room is finally not committed, it is not clear whether either the writer or the scientist has visited the room. Actually, it is not even important. One of the final scenes of the film shows prostrated Stalker lying in bed. Although all visitors came back from the Zone alive, Stalker was not able to achieve his purpose, that is giving hope to others in order to make his own life more hopeful. He accuses the two men, and the rest of the mankind, of having too little faith. Another interesting scene is the monologue of Stalker's wife. She sadly talks about her difficult life full of sorrows, but comes to the conclusion that if there weren't any sorrow in our lives, there would be no happiness either, and no hope. It seems that in the end she is the only one, who still hasn't give up hope. And, most likely, her hope is in her daughter, which, as it turns out, is not an ordinary girl at all.",Stalker
365,msslemon,Do not watch this movie if you dislike foreign films or have misconceptions....,9,13 April 2011,"If you dislike foreign films, slow films, or have a misconception of what truly defines science fiction, then I will tell you now, that you will hate this movie. However, if you are fine with a film that actually attempts to do something, instead of aliens shooting at a protagonist who utters ""bad-a**"" one liners as he wins an impossible fight, then you will in most likelihood, love this one. Stop now, if when I say sci-fi you think of stuff like Battle:LA and Avatar. Stalker is a movie that explores the human condition. Throughout the movie, the scenes are defined by the long, drawn out, even sometimes awkwardly so, harrowing shots. Paired with the intensity with which the shots are taken, switching from a pan showing a lush green with three lonely figures centered within the frame, to tight over the shoulder glances following Writer down the Meat-grinder, the film builds its own unique, ethereal grasp. A common remark made on the lower ratings is that despite how dangerous Stalker keeps claiming the Zone is, nothing ever happens to them. If you have watched the actual movie, then you would know this to be false. Though, tie this to the over arching complaint that nothing happens in this movie. The point of the movie is not what physically happens, they want to get somewhere, they get there, then they come back to the bar, but what they understand due to this journey. The idea that men are, in essence, flawed by their selfishness, the death of hope in society, spirituality/empiricism etc, all are reflected in the resolution of the plot. All the men find that they are unable to actually find out their base instincts, as it is too horrifying for them to want to see. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredibly hard movie to watch, but it is more than worth the effort. It is resounding, deep, and unfortunately for some people, forces you to think.",Stalker

368,karnevil9-1,A short comment on the motifs and metaphors in this masterpiece,10,5 April 2004,"This film is based on a SF novel by the Strugatki brothers, called ""Picknick at the side of the road"" (the translation might not be very accurate). In spite of the very simplistic narrative and dramatic structure (the whole action takes place only in one day and only in three locations: the stalker's home, the bar where they meet and the Zone), this is the masterpiece of Tarkovski and probably of the whole cinema ART.You have to understand that this film is not sensational through its action, but through its metaphors and motifs. For example, the house motif, that appears in all his movies (The Sacrifice, Andrey Rubliov, Ivan's Childhood, Nostalghia etc.) also appears in Stalker, as everything that is outside the house. That means all the world that was destroyed and made hard to live in by man. Like the whole world, the stalkers home is ugly and sordid and like Rubliov he doesn't have a place to call home: ""For me everywhere is a prison"". Thats why he retires and finds his peace in the dangerous but alive and full of miracles space of the Zone. The Zone, sign of extraterrestrial or divine (apparently hostile) passage on earth, remains the only breathable place for man, because man hasn't reached to spoil it yet. The presence of the ""wishing well"" there says it all. The time in this film is as important, as in all tarkovskian art. The rhythm of the movie is given by the time that flows in it. The long frames express a relation between action and contemplation, between the meaning of that moment compared to the meaning of history. Although there are no retrospectives, the linear flow of the frames doesn't imply neither the subjective nor the objective characteristic of time. If you noticed, in the Zone they only travel in curves: ""Here the shortest way is not the straight one"" says the stalker to his companions. Anyway, these are few of the reasons why I think this is a masterpiece of the cinema art. For the ones that have rated this film less then ""excellent"" I would recommend that they see it again... and again... and again. ""BUT, EVEN THEN THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE"" - says the stalker at the end of his one day adventure. :) I would like to excuse myself for the spelling mistakes! (I'm from Romania :))",Stalker

370,epetr-lucl,the science of fiction and the fiction of science make friction,9,11 June 2012,"I feel no sort of commentaries or critics could ever equal what this unique film carries on. It could easily be just about how us, the eye, could make its way through, and the intensity of our participation... we become something like a ghost within the imagery of this film, as well as the Zone can turn inwards ourselves as a cinematographic (and not only) experience, it is not at all about a slow-paced rhythm, but more like of a seek for silence, when motions and sounds and landscapes and tensions unite, as if Mr Tarkovski played with the Light, and that, is what cinematography is all about. But do we believe in it, because you see, Tarkovski really believed, the cinematography itself needs a writer, a scientist, and even more, a stalker. Maby even the Room could be the darkroom where exposed pelicula comes visible, and maybe we, the viewers, are always at a threshold in relation to what the film carries on. The entire film is by itself a 'zone', but we just might not be able to get a clear way through. Whether we like this journey or not, depends on where it leads us, moment by moment, scene after scene, and which is our 'present'/presence in the image. We could call it science fiction just if we could call Tarkovski a 'dinosaur'. Interpretations are our motors of life, he just knew it and let everything open. I think that 'Stalker' did one thing like only few other cinema productions did, it swept away time in a unique way. Created a new kind of time, which for our modern beings is hard to understand or bear. It has to be lived.",Stalker
371,horrorfan909,Step Into The Zone...,8,10 November 2014,"The movie Stalker is first, and foremost, a piece of visual, moving art; it is moving poetry. The cinematography is stunning and quite possibly unparalleled. The primary thing to keep in mind when watching this film is that you will get out of it exactly what you put into it: if you look at it with brewing cynicism and little patience, you are bound to be either letdown or annoyed by this movie (or possibly both). But if you sit back and truly experience the film for what it is, you may walk away with a new-found appreciation for just what a film can actually be when one strips away the constricting limitations that we often confine to cinema. Stalker is loosely based on a science fiction novel titled ""Roadside Picnic"" by Arkady and Boris Strutgatsky. There was actually an original film that more closely followed the narrative of the novel, but when the original, undeveloped film was accidentally ruined, Tarkovsky chose to do an entirely different story in which he completely stripped away the character driven plot of the novel in favor of a visual story. The resulting product is a movie with minimal story and stunning visuals on a shoe-string budget. Two professionals, Writer (the cynic) and Professor (the reasoner) are accompanied into a derelict area known as The Zone by an individual called Stalker (playing the role of the hopeful ""Holy Fool""). Their primary goal upon entering The Zone is to find an area known as The Room, a place where only the truly hopeless may enter and, in turn, have their wish granted, but there's a hitch: The Room does not just grant any wish; it grants your truest, most innermost desire, no matter what that may be. Upon entering The Zone, danger supposedly lurks in every corner, ready to spring up at any second, yet we see none of this. Why is this so? Is The Zone truly dangerous? Or has the myth, the legend of The Zone simply grown larger than what The Zone really is? That's the true beauty of this film: we don't know! There is so much subjectivity in this cerebral film, and a good majority of the film can argumentatively be left open to debate and interpretation. From a cinematographic standpoint, the film is visually stunning. The switching back and forth from sepia tone to color provides a stark contrast between The Zone and the rest of the world. A point of contention seems to be the use of long shots and lengthy pauses, thus making the feel seem unnecessarily slow and drawn out. It is this pacing that is actually crucial to establishing the tone of the movie, in turn inducing a feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia that runs throughout the majority of the film. So at the end of the day, what is Stalker? Stalker is a psychological movie with stunning visuals that can probably be interpreted a million different ways by a million different people. It favors cinematic style over plot, and, in turn, expects you to connect the dots and walk away with a meaning that is uniquely personal to you.",Stalker
372,ravenburg66,A STALKER Biased Review,10,15 September 2020,"Note: There are no spoilers in this review!This is firstly a story and secondarily a movie, because the story is depicted so well, you will forget you are watching a movie, and this is quite rare for any kind of movie.
Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpiece, he is retelling a novel and is adding new layers to the story, the philosophy behind it can be overwhelming, especially at first view; this is a movie that requires multiples views, and I am the kind of movie watcher that rarely enjoys to see the same movie twice. There is a very short list of movies that I really enjoyed on the first and on the second view: Citizen Kane 1941, Batman 1989, The Dark Knight 2008, Alien 1979 and this one.
This is one of the best movies ever made and easily top 5. But you have to take some things into consideration before seeing this movie: You have to be in the right mindset, you really need the time to enjoy it, this is NOT A POPCORN MOVIE, and it's not a movie to see with your friends. You need to enjoy it by yourself at least the first couple of times, and only then you can share it with someone else (who preferably enjoys art movies with heavy philosphical undertones), simply because it requires all of your attention in order to grasp a fraction of what is going on. And this is the beauty of the film, if you only watch it superficially, it may seem that there isn't much going on, but that is only because you are not looking through the thin veil, you are only seeing what is on the surface. Speaking of which:The image is gorgeous, every frame looks like a still picture, this is Tarkovsky's best style, many have tried to replicate it, few have succeeded. And the best part is that they are not there to look pretty, every frame has a meaning and a purpose, there are no fillers, on the contrary to me the movie seems rather short. But very satisfying. Including the end, even though you might get lost through the meanings, once you see the ""whole picture"" it will be your favourite movie too.It has everything you need: Philosophy, Psychology, Science-Fiction, Cinematography, and the list might go on. If you want to test your abilities as a serious moviegoer and to depart from the mind-numbingly decrepit half-witted Hollywood movies, I suggest to start with something lighter like: Citizen Kane, or Frankestein 1931. The Stalker is always one step beyond.",Stalker
373,leostalker,Do you know interesting facts?,10,18 April 2013,"It's my most dear, secret movie, which I'm ready to watch again and again making journey with characters. As already mentioned in some comments, it's not even film, it's co-existence with travelers, it's a road to your heart or to God, or to elsewhere. I could tell much about this masterpiece, but would like to say about things people, even fond of Tarkovsky art, might unaware of. Below is a quote from Tarkovsky; ""For me this work is expression of power of a weak man, man of faith, man of highest spirit. His actions might be impractical and absurd. But impracticality is a sign of high spirit. He has an idea. There is no Zone. He just invented so to take two-three desperate people, bring them there and inspire an idea of some hope for the happiness sake. But finally none of them want to enter this simple room"". This is a answer to those (I'm also amongst them), who expressed they guesses that the Zone and the Room are not actually produce miracles or disasters, but just Stalker's words. Though we see corpses, tanks and other things that supposedly confirm the existence of something supernatural, but real miracle (or peril, or change of mind, or growing of souls, if you want) takes places spiritually. This Tarkovsky's explanation (some people, as I am, realized this even before learning Tarkovsky's words) only adds depth to the film. Another interesting point is that the final monologue of Stalker's Wife supposed to be IN BAR (and it's actually shot THERE – look at the wall behind her, when she is speaking), not in Stalker's home. I learnt about it from interview of the editor of the film. She (it was a women) offered Tarkovsky to move this scene from the bar closer to the end so to have an effect of addressing not only to Writer and Professor, but to the soul of an amateur. The editor said to Tarkovsky that the difference of the surroundings would not be marked by a amateur because his attention on that moment is fixed on the face of Alisa Freindlich (Wife). Tarkovsky finally agreed and put this scene to the final and it became much deeper then it would have been in the bar. Wife now addresses to all of us (as Writer did sitting near a hole in the Zone after going through the ""meatgrinder'). I watched film many times and paid attention to the interior of Wife's monologue – it's in the bar! Thanks to advise of films editor we have such a important change of the final moments of film. To end it I would like to mark a strong scene, almost nowhere mentioned. When crippled daughter of Stalker seems to walk Film returns in color and Artemiev's music is heard as to underline the miracle. And several seconds later camera moves revealing us the truth – she is sitting on Stalker's shoulders. What a piercing, shrill moment of a miracle that took place only in our imagination. Wonderful moments!",Stalker
374,vladimir-leksa,faith of a child,10,18 April 2007,"Faith or religion is the gift given to us, secret, deep and hidden, like a zone in the film. You can approach that zone as a philosopher, a scientist or spiritually, as a stalker. However, it is all wrong unless you are child. because only as a child we should believe. These are the thoughts born in my head as watching this movie. As all other Andrej's movies it is simple and beautiful in its film language, music, pictures and rhythm. I feel deep sadness while watching this film, yet not frustration or depression. There is hope and light unceasingly present, if you do not lose or forget or bury your childhood spirit and faith.

Maybe one of the Genius named Tarkovsky more ""acceptible"" movies, but still a definitive in the philosophic and psychological movies. No, it's not your typical sci-fi movie in the American way it's more complex and deeper. Just listen to the dialogs and pay attention to details and references. Especially the moment with a text from the Revelation. And to those who find this movie boring - you just have not grown to the level of this kind of movie. It's not a Saturday Night entertainment. It's something to think about, the true existential questions and like religious revelation for the mind and poetry for the soul. Deeply personal for the director and each of us.",Stalker
376,htmkrm19,Ideas about the meaning,9,8 September 2013,"SPOILERS ... What was the hidden concept ?? I think the movie Stalker with its strong symbolism can be interpreted in the context of the Soviet era when religion was brutally suppressed. ""The zone""/religion is a place that provides a comfortable sanctuary from the material dull life, and is guarded from entering by the military/ communist authorities. It came to exist from a meteorite/ a heavenly message to earth. For the stalker/ the religious man, it represents home and comfort, although he always enters it with fear to make it/God angry. The zone/ religion has its own natural laws/miracles that defies logic, but you have to get along with. It promises a ""room""/paradise were your innermost wishes come true. The road/ life work to reach the room/paradise is tough and requires guidance from a stalker/ religious man. The existence of the room/ paradise has been always challenged by science/the professor and philosophy/the writer, and despite that they try to explore the facts of religion, and have some understanding for it, they could not accept it at the end. Science/the professor was ready to destroy what he could not rationalize, and from the standpoint of the stalker/religious man, science/the professor and philosophy/the writer are completely ignorant despite their knowledge. The stalker personal life/ the religious man life is not materially fulfilling and may be disappointing. The daughter may represent the outcome of following religion blindly, the mind/body may be crippled to move freely but it may have sensitivity and mysticism not owned by others.",Stalker
377,odmediapro,Great film,10,14 November 2013,"One of the greatest films directed by Russian prodigy Andrei Tarkovsky. The film inspired by Roadside Picnic is directed by Russian prodigy Andrei Tarkovsky. Although based on the Strugatsky novel, there are many divergences from the written story. The Zone remains as the principle focus and its most cherished treasure is once again the target for the adventurers. Other than that, the origins of the Zone and the trespassers who are lead across it by the Stalker are all completely new characters and explanations. An unnamed Stalker, presumably based on Red from the novel, begins his day by trying to sneak away from his sleeping wife. He fails, but not even her most heartfelt pleas can persuade him to stay away from the Zone and the multiple dangers it presents. This is, after all, how he makes his living.",Stalker

The plot seemed strong and reasonable and also something I was not used to seeing. Unfortuanatly however I felt that the film moved at an extremely slow pace and there was not much to it at all. I think that this film relied heavily on the dialog and interactions between the characters and considering the fact that the film was originally a Russian film; I feel that a lot of it was somehow lost in the translation. Don't get me wrong it may actually be quite good if I actually understood Russian. So if your Russian is quite good give it a shot, otherwise us it to fall asleep to because there isn't much to keep you captivated.",Stalker

380,AntonioSalieri,A soulful experience!,9,18 November 2018,"So, a stalker, a writer and a scientist, try to enter a ""zone"", so as to reach a certain room that grants wishes. Because we have no back stories on any character whatsoever(aside from the stalker's family which isn't enough at all), I strongly believe that the 3 characters represent 3 archetypes and how they interact with the world, each one has his own way of finding truth within this universe, the stalker has faith and less logical reasoning, he thinks that there's more side to this world than what is material, the writer who completely rejects the idea of faith, represents art, the scientist (which resembles the writer in a way), also discards faith as a valid tool to reach any truth, and kind of relies on his scientific method.
The zone in my opinion and the journey towards it is a miniature representation of the human quest towards finding happiness in this world, each on of the characters has his own methods, but they're both guided by the stalker, he tells them very ambiguous things that no one ever confirmed, he uses nuts and bandages and he never explained why, I think that's a metaphor for religion or metaphysical interventions in our lives, no one can ever confirm it, but people use it anyways to make sense of this world, even towards the end of the film when they're trying to get in the tunnel, the scientist told the writer to use the nut first, he doesn't know why, but he was indoctrinated to do so throughout the journey, just like humans when they're faced with the meaningless of life, they tend to believe in absurd things just to reassure themselves and become less worried about it, at the end no one knows anything for sure.
Another thing that I noticed is that Tarkovsky never showed us any sing of those perils the zone claims to inflict, The stalker keeps warning the other two of the dangerous punishments that would occur if they misbehave, and even if they do, he keeps telling them that they were only lucky, exactly like religion beliefs, hell, sin..etc
at the end of the movie, I was so bewildered as to why the writer and the scientist refused to enter the room and make their wishes come true, they suffered so much on that journey but they couldn't claim their reward, a reward of eternal happiness and hope, why though?
I think that, Tarkosvky is sending us the message that, happiness and hope aren't that important, it's the journey that leads to them that is of a paramount importance, achieving them perfectly (as the room claims to do) would only be harmful and would destroy any meaning of happiness, just like what happened to Porcupine, the room granted him a fortune, which was his ultimate desire(he claimed that he wanted his brother to be saved but that was only a facade), but realized that the money meant more to him than his dead brother, he couldn't bear that thought and sadly suicided.
the constant longing for happiness and the idea of hope are the only things that would save us, if they were served to us on a silver platter then nothing would ever make sense, as the stalker's wife clearly said on last shots of the film when she broke the 4th wall, she said that the balance between sorrow and happiness is a must, you can't have one and discard the other, even if grief was so much more consistent, that's life, that's us.",Stalker

You can tell from the fact that it would be just as good without sound, or sound without image, or even just a set of freeze frames played out.That being said, what you actually get in this film is intense and vast imagery, from the minute to the universal, horrible dankness to expanding nature, inside and outside of rooms; and what is also rare, is that NOTHING is wasted in the script, no fillers, and no retreat from exactly what is going on.The things that turn people off about it are all of its virtues, it's long, it takes its time, its script is poetry, and it doesn't shy away from talking about life.It is also complex, but does not 'try' to be complex. It's actors, all of whom are cast perfectly, especially the almost alien demeanour of Alexander Kaidonovsky (as the paid for hire 'Stalker'), are not really there to entertain you, you are there in Communist Russia walking through cold wet puddles, with little in the way of supplies, going somewhere strange, without knowing what's going to happen.If the world of film was filled with the opposite of this, which it is, one would have to search through the dross to find anything as worth while as this.",Stalker

With Stalker it is doubly true. The first time I experienced the tunnel scene my heart nearly stopped. This was in 1984 I watched the TV listings in England for 20 years waiting for a repeat - finally buying the DVD in 2004, though I couldn't really afford it. Proof that a SCI-FI film does not need tons of effects to work. In a science fiction film book I read years ago they rated Stalker as the only film ever made deserving full marks in all 3 sections. Imagine if Tarkovsky had made a film of one of PKD's novels ?! OK, I'm dreaming ?! We are lucky to have been blessed by his genius. The good die young.

By the way, I remember my face was locked. The interesting part is that I watched Russian with English subtitles, but all the dialogues came to my mind in Turkish.

Once inside, they attempt to reach the Room, which grants a visitor his or her innermost wish.",9,19 November 2014,"Director Andrei Tarkovsky does an excellent job emphasizing duration in the film - time slows down with the use of long durational takes. The long takes help focus the viewer as he or she needs to pay close attention to the dialog with the action being so slow. It also encourages the viewer to contemplate the philosophical dialog as pauses occur during the scenes. Through the men's journey, we as viewers learn that the men populate the Zone with their own fears. They imagine various traps as they throw bolts and proceed cautiously through the region. We get a sense that there is someone constantly watching the men with pseudo point-of- view shots that show the back of the men's heads in scenes such as the trio riding in on the train.We learn through the story of Porcupine that the Room does indeed fulfill wishes, your innermost one at that. But what is critical about that wish is that it is a wish that you may not even know - Porcupine thought that he really wanted to help his brother but he was actually seeking wealth - and this can cause the recipient to become ashamed, guilty, and even drive him or her to commit suicide. Though this film was produced by a Russian film director during the era of the Soviet Union, there is no clear Soviet ideology, but there are elements of philosophy and religion. Religious elements include references to the Rite of Penance and the Book of Revelation in the Bible, and the viewer watches as the men discuss life's toughest questions. I think that the pace of the film combined with the philosophical dialog makes this film incredibly fascinating, as the viewer is required to think a lot about their own beliefs and fears. I felt engaged throughout the film, and I would recommend Stalker to anyone who wants think critically about the philosophical elements of life.",Stalker

The characters seem kind of stiff and don't really seem like there really ""in their roles"". There's hardly any action. There's a lot of suspense, but nothing happens from it. There's a couple scenes that are interesting like when you get to see shot of war torn Russian streets. Overall, I would not recommend this movie. Its just too slow and no action to keep you excited.

The setting of the film focuses majorly on nature and the elements of the wilderness. It also touches on human nature as you follow the journey of three men risking their safety to explore unknown territory. It is a very slow yet suspenseful film, making it hard to look away regardless of it's lethargic pace. I liked how open ended the story line was because it really kept you guessing as to what would happen and how it would end, therefore making every conversation between the men meaningful and captivating. The overall eerie feeling of the film adds to the suspense and forces you to think of all the possibilities the film could end in.",Stalker

The story of this zone is such an empty place yet there is more to learn from it. The camera angles used to simulate the mysterious stranger watching the group is brilliant. Finial the lack of fluff of explosions builds such a greater tension to which little else could take its place. Today films are first thought as art but entertainment, like a cheep trick.

Many of the tropes and plot points in this movie are what one might expect to find in an American science fiction movie.

While the film moves slower than any you have ever seen, it does so in a manner that draws the viewer in, leaving you wondering what will happen next. From the very beginning of the film nearly every take is so long that the tension just continuously builds, and even if the character stayed in the same building the same type of shots would have carried the amazing feeling of suspense. The slowness of the movie also play an important role in the way that Tarkovsky wants the viewer to think about the film. It gives the viewer time to think about the coded messages that he presents from beginning to end. Furthermore, it also adds to the ideas we take away from the movie. Instead of viewing certain sequences as action based, it leaves a feeling that many tings are meant to be symbolic or purposefully exaggerated. Overall, the film does not disappoint from beginning to end with many slow turning twists that leave you scratching your head and asking what it was you had just seen. The acting and plot combine to complete what truly is a great film.",Stalker

The way in which scenes were shot enhances the plot in a way that allows for this rather slowly moving film to keep the viewer enticed the whole time, for every image on the screen felt as if it was vital to the story. The film also allowed for the viewer to draw personal inferences as to what was happening, going to happen, and did happen in the film. This helped to make the film extremely satisfactory in an entertaining sense and provided the viewer with a sense that there was much deeper meaning to be found within the movie.

It's not an easy watch, you must possess an extreme genuine love for the art to reach till the end. I read in wikipedia that the film wasn't received well by the audience upon it's release.

Tarkosvy portrays the future as a bleak, ravaged Russia through a color palette never seen before on the screen. He blends Sepia, black & white and color in a mesmerizing way that you will remember long after watching the film. It is much different than any other science fiction film I have ever seen. It is a starker, more apocalyptic version of the future that mirrors Fury Road in some ways... but the two are nothing alike. There is some action and suspense, but the attraction lies in the characters. The Writer. The Professor. The Stalker, whose name I'm not even going to spell correctly. The film has a feeling of dread from the very first frame. Indeed, it has been compared to David Lynch's 1977 abstract film Eraserhead, but to me there is no comparison.

The film just cannot be compared with the book. The book is much more interesting, provides more details, much closer to the real life, and still contains all the strong ideas. The only thing, which is absent in the book - visual effects. Of course, sometimes in the future I will watch it and I will really like it - I know that for sure.

Most of us do not have real dreams and we try to get pleasure from common treats. This movie asks us if we have a real wish an so it is hard to anwer after watching.,Stalker
404,garbanzomudsalad,This film is a rare and redemptive work of art.,10,26 February 2006,"Not for the aesthetically challenged! If you tend toward logic and reductionism... chances are you will not enjoy this film, as it utilizes confusion as a vehicle to explore posture and understanding. If inclined toward symbolism, silence, mystical wonder/wanderings: hence if you have come nose to brick with the wall of existential/epistemological finitude, you may enjoy,.. or ""feel"" an uncertain familiarity with the themes.In form/structure: one of the more brilliant mosaics I have ever seen weaving sound, color, plot, character development, scene selection... etc., into a seamless crescendo.Own it and watch as thought-enema every 16 months or so, or when the neon buzz suburban sprawl of film/TV/media begins to encroach on your spirit.This film is a rare and redemptive work of art.",Stalker
405,asiakonic,Great example of movie-poetry,10,24 July 2020,"""Stalker"" is over two and a half hours long; its pace is deliberate and its payoffs, by movie-movie standards, amazingly paltry. Most of the action takes place amid voluptuously overgrown industrial ruins.Stylistically, Tarkovsky pares away the overt science fiction elements of the story, and imposes a stately pace and long takes to create a sense of seamlessness, of ""one long take"", as though a Chinese landscape scroll were unwinding before our eyes. There are echoes of Beckett's sparseness.The film follows three men -- the Scientist (Nikolai Grinko), the Writer (Anatoliy Solonitsyn), and the Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky) -- as they travel through a mysterious and forbidden territory in the Russian wilderness called the ""Zone."" In the Zone, nothing is what it seems. Objects change places, the landscape shifts and rearranges itself. It seems as if an unknown intelligence is actively thwarting any attempt to penetrate its borders. As I wrote, Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' remains a great example of movie-poetry, easier to experience than explain.",Stalker
406,ca_thor,Pure poetry,10,7 July 2006,"A Film of incredible beauty and philosophical insight. An allegory about the meaning of life, of beauty, of hope. The rhythm is slow, the film being full of long shots but all done with an incredible sense of composition, colour and light. The beginning, with the locomotive sound and Beethoven 9th really delighted me, as well as the dialogues on Newton's binomial formula... Pure poetry. Civilization, with its pollution and its mal d'etre is depicted in tones of black and white, while the zone, some very old battlefield, a place of destruction turned into a place of hope, thrives with colour. A spiritual, yet innocent and simple, guide, the stalker, takes a scientist and a writer full of culture, cynicism and disbelief to enlightenment or maybe just bare beauty and communion with nature, which they refuse in the end out of bitterness...",Stalker
