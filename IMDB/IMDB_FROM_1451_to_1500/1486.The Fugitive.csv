0,bkoganbing,The premises of the TV series,8,11 June 2019,"Back in the 60s I tuned into ABC TV on Tuesday night to see how David Janssen as
Dr. Richard Kimble would once again escape the clutches of the law. Kimble was a convicted murderer who escaped execution in a train wreck. Once out Kimble
searches for a one armed man he saw leaving his home where his dead wife was
who can clear him. Searching for single wing and avoiding the cops was what was
behind every episode for four years.That's still in the film, but it's a more complex motive behind the killing and it
involves Kimble's colleagues in the medical field. Harrison Ford who is now
Richard Kimble is as resourceful as Janssen was on television. What is a change
is instead of the very dour Barry Morse as Lt.Gerard the pursuer and a lone hand pursuer we have good old boy Tommy Lee Jones who is in command of
a unit of Fugitive chasers. The voluble and quotable Jones earned himself a
Best Supporting Actor Oscar for what he did here.The tension is good and crackling throughout and both Ford and Jones have
their moments. Ford and Jones are evenly matched as adversaries. As the
pursuer Jones could easily have been made to look like Wile E. Coyote as Morse
was sometimes over the run of the TV series.Also Joe Pantoliano has some good moments as Jones's 2nd in command. He
has some droll lines.This is one case where a movie adaption of a classic television series did not
make you wax nostalgic for the series.",The Fugitive
1,Leofwine_draca,One of the best thrillers of the decade,8,18 June 2017,"The 1990s wasn't exactly a decade known for quality cinema. Particularly in the second half of the decade, Hollywood became obsessed with poor quality CGI and the like and the quality of movies in general plummeted. However, in terms of action movies and thrillers, there were still plenty of interesting titles being released, none more so than THE FUGITIVE. A remake of the cult 1960s TV series, this blockbuster hit pitted hunter Tommy Lee Jones against wronged man Harrison Ford in a refreshingly adult and old-fashioned story that could have been directed by Hitchcock back in the day.There's a lot to love about this one. Harrison Ford plays his usual resourceful hero, but he's more grounded and believable than most and as a whole the story is far more realistic than expected given the excesses of the decade. Jones is the scene-stealer here and deservedly won the Oscar for his wry, finely-judged performance that contains a lot of humour. The supporting cast is also of a high calibre. However, the real winner is director Andrew Davis, who brings back half the cast from UNDER SIEGE and crafts a film which is just as thrilling and edge-of-the-seat exciting. Despite a fairly lengthy running time, this journey is never slow, and it's only occasionally clichéd. It has a real drive to it, a sense of momentum that sees it through. A fine sequel, U.S. MARSHALS, followed.",The Fugitive
2,SnoopyStyle,Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones perfectly matched,8,9 March 2014,"Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is called in for an emergency surgery. When he returns home, he finds an one arm guy murdering his wife (Sela Ward). The cops don't believe him, and he is wrongly convicted. Kimble's prison transport crashes when the prisoners try to take over and is run over by a train. Kimble escapes and Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) takes charge of catching Kimble. Meanwhile Kimble goes in search for his wife's killer.There are just so many classic moments from this movie. Not to mention that these two lead actors are perfectly cast as their characters. Those great lines just sings out of Tommy Lee Jones' mouth. The investigation is also compelling. The whole movie is just as entertaining as heck.",The Fugitive
3,Hitchcoc,Tommy Lee as Harrison Ford's Javert,9,3 January 2017,"Most of us remember David Jansen as the fugitive, Richard Kimble. Every episode was another hiding place, another near escape. Barry Morse's Gerard was tireless, obsessed. So now we have Harrison Ford, whose facial expressions of pain and anguish are priceless. He is the perfect victim of a crime he did not commit. He is formidable, like Indiana Jones, but always looking over his shoulder. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard has that itch he needs to scratch. He is utterly determined to get Kimble. He continually puts himself in danger, risking his life for his cause. He is like Javert in ""Les Miserable,"" where the job supersedes all else. The close calls and the gyrations Gerard must perform to continue his pursuit are almost superhuman. Kimble is left with only one option. He must find the one-armed man and prove he committed the murder. This is a marvelous adventure film which should appeal to nearly every taste.",The Fugitive
4,classicsoncall,"""I didn't kill my wife.""",9,5 May 2018,"I'd only seen snippets of this movie in the past but never the entire picture until the other evening. I thought it was a well plotted thriller with only a couple of minor quibbles that distracted from the main story. One was when Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), on the run from Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Samuel Gerard), committed an unforced error by responding to the sound of his name on the staircase. The other was during the St. Patrick's Day Parade, Kimble sheds his heavy topcoat and when he heads out of the parade route, Gerard appears to have been walking closely behind without realizing it. My question would be - how and where would Kimble have discarded the coat without anyone noticing? Otherwise, the film's story line was well scripted with tantalizing details regarding the villains of the piece dispensed like crumbs to help the viewer follow Kimble's progress in solving the crime of his wife's murder. But aside from Kimble, it's Tommy Lee Jones's character, Samuel Gerard, that keeps the story crackling with beat pounding forensic work and deftly inserted humor to sharpen the suspense. I liked the idea that Gerard slowly but steadily brought his own way of thinking around to consider that Kimble might be innocent, something you don't see very often when authorities think they have an open and shut case. And in this instance, the case had already been decided once, so Gerard and the rest of his team were more or less involved in a deadly cat and mouse game until the pieces with Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbé) and security expert Sykes (Andreas Katsulas) began to fall into place. I guess the biggest downside to the picture if there is one, is that we didn't get to see Sela Ward all that much. As Mrs. Richard Kimble, she wasn't on screen very long, nor was Julianne Moore, who shares top billing as the doctor who smoked out Kimble's ruse at the hospital. Both were fine in limited roles, along with Joe Pantoliano as Gerard's second in command. But gee, who names their kid Cosmo?",The Fugitive
5,gavin6942,It Wasn't Me! It Was The One-Armed Man!,7,3 October 2006,"Harrison Ford is arrested for killing his wife, a crime he didn't commit. Through some incredible luck, he escapes on the way to the prison and returns to Chicago, completely undetected because he shaves off his beard. Can he find the real killer before the marshals (led by Tommy Lee Jones) track him down? This film is considered one of the better films out there. It was good, but I wouldn't say it was the greatest. Having just watched ""Striking Distance"", I found some of the similarities to be a bit unfortunate. I mean, they're two very different films but coming out about the same time makes me suspicious.Ford is great of course and Jones is the perfect man to face him. Julianne Moore also gets a top billing, but I'm not sure why because she has no more than five minutes of screen time. I could have used a full hour of her.What keeps this film going is the mystery and conspiracy. It runs very deep and keeps you guessing, so much so that even in the end you may need to watch the movie again to really understand who is connected to who and what. I think I saw a plot hole or two, but maybe it was just so complex I couldn't tell! The action is also good (especially the train-bus collision) but this should not be your reason for watching it.If you liked this movie, I strongly recommend you read up on the case of Dr. Sam Shephard. My understanding is that his case was the basis for the show and movie, so you might want to see how things happen in real life. Just a suggestion.",The Fugitive
6,lee_eisenberg,A perfect display of both men's talents.,7,1 October 2006,"I had never heard of the original TV series when the movie first came out, but when I saw the movie several years later, I was quite impressed. What's really interesting is the dichotomy of Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) trying to escape, Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) trying to catch him, and how both men try to outsmart each other.OK, so how many man-on-the-run movies can there be? Well, ""The Fugitive"" justifies them. And while Tommy Lee Jones - who won Best Supporting Actor - has since become typecast as the pursuer, remember that this was the original. Of course, Harrison Ford is the real reason for the movie. His gravitas reaches unmatchable levels here. A real treat. Also starring Sela Ward, Julianne Moore and Jeroen Krabbe.",The Fugitive
7,jboothmillard,The Fugitive,8,22 September 2005,"I always like a good crime action thriller, and this is another fantastic one based on a TV series. Basically well respected surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble (Golden Globe nominated Harrison Ford) found his wife Helen (Sela Ward) ferociously murdered at home, and the police mistakenly found him and he was accused of murder. He was then tried, convicted and sentenced to death, however, he manages to escape when the prisoner transport bus crashes. Kimble is now on the run, both escaping the cops, led by Marshal Samuel Gerard (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tommy Lee Jones), and trying to find the guilty man and prove his innocence. Also starring Julianne Moore as Dr. Anne Eastman, Joe Pantoliano as Deputy Marshal Cosmo Renfro, Andreas Katsulas as Frederick Sykes, The Living Daylights' Jeroen Krabbé as Dr. Charles Nichols, Daniel Roebuck as Deputy Marshal Robert Biggs, L. Scott Caldwell as Deputy Marshal Poole, Tom Wood as Deputy Marshal Noah Newman, Ron Dean as Detective Kelly and Joseph F. Kosala as Detective Rosetti. The action and some stunt sequences are exhilarating, Jones deserved the Oscar, and this film has very witty pace. Jones returned in a sequel, U.S. Marshals in 1998, which obviously cannot come close to the great action and thrills of this. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing, Best Music for James Newton Howard, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Editing and Best Special Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Director for Andrew Davis. Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!",The Fugitive
8,ccthemovieman-1,Fabulous Thriller That Endures,10,17 October 2005,"This a one of the best thriller/suspense/action films I have ever watched, and I've seen tons of them for almost 50 years. It ""endures"" because it is just as entertaining on the sixth viewing as it is on the first.Of course it helped it was based on a TV show that people my age watched religiously every week, so the plot if familiar and many of us wanted to see how the movie would stack up to the TV program. Well, as good as the TV series was, this was far better. Two scenes alone: the train wreck and Harrison Ford taking a swan dive - were worth the price of the film. Great stuff.The story has been discussed by many so let me just add how much I appreciate the sound in this movie. When this film first came out on VHS, I used the opening moments as a demo model for various surround systems. The DVD has enhanced that as well as the picture.The film has just the right amount of action scenes, very interesting characters and a storyline complex enough to bring you back for multiple viewings to totally understand it. Ford, of course, is the star with Tommy Lee Jones a close second, but the more you watch this, the more you appreciate EVERYONE'S acting in this movie.And, by the way, filmmakers take note: here''s another example how you can make an ""edgy"" modern-day crime film without a ton of unnecessary f-words.",The Fugitive
9,rmax304823,The Doctor is Out.,6,3 August 2004,"Part of the fun of the original series, lo those many years ago, was watching Doctor Richard Kimble get turned into Doctor Richard Humble. I mean, here he is in the person of David Jansen, and we know he's got a sconce full of medical knowledge and everything, yet he's running from town to town being a gardener or a pool guy or something, never able to show off his skills until the end of the program when he's called on to reveal his identity by saving someone's life. It was like watching Jimmy Stewart in ""Destry Rides Again,"" the newly arrived sheriff acting like a bumbling inarticulate naive idiot until half-way through he unlimbers his guns and leaves the town goggle eyed.The movie lacks the tension associated with that kind of status discrepancy.It doesn't really matter much that Harrison Ford is a doctor. He's only called on to exercise his skills once. And he never is hired as a handy man or chimney sweep so there's no real mystery about his true occupation to be unraveled.I'm pretty much skipping the plot of the movie because it must be pretty well known by now. But I will say that the episodic semi-mystery of the original, with Kimball getting involved in the lives of various locals, has been dropped in favor of a standard chase/action movie, and not a bad one if you disregard certain facts. One of the facts to be disregarded, common to action movies of this caliber, is that the human body is destructible. Instance: Dr. Kimball does this Brody out of a sewer outlet and falls down the greatest biggest most horrifyingly tiptoptoloftical cascade of water you ever saw. The scene reminded me of an old Tarzan movie in which Tarzan dives off one of the towers of the Brooklyn Bridge. Like Tarzan, Harrison Ford, emerges from the midwinter water, shakes himself off like a dog, and makes off through the woods with only a look of irritation to show for the experience.The solution to the murder mystery, when it comes, arrives rather suddenly and without earlier hints. All of a sudden there is something to do with falsified results of liver damage. I don't know what's the big deal about Provasic. I once asked a doctor to give me something for my liver. He gave me a bag of onions and that was that. The ending involves more human indestructibility, multiple shootouts, a helicopter with one of those bright spotlights, a chase across a roof, a fist fight in which middle-aged doctors throw punches that would stun a rhinoceros, and so forth.Harrison Ford is okay. We don't get to see nearly enough of Julianne Moore.She exudes intelligence as well as a peculiar beauty. Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding. He brings something unique to each role. And Joe Pantoliano is as good as always, which is to say pretty good. Joeren Krabbe is a smooth villain. Well, with a name like that, could it be otherwise? Come to think of it, we should have seen more of Sela Ward too, a Southern black-eyed susan if there ever was one. It's easy to understand why, after she was murdered, Ford carried a grudge against the perpetrators.Well, see it if it's on TV sometime. Or rent it if you want action. And if you want action, the first bang-up bus-train collision should keep you happy for a while.",The Fugitive
10,Tweekums,Kimble is innocent!,8,15 May 2017,"Dr Richard Kimble is a leading surgeon at a major Chicago hospital but that doesn't help him when he is accused of murdering his wife. All the evidence is stacked against him; there is no sign of a forced entry, there are no unexplained fingerprints, she had scratched him, her dying 911 message sounded as if she was saying he did it and his story about finding a one armed killer in his house seems very far-fetched. He is tried and convicted to death but as the bus takes him to prison another prisoner attacks a guard; this sets off a series events that causes the bus to crash onto the railway line that runs alongside the road. Kimble gets out just before a train hits the wreckage. The police assume there are no survivors but US Marshal Deputy Samuel Gerard isn't so sure and sure enough it becomes obvious that somebody has survived. Kimble is on the run but rather than heading for somewhere far away he sets about getting back to Chicago so he can find the 'one armed man' not exactly the actions of a guilty man. Gerard starts to suspect that Kimble might be innocent but that won't stop him trying to catch him; it is his job to catch escaped felons not solve crimes.This film may be almost twenty five years old but it still feels fresh. Things get off to a good start and it isn't immediately obvious that Kimble isn't guilty. The scene where the crashed bus is hit by a train is spectacular without being overdone we don't see the smash repeated from different angles as I've seen in at least one other film featuring a similar event. That might be the most spectacular event but there are lots of other great moments; most notably Kimble leaping from a dam into the turbulent water below. There is also more action towards the end as Kimble closes in on the real killer and the authorities close in on Kimble. Harrison Ford does a fine job as Dr Kimble although I imagine the only reason for his beard, which made him look about twenty years older, was so he could shave it off later as part of his change of appearance to aid his evasion of capture. Tommy Lee Jones is equally good as Gerard; he is an interesting character as while he is in some ways an antagonist he is really a good man hunting a man convicted of murder. There are also solid performances from Joe Pantoliano as Gerard's deputy and Andreas Katsulas as the 'One armed man' among others. There is a bit of a twist at the end although this isn't too much of a surprise. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good solid thriller with little in the way of offensive material.",The Fugitive
11,dbdumonteil,on the run...,5,2 April 2004,"An adaptation of a famous TV series, ""the fugitive"" was a blockbuster when it was launched in 1993. Did I enjoy it? Yes and no... We deal with a spirited action movie, led without any dead times and with a well-balanced performance. I was told that Tommy Lee Jones almost stole the show from Harrison Ford. Honestly, I didn't have this impression.But ""the fugitive"" is also a movie without any major surprises and where you can detect a lack of inventiveness because it confines itself to the usual rules of the detective movie: a man wrongly accused of a crime he didn't commit, a will to discover the real culprit, police on his tail, a predictable progression sprinkled with stirring chases. Furthermore, the script, which is sometimes repetitive doesn't exclude unlikelinesses and the end makes the whole conventional.Nonetheless, Andrew Davis knows his job and ""the fugitive"" remains a spectacular and watchable movie but also too much superficial to call it a masterpiece.",The Fugitive
12,blanche-2,Great thriller,8,26 June 2008,"Harrison Ford is ""The Fugitive"" in this 1993 version of the popular television series. The film also stars Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, Sela Ward, Julianne Moore and Joe Pantoliano. For you young 'uns out there, ""The Fugitive"" TV show starring David Janssen was based on the 1954 Sam Sheppard case, the subject itself of 10 books and two movies. Dr. Sheppard. accused of murdering his wife, claimed to have seen a ""bushy-haired man"" at the scene. It was a landmark case, resulting in the creation of the ""change of venue"" motion.The film ""The Fugitive"" keeps the basics: Dr. Richard Kimble, en route to prison to await execution for the murder of his wife (Ward), escapes after a terrible accident. On his trail from the beginning is a U.S. Marshall, Sam Gerard. Both men have way above average intelligence, so while Gerard is able to get close, Kimble always eludes him. After stealing clothes, shaving his beard and dying his hair, Kimble goes to the hospital where he worked and gets into the computer database to find the one-armed man. He knows he injured the man's arm in a fight, and repair of the arm would have necessitated a visit.This is a real on the edge of your seat thriller, with an absolutely spectacular beginning sequence that grabs the audience and doesn't let go. In the TV series, the one-armed man is an intruder; here, a different storyline has been added, and it's quite good. One of my favorite parts occurs when Kimble, disguised as a janitor at the hospital, overhears an incorrect diagnosis for a young boy. Because the ER is so busy and there is no one available, he's asked to take the child to another floor. While doing so, he conducts his own quick examination and writes a change of orders; the boy ends up in surgery. The OR doc (Moore) catches Kimble looking at the child's x-ray, and when she learns the boy never arrived at his destination, alerts security. Gerard asks her later, ""What happened to the boy?"" ""He saved his life,"" Moore says.Both Ford and Jones are at the top of their games and very well matched, Jones bringing a lot of humor to his role as the determined Gerard. Ford looks a little like the Ape Man in the beginning with all the facial hair; as Kimble, he's sympathetic and his desperation and determination are more internalized than Gerard's.It wasn't until 1998 that DNA evidence finally exonerated Sheppard, who was released in 1966 after a retrial (in the original trial, the judge told reporter Dorothy Kilgallen that Sheppard was guilty). Sheppard died in 1970, his life ruined. Fifty years after the case, it continues to influence courtroom proceedings and inspire books and films. This ""Fugitive"" is particularly excellent.",The Fugitive
13,Quinoa1984,The most intense picture of the decade,10,29 April 2000,"The Fugitive is the biggest heart-pounding thriller I have seen in a while (and the best one this decade).  The story revolves around Dr. Richard Kimble, played by Harrison Ford to pythagorean procision.  Kimble is accused of killing his wife and is chased all over Chicago by Marshalls while looking for his wife's one armed killer.  One of these Marshalls is Samuel Gerarg (Tommy Lee Jones terrific and Oscar nod performance) who after a while believes he is innocent. Spectacularly done in the tradition of crime/drama thrillers with Ford and Jones working better together than ever before.  I found this film to be the best film experience of the early 90's, and hopefully you will too. A++",The Fugitive
14,edwagreen,The Fugitive Should Have Fled With the Script **,4,26 July 2010,"After one has seen the outstanding television series, you realize what a disappointment the 1993 film was.The fast pacing of the show wasn't there and Tommy Lee Jones winning the best supporting actor award for his performance as Girard was ridiculous. (The award belonged to Ralph Fiennes for his brilliant portrayal of Nazi killer Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List."")The television show was a guessing game of Dr. Richard Kimball's whereabouts. To think, in the movie, the good doctor was hiding out in the hospital all along. This is ludicrous. Don't you think that the police would have looked into this right away?",The Fugitive

16,hitchcockthelegend,The fugitive's name is Doctor Richard Kimble.,9,25 May 2008,"Dr Kimble is falsely accused and sentenced for the murder of his wife. Whilst being transfered to prison a breakout occurs, seizing his chance, Kimble goes on the run in a desperate search to clear his name. Hot on his tail is staunch Marshall Sam Gerard, a man who always gets his man.Based on the long running and popular TV series of the same name, The Fugitive stands up as one of the best thrillers of the 90s, it's full of action and tight sequences that dovetail excellently with the who done it plot. The film opens harshly with the murder of Helen Kimble, and we are shown that it wasn't Richard who killed his wife, this puts us firmly onside with Kimble and his pursuit of the truth. Much credit must go to Harrison Ford who layers Kimble perfectly, Kimble is an honest hard working man reduced to fugitive tactics to avoid capture, always seemingly one step away from being caught, Kimble becomes something of a modern day hero figure, and in this Ford excels. As Sam Gerard we have Tommy Lee Jones having the time of his life, gruff and ready for a rumble, and with a quip at every turn, Gerard is a man we know is not to be messed with, and Jones portrays him wonderfully as the obsessive pursuer he is.From that harsh opening, to a quite breath taking sequence with a train, the film cements itself as a bona fide top draw thriller, however, the second half of the picture, whilst still an intriguing mysterious chase movie, does veer down the formulaic road with it's conspiracy plot line, but it really is a minor complaint that doesn't send the film to averageville. The Fugitive at any one point is never less than great fun, high on action and containing great performances to crown the smart David Twohy/Jeb Stuart screenplay, the film is a winner from start to finish. 9/10",The Fugitive
17,Theo Robertson,Chase Movie That Often Jumps The Shark,6,23 February 2013,"Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say "" Hey guys the trail has gone cold "" but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings",The Fugitive
18,Hey_Sweden,"""I didn't kill my wife!"" ""I don't care.""",8,23 August 2017,"Roy Huggins' original 1960s TV series gets reinvented for the big screen, with engaging results. The premise is that an esteemed vascular surgeon, Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), is tried and convicted for the murder of his wife Helen (Sela Ward, in a pretty thankless role), despite his claims that he'd tussled with the REAL killer, a one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas). On his way to prison, Kimble seizes a chance to escape, and takes it on the lam. Naturally, he's determined to solve the crime, but almost always manages to stay one step ahead of the equally determined Federal marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) on his trail.While the story is not a great one (and won't bear a lot of scrutiny), it's still a solidly entertaining one. Director Andrew Davis (""Code of Silence"", ""Under Siege"") does a masterful job of directing this chase thriller, guiding us towards some pretty impressive set pieces, such as an amazing bus crash / train wreck, and a VERY long dive off of a dam. Davis and company hit the ground running, and even though their film runs two hours and 11 minutes, the pacing never drags. Every scene serves a purpose, and commands ones' attention. Great music by James Newton Howard and superb location shooting in Chicago are all part of the slick and stylish package.Of course, one of the most compelling facets to the film is the cat and mouse game between two very strong personalities, and both Ford and the Oscar winning Jones are extremely well cast. Not all of the supporting actors & actresses get a lot to do (Julianne Moore is only around for one section of the story), but the other roles are also nicely cast: Joe Pantoliano, Jeroen Krabbe (in a role originally intended for the late Richard Jordan), Daniel Roebuck, L. Scott Caldwell, Tom Wood, Ron Dean, real life Chicago cop Joe Kosala, etc. Jane Lynch can be seen in one of her earliest film roles.""The Fugitive"" holds up pretty well almost 25 years later. It's just good, straightforward entertainment all around.Eight out of 10.",The Fugitive

There was suspense, action, drama, and fun in a film that did not insult your intelligence. The Anti-Hero Jones and the Hero Ford played off each other magnificently. The cinematography, FX, editing, sound, music - all of it were superb. The direction by Andrew Davis was outstanding.

Now he sets out to prove his innocence by tracking down the one-armed man. Hot on his trail is a highly-resourceful, single-minded Deputy US Marshall, Sam Gerard, and his team.Great thriller. Wasn't always apparent that this was going to be the case though as the first third or so of the movie was more just about Kimble running away: physical feats etc. However, from a point it became quite intelligent as Kimble investigates who killed his wife and Gerard tries to get one step ahead of him. It became more of a crime-drama and less of an action-drama, which was a very good thing.The intensity towards the end is almost off the scale, making for very entertaining viewing.",The Fugitive
22,Boba_Fett1138,Well made movie.,7,6 August 2005,"This movie had been made with lots of profession both in front and behind the camera. The directing is subtle and nice and the performances by the actors are excellent.Really the best thing about ""The Fugitive"" is the acting, in particular Tommy Lee Jones. Basically his performance alone is what makes the movie work well and makes the story believable enough to be captivated by it. No wonder he won an Oscar for this, it's his best role till date and his character is an highly memorable one. Harisson Ford plays a boring average man which work well for his character and the movie. Other actors worth mentioning are Joe Pantoliano and Jeroen Krabbé.Still ""The Fugitive"" is not a movie I enjoy watching. The story, especially towards the end gets a bit too complex and perhaps even ridicules. I don't know but for some reason it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie, that was just basically a tense chase between Dr. Kimble and the U.S. Marshals. I think an action/thriller movie like this should be made just for pure entertainment were not a lot of thinking is required. Yes, although I still find it a good and recommendable movie I still tend to call this movie an overrated one.The movie is filled with some tense and memorable chase and action sequences that alone are reasons enough to go and watch this movie. The whole train/bus crash at the beginning is already regarded a bit as a classic action sequence that is well known to everybody.Worth watching mainly because of Tommy Lee Jones and the nice action and chase sequences. However if you expect this to be a simple entertaining action flick, think again, you're better of watching another movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Fugitive
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Pretty exciting, but overall, a very standard thriller",7,28 March 2004,"This is a pretty standard thriller. Harrison Ford performs pretty well, in fact, most of the actors portray their characters very good. I really liked the typical in-your-face smart-ass character that Tommy Lee Jones' played; he was a great comic relief, coupled with Joe Pantoliano. I also enjoyed the inventiveness of Harrison Ford's character, throughout the movie. The plot is interesting, but I guess it's mostly there as an excuse for a mostly standard thriller. The characters are believable and all the actors portray their respective characters well, with no exception. The suspense is pretty good, and it lasts for most of the movie; unfortunately, at the very end it seemed to degenerate into a typical thriller, and for this movie, it just seemed like it had the potential to be better than that. The movie is one of the better thrillers, but it's only worth watching if you like standard thrillers, and you're just looking for the pick of the bunch. I'd only recommend this to fans of standard thrillers, or fans of any of the main actors. 7/10",The Fugitive

As I've heard from my parents it was a long running series with Dr. Richard Kimble perpetually on the run. Well, in that case, the movie was on point.I thoroughly enjoyed this who dunnit movie. As good as Harrison Ford was as Dr. Richard Kimble, Tommy Lee Jones was better as the lead officer hunting down Dr. Kimble. In fact, I would say that TLJ put his name on the map with his performance. Sure, he was good in Under Siege, but he took it up a notch in The Fugitive.The Fugitive was a terrific story with terrific acting, an all around blast.",The Fugitive
25,evanston_dad,A Thinking Man's Action Thriller,7,9 February 2009,"Harrison Ford runs and Tommy Lee Jones chases after him in this big-budget film adaptation of the popular television series.This is a Hollywood action movie for the thinking man, where you can tell that at least as much thought went into characterizations as into the numerous technical stunts. One of the film's strongest ingredients is the chemistry between Ford and Jones, all the more remarkable since the two actors don't actually appear physically together on screen very often. Jones, especially, steals the show, and I remember sitting in the movie theater at the time of this movie's release thinking that he would at least be nominated for an Oscar (which he was, and which he won).So, good movie for its genre....but an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture? I don't know about that....Grade: B+",The Fugitive
26,AaronCapenBanner,Superb Version Of TV Series.,8,2 December 2013,"Andrew Davis directed this surprisingly superb cinema version of the classic TV series that had starred David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, and Barry Morse as Lt. Philip Gerard, his pursuer. This time, Harrison Ford plays the wrongfully convicted Dr. Kimble, who was found guilty of murdering his wife Helen(played by Sela Ward) despite it being the work of a one-armed man(played by Andreas Katsulas) After his train derails in an escape attempt gone wrong, Kimble becomes a fugitive, as he relentlessly tries to hide from authorities led by U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard(played by Tommy Lee Jones) and uncover the true killer, which ends up not being just a simple burglary gone wrong... Well acted and written film has incredible action scenes and suspense, and neatly condenses the TV series. Plot may end up being a bit too complicated in terms of conspiracy, but otherwise this is the textbook case on how to adapt a TV series to film, which is so often botched.",The Fugitive
27,FlashCallahan,Made when people went to see the film because of its Star....,9,20 March 2016,"Dr. Richard Kimble returns home from work one night to find his wife Helen has been murdered. The killer, a one-armed man, manages to escape before police arrive. With lack of evidence pointing to the one-armed man, Kimble is arrested and charged with murder. On his way to prison, the transport bus crashes, giving him the opportunity to escape. Kimble decides to find out who the real killer is and why his wife was murdered. But a US Marshal named Samuel Gerard and his team are tasked with finding Kimble and arresting him. However, the further he is to catching Kimble, the more Gerard is convinced he is innocent..........As my summary says, this was made when Star power was one of the main reasons why films made so much money, and ironically, this was released the same year that Last Action Hero flopped, starring Schwarzenegger, easily the most bankable star in Hollywood at that time.Along with Cruise, Hanks, Gibson, Stallone, and Costner, Ford was among those actors who's name above a film title would guarantee a huge revenue at the box office, and this was one of Fords last film that was huge because he was in it.It also helps that it's thrilling from beginning to end, and for a remake of a TV series, it's pretty intelligent and doesn't spoon feed the audience with all the Basil Exposition we are 'treated' to now.But what really stands out is the change of mood when the film flits from Kimble's quest to Gerard's. It's almost like the film has two different narratives, and the tones of these narratives are much different.Kimble's is cold, dangerous, and untrusting, while the Marshals quest is honestly downright hilarious at times. And when these narratives merge, it's unmissable, especially the now legendary dam scene.Ford gives a really humanistic, vulnerable performance, and there are times when you really feel sorry for the man, one minute, he has everything he could wish for, the next, he's stealing food from an almost comatose patient.A true classic, one of Fords greatest performances.",The Fugitive
28,Aaron1375,"Thankfully this version of ""The Fugitive"" wraps up in two hours rather than a couple of seasons.",9,2 March 2010,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie that has good acting, a good story, and good action. Based on the television show of the same name it is also probably the most successful and best television show to movie I have ever seen. It also has that major plus in that at the end of the movie you are done with your journey and everything wraps up rather nicely. The story has Dr. Kimble accused of murder and we speed through the trial as the police do not believe for a minute Dr. Kimble's story of a fight he had with the actual killer, the one armed man. Well through some good and bad luck at the same time, he finds himself free of the prisoner transport he was on and now he is set loose to try and clear his name and bring the real killer to justice. On his trail though is a United States Marshall played by the very good actor Tommy Lee Jones. In fact, Jones would win an Oscar for his performance in this movie. He would later reprise this role, but with little success in the film ""U.S. Marshals"", my thinking is though that it might have done better at the box office had they not simply made almost a remake of this movie with the wrongly accused escapee, but instead had him track someone actually guilty of the crime. This one though has some great cat and mouse as you really pull for Kimble (played by the excellent Harrison Ford) to connect all the pieces and find the party responsible for his wife's death. Most of the action is confined to the city of Chicago I think it was, but there is enough action and such to make up for the lack of locales. Though there is a great scene involving a dam and the inner workings of it as Kimble is almost caught right off the bat by Gerard (the marshal). All in all a fine film and in my opinion still the best television show to movie film there is.",The Fugitive
29,Wuchakk,Top-of-the-line crime thriller with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones,8,10 December 2018,"Released in 1993 and based on the TV show from 30 years earlier, ""The Fugitive"" stars Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, an innocent fugitive framed for murder. As he pursues the one-armed killer & those who pulled his strings, a determined U.S. Marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) hunts Kimble down from wilderness regions to the streets of Chicago.The first 40 minutes contain the most action, hooking the viewer with an exhilarating bus wreck/train wreck followed by a phenomenal dam sequence. The rest of the movie is an intelligent and suspenseful cat-and-mouse chase with Kimble zeroing-in on those who framed him and why.""The Fugitive"" was a deserved box office hit, costing $40 million and raking in $369 million with $184 of that domestically. To realize just how well-done it is, check out the sequel, ""U.S. Marshals"" (1998), which features the same basic plot, but without most of the magic.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot in Illinois and North Carolina; the dam sequence, for instance, was filmed at Cheoah Dam, Tapoco, North Carolina.GRADE: A-",The Fugitive
30,Mr-Fusion,"Sits at the top of the heap, as chase movies go",8,18 January 2015,"The beauty of THE FUGITIVE (just as a premise, before a single life of dialogue is written) is that you've already got a sympathetic protagonist to lure the audience in. Dr. Richard Kimble goes from affluent happily- married surgeon to widower and wrongfully-convicted murderer in just a few minutes' runtime. It's a nightmare situation, the police are no help, and you just want the guy to set things right and clear his name. All you need now is a foil to chase down our hero (it's got that) and some capable direction to keep things fast and tight (it's got that, too).Tony Lee Jones is a vision to behold in this movie. He truly inhabits the tireless hunter; yeah, it helps that Gerard is a well-written character, but Jones infuses the role and the movie with great personality. Ford's certainly no slouch, and feels at home as the guy who's outsmarting the police. Nice to see him go from hunted back to caring doctor too, in the scene with the injured boy.It's a well-done movie all-around; tense, exciting, there's good banter among Gerard's team, it's a good Chicago movie, and that ending is all sorts of satisfying.8/10",The Fugitive
31,christopher-underwood,Harrison Ford is fine as the running man but it is Tommy Lee Jones that helps make this so watchable,8,16 June 2020,"Opening with a wonderful combination of colour and b/w exposition, the latter segments showing the killing that will form the basis of the film. From here we cut to, surely one of the finest vehicle crash sequences ever filmed. So many times we have seen prison break-outs from the transportation vehicle but never before with such consequences. It is a fitting and fast beginning and the film barely lets up. Harrison Ford is fine as the running man but it is Tommy Lee Jones that helps make this so watchable. His seemingly unflinching and unchanging tone at the start gradually becomes more nuanced and there is a moment some three quarters in when the thoughts of both the hunter and the hunted look as if they may be converging as both men begin to have similar notions as to what might really have been going on when Ford's wife was killed. Exciting, exhilarating and sustained, this is a well written piece with fine performances, well controlled by the director and with some judicious editing that ensures that The Fugitive does not escape the grip of the makers as we so often see in other overblown efforts.",The Fugitive

This 1993 box-office smash hit, is cleverly directed by Andrew Davis and very well acted by it's lead cast.'The Fugitive' is a cat-n-mouse thriller. A wrongly accused is on-the-run to prove his innocence, while a stubborn Marshal hunts for him. It's basically a war between these 2 men, who go 'no holds barred'! Andrew Davis has made a memorable fare in 'The Fugitive'. He has directed the film with style. The Screenplay keeps you at the edge of your seat most times, and even the characters are damn interesting. Michael Chapman's Cinematography captures each moment wonderfully. Dennis Virkler's Editing is cool.Performance-Wise: Harrison Ford is terrific in the central role. The legendary box office star, proves his mettle yet again. Tommy Lee Jones is razor-sharp in an Oscar-Winning role, while Jeroen Krabbé is good. Andreas Katsulas and Joe Pantoliano are first-rate.

33,JamesHitchcock,One of the Finest Crime Thrillers of the Nineties,8,3 February 2006,"I recently came across a message on the IMDb message board for one of Hitchcock's classic thrillers challenging readers to name modern crime thrillers in the tradition of the master's work. I was surprised by the fact that several of the first few answers I thought of (""Witness"", ""Presumed Innocent"", ""The Fugitive"" and ""What Lies Beneath"") all starred the same actor- Harrison Ford. In my view Ford is often underrated, particularly by the critics. (He has, for example, only ever received one Oscar nomination, for ""Witness""). Perhaps his roles in the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series have led to his being unfairly categorised as an actor most at home in effects-laden blockbusters. He is not, perhaps, the most emotionally demonstrative of actors, but he is able to convey a sense of solidity and inner decency which make him valuable as the hero of crime thrillers as well as political thrillers like ""Patriot Games"" or ""Air Force One"". The surprise twist in ""What Lies Beneath"" came as particularly shocking for the very reason that a man we generally associate with solid, unflappable heroes actually turned out to be a villain, led astray by his inability to curb his emotions.In ""The Fugitive"" Ford plays Dr Richard Kimble, a doctor wrongly convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to death. (Ford does get to show some genuine emotions when Kimble breaks down after his wife's death and in the scene where he is being interrogated by the police). Kimble manages to escape when the bus which is taking him to prison is involved in a collision with a train following a failed escape attempt by another prisoner. Kimber is faced with a race against time to discover the reason why he was framed for the murder and to find out the identity of the real killer. He is pursued by Sam Gerard, a US marshal who has taken over the responsibility for investigating the case.In some ways the film is as much about Gerard as it is about Kimble. Kimble is a classically Hitchcockian figure, the straightforward hero wrongly accused of a crime and trying to prove his innocence. Gerard is an unusually complex character for the cop in a crime thriller. He starts off as a man simply trying to do his job as best he can, without thinking of deeper issues. When Kimble tells him ""I didn't kill my wife"", Gerard cynically replies ""I don't care"". As the film progresses, however, Gerard comes to believe in his quarry's innocence and a strange respect grows between the two men. Ford and the showier Tommy Lee Jones have different acting styles, but they combine well here. Jones is very good here, but I was rather surprised by his ""best supporting actor"" Oscar, as I felt that the Academy overlooked fine performances from two of the supporting actors in ""Schindler's List"", Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley who was not even nominated.Besides good contributions from the two leading actors, ""The Fugitive"" is notable as an exciting, well-paced thriller. There are some memorable moments such as the heart-stopping train crash and the confrontation between Kimble and Gerard on top of the dam, followed by Kimble's plunge to safety. Occasionally one doubts the credibility of what one is seeing- it seemed unlikely, for example, that Kimble could have survived his dive from the dam unhurt, or that he should be so successful in eluding his pursuers even with so competent and dedicated a cop as Gerard in charge of them. These doubts, however, are generally quickly swept away by the pace of the action. Director Andrew Davis seems to specialise in thrillers, but this, one of the finest crime thrillers of the nineties, is best example of his work that I have seen. 8/10",The Fugitive
34,Smells_Like_Cheese,I wonder if Tommy Lee Jones ever cared? :D,7,4 April 2006,"The Fugitive is a fun action movie that keeps you going until the cool ending. We've got terrific actors, Harrison and Tommy who play cat and mouse very well. My only problem with the film was that I didn't know if they wanted this to be an action movie or a drama/suspense thriller. It had exciting explosions but then turned into a soap opera. Not to mention a miraculous survival off a dam. Well, I mean, whip or light sabor, I love Harrison, but geez, yes, it was cool, but someone had to look at the dam scene and wonder too if it was believable.I would recommend the Fugivtive because like I said, it's a fun great paced action/thriller with some minor flaws.

35,MovieAddict2016,Run Harrison Run.,7,17 September 2003,"Imagine a time, if you will, when fugitive movies were not released ten times a year, a time when Tommy Lee Jones actually appeared in fugitive movies simply because he liked the script and not because he was revisiting the role that made him famous again, a time when the fugitive movies were about much more than simply a homicidal maniac being chased by a man who has a connection to him. You will understand this film a lot more.It relies so much on characters and a witty script as compared to explosions and fight scenes. But of course that's not to say it doesn't have any pyrotechnics or chase scenes or battles - the action scenes will satisfy even the biggest of action buffs. It just makes a lot more sense when they're there for a purpose.Harrison Ford plays Dr. Ryan Kimble. Kimble comes home from work one night after an emergency procedure at the hospital to find his wife brutally beaten to death by a one-armed man. The one-armed man escapes from the scene of the crime and all evidence points to Ryan as the assaultant and killer.After sentenced to death, Ryan is pushed into the back of a convict bus transporting convicted fellons to jail. But one of the criminals tries to escape and the bus ends up swerving off the road and flipping down a steep ravine, coming to rest upon a railroad track. Ryan escapes before the train rips through the bus, resulting in a great scene where Ryan is running in front of the derailed train, chained at his feet and arms. It's the classic Indiana Jones bolder scene redux.Ryan eventually disappears into the woods and U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives at the scene of the crash a short time later. He is the ultimate seeker; he is barely ever wrong about anything, and when he is he doesn't like to admit it. Jones presents his character with such a sense of self-confidence and oozing calmness that his Oscar was well-deserved.Ryan keeps on running throughout the film, only stopping to gather evidence of his killer and then moving on. He goes through some interesting scenarios and starts to stumble upon a conspiracy, but no one will hear his story - the only living person who might care is the same man who says he doesn't care: Sam Gerard.If I am correct in my observations, Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones only appear in about two scenes together - the rest of the film they are apart from each other. As Jones pursues Ford, it seems as though he starts to make a connection with his prey - as though he may be the only one understanding what Ford is doing and why. It creates a sense of greater suspense for the audience. This is not a run-of-the-mill chase picture we are exploited to on so many occasions. We care for both characters in equal regards, and when they finally do come face-to-face it results in a kind of unexpected payoff; at last we get to see the two together in the same shot and it's strangeThe movie is directed by Andrew Davis, who directed ""Collateral Damage"" and ""Holes."" He has a solid sense of direction even if the material itself doesn't always hold together. Given a terrific script like ""The Fugitive,"" Davis creates a type of cement cornerstone that is the base of the film. The script and direction compliment themselves often, something that can't be said in most cases.Tommy Lee Jones recently appeared in ""The Hunted,"" a film about a madman killer on the loose, and Jones plays the man trying to pursue him. The stupidity of the script hit me hard. I rewatched ""The Fugitive"" not a week after I saw ""The Hunted"" and realized the sheer genius of it versus the lesser film. This is a movie that will wet the apetite of all action, mystery and thriller lovers alike who are looking for something different than the routine chase films. I know it did for me.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",The Fugitive

37,KineticSeoul,Harrison Ford on the run,6,31 January 2016,"This is a very typical and predictable chase movie from the 90's. It is a very generic 90's movie that works but just doesn't really stand out all that much. I personally think the main reason a movie like this is not forgotten is because it has Harrison Ford in it. Like I said the formula works, but it lacks the suspense and tension to make it a great chase movie. So the plot is about a guy in the medical field that gets apprehended and accused of murdering his own wife. There was a chance for his escape so most of the screen time is over him running from the feds and using his wits to escape while trying to find answers. I guess with today's standards I was expecting something more. But again this was made in this 90's so I am going to cut it some slack. On a positive note the execution of the chase and action sequences is done well. It's a okay movie to pass the time with.6.5/10",The Fugitive
38,OllieSuave-007,Quite entertaining throughout the run.,7,23 July 2015,"This is a pretty exciting, fast-paced thriller about Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who was accused or murdering his wife Helen (Sela Ward). After being convicted, he escapes after his transport van crashes and then goes on his own mission of finding his wife's killer - all the while avoiding the pursuit of the U.S. Marshal Service.Ford does a good job acting in his Dr. Kimble role, proving his determination of finding the true criminal in the case and dodging the marshals left and right - all in a nationwide manhunt that generates enough thrills, chase scenes and games of hide-and-seek that will keep you on the edge of your seat. He also generates the audience's sympathy, letting them believe he is innocent and that a real murderer is out there. What distracts from the exciting plot, unfortunately, is the Tommy Lee Jones' flamboyant portrayal of Marshal Samuel Gerard. He treats the case like he was playing a game instead of solving a serious murder and his constant showy attitude eats away at the tense atmosphere. What is also distracting, and extremely annoying, is the mindless chatter and butt-kissing of Gerard's deputies, particularly that of the loudmouth Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano) and moronic Biggs (Daniel Roebuck).Julianne Moore is a nice addition to the cast, but unfortunately her appearance is more like a cameo at best since many of her scenes were deleted apparently.Overall, it's a pretty good thriller with some action and surprises that make it quite entertaining.Grade B-",The Fugitive
39,thesar-2,The Incredible Ford vs The Real Jones,9,22 July 2010,"There's a story behind me and The Fugitive.(Said in best Sophia Petrillo, of The Golden Girls, voice) Picture it: Phoenix. 1993. A movie critic, much like the one you're reading now, who writes for a college column with the same name, wants to see a double feature with his buddy: Jurassic Park and The Fugitive. The paper advertises a ""free"" screening of The Fugitive following the final showing of Jurassic Park at the original Cine Capri. So, he goes to buy both tickets at the box office, but the clerk informs him of the misprint in the newspaper and that only ones with preselected passes can attend the sneak preview of The Fugitive that Thursday evening.Disappointed, but devious, that young reporter has plans and attends Jurassic Park for his third time. Heck, it was Cine Capri – a local legend of a theatre – and it's a big-screen movie. Following that movie, he goes to the lobby and talks to the manager who's scrambling around because this promises to be a not only booked presentation, but over-sold screening of The Fugitive. The manager repeats that the newspaper misrepresented their viewing of the Harrison Ford movie that wasn't supposed to open until the next day. He said to the young movie reviewer, ""Unless you have a pass""Smartly, the future Reevesreviews.com admin pulls out his college-press-badge he happened to have on him and convincingly (and visually panicked) states: ""I did have a pass, but I left it in the newsroom.""Honestly, he did get many passes, but not for this one. Shhh, don't spread it to the manager that probably doesn't work for the same company, now 17 years later. The manager surprisingly okays the deceit and allows the two buddies back into the auditorium to watch The Fugitive. But, before he did, he noticed the line outside, the line of people that apparently wrapped around the building indicating that not all who actually did have passes could see the movie. Even though it was Cine Capri, and it had a large number of seats, it didn't have enough to supply the mass-mailing of the free passes.Smiling, the young male didn't care. He was about to watch a fantastic movie. A movie that would still hold up in spades nearly two decades later. A movie based on a TV-show he has still yet to see.It doesn't matter. He, or rather, I loved the film. It contained great action segments, wonderful acting – Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble was superb while Tommy Lee Jones would rightfully earn his only Oscar a few months later, a powerful score and enough suspense and intrigue that you don't have to see the original source material.Kimble is living the wonderful social life with a beautiful wife in tow until his wife is bludgeoned to death and the good doc is accused, sentenced, jailed and transported until a chance – and explosive – escape leaves him free to search for the, gasp!, the one-armed man who really killed his wife (Ward.) It's up to U.S. Marshalls, led wonderfully by Gerard (Jones) to catch the fugitive(s) in an unbiased and unforgiving way.Against impossible, and I do mean IMPOSSIBLE, ways, Kimble thwarts the authorities and puts the pieces together to regain his innocence and freedom. Will Gerard catch up with the lone doctor? Will he care? He clearly says he doesn't.This movie is flat exciting and simple. Barely a CGI moment, if any and it relies heavily on the acting of both Ford and Jones in classic cat 'n' mouse fashion. And it works, it really does. You will have to get pass the endless ""OH! He's gonna get caught here! No, he's definitely done for there!"" moments – which worked better in the superior The Silence of the Lambs and most of all, the 93-story-drop Kimble survives off a dam. (Yeah, that's an exaggeration, but not too far off.)This is the first viewing I've had of this movie in a long time, and with what I've been seeing this past decade, this was thoroughly refreshing. I love pre-CGI movies and especially movies that rely on heart, plot and acting vs. special effects. This is a must seeEven if you have to lie your way into the theatre.Did I mention, that young reporter got his pick of any seat as, he and his friend were the first ones in the auditorium before anyone else was let in? Oh, yeah. Those were the days.Side Note: When I originally watched this, one of my first thoughts was: Ford, as shown here as the runaway Kimble, would make the ideal movie adaptation of David ""Bruce"" Banner if they ever made a Hulk movie. Unbeknownst to me, it would be another 10 years until they did, in fact, finally bring the Hulk to the big screen. By then, Ford was probably too old. Either way, I grew up on the TV version of The Incredible Hulk and saw the late (he would die, literally, a few months following this movie's opening) Bill Bixby in Ford. Maybe it's just me, but watch for yourself and think David Banner on the run here.",The Fugitive

42,ElMaruecan82,Consummate 90's action film... with a brain...,9,5 June 2017,"""The Fugitive"" is a first-rate action-packed thriller. Indeed, no matter how deep your involvement in story is, no matter how familiar you're with the original 60's TV series, or how much you appreciate the action genre, there is not a way not to enjoy it. In fact, this paragraph should be enough unless you're not convinced, then you can read what follows.Directed by Andrew Davis whose ""Under Siege"" met with surprising critical acclaim (one of the few Steven Seagal movies to achieve this stunt), the film stars Harrison Ford as the ill-fated Dr. Richard Kimble, trying to find out the mysterious one-armed man who killed his wife, while escaping from the Law, incarnated by his nemesis US. Marshall Deputy Gerard played by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones was the villain in ""Under Siege"" but this time, it's another form of antagonism he embodies, he is a roller-coaster of a man who won't tolerate any fugitive to slip through his net. It's not even personal, this is man who wants the job done and that's perhaps enough a reason to root for him while empathizing with Kimble. Why, that's a nice way to put it.It all leads to the most famous and parodied moment of the film : the early encounter between the two men at the edge of a storm drain over a huge dam, Kimble tells Gerard: ""I didn't kill my wife"" and Gerard's answer is ""I don't care"". Whatever Kimble did is irrelevant, that's what makes his situation tricky. He sees himself as an innocent man, people see him as a fugitive. He's got one enemy to find, but for the moment, he's like the public enemy number one. This moment seals the real confrontation between two men: one represents the Law and according to the Law, Kimble was convicted, and one cannot escape the Law. Kimble represents justice, justice for his wife, and for his own life's sake, he's the only reason one could escape from the law: self-defense. And only for that reason, would a man plunge into raging waters, it's not your usual nihilistic escape, it's a race around the clock between two men who know what they want.The point of this comparison is to highlight why these men happen to be 'enemies' on the surface but as Kimble finds the path of the one-armed man and Gerard follows his footsteps, there's something evolving in his attitude and the wisecracks displayed through the film vanish in favor of a growing respect toward his target and the realization that Law and Justice can make one; it's something in the same vein than ""The Defiant Ones"", with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis, movies that are entertaining but respecting viewer's intelligence and not succumbing to Manichaeism. And the power of Jones' Oscar-winning performance was to evolve to that point where we, viewers, wait for that moment where he starts to care, we never pinpoint it exactly but we can tell it from his acting, this is how great he is without forcing himself.Both Kimble and Jones are smart and competent and that's another force. In most movies, the hero easily outsmarts the villain but this time, like in a chess game, Gerard knows how to anticipate or follow the moves and the 'how he does it' is even more captivating, which creates countless situations similar to the dam one, where Kimble can slip from the Police's hands within a nick of time. No matter how often this happens, there is an attention for detail, for chronology, for simultaneity of events that leaves nothing for hazard, this is a meticulously edited movie that doesn't rely on luck. There's a moment where Kimble, passing as a janitor, prints a document of the people who repaired their prosthetic arms shortly after the murder, and to cover the buzzing sound of the printer, he pretends to be dusting the Venetian blinds. This detail reminded me of J.J. Gittes in ""Chinatown"" coughing loudly while he was ripping an important piece of evidence.The film works on many levels, it's a cat-and-mouse thriller served by a heart-pounding score from James Newton-Howard whose main movement works without even watching the film. The term is hackneyed but it's also character-study in the sense that you can tell how the perception toward a man changes while the chase moves forward, it's just as if Kimble needs time to get closer to his innocence as something suspected then perceived by his chasers. The film also affords the luxury of a higher scheme involving the wife's murder. And maybe there's something in the tradition of Hitchcock's movie with the eternal theme of the wrongfully accused man, who doesn't just escape for freedom but to prove his innocence, for justice. Kimble needs to find the one-armed man, maybe less to prove his innocence but to avenge his wife. Gerard being the law, will also realize that something must be done on that matter.I've often been critical about Jones' Oscar win for that role but maybe I'd reconsider my opinion. I like the duality he forms with Kimble, for one, it's personal, for the other, it's only his job. 1993 was a pretty good year for intelligent thrillers, with films like ""The Fugitive"" and ""In the Line of Fire"". This one was nominated for many Oscars, including Best Picture, it is not your usual action movie, and it finds a way to reinvent the archetypes and stay original within a rather conventional plot. This is not just a school case of from TV to movies adaptation, it's one terrific action movie, about men doing what they think they must do and doing it damn well, the film oozes quality in every inch of celluloid.",The Fugitive
43,MOscarbradley,Sheer pleasure from start to finish.,9,15 February 2020,"If you have to make a big screen film version of a long-running television series then ""The Fugitive"" is the way to go. The original series ran for four years from 1963 to 1967 and is now regarded as something of a television classic. What writers Jeb Stuart and David Twohy and director Andrew Davis have done is to break almost one hundred hours of television down to a very crisp two and they have done it superbly.By now I'm sure almost everyone knows the story of how Dr. Richard Kimble, accused of the brutal murder of his wife, though innocent, escaped from custody and is pursued by a dogged US Marshall. On TV these roles were played by David Janssen and Barry Morse and are now played by Harrison Ford and a terrific Tommy Lee Jones, who won the Oscar for his performance. The real killer, of course, is the famous, or infamous, one-armed man and Kimble is out to find him.This is the chase film par excllence and is one of the greatest thrillers of the nineties. Ford and Jones may carry the picture but there isn't a bad performance in sight and Davis handles the virtually non-stop action superbly; it's almost one set-piece after another. An almost obscenely entertaining picture.",The Fugitive
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"One of the most purely exciting and suspenseful films of its kind; a mile-a-minute, edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride.",8,1 March 2018,"'The Fugitive (1993)' is a suspense thriller funnelled through a late 80s action flick, ala 'Die Hard (1988) or 'Lethal Weapon (1987)', and is actually one of the most purely exciting, and indeed suspenseful, films I've seen in a long time. It's mile-a-minute, edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride that keeps ratcheting up the tension and masterfully plays its audience like a fiddle. It holds all its action to a tangible and fairly realistic standard, with the cat-and-mouse elements being some of the absolute best of their kind, and it's the sheer, palpable desperation of Ford's eponymous escapee that makes every close call he has with Jones' charismatic but calculating US Marshal both totally riveting and extremely entertaining. A brilliantly made, wholly enjoyable piece that may be slightly baggy but is fun from beginning to end. 8/10",The Fugitive
45,bowmanblue,Don't let this one escape you,9,19 January 2015,"There are some films which are pretty much perfect (for what they are). 'The Fugitive's' beauty lies in its simplicity (not to mention the excellent performances from its two main stars). A prominent doctor's wife is murdered. He's accused and convicted, but manages to escape and sets out to prove his innocence.Of course 'simple' doesn't always mean great. Like I said, 'The Fugitive' would be a lot less if it wasn't for the fact that everyone's favourite space pirate/adventurer, Harrison Ford, wasn't the fugitive in question. As with most of his films, he's great to watch and perfect to root for. But of course things go even less smoothly for our runaway doctor than they already have been. If being wrongly convicted for spousal murder wasn't bad enough, the toughest U.S. Marshall ever, played perfectly by Tommy Lee Jones, has been despatched to bring in his man – at any costs. Again, Jones' performance is spot on and if ever there was a better game of 'cat and mouse' then I haven't seen it.There are plenty of memorable scenes in the film, most of which involve the two leads squaring off – most notably the scene at the dam. And, even thought the film is now over twenty years old, it can still hold onto its own today. It doesn't look in any way dated and you don't need iphones or Twitter to prove how modern it is.Sometimes I try to guess who the audience to a film is. In this case, I'd say: everyone. If you like thrillers, if you like tension, if you like mystery or you just like either/or Harrison Ford or Tommy Lee Jones then you're in for a treat. In fact... if you like good films in general you really should check it out. Despite its two hour runtime, it flies by (not sure whether that makes the 'semi-sequel' 'U.S. Marshalls also a success – most people may just want to stick with this one).",The Fugitive
46,g-bodyl,Excellent Chase Film!,10,19 August 2012,"The Fugitive by far is one of the best films dealing with fugitives on the run from the law. This film has two solid leads and it reminds me of action films from the 80's. The train sequence at the beginning of the film is definitely one of the best train sequences seen on film.This film is about a doctor who is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and is sentenced to death. He escapes from prison to prove his innocence. But can he do that with the U.S Marshals on his tail? The acting is very good. Harrison Ford is at his best as the man on the run. Even better is Tommy Lee Jones as the head Marshal. He was great and is someone you don't want to mess with.Overall, this is one of the best thrillers of the 1990's. This movie has a fair share of action and drama combined. I rate this film 10/10.",The Fugitive

48,kenjha,Fun but Rambling,8,28 December 2010,"In this big screen adaptation of the classic TV series, a doctor is falsely convicted of murdering his wife, but escapes en route to prison. This is an entertaining, fast-moving adventure yarn with non-stop action. In fact, there is perhaps a bit too much action, as it starts to run out of steam towards the end. The story is fairly straightforward but tends to ramble and becomes somewhat muddled in the latter stages. It could have benefited from tighter editing. Ford is well cast in the title role, but Jones steals the film in his Oscar winning role as the U.S. Marshal who doggedly pursues him. It's mindless fun, with little attempt at plausibility in the plot.",The Fugitive
49,The-Sarkologist,Fun but dry,4,26 April 2020,"Yeah, I remember watching this film a while ago, but honestly it really didn't impress me. I guess it had a lot to do with most of the action occurring within the first half hour, and the rest of it simply being a man hunt, and a detective story. Of course, like a lot of films, there are a lot of inconsistencies, and then there is also the issue of certain things happening in the film that wouldn't happen in real life - such as Kimble being interviewed by the police without a lawyer. In fact, the whole trial was just so unrealistic that I sort of wonder how he was convicted in the first place.Anyway, the film is about this guy named Richard Kimble who returns home to discover that a one armed man is in the process of killing his wife. He attempts to stop him, but to no avail, and upon calling the police he is arrested and charged with murder. As I mentioned, he is also convicted and sent onto death row. However, on the way to the prison there is an attempted escape, and the bus crashes enabling him to flee. Then this US marshal comes along and attempts to track him down while Kimble is attempting to get to the bottom of the mystery.It's a fun movie, but as I mentioned there are an awful lot of flaws in it. Like, they seem to spend most of the time attempting to track Kimble down, and no time tracking down any of the other escapees. Then again, that probably does have something to do with the movie being focused primarily on him, and not on any of the other escaped convicts. Then there is the fact that he jumps off of a dam and into a river, however they seem to assume that he survived, when it is highly likely that a jump from that height would've killed him. Then again, it is a Hollywood movie so I guess we do have to take that into account.In the end though, while it is a fun film, it sort of does dry up pretty quickly, especially when it settles into Kimble attempting to clear his name. Mind you, I also find that somewhat problematic as well considering that there is also the issue of the fact that he escaped from lawful custody. Yeah, that's going to create a bit of a problem because it seems that nobody is interested in clearing his name, and the only way that he can clear his name is by escaping from lawful custody.Yeah, there are certainly quite a few issues that I had with the film, but it still is pretty popular, at least among the people that I know. On the other hand, I guess it is the case with a lot of other Hollywood movies - we really have to take reality with a grain of salt and basically just go with the flow and enjoy the ride. It was just that the ride with this film wasn't actually as good as some others that I have watched. Hey, at least I got an opportunity to watch it again because I probably wouldn't have otherwise.",The Fugitive

51,zkonedog,Remembered It As Memorable...But Now Realize It Hasn't Aged As Well As I Thought,5,3 March 2017,"When I first watched ""The Fugitive"" as a teenager, I remember thinking how great of a movie it was at the time. Having not seen it for a number of years, though, a repeat viewing recently showed me that it wasn't the classic that I remembered.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford), a man falsely convicted of murdering his wife. He claims that a one-armed attacker inside his home was the real culprit. During a prisoner transfer, Kimball manages to escape his custody and begin the search for the one-armed man. Hot on his heels, though, is U.S. Marshal Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones).""The Fugitive"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It has a decent plot, some decent adventure, and some good actors. Yet, that is part of the problem...there are too many flaws for the entire experience to ever crest that ""decent"" mark.It is clear that this movie was made as a star vehicle for Ford and little more. His performance is solid as Kimball, but even then his character is not given enough real meaty scenes/dialogue to stand out. We needed to know more about Kimball's past and his relationship with his now- deceased spouse in order to truly care.Two other things in this movie really bugged me:1. The whole experience could have been much more of an intriguing mystery had the producers/writers left some doubt as to what actually happened to Mrs. Kimball. Instead, it is clear early one that Ford's character is telling the truth.2. For me, at least, what kept me watching for most of the movie was that anticipated moment where Kimball would find the one-armed man and the showdown would commence. I won't completely ruin the ending for you, but suffice it to say that it is more than a bit of a letdown.Overall, then, I put ""The Fugitive"" about on par with another Ford film, ""Witness"". Both movies are decent at what they do (so three stars), but neither pushes itself onto that ""next level"".",The Fugitive

The film is a classic police thriller, with an innocent running away from a police officer who pulls his booties to pick him up. The thrill of the film lies in this game of cat and mouse and the mystery surrounding an unresolved crime. Harrison Ford gives life to the doctor trapped in this trap, while Tommy Lee Jones is the investigator whose mission is to catch him. Both actors are at their best and both are able to do a masterful job in this film at what they have done best to this day. There are no great special or visual effects.

First, the choice of the Chicago region is cool as it mixes the nature and an authentic city, traits that can't afford NYC (no nature) or LA (no city). Next, Harrison is always excellent playing an overtaken but pugnacious doctor (see « frantic », « what lies ») and Jones brings a surprising but cool side to a unpleasant job. Sure, the story has a lot of improbabilities (why didn't Harrison manage to prove his innocence at the trial for example) and the last sequence in the hotel is a bit boring.

Based on the television series, Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a respected Chicago surgeon who is wrongfully accused of brutally murdering his wife (Sela Ward).

And the chase is on. As the picture roles, we're in the action with two men who are both chasing after radically different goals; it's the hunter and the hunted. We're with Ford's desperate doctor as he searches vigorously for a fiendish murderer, and we're with Jones' agent as he tracks Kimble's trail.

64,drqshadow-reviews,"Snappy, Up-Tempo Action with a Decidedly '90s Aesthetic",7,11 May 2021,"Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones race around in circles for this memorable early '90s cat-and-mouse blockbuster, skillfully adapting and modernizing a four-season television series from thirty years prior. The Fugitive doesn't fool around, racing through dozens of heavy plot points in the first hour without feeling overwhelming or hyperactive. It's a succinct, condensed version of a once-sprawling serial, one which trims away the obligatory TV padding without skipping any good bits.While it's trucking through those establishing shots, the story is a whiplash stunner; in the blink of an eye, we see our protagonist as a respected physician, grieving husband, bewildered murder suspect, sentenced convict, opportunistic escapee and outdoor survivalist, with one particularly well-executed train derailment thrown in to really kick off all the turmoil. Almost by necessity, the second act slows down to focus on the chase, balancing Ford's attempts to lay low with Jones's top-of-the-food-chain detective work. That performs well, too, a firm gear-shift from the opening salvo's manic mayhem (one that's certainly assisted by its two phenomenal cornerstone stars), though it does lose its way as all the different points converge and the moment of resolution draws near. By contrast, the ending falls more on the bland, derivative side; careful suspense cast aside in favor of a big chair-tossing, pipe-swinging, rock'em'sock'em finale. These scenes are inoffensive, but a decided step down from what we'd seen and felt just prior. Put it this way: I still vividly recalled the bus crash and dam jump, decades after I last saw them. I'd forgotten all about the climactic rooftop fist fight.While the gettin's good, it's real good. A fairly simple premise with plenty of intrigue and gray morality, a tight script, more than one all-decade action set, a super-sized portion of Tommy Lee Jones intensity and lots and lots of chances for grim Harrison Ford to glance worriedly over his shoulder.

66,barnabyrudge,"Excellent, influential big-screen treatment of an old TV show.",9,22 December 2005,"Nowadays it seems that every other month there is a big-screen release adapted from an old TV show. Think about it.... they've virtually all be done: Lost In Space, The Avengers, Starsky & Hutch, The Saint, Charlie's Angels, Fantastic Four, Mission: Impossible and Thuderbirds to name but a few, with more promised for the future (at the time I'm writing this, big-screen treatments of The A-Team and The Persuaders are on the cards). The trend for borrowing TV concepts and transforming them into major film releases really began with this 1993 offering. Knowledgeable film buffs might argue that Batman or even Flash Gordon pre-date The Fugitive and were also TV shows long, long ago, but both of those films actually drew their inspiration more from the original comic books than their television ancestors. Therefore, The Fugitive is probably the first genuine cinematic version of an old TV show. Ironically, after all the years since its release, it is still the best of the bunch too!Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) returns home one night to find his wife bleeding to death and a burglar in his house. He fights with the burglar, and discovers that his assailant actually has a prosthetic arm, before finally being overwhelmed. When the police arrive, they refuse to believe that Kimble's wife was murdered by an intruder and instead charge Kimble himself with the crime. He is convicted and put on Death Row. However, Kimble gets an unexpected chance to clear his name when the bus transporting him to jail crashes off the road and ends up straddling a railway line. Kimble makes a breathtaking escape from the crippled vehicle and goes on the run in the neighbouring woodland. Ace FBI agent Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is brought in to track down the fugitive and the two of them are soon locked in a battle of wills, which ends when Kimble makes a remarkable escape from his pursuers in a storm drain. Later, Kimble makes his way to Chicago where he begins to piece together the mystery of his wife's murder, eventually realising that he was set up to divert attention from a conspiracy in the medical world.Ford is terrific as the titular fugitive and he gets superb support from Jones as the Federal Marshal on his tail (the latter got an Oscar for his efforts). The film is brilliantly scripted by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, who manage to remain faithful to the plot of the original show, while updating it for contemporary audiences and condensing it into a 2 hour narrative. James Newton Howard also does a fabulous job with his score, which is emotional and exciting at all the right moments. The story is paced very thoughtfully, so that the characters are introduced and developed meaningfully, without tedium setting in while the viewers await the action. The Fugitive is a terrific film, totally absorbing and exciting from beginning to end, and easily one of the films of its year.",The Fugitive

I know I wanted to see it over and over again after I first saw it on WTTG in September 2002. If you ask me, Kimble (Harrison Ford) was a very desperate man out to prove the fact that he didn't kill Helen (Sela Ward). It sort of reminds me of THE NEGOTIATOR, only this movie mostly takes place outdoors. Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) was a dogged U.S. Marshal in my opinion. This is because he wouldn't stop chasing Kimble. In conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action movie that you'll want to see over and over again to all you Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a wild ride.",The Fugitive

69,slokes,He Doesn't Care...But You Will,8,22 April 2004,"One of the supreme examples of '90s crime action flicks also represents the best of another kind of '90s movie, the TV series remake. ""The Fugitive"" takes its name, although not so much of its content, from the 1963-67 TV series that starred David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, wrongly convicted of killing his wife, on the lam, and on the trail of a one-armed killer.That's all in the movie, too, with the exception that Harrison Ford now plays Kimble. But since the movie doesn't have the luxury of four seasons worth of hour-long episodes to stretch out the denouement, things are much faster-paced. Just how much faster-paced is established in the opening credit sequence, which shows Kimble arrested, tried, convicted, and escaping a stranded prison bus just ahead of a speeding train in one of moviedom's all-time-best cliffhangers.Director Andrew Davis has had much success with two kinds of movies, those set in Chicago and those featuring Tommy Lee Jones. This has both, so it makes sense that it is Davis's career moment, and Jones' one Oscar-winning performance. Davis's feeling for the Windy City, the grittiness of the backstreets and the skyscrapers lit up like Christmas trees at night, creates a compelling composition. He also populates his film with vivid, authentic-looking characters, like the boarding-house lady and her son, the roller-blading hospital attendant, and the surly CPD detectives, some of whom are welcomely recognizable from Davis's earlier, excellent Chuck Norris vehicle, ""Code Of Silence.""People are quick to credit Jones for his performance, and he deserved Academy consideration, playing against the Javert formula and walking a tightrope as he alternates between ruthless and determined on the one hand, and amiable and goofy on the other, sometimes in the same scene. His lines aren't that witty or cool, but Jones' delivery of simple lines like ""I don't care,"" ""I don't bargain,"" ""We got a gopher,"" and ""The big dog's always right"" makes all the difference. The interplay between Jones and his supporting cast of underlings has an engaging yet professional-seeming vibe that draws you in.But Jones' performance wouldn't shine so brightly if he were chasing an actor like Adam Sandler or Howie Long. Harrison Ford really emotes in this film, creating an emotional bond with the audience that keeps him at the center of our attentions no matter how bright and pleasing Jones' pyrotechnics get to be. Ford's breakdown scene during the police interrogation is riveting, nakedly emotional, and all the more surprising because, according to the DVD commentary, it was improvised. Throughout the rest of his performance, Ford dispenses with the glamour shots and lets us in on his character's grasping desperation, whether he's looking through files, making a phony ID, licking egg off his fingers, or shaving his beard. The result is a suspense film that really works because it draws you into feelings so real they hurt.In addition to being a good acting primer, ""The Fugitive"" also boasts a top-flight clinic on editing. This is apparent not only with the train escape scene and Kimble's other narrow misses, but the fact we are distracted from some obvious plot holes. I won't go into the problematic reveal of the real culprits, except that they would seem unlikely to have been overlooked by the police or by Kimble in any actual investigation worth its salt. The pharmaceutical angle is a weak MacGuffin, not really explaining the whys of the crime. But when you see those flashbacks of the gorgeous Sela Ward dropping rose petals behind her while the killer waits to strike, logic flaws kind of go out the window, at least the first time around.A great film about justice, that works all the better because it plays with the conventions of the form. Who says there's never anything good on TV?",The Fugitive
70,gcd70,Enjoy every minute,7,2 December 2007,"Based upon the popular television series of the mid 60's, this thriller converts well to the big screen thanks to some competent direction from Andrew Davis, and two sure-footed performances from the lead stars.Harrison Ford adds yet another character to his already impressive collection as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man who, whilst on the run, searches for the one-armed man he claims killed his wife. And Tommy Lee Jones continues to grow in stature, after his Oscar nominated performance in ""J.F.K."", with a very good turn as Deputy Gerard, the man pursuing Kimble.Davis develops tension early and maintains it well, right up until the suitable, though none too surprising, ending.

71,aidanratesmovies,The Fugitive (1993),9,30 April 2020,"A smart, compelling, and very well-acted thriller, The Fugitive is one hell of an entertaining ride, and quite possibly some of Harrison Ford's best work. The film is entertaining from start to finish, and though it may not be edge of your seat entertainment for some of its long runtime, it is more than capable to gain your attention, and fill you with just enough interest and suspense to make for one very enjoyable time. Harrison Ford is fantastic in his role as Dr. Richard Kimble, and is my favorite performance I have seen of him so far throughout the films I have seen of his career. Tommy Lee Jones also provides for a terrific performance, and all other actors involved also give it their best, but none are as memorable as the two leads. The film is cleverly paced, although it can be a bit choppy at its beginning remarks. However, The Fugitive is able to make up for this by providing a truly compelling tale of innocence and crime on a scale I have not seen before. The writing is quite good, as well as the soundtrack, and its cinematography quite fine as well. In the end, The Fugitive has a few minor issues, but is mostly a very enjoyable and classic thriller work that is bound to be a classic in due time.

Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are what make the movie and it's there screen presence that makes this such a well loved film but it's not all perfect ...The one thing that I find really odd about this film is that Marshall Sam Gerard has four if not five people following him around wherever he goes . Cosmo (with his stupid wig) , Biggs , Poole and Newman are like his man servants and it's just weird .Lots of the dialogue was improvised although you wouldn't know because Ford And Jones are masters of their craft . There is also a scene where they are both in the St Patrick's Day parade and that is improvise too . Apparently it took several minutes before they were recognised.The action stuff is great . Typical of the 90's . Not a second of CGI which is great .Overall The Fugitive is still great escapism ( excuse the pun) and was well worth revisiting.",The Fugitive
74,Movie-ManDan,A Mystery Masterpiece in Every Sense of the Word!,10,18 August 2016,"Andrew Davis is an action director who has done a few decent films, but one great. This is a mystery/thriller with a brain that has it all. Car chases, foot chases, one-versus-all, and a complex plot enhance a generic whodunit into new heights and into the highest realm of movie magic.I have never seen the TV show this is based upon, but I don't care. This movie is good enough for me (and probably better too). Harrison Ford give his greatest performance as well-respected Chicago physician Richard Kimble. The first few minutes of the film document his conviction of the murder of his wife. It alternates in such a creative and exciting way to see exactly what we're dealing with: Kimble's wife is murdered by a one- armed man and the evidence against the innocent Richard is high. The way that this is shown is just perfect. It is well created and is makes the viewer feel slightly uncomfortable and shocked, but thirsting for more. On the bus to be incarcerated, it crashes, leaving Kimble to go on the run from the entire country. Nobody is on his side and justice has not been brought, but we want Kimble to survive and the bad guys brought down. That's a reason why I love this so much, a regular man faced with certain death must put the wrong things right with impossible odds and lots on the line.Richard's first goal in the manhunt is to change his appearance. His change makes him look like the Harrison Ford we all know. After he changes his look, he is able to waltz right by some of the key people that are trying to kill him. That is where the brains come. He can dodge his enemies at ease in such a calm but brilliant way. That causes his evasion to become easier and he can focus on who killed his wife and why. Meanwhile, a tough team of US Marshals, led by Sam Gerard (Jones), lead the way for the hunt of Dr. Kimble. The intro of Gerard and his crew is where the friction really heats up. As Kimble digs deep into the case, so does Gerard and his men in a parallel fashion. Eventually, Gerard has a change of heart and the Marshals soon become on the same side as Kimble. Kimble's discoveries in the murder are shocking and need full attention and thinking. Movies like these are the best. Loyalties change hands and secrets are revealed that will make the viewers' blood boil. I don't want to ruin anything about the conspiracy behind the murder, but it is sharp to perfection.Think to yourself what makes a movie great, truly. The Fugitive has those. Now think about what makes a mystery great, truly. The Fugitive has those. The first little bit is an exciting manhunt that feels like one man against the world. While keeping the manhunt premise, it subtly shifts gears into more of a whodunit. There are so many people linked to the murder and the movie cleverly teases them into the picture, raising excitement. The bar constantly raises, so the way it all comes together must be something very smart. And it is! The characters are so well-written and acted with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones shining as the crown jewels.4/4",The Fugitive
75,Sandcooler,Roller-coaster ride that jams halfway,7,7 January 2012,"The first hour of ""The Fugitive"" is just fantastic. It's one of the most brilliant cat-and-mouse games I've ever seen, well-acted and extremely gripping. The reason it works is probably because there isn't that much of a story to deal with at that point, it's just one guy running and everyone else trying to catch him. The first act also gives us that one scene from ""The Fugitive"" literally everyone knows: the immortal dam scene. It just gets better every time I watch it, even the super-obvious dummy can't ruin it. Sadly the movie kinda sinks in after that, probably because from then on more and more people start to sympathize with Harrison Ford's character. When he was hated and chased down like an animal the movie was chock-full of tension, but in the second half they barely even seem to want to find him and it's tough to keep interest. There's a detective story woven in, but this storyline is just so pedestrian and breaks the claustrophobic mood. There is no real threat anymore, you don't fear for the main character's well-being, and this leads to a rather predictable finale that even the brilliant Jeroen Krabbé couldn't save. I get why this movie is such a classic, because the greatness of some scenes is tough to deny, but as a whole it's not really that superb.",The Fugitive

Even after many years this movie still stands",9,26 December 2004,"""The Fugitive"" is one of those movies that you may already have seen a dozen of times, but which still seems to surprise every time that you watch it. I don't know what it actually is that makes this movie so good, but it sure works. It's probably the combination of a good script, good acting and the abundance of action that's always present, but never exaggerated.The movie is about a doctor who's wife has been murdered by a one-armed man. He's innocent but is accused of the murder and convicted by court. He will get a lethal injection soon, but as he is transfered to another jail, the bus in which he is transported with some other inmates, crashes. He knows to escape and is determined to find his wife's murderer, but has to try to stay out of the hands of the police. The result is an interesting cat-and-mouse game between him and the police that never allows your attention to fade away.The story is perhaps not exceptional, but thanks to the good directing and acting and the constant action and tension, this movie really delivers everything that you can expect from it. I give it an 8.5 - 9/10.",The Fugitive

Kimble escapes and is now on the run. Deputy Samuel Gerard from Chicago takes charge of the chase of Kimble. Meanwhile, Kimble makes up his own investigation to find who really killed his life, and to lure Gerard and his team into it as well.I loved this movie. I really liked it a lot. Compared to other chase films, this is one of the best. This movie is based off a TV series and no, I did not see it. However, I was really convinced that the events that happened in the film could happen in real life. It's realistic. This film is taught and intelligent. In fact, you find out who killed the protagonist's wife way early into the movie and does not play like a ""whodunnit"" film.However, the whole explanation in the end is a let-down, no doubt. In fact, the movie stretches a bit. The whole final act plays unlike anything from the the first two acts. I felt that the movie needed to end a bit earlier and the action in the end was going a bit too long and too far. Another thing I was annoyed with in here was the false or trick scenes, where something you think will happen but because it's a movie, something else happens. It's really clichéd, I think.The performance by Harrison Ford was great. Tommy Lee Jones provides all the one liners here, which are more or less funny from other action movies. The action scenes in here are decent and sometimes great. Overall, it's a really good chase film, although it does fall short in the whole resolution and explanation.",The Fugitive

82,MartianOctocretr5,Exciting and intense thriller,9,11 September 2006,"One of the best (if not the very best) of the TV show adaptation movies. Not only is the film consistent with the theme of the series, but it juices it up with intense action and an involving, well-constructed plot.The movie adopts just enough of the popular '60's program's original elements, and blends them nicely with the right measure of new plot twists to concoct one furious and exciting ride. Harrison Ford takes the role magnificently originated by David Jansen, and puts his unique stamp on it to make a Dr. Richard Kimble that is his own. His perfect sparring partner is Marshall Sam Girard (Tommy Lee Jones), who takes Kimbles's escape as a personal challenge to a chess game of wits.Parallel cat-and-mouse duels are the stuff of this chess game: Kimble is not only the pursued, but also the pursuer of his own prey, the mysterious one-armed-man he saw fleeing from the murder scene. The action is constant, featuring leaps from dams, high speed ambulances, chases through sewers, fights, shootings, and more as each closes in. The train wreck sequence that sets Kimble on his trek to clear his name is one of the finest sequences ever filmed. The cast is exceptional. Never a dull moment from start to finish. A great mystery, and a great pursuit suspense thriller. This is the kind of movie that remains fun after multiple viewings. A keeper for sure.",The Fugitive
83,DeeNine-2,Excellent thriller,7,23 December 2003,"This is a fine vehicle for Harrison Ford made even more agreeable by a clever, somewhat tongue in cheek performance by Tommy Lee Jones as a US Marshall out to have a good time getting the bad guy, even though the bad guy might not be so bad, and even though that's irrelevant, but hey, don't think so much and get me some coffee and a chocolate donut with those sprinkles on top, ya hear?This is also a Hollywood producer's orgasmic dream with a chase scene beginning in the first reel and lasting throughout. It is based on the 60s TV show of the same name, but gets its premise from a true crime story, that of Ohioan Dr. Sam Shepherd who actually went to jail for murdering his wife in the 50s. He too claimed to have fought off the real killer, but the forensic evidence and his personality were against him. Here we have Harrison Ford as the good doctor, and it doesn't take a Hollywood genius to tell you that the most popular leading man of the late twentieth century ain't about to play the kind of guy who murders his loving wife.Ford does a stand-up, competent job, saving lives and patting kids on the head as he plunges through sewers and off the top of a towering waterfall, steals an ambulance, survives a bullet wound and a bus wreck, etc. His fans will be pleased, but Tommy Lee Jones steals the show (and got a Best Supporting Oscar for his trouble) as a clever, wise-cracking good ole boy who has a lot of fun leading the posse. I wonder if he or director Andrew Davis invented the spin because without it, this wouldn't be half so good.This is not to be confused with, nor is it a remake of The Fugitive from 1947 starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, a cinematic gem of an entirely different sort.See this for Tommy Lee Jones who has made a career out of turning oh-hum parts into something special.",The Fugitive
84,sme_no_densetsu,A taut thriller with top notch performances from both Ford & Jones,8,14 December 2015,"""The Fugitive"" is based on the classic TV series of the same name that ran from 1963 to 1967. The finale of that series still ranks as one of the most watched episodes in U.S. history. So, while the TV show provided a promising template for a successful movie, it would nevertheless be a challenge to match the impact of the original.The story concerns Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a doctor falsely accused of killing his wife. Convicted of murder, a spectacular crash en route to prison allows him to escape and search for the real killer. Unfortunately for him, hard-nosed U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is determined to pursue his man until he's back in the hands of the authorities.The performances of Ford & Jones are the linchpins that hold the film together. Both characters are equally driven and the actors successfully bring this intensity to the screen. Their portrayals also have a depth not found in most action movies. Notably, Jones managed to snag both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work here. Apart from this pair, Joe Pantoliano & Julianne Moore make welcome appearances while the remainder of the cast is mostly composed of lesser-knowns who nevertheless perform admirably.Director Andrew Davis masterfully handled the film's action set-pieces along with the unravelling of the mystery at the core of the story. Even when the story gets a bit convoluted, the viewer is nevertheless propelled forward inexorably. The Oscar-nominated score by James Newton Howard is another important ingredient in the mix and is only one of several technical areas that received awards attention.Ultimately, ""The Fugitive"" lived up to its predecessor and became a huge commercial and critical success. A thrilling and engrossing action movie, it remains just as vital more than twenty years after its original release.",The Fugitive
85,Howlin Wolf,Excellent right the way through. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.),9,27 March 2001,"Director Davis takes the blueprint for a (60's?) TV series and turns it into a multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster.  Like only a few of his directorial colleagues before him (De Palma is one) he succeeds.  ""The Fugitive"" is tremendously entertaining popcorn fare.   Star power is largely the key to this being such a compelling thriller. We have a protagonist and antagonist, as usual, but Jones as the antagonist doesn't overplay the character or make the audience hate him.  Ford is impressively humble as the doc on the run.   There is one outstanding setpiece, which I won't reveal (though most readers will probably already know what I'm referring to even if they haven't seen the film)   The script is not outstanding, but neither is it awful, just serviceable.  As the title implies, the majority of the movie follows Kimble as he is on the run from Gerrard.  This means that  all the best lines are given to Gerrard, and since he's not really the character we're meant to have invested our sympathies in, they just serve as comic relief.  The film rarely flags in pace, which must be attributed to Davis, but aside from that the direction is also merely serviceable.   The intensity of the flashback scenes is pleasing, and its important that the whole ""one armed man"" thing never feels like a subplot which detracts from the two main characters.  Watch it for the performances, and the perfect simplicity of the plot.  Who said great thrillers always have to be convoluted and spectacularly original?  Not me.",The Fugitive

I saw it again on fresh video release about seven months later,and sometime later on a medium I don't immediately recall. EAch time I am struck by the fact that,despite my(And anybody's,really)ability to practically recite,not only the plot but the sequence of events,even some of the exact lines spoken by each character,this film just plain simply DOES NOT lose its potency,interest,energy or even suspense. Credit goes to the actors--not only HArrison Ford and Tommy Lee JOnes as pursued and pursuer,but also JOnes' posse of fellow feds(Joe PAntoliano,Tom Wood,Daniel Roebuck among them)and the shady side characters such as Dr.Kimble's colleague(Jeroen Krabbe)or the one-armed man himself(hulking,brooding Andreas KAtsulas)--for building the interest through intelligence and uncanny acting AND reacting. Director Andrew DAvis,a whiz at action films,is able to camera shoot and plan practically every element of this film to exquisite perfection! David Twohy's script is parts construction and ad-lib(if you see the extras on the DVD,you'll know what I mean),and the ability for Ford and some minor players,such as Ron DEan and Joe Katsulas as the arresting and highly suspicious(!)detectives,to be able to create a great sense of conflict and reaction to add tension.I just caught this again as a free rental,and to me there's really no price on it. I'd buy it,I'd see it on the tele. Maybe you all know the story of the beleaguered and ultimately innocent Dr.Richard Kimble and his chief,cunning, ""Les Miserables""-like law enforcement pursuer Philip/Samuel Gerard,but that still shouldn't hinder one from seeing and--for me,anyway--enjoying this excellent piece of big budget film-making(a somewhat rare commodity it seems anymore)again and again.",The Fugitive
87,frankde-jong,One of the most intelligent action movies,8,5 August 2020,"In the opening scenes of ""The fugitive"" the pace of the events is extremely fast. A woman is murdered, her husband is suspect because she had a large life insurance policy and before we know it her husband is sentenced to death. This makes the opening not very plausible, but it sets the scene for a movie that is tense from that moment on towards the very end. It often happens in action movies that either the opening is unlikely, but once you have accepted that, the story keeps rolling (""The Pelican brief"", 1993, Alan J. Pakula). Another pitfall is that the main character slips off into diffuculties in a way very imaginable, but the director feels obliged to put in an overdosis of action towards the end (""The firm"", 1993, Sydney Pollack). ""The fugitive"" is of the first kind, but the director is so wise to keep the improbable opening sequence as short as possible.I read somewhere that main character Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is caught in a ""Kafkaësk"" situation. In my opinion that is not true. Everybody knows that Dr Kimble is innocent (except the police and the judge), but the murder charge agianst him is chrystal clear. This is the way Alfred Hitchcock used to make films, not the way Franz Kafka used to write books. See for example ""The trial"" (1962, Orson Welles) in which Josef K has no idea of what he is accused.After the death sentence the movie consists of three parts. The first is the escape and staying out of the hands of the police. This is the most spectacular part of the film. Dr Kimble and some fellow inmates escape during the transport to death row in what is one of the most stunning scenes I have ever seen. Also the famous scene in the drainage tunnel is from this part of the film. In the second part Dr Kimble starts his investigations to find the real murderer of his wife and in the third part the leader of the police hunt (Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard played by Tommy Lee Jones) gets doubts about the guilt of Kimble.The transision from part two to three is subtle and very interesting. Gerard never explicitely states he is starting to doubt the guilt of Kimble, but you can sense it from his actions. His hunt becomes less intense, as if he is willing to allow Kimble some more time to prove his innocence. Apart from that Gerard has never said that he thought Kimble was guilty. A crucial dialogue in the drainage tunnel goes like this:Dr. Richard Kimble: I didn't kill my wife!

88,seymourblack-1,An Action Movie Of The Highest Calibre,9,16 December 2011,"This exhilarating action thriller is full of plot twists, suspense and excitement from start to finish but what distinguishes it from other movies of the same genre is its two main characters who are both good guys who, through extraordinary circumstances, become adversaries. Both men are very smart and incredibly determined and it's their efforts to outwit each other that grips the audience so strongly and creates a dual which is riveting to watch.The story of a man who's unjustly accused of a crime he didn't commit and then has to go in search of the real culprit to prove his innocence (whilst also being pursued by the police) is, of course, a set up for the classic double chase plot which inevitably puts the accused in numerous dangerous situations and under constant pressure because of the ever present threat of capture.In ""The Fugitive"" Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), is a Chicago surgeon who's sentenced to death for the brutal murder of his wife. Whilst he and some other prisoners are being transported by bus to the Illinois State Penitentiary, an attempted escape by one of the other prisoners leads to the driver losing control of the vehicle and swerving off the road and into the path of an on-coming train. The resulting collision provides Kimble with the opportunity to make a run for it. After making his escape, this man who has nothing to lose decides to track down the one-armed man who he knows was his wife's real murderer.Deputy U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), is the man whose job it is to hunt down the escaped convicts and after the bus crash, he quickly arrives on the scene and takes charge of the situation. His dogged pursuit of Kimble is relentless but surprisingly as the chase goes on, what he discovers leads him to suspect that his prey may not be guilty and what he learns about Kimble inspires a certain amount of respect although this never, even for a second, deters him from his single-minded commitment to carrying out his task to its conclusion.""The Fugitive"" is skilfully directed by Andrew Davis and the pace of the action is absolutely breathtaking. The sequence early on in the film during which the audience sees the events that led to Kimble's arrest is a marvellous example of this and the momentum is then maintained as there are numerous situations where Kimble has narrow escapes from being caught and the consistent level of tension just seems to escalate as Gerard is regularly only one step behind his quarry.The action set pieces are all brilliantly staged but the bus / train crash is easily the most impressive with further excitement being added when Kimble makes his incredible last minute leap to escape from danger. The screenplay is also excellent and includes some enjoyable moments of humour which provide an effective counterpoint to the suspense which features strongly throughout.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are thoroughly convincing in their roles and show so much more of what they're thinking and feeling by their expressions and body language than they do through what they say. Ford's fear and the strain he's under, is constantly evident in his face and Jones, whose character is a consummate professional who's adopted a persona which works well for him in the context of his job, subtly shows that below his aggressive surface resides a rather warmer and more understanding man.It's easy to see why this movie was such a box office success as it scores highly on every level and combines visceral excitement so perfectly with intelligence and humour.",The Fugitive
89,RNMorton,Over everything,7,16 February 2004,"It cudda been a contender, it just tried too hard.  Tale of doctor (Ford) accused of killing his wife is overdone in just about every possible way, including the incredible and unnecessary late plot twists.

The fugitive is very good story: the murder of a woman, the accusation against Richard Kimble, the escape and the chase lead by Tommy Lee Jones, the discovery of a terrible fraud (false medical reports) and the moment of truth.

91,gedikreverdi,An almost flawless thriller from 90s,7,10 June 2021,Richard Kimble was accused of killing his wife and he was innocent. The killer was a man with a prosthetic arm. He escaped from the prison transfer vehicle after they had an accident and got hit by an oncoming train. The scene where he was chased by the deputy and his team was amazing. He jumped off the tunnel on the dam wall and ended up working at the hospital as a janitor with a fake id and lived in a dilapidated home owned by a Russian woman. He found the list of patients with prosthetic arms there and found the house of Sykes who killed his wife for his colleague who helped him by giving him money when Richard approached him when he's in his car in the traffic. He was the new chairman of the pharmaceutical company which produced the new drug which have adverse effect on the liver and Richard knew about it so they killed his wife so he could get incarcerated. At least that's what I thought because they could have killed him too. He was chased by Sykes. They fought in the train and Sykes shot a police officer and Richard handcuffed him to the pole and went over to Chicago Hilton to see his friend in the convention. They alternated and fought at the king suit and on the roof and fell on the elevator from the glass roof. The deputy arrested him in the laundry floor because he knew Richard was innocent. I noticed he didn't shoot Richard on purpose several times throughout the movie. Then they got on the car and he took off his handcuffs and the deputy and his team along with Richard drove off. It was extremely enjoyable from beginning to end and I really like the atmosphere of 90s.,The Fugitive
92,baumer,Pure action and Tommy Lee Jones make this an unforgettable masterpiece,10,2 July 1999,"Arnold and Sly are great action heroes.  Their characters are always larger than life.  Rambo and Rocky are household names and The Terminator and films like Commando are great partly because of Arnold's physical presence.  But as good as they are, I don't think they can hold a candle to Harrison Ford. Sure he is in great shape, but have you ever seen an actor take average guys and make them so real that you want to know them?  Take your pick, Han Solo, Indy and even his character in Six Days and Seven Nights was an adventurer. Add Richard Kimble to that list.  As Kimble, Ford is perfect.  He is the wronged man that has to avenge his wife's death and clear his name at the same time.  He is so great in this film and I'm sure that's why so many people went to see this film at first.  But I think what kept them coming back was Tommy Lee Jones.  We'll get to him in a minute.Andrew Davis proved here that he is one of the best action directors in the business today.  Along with Under Siege, he showed us that he is an efficient artist that knows how to keep the action flowing.  He never seems to let up with his relentless pursuit of the perfect scene.  But since the film did so well and everyone pretty much knows what it is about, let's talk about the true strength of the film, and that would be Tommy Lee Jones."" I don't bargain.""  "" Well that's odd!""His portrayal of Samuel Girard is an exercise in how to make the audience relate and understand a character.  He starts off as a manic perfectionist. He is obsessed with capturing Kimble and that is all that matters.  But as the film proceeds, you can sense his unease, his wonder and his ethos. You can tell by a simple expression that he is beginning to solve a crime and not just chase a criminal.  And the turning point to me was his simple scene where he says "" You know Devlin and McGregor made 4 and one half billion dollars last year?  That company's a monster. ""  It is all in his face. He knows that Ford is innocent but he still has a job to do.  It is Jones that makes this film so much fun.  And I didn't think that there would be a more worthy recipient of best supporting actor in '93 than Kilmer in Tombstone, but Jones' work here was well deserving of his Oscar.The Fugitive belongs on every top 100 list and if the AFI wasn't so enthralled with older movies, they would see that films like this are more worthy than some of the mediocrity that graces their findings.  This is an incredible film.",The Fugitive
93,IonicBreezeMachine,A strong TV to film adaptation with great performances by Ford and Jones that's also a excellent thriller in its own right.,9,29 August 2021,"When vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble's (Harrison Ford) wife Helen (Sela Ward) is murdered by a one armed intruder, Kimble is wrongly convicted and sentenced to death. When a group of prisoners stage an escape attempt on Kimble's prison transport that results in the transport crashing, Kimble rescues one of the guards and eventually goes on the run. Now hunted by the tenacious and driven Deputy U. S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) and his team, Kimble must evade capture while finding his wife's true killer.Running from 1963 to 1967, the Quinn Martin produced The Fugitive became a massive success during it's original run at one point being the 5th highest watched TV show and garnering many Emmy nominations. The show of a man who had to be on the move because of some force or organization chasing him helped shape an entire subgenre of TV with the likes of shows such as Kung Fu, The A-Team, The Incredible Hulk, and The Pretender utilizing similar formats to tell ongoing episodic television. Produced during the wave of TV to film adaptations that began with The Untouchables and continued through the 90s, The Fugitive may be one of, if not, the best examples of the trend capturing the spirit of the original series while also managing to update itself to good effect with high tension, an engaging adventure/mystery, and two very solid leads that all serve to make the movie the entertaining ride it is.At it's core, The Fugitive is about a man in the wrong place at the wrong time with the odds stacked against him. Playing against his more noted rugged image, Ford's Richard Kimble is a good man who cares about people and just wants his life back after having it stolen from him. There are a number of scenes in the film where Kimble has the opportunity to run or get a head start on his pursuers but doesn't because he sees people in danger or in need of assistance and Kimble will use his medical expertise to do so. Not only does it make Richard a likable character, but does a good job paying homage to the series. And of course opposite Kimble is his pursuer in Deputy U. S. Marshal Sam Gerard for which Tommy Lee Jones won an Academy Award for his performance. The role of Sam Gerard is terrific because while Jones plays the character with authority and intensity, he also plays the part with a sense of humor making asides with his team who all bring unique personalities to the table for Gerard to bounce off of. There's also a paternal quality to the character where he cares about his team but and will do anything to protect them but not at the expense of the mission. It's a really strong performance from Jones and watching his inner struggle as he learns more about Kimble's case is some terrific work.The script by David Twohy and Jeb Stuart is fantastic with some thrilling but grounded action/adventure elements that work well in combination with the ""innocent man"" mystery motivating the film's progression. The Fugitive knows what makes a good mystery and works well in giving the audience answers only to lead to more questions. Even if you do happen to figure out any of the reveals ahead of time, the movie's quick pacing and clever dialogue will ensure the ride getting there will be well worth it.The Fugitive is not only a gold standard for feature film adaptations of TV shows, but also for Summer Blockbusters in general. With two top of their game leads playing off strong material that keeps up the tension to the last act, The Fugitive is both intelligent and thrilling and has lent itself to parody, homage, and imitators because it's just that good.",The Fugitive
94,hnt_dnl,An all-time chase thriller with 2 enduring performances,10,19 December 2008,"THE FUGITIVE is one of the very few examples where a film adaptation of a hit TV show perhaps surpasses that TV show in scope, ambition, and payoff. The classic 1960s series ""THE FUGITIVE"", starring the perfectly cast David Janssen as somber, falsely accused Dr. Richard Kimble, has been one-upped by this 1993 masterpiece of an action-adventure film THE FUGITIVE, starring the rugged, unique Harrison Ford in the role of Kimble. Ford has similarities to Janssen, but there are also differences. Ford is much more burly and more of an intimidating presence than Janseen was and so you couldn't see Janssen kicking someone's ass the way Ford could. But Ford definitely does excellent job of capturing the calm, meek, quiet nature that Janssen so perfectly conveyed in the series, with added touches of desperation and fear. This is important as Kimble was always designed to be a 'regular everyday Joe', one of us. We HAVE to relate to him and sympathize with him and the more cocky, brutish characters that Ford has played in the past (Han Solo, Indiana Jones, etc.) have no part in this movie. I just hate that Ford didn't get a Best Actor nomination for this film as it is truly a performance deserving of one.The 2nd great performance in this already-classic film is that of Tommy Lee Jones, who truly came into his own with this movie. He won Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but c'mon! We all know he was really the 2nd lead of this film. Jones plays Kimble's pursuer Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard (in the series it was Barry Morse playing Lt. Philip Gerard). About the only thing Jones and Morse have in common is that they are short men. That's about it! While Morse was much more calm and reserved as Gerard, Jones' Gerard is all out full-throttle, in-your-face, get-the-job-done-or-else version of the character. Full of juice throughout the entire film, Jones conveys a man obsessed with doing his job at whatever cost, but along the way, we get to see flashes of humanity and insight that makes us realize that Gerard isn't just some carbon copy blind cop. He begins to realize that maybe Kimble's assertion that he didn't kill his wife might be true. Kimble is a 'fugitive' and Gerard is fully within his right to arrest him and bring him in, whether Kimble is guilty of his convicted crime or not, but at the same time, Gerard's no-nonsense persona shines at welcome moments when he's dealing with people who are either buffoonish, deceptive, or apathetic. This is a key ingredient that makes this film work.Another brilliant aspect of this film is all the minor characters that Kimble encounters along the way, none of which have a big role, but all seem like actual people, just going about their everyday business. But none of these characters detract from the main plot of the film, thus THE FUGITIVE flows throughout.Like many great action films, the film contains some exciting scenes and set pieces (the train crash, the dam chase, the county jail chase, and the exciting climax with the one-armed man).Special mention should also go to the actors (Daniel Roebuck, L. Scott Caldwell, Tom Wood, and especially Joe Pantoliano), who play Gerard's deputies aiding him in the search for Kimble. The chemistry of this group is totally convincing and fun to watch and listen to.Andrew Davis directed this Best Picture nominee from 1993 and I would definitely rate it as one of the best films of the 1990s and one of the best action films ever!",The Fugitive
95,hall895,The chase is on,6,25 July 2009,"Based as it is on the famous television series everyone knows the rather simple premise of this film. Dr. Richard Kimble is accused of murdering his wife but we know darned well that Kimble is innocent. No mystery here, the one-armed man did it. Unfortunately for the good doctor all the evidence points to himself and he is duly convicted and sentenced to death. But fortune shines on Richard Kimble as while being transported to prison the opportunity for him to escape presents itself. After a thrilling, wonderfully executed, train wreck sequence Kimble finds himself a free man. In order to remain free he will have to survive in a cold, rugged, unforgiving landscape. And he will need to evade a dogged pursuer. Enter U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard. And away we go.After initially evading capture Kimble faces new challenges. He has to find a way to survive in the world without any money. Not an easy thing. And he has to conduct his own investigation of his wife's murder, find the real killer and prove his innocence. And he must do this while going unnoticed in his hometown of Chicago where more than a few people are looking for him. It's a simple story and there is great tension as the chase begins. Maintaining that level of tension for the over two hour running time of the film would prove to be a challenge. It's a film with an energy that somewhat wanes as we move towards the end.Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that apparently the filmmakers thought the simple story was a little too simple for its own good. The one-armed man isn't enough, there has to be some kind of grand conspiracy and another dastardly villain. Somebody decided the compelling story of the wrongly accused man wasn't enough. In trying to explain the events leading up to the murder of Kimble's wife the film really does take an unfortunate detour and much of the tension drains out of the story. The film is at its best when Gerard is trying to track down Kimble. Tommy Lee Jones created a truly memorable character with his portrayal of Gerard. While less showy than Jones, Harrison Ford does well with his role as Kimble. Left to their own devices these two characters would have been enough to make a truly excellent film. The film was always about Kimble and Gerard, Ford and Jones. Those are the characters we care about, identify with and root for. In fact Jones is so good, so compelling, that you're almost rooting for his character to succeed as much as you are for the plainly innocent Kimble. But instead of leaving well enough alone with these two men in the end the film devolves into a big conspiracy saga that rather disappoints. As the final act plays out there's too much going on, keeping it simple would have worked much better. The end result is a good film but one which with a more sharply focused story probably could have been something much greater.",The Fugitive

I enjoyed ""The Fugitive"" when I watched it on TV. It has just the right elements for a total action flick. Great performances, excellent escapist plot, strong direction and daredevil cliffhangers.

You don't need explosions and car crashes when you have those.But this movie does gives you one big crash, and because just one they evidently decided it had better be big.

98,Stampsfightclub,Fast and highly likable thriller,8,27 October 2009,"After a traffic collision convicted murderer Dr Richard Kimble (Ford) tries to clear his name whist Samuel Gerard (Jones) attempts to track him down.This Andrew Davis picture brings together a slick plot flowing with action and intrigue and with Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford on perfect form this is the perfect remedy to an absent action injury.With James Bond being ""reborn"" these last few years and The Bourne trilogy racking up plaudits from everywhere it seems we have reinvented the term of thriller in a genre that is often scrutinized for its lack of realism in context.What makes the Fugitive tick? For starters this is a fun adrenaline soaking thriller that needs minimal explanation to get the blood pumping. From waterfall jumps to train crashes this has enough to fulfil the viewer's requirements.There is an array of credited actors who have broken barriers in their lifetimes previous to this Oscar winner. Tommy Lee Jones (winner of best supporting actor) has of course starred in plenty of action thrillers. Under Siege, No country for old men and possibly Men in Black he knows how to tackle the action. Having just reviewed the Oscars from 15 years ago I must confess to having liked John Malkovich's protagonist in the Wolfgang Peterson thriller In The Line of Fire plenty more. The swagger and evilness of Booth was elaborate, eccentric and malicious with a delicious cunning that made his character seem approachable but undeniably sick and evil. Jones nevertheless presents a character with baggage but does not convey it and with an intelligent appreciation of law and crime he sets the benchmark to the law breaking citizens of America.Ford establishes himself as mystery man in the early stages where we believe he could be good or evil and when the plot momentarily loses its balance we know the truth of his innocence.This narrative of a man needing to escape and prove his name as innocent is reflective of numerous other thrillers there's no question. Bearing in mind this concept can become tedious when seeing repetitive viewings of various thrillers it is significant to recognize this was one of the early films that brought this technique to the attention of the critiques and various other filmmakers. It is a stunning concept that adds tension and mystery from every aspect.The scene setting is wonderfully exuberant. The forest setting generates the feeling of isolation exquisitely whilst the montages of the flashbacks fittingly reflect this isolation and gives the central character development and contemplation.There are lapses in the action with an overhaul in dialogue and the Bourne series has shown the meaning of thriller but this is undoubtedly fast and fun mystery.",The Fugitive

It has got a lot of great aspects to it that keep you interested and very entertained. If you are into thrilling mysteries with plenty of enticing action then this is a great movie for you. The movie mostly plays out with the kind of tone you would expect, throwing in a few tricks along the way that makes for a very entertaining story. This film never lost my interest but it never spiked it. I was amused by the film the whole way through and enjoyed it enough to not regret watching it at all. It boasts some great set pieces and fun chase sequences through these busy urban sets. The film has a lot of characters but the only two that really draw you in are Kimble and Gerard. The two are played excellently by Ford and Jones respectively.The best way to describe The Fugitive would be high quality escapist entertainment. This is simply one of those movies you take at face value. There isn't a whole lot to take out of this film, and you really just have to watch it for a good time. It pretty much succeeds in that area. I wasn't blown away by this film but I wasn't bored or irritated by it either. It doesn't have any glaring issues that bothered me other than the occasional silly line or ridiculous moment that makes you go, ""yeah right."" Overall it isn't a movie that is very aesthetically impressive, but it does have its moments. This isn't one of those films that you can bash, but rather just accept it for the fun use of two hours of your life that it is.The Fugitive is a lot of fun and it's easy to enjoy. It doesn't require a significant amount of brainpower but it isn't a braindead schlock of a film either. When you look at the action thriller genre, The Fugitive stands as the genre done just right.

102,ivo-cobra8,A classic! The Best Harrison Ford's action flick. An Andrew Davis masterpiece!,10,26 February 2016,"The Fugitive (1993) is a classic action thriller flick from Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. It is my favorite all time classic action film from Harrison ford and Andrew Davis, that I love to death! Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, gave their best performances on screen, I have ever seen. No wonder the score is 7.8 on IMDb, because it is a classic and I absolutely love it. I grew up, with this film and it is my childhood favorite movie. Back in 1993 this film was a hit, I remember seeing the trailer on TV as a kid, this movie was also in the theater. This is third time that Tommy Lee Jones and Ron Dean worked together with the director Andrew Davis. Tommy Lee Jones previous worked on a movies The Package and Under Siege, until he got cast in this film. Being the biggest Harrison Ford fan, I must say this is my favorite film of his. Watching him last year on YouTube on Jimmy Kimmel Live show, Harrison specifically requested Jimmy not to ask him anything about Star Wars. I don't know what happened with him on Star Wars movies and I don't care! I was never fan of Star Wars and I never will be! I was more an Indiana Jones fan and still I am. So my favorite Harrison ford Films will always be: Indiana Jones Trilogy, this one (The Fugitive), Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games. Those are the films I grew up with it.Plot: Dr. Richard Kimble, unjustly accused of murdering his wife, must find the real killer while being the target of a nationwide manhunt. I know that this movie is based on original TV series from the 60's with David Janssen and it was also based on a doctor who was accused of murdering his wife, which he didn't, I watched the TV movie. I love this film to death, Andrew Davis Sensational directed the film, no shaky cam and no CGI in the movie. The special effects were great, the acting performance from the cast was perfect and the chase sequences were incredible. The film is entertained from the beginning till end. I love the music score by James Newton Howard in the film, the plot and the story is brilliant. About the character Dr. Richard Kimble, this character has a heart. I love how Richard (Harrison Ford) was pretending to be a janitor the same time, while he was looking in the prosthetic limb area for patient information matching the description of the one-armed man. The best scene and favorite of mine is a scene, when a doctor (Julianne Moore) asks Kimble to take down a boy down the stairs in the operation room, who has a chest broken and Kimble doesn't obey her, he sees the record and he writes a description, he talks to the boy and he put him in the right surgery floor and saves the young boy's life. That scene touches my heart every time, I see it. This film has a heart, it does show that Kimble is not only innocent, but he is a good hearted person, that he was convicted wrongfully, for the crime he did not commit. That is why I love this movie. I also love Tommy Lee Jones' character Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard who later starts to believing that the man is innocent, but he has to do the job by bringing him back to hand of the law. I love his line ""I...don't...bargain."" About the cast: Beside Harrison Ford which I love him that he did an outstanding, believing acting and the best performance. Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard was outstanding which I loved him in this movie. Joe Pantoliano as Deputy U.S. Marshal Cosmo Renfro was terrific, recently I just watched him in Bad Boys II and I seriously love his voice. Julianne Moore as Dr. Anne Eastman has only two scenes and made only a cameo scene in this film, which she was awesome! later she played the main role in my favorite all time adventure flick The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). Andreas Katsulas as Fredrick Sykes was fantastic and he was awesome villain I love him in this film. Jeroen Krabbé as Dr. Charles Nichols was incredible as a doctor and the villain I love him. The last actress I want to mention in this movie is L. Scott Caldwell as Deputy U.S. Marshal Erin Poole she was also awesome. I know she had a small role in here, I am really wondering why she didn't return in the sequel U.S. Marshals (1998). Overall: I love this movie to death, it is my childhood movie that I have grew up with it and it is my Harrison Ford and Andrew Davis favorite film of all time I love it!

103,natashabowiepinky,Watch out... You may just gnaw your fingers off.,8,14 April 2015,"An all-time classic chase thriller with an equally compelling character study, The Fugitive ranks as one of the best examples of it's genre around. As dogged detective Tommy Lee Jones hunts his prey (an innocent doctor, played by Harrison Ford) through hospitals, street parades, and even the Hoover Dam, the interaction between the two and the amount of near misses will have you falling off the edge of your seat. And there is also Ford's quest to prove his inculpability in the murder of his wife... Jones's bonding with his hand-picked investigation team... Exactly how much can you squeeze into a two hour long feature?!My favourite aspect of the production isn't the brilliantly directed scenes of pursuit, or the slow unveiling of who WAS responsible for the tragic crime, or even Harrison Ford as the wronged man who nevertheless stops to help others even while on the run (Thus engaging him perfectly with the audience's sympathies). Nope, that would be Tommy Lee Jones as the bombastic police office in charge of the capture... He is never short of something to say... Doesn't take crap from anyone... And (most of all), the small looks in his eyes as the evidence mounts that Ford may not be the one responsible for his spouse's demise after all. He turns from the man trying to get Ford at all costs... To the only one willing to protect him in the heated climax...A great character, brought to life by a great actor. Someone give that chap an Oscar... Whoops, he received one. WOWEE Life Is Good. :) 8/10",The Fugitive
104,SmileysWorld,Ford and Jones in top form.,9,27 February 2002,"Now,I am not a big fan of the idea of the small screen to the big screen,and being a fan of the original television series with David Janssen and Barry Morse made me a skeptic at the beginning,but I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised with the big screen version of The Fugitive.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones make an excellent pairing and both are in top form here.Yes,the story has been reworked somewhat,and a few names changed,but this film does it's job splendidly.In my own humble opinion,this action film is second only to Terminator 2:Judgment Day as tops for the decade of the nineties.My wife and I visited the area in North Carolina recently where the train wreck sequence was filmed and the train is very much still there and quite the tourist attraction.If you are a fan of the old series,and have boycotted this film because you are afraid it will disappoint you,my advice to you would be not to rob yourself of the pleasure of this great film any further.You may just wind up with a whole new passion for this story.Thumbs up!",The Fugitive
105,Angry_Arguer,3 Days of the Condor meets Braveheart,10,18 January 2004,"Here's Davis' second most interesting film, perhaps the most successful TV-quality movie ever made.  The biggest problem is that Davis is too pedestrian in his methods and never adopts a useful style.  Richard Donner and Spielberg have covered multiple topics in their careers, but have also maintained a sense of style.  Davis takes everything at face value.Here Ford is called upon to do something other than quip Lucas-inspired dialog, something he also failed at with Witness.

Tommy Lee Jones won an Oscar as best supporting actor for this film but it is also among Harrison Ford's best performances. Based loosely on a celebrated murder which would have been even more famous if CNN and Fox had been pursuing the story, The Fugitive records Harrison's pursuit by Jones as a U.S. Marshall attempting to capture the doctor accused of killing his wife, while Harrison tries to find the actual killer with Jones never very far behind. There was a TV series before the movie -- and it was pretty good. But the movie is better.

Without the two actors, the movie would have been largely forgotten but the two antagonists are in full flight and in their prime. (Maybe a few years past.) The movie features one long chase with police only a step behind as prison escapee Dr. Richard Kimble tries to outwit and out-run Samuel Gerard, federal Marshall. Kimble races across Illinois to Chicago from highway to subway to hospitals and flophouses with a pause at the St. Patricks's Day Parade. Viewers are treated to some exciting scenes as Kimble successfully dodges police as he changes his appearance by shaving his beard, changing from day clothes to uniform and back again. He seeks out friends whose help he needs to establish his innocence.

The added suspense lives up to calling this just another mega-thriller that differs the original black-and-white series. Both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are fully demanding in giving this the raw energy a simple cat-and-mouse story needs. For interesting terminology, the leading characters are on opposite sides of their personalities, with ""good"" convict Kimble evading the so-called ""villainous"" U.S. Marshal who is out to capture him. Ford uses the old INDIANA JONES trick in a couple of the riskiest stunts performed on film, but he keeps the action moving. One drawback is that you're now beginning to notice his recent characters a bit more worrisome than heroic, but Ford gets the job done as usual. Much of THE FUGITIVE displays continuous action and suspense until the rousing climax. Look for a hospital nurse that appears in the form of Julianne Moore. This will most likely end up as one of the Top 10 action thrillers of the decade before the 90s is through.",The Fugitive
114,Darkside-Reviewer,Kimble!,9,18 February 2020,Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is a renowned doctor and all round nice guy who is wrongly convicted for the murder of his own wife when the police find only evidence on Kimble and no evidence supporting his claim that his wife was killed by a one armed man now sentenced to death he's transported by prison bus to death row when a group of convicts cause the bus to crash everyone escapes and now Kimble is now a fugitive on the run from the police and a bad ass US Marshall Samuel Gerard played by (Tommy Lee Jones) what ensues is a cat and mouse game between a dedicated US Marshall and a highly intelligent Doctor determined to find the man who killed his wife and clear his own name.This movie is an absolute classic and is regarded as one of the best and most memorable performances of both Harrison Fords and Tommy Lee Jones careers and it's easy to see why both are at the top of their game here and both work well together as Co Star's both giving a commanding performance that grabs your attention in different ways you want them both to win but neither of them to lose at the same time.If you haven't already seen this classic Drama/Action movie then do yourself a favour and watch The Fugitive you won't be disappointed with it.,The Fugitive

116,virek213,An Innocent Man On The Run,9,31 May 2002,"Of all the old TV shows that have become big-screen movies, THE FUGITIVE must be one of the very few that actually works.  A transfer to the big screen of a fine TV series that starred the late David Janssen and ran on ABC-TV from 1963 to 1967, THE FUGITIVE had all the earmarks of a great film, and it does not disappoint.Taking over for Janssen, Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, a prominent Chicago surgeon who is convicted for the brutal slaying of his wife Helen (Sela Ward)--a crime he did not commit.  While on his way to meet his fate in an Illinois prison, the bus he and other prisoners are riding in suffers an accident, and is literally crushed by a freight train.  Ford manages to make it out of the wreckage and escapes into the woods.  Now, however, he not only has the whole Illinois state police and the Chicago P.D. on his trail, he also has a phalanx of U.S. marshals, led by the tenacious Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones).With all the odds stacked against him, Ford constantly has to change his appearance to avoid detection while at the same time going after the one-armed man who actually killed his wife.  The result is a gripping cat-and-mouse game through the streets of the Windy City, a literal battle of wits between Ford and Jones that made for some of the best movie-making of the Nineties.Superbly directed by Andrew Davis (UNDER SIEGE; CODE OF SILENCE), THE FUGITIVE is not only a brilliant big-screen translation of a fine TV show from the past, it also echoes a theme familiar to Alfred Hitchcock--a man on the run for a crime he never committed.  Ford is the man in that position. Jones won a well-deserved Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Gerard, but as Jones himself readily admitted, it is Ford's portrayal of Richard Kimble that is at the heart of this great thriller.  Not nearly as violent as a lot of action films have tended to be, THE FUGITIVE is one of the finest in its genre, well worth seeing.",The Fugitive

A great thriller!The story is about a doctor called Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) who is on the run after the bus he was on is crashed, and was he suppose to be given a death sentence for apparent 'murder'.He is believed to have killed his wife, but Kimble (Harrison Ford) sets out to prove he was innocent, and find out the real killer and his motive.However, the problem he faces in finding out these things is that he is being hunted down by the US Marshall called Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) who firmly believes Kimble (Harrison Ford) is guilty, and that he is trying to get away for his 'crime'.The Fugitive is simply an awesome movie.

When an accident allows Kimble to escape, his one and only goal is to find out who really killed his wife and then prove it to the authorities, clearing his name. Gerard's only concern is bringing him in, no matter what it takes.This was such an outstanding film on so many levels. I remember watching it back in 1993 when it first came out in theaters. We went, bought our tickets, watched the movie, and then went right back out to the box office and bought two more tickets and watched it again. I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen it since. I love this film.Tommy Lee Jones earned and deserved his Best Supporting Actor award for his role as the Deputy U.S. Marshal. This was the role he was born to play. Nobody, and I mean nobody, could have played this part as well as he did. Harrison Ford was convincing in his plight as the desperate fugitive, just trying to survive and prove his innocence. The cinematography was second to none, the screenplay perfect, all the acting participants solid in their roles, the action sequences pulled you to the edge of your seat - and very rarely have I been so engrossed in a story as I was with this movie.""The Fugitive"" comes with the highest recommend possible.

This here features an excellent cast, good action, but is actually a very compelling and superbly crafted story, with great tension; very difficult to keep up for a whole 2hrs + with such a basic main plot; and a superb ending. Great suspense, great twists, great acting - Ford plays his part very well and Tommy Lee Jones as usual is brilliant, and plays *just* right. It really takes a great effort to extend such a synopsis into a lengthy epic like that and not lose credibility, or dynamism at least at some point.

122,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones (& Vice Versa),8,15 December 2018,"The coolest scene of this popular and successful, multi Oscar nominated and in one case, Oscar winning big screen adaptation of the classic TV-show is when supporting actor champ Tommy Lee Jones is by himself, looking straight ahead but at nothing, really - then cutting to where Harrison Ford's title character is seeking refuge.Jones, who was practically a veteran actor at this point, and hadn't yet reached big mainstream success, is downright fantastic here: he deserved the A-list promotion but should NOT have won the award far more deserving of Ralph Fiennes, who turned in a more difficult and less natural performance as a loathsome Nazi's Nazi in SCHINDLER'S LIST, and his was actually a Supporting Role, and not one of two equal co-leads: Which is what Ford and Jones are... In fact, the latter has even more scenes, overall input, and, obviously, dialogue...Meaning little to Harrison Ford, doing some of what made legendarily pursued-heroes Han Solo and Indiana Jones so great: Running in a human manner, and with an off-beat cadence that's even a tad clumsy: as if he could be caught at any moment, which provides a built-in element of suspense: especially here, where running and hiding are pretty much everything UNLESS you're searching and sweating like Jones's U.S. Marshall, Samuel Gerard, who wields the same type of perfectly cast Solo/Jones sarcasm that both grounds the action and keeps it rolling...Following the initial prison bus escape leading to perhaps the greatest train derailment scene in cinematic history, it might have been tough living up to this early a peak (of peaks): after all, it takes more than machines to carry a 130-minute motion picture...So it's annoying and distracting when Gerard's forced comic-relief cohorts chime in every time ""The Big Dog"" speaks; making Ford's once-dignified surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble (with a pretty wife killed by a one-armed man) the real partner here: and that's with only one quick scene shared between them...You can thank director (and OVER THE EDGE cinematographer) Andrew Davis for that: making THE FUGITIVE (after a somewhat rushed and melodramatic interrogation-to-courtroom prologue) the kind of action movie that flows like a glorious epic adventure, updating a simple story with precision, style and substance, and, whether he was influenced or not, Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS has similar above-ground/sky-high, slow-pan establishing shots.

These 2 movies introduced us to a ""family"" of United States Marshalls who work together to fight crime. The reason the films work so well for me is the intelligent story lines, the richly developed main characters, and the good support from the secondary characters.In THE FUGITIVE, Tommy Lee Jones indeed deserved the Oscar he got for his portrayal of Sam Gerard. He gave the character warmth, wit and hilarity. Simple moments like, ""WHY HAVEN'T THEY TURNED THAT WATER OFF YET???!!!"" are reasons why the Oscar was deserved.Harrison Ford also deserved an award for his desperate, driven portrait of vascular surgeon Richard Kimble, whose beloved wife (the classically beautiful Sela Ward) was brutally murdered. Convicted and imprisoned, Kimble gets a unique opportunity to escape, hunt down the person or persons who DID kill his wife, and bring him/them to justice.And he uncovers the most evil conspiracy of greed and corruption.With a great cast that includes Joe Pantoliano, Julianne Moore, and Jeroen Krabbe, THE FUGITIVE is one of the new classics, a smart, cerebral thriller and also a nonstop action adventure.",The Fugitive
124,bbewnylorac,"Superb, intelligent film",10,7 December 2015,"I just watched The Fugitive for the first time in years, and enjoyed it immensely. The script and direction are near perfect. The tension hums along like a clock, and there are lots of inventive chases, but the plot is always crystal clear. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford both bring a keen intelligence to their roles. It could be Ford's best role, and Jones lights up every scene he's in with a droll humour and relaxed yet astute manner. But all the actors, including then-unknowns Jane Lynch and Julianne Moore, are given smart and absorbing parts. Even cameos are good. The background music is very dramatically old fashioned but bearable. The flippant, jokey humour of the detectives gets annoying sometimes. The opening bus and train crash is amazing -- one of the most perfectly executed stunts you will ever see. But the film is just constantly inventive, such as a chase scene in the St Patrick's Day parade, or the police raid on the house where Dr Kimble is staying that turns out to be the arrest of the shonky landlord. Not a scene or word in The Fugitive is wasted. It's almost clinical, the way the film is paced, but it has so much heart and soul, it draws you in and keeps you riveted.",The Fugitive
125,DavidSim240183,The Chase Is On!,10,9 August 2006,"I'm not much of a fan of films adapted from TV shows. Most are dreadful, but there are a few that work well when stretched to feature-length. The Addams Family, Starsky & Hutch, and The Fugitive.When The Fugitive was released in 1993, films spun off from TV shows was not the common occurrence it is today. The Fugitive is one that works, and works better on the big screen. Through sharp, taut direction, virtuoso action scenes and two great performances from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.The film uses the basic framework of the series and takes it to great new places. Ford is Chicago surgeon Dr Richard Kimble. A respected man who loves his wife Helen (Sela Ward) dearly, his perfect life is shattered when a one-armed man breaks in to their home, and batters Helen to death. Richard can do nothing to save her, and fate deals him a cruel hand when her murder is pinned on him.In a shocking ten minute prologue, the film goes through the motions of Richard's arrest, trial and eventual sentencing to death with an almost frightening rapidity. These scenes are short, clipped and devoid of excessive material. They're important because it sets up the atmosphere that constantly hangs over Richard for the duration of the film. It is a point where the whole world is seemingly against him.But Richard gains his freedom in the first of many marvellous, exhilarating action sequences. The prison bus he's on is hijacked by the other prisoners on board, and it ends up on the train tracks, just in time for a meeting with an oncoming train. Watching Richard jump from the bus before the collision is one sight you won't forget in a hurry.Enter Deputy Sam Gerard, the US Marshal on Kimble's trail. Tommy Lee Jones pulls out all the stops here, putting in an Oscar winning performance. You perk up every time he's on the scene, because you know you'll be entertained. Although Sam is initially portrayed as an obsessive lawman with no qualms about catching his quarry, Jones is skilled enough to bring more dimensions to his character.Jones' best scenes are with his team of deputies. Although they're dead set on catching Kimble, director Andrew Davis is smart to add a little comic relief to counter-balance the building tension. Sam's deputies affectionately snipe at each other, but they are real people. My favourite scene is when Sam and one of his deputies, Newman, apprehend another fugitive. Newman is taken hostage, and Sam is forced to kill their fugitive. When Sam checks if Newman is OK, this scene speaks volumes about Sam's character. Behind that cynical front is a thoughtful man who cares a great deal for the people who work with him.The Fugitive is a story of two halves. Richard searching for the one-armed man, and Sam's deepening investigations. Ford is a great deal more subdued than Jones, but you do feel for his plight. And with Ford's status as an everyman, he is perfectly suited to this character who has to continually change identities and locales to stay one step ahead of the law.The film is admittedly a little vague about how Kimble gets the money for new clothes and hair dye, but that comes with the territory. Since Davis has such a firm hand on the reins, he keeps things ticking along nicely. And Kimble's own investigation is logically explored.Kimble's unforgettable swan-dive off the top of a dam is master stunt-work on an epic scale. And there are many thrilling chase sequences. Too many to mention, but the best is Kimble's near death at Sam's hand at the County lock-up.There is an immense amount of satisfaction in watching Kimble put it together. It's a puzzle that needs to be solved. And I wouldn't dream of spoiling it for you. The Fugitive is at it's best when the slick plot direction is moving forward, even though it leads to a few dead-ends and near misses for our hero.It all comes together nicely with Kimble finding the killer (or killers), and Sam and police catching up to him at the same time. Still, in regards to the police, the film requires some stupidity on their part, since they're so willing to ignore any possibility that Kimble might be innocent. It's left to Sam's team to put the pieces together and save the day.The Fugitive is excellent. A refreshingly character based action film that is a rarity these days. Look out for some fine supporting performances from Julianne Moore, Joe Pantoliano and the underrated Jane Lynch. All component parts of a much larger masterpiece.The finest action film of the 90's.",The Fugitive
126,romanorum1,"""A hard target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, hen house, outhouse, and doghouse in the area""",9,15 September 2013,"In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers.The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a mêlée, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources – and even slightly wounded – Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance.Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: ""I didn't kill my wife!"" Gerard: ""I don't care!""). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end.Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions.Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room.The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, ""Saboteur""). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. ""The Fugitive"" is enjoyable even after many viewings.",The Fugitive

If you like intrigue, Ford, Lee Jones, or a story about a guy trying to clear his name, it's definitely for you. If you like action, you'll also find your entertainment. There's even a bit of romance and a cap on the violence so the ladies might find their own too.",The Fugitive

130,avik-basu1889,He Just Won't Give Up !!!,8,6 June 2015,"The Fugitive is a crime thriller based on a TV series from the 1960s of the same name and it stars Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones and Sela Ward. The plot is pretty straight forward. After his wife gets murdered , Dr. Richard Kimble(Ford) is accused of committing the crime and with circumstantial evidence stacked against him, he is sentenced to death. But due to a fortunate accident he escapes from the police and starts his own investigation of the murder of his wife while the authorities headed by Deputy Samuel Gerard(Jones) keep chasing him.From a thematic standpoint, this film isn't very deep. It isn't really trying to say anything too cerebral or profound about our society or the characters. The director Andrew Davis knows what kind of film he wants to make and he does a very efficient job of making a thriller that keeps the viewer invested and always on the edge of their seats. Something or the other is happening at every moment and boredom is never allowed to set in. The cat and mouse game between Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones' characters make the film an exhilarating watch. Both Ford and Jones give good, intense performances.If a thriller works well, the screenplay and the direction have to be admired. Although there are certain occurrences in the film that require the viewer to suspend his/her disbelief to some extent, but for the most parts the storyline remains believable. The director and the screenplay writer never consider the viewer to be stupid and actually demand some attention from the viewer to understand what is happening in some of the scenes.The Fugitive isn't a very deep film, but it is certainly a thriller in the true sense. The direction, acting and the screenplay will keep the viewer engrossed and heavily interested.",The Fugitive
131,Majikat76,A classic Thriller!,8,2 May 2018,"A timeless classic, cat and mouse chase for the fugitive Dr. Richard Kimble. Innocence to be proven, this man pulls out all the stops to get to the bottom of his wife's murder, whilst being hunted by the F.B.I.A great film for both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.",The Fugitive
132,theshadow908,Great cat and mouse thriller.,8,21 May 2006,"Dr. Richard Kimble is accused of murdering his wife even though he witnessed a one armed man committing the crime. On his way to death row there is an accident that allows Kimble to escape. The hunt is on. Kimble goes on the hunt to find out who killed his wife and why, and U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard goes on the hunt for Kimble to bring him in. All the events leading up to the great climax make for an amazing cat and mouse thriller.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are great in this movie. No matter which one is on the screen you get the same vibe. Their characters both don't want to stop. They want to find who they're looking for, and they're not going to slow down until they do. To me, this is one of Harrison Ford's better roles. To me his films have been dwindling in quality lately. The scenes involving the U.S. Marshals provide some good comic relief that makes the mood of the film more lighthearted until the action picks up again.Andrew Davis does a really good job compacting four years of material from the TV show into a 2 hr. and 10 minute movie. He even gives the film a twist ending that you're not really expecting. What I really like about The Fugitive is that it's a non-stop action film, but it's not a popcorn flick. This is a real serious movie. The characters and dialogue are realistic, and they make use of several different emotions throughout the film. This is a great movie that if you haven't seen it, you should definitely rent or buy it. You won't regret it.8/10",The Fugitive
133,Marc_Israel_365,A thriller of a thriller that tops itself in thrilling fashion,8,26 April 2013,"Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clichéd gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.",The Fugitive
134,tastyhotdogs,Great TV adaption,9,8 October 2005,"THE FUGITIVE- REVIEWI was walking through K-Mart the other night when I stumbled across ""The Fugitive- Special Edition"" DVD. I was in the mood for buying a DVD so I thought I'd check it. It had lots of bonus features plus it was $9.95. I was sold. I actually felt I was ripping K-Mart off. If they knew it was my 2nd favorite movie of all-time, could they have charged me more? Anyway I watched it this morning and here's my observations:-To fully appreciate the movie, you have to (1) know it is loosely based on a true story (2) have watched the TV series from the 60's. -This movie contains the only enjoyable role ever played by Tommy Lee Jones. -It's probably also Harrison Ford's last good movie, unless you count ""Air Force One"" as a comedy. -I reckon if he went in the outfit he stole from the old guy in the hospital in his initial court trial and not the suit with the beard, he would have got off with good behavior. -Great quote 1 (when he's being quizzed at the station) ""Financially, you're not gonna be hurting after this"". I'm gonna use that when consoling people at the next funeral I attend of a well-off family. -I know it would have ruined the film, but I gotta ask, if they're killing people to cover up this thing, why didn't they kill Kimble? Didn't it occur to them that even is they successfully framed him and he went to prison to wait for the lethal injection, he would have had a few years to do research and chase down the one armed man. All he needed was internet access and someone like Chloe from ""24""and he would have solved it in a week. -That bus rollover is still one of the best car accident scenes in a movie. Brilliant. The train crashing into it is even better. Watch the DVD to see the fascinating insight to the making of that scene. Amazing. The only digital effect was Kimble jumping from the bus. -Great quote 2 from Deputy Gerrard ""You wanna change your %^&*(*&^ story"" -Great quote 3 from Deputy Gerrard ""Think me up one of them chocolate donuts with the sprinkles on top"" -The tunnel scene is totally implausible. Watching closely you'll see cops from both ends were no more than 20 meters from him- and they missed seeing him jump down a sewer. That's not even considering the jumping off bit. -One thing everyone in the world knows from movies. If you have to call the cops, don't talk too long or they'll trace the call. Be careful if you're ever in this position of cops trying to drag out the call. -It's amazing that this movie isn't particularly brilliant in any one area, yet it keeps you gripped the whole way. Much like ""Heat"" it contains 1 awesome action sequence but other than that just plays out a very well written story with just 1 ridiculous scene. And the stars only share a few minutes of time together on screen.",The Fugitive
135,buckikris,Your Fugitives Name Is DR RICHARD KIMBLE!,9,14 March 2019,"Dr. Richard Kimble( Harrison Ford) is a successful vascular surgeon, for Chicago Memorial. He is arrested for murder of his wife, Helen( Sela Ward). He is then taken into custody and tirelessly questioned by Chicago P.D.. Kimble claims a one armed man was responsible; but when they find he is the sole beneficiary flags go up. He is booked for the murder of his wife. He is tried and convicted of the murder, and on his way to prison. He along with high security prisoners are taken via bus to prison. On the way there is an accident involving a train and the department of corrections bus.After the accident The U.S. Marshal's office is called in to take over the investigation. Leading the team is U.S. Deputy Marshal, Sam Gerard( Tommy Lee Jones). He and his team go on a man-hunt to find Kimble and bring him into custody. It is a cat and mouse game by air, foot(with bloodhounds), and so on. It stretches from the southern part of Illinois to Chicago. The pursuit begins with Kimble almost getting caught by Gerard running through a dam. Kimble escapes by jumping from the dam, shocking Gerard and his team. On foot Kimble changes his appearance, and starts a long journey back to Chicago. He blends in perfectly stopping at a near by hospital to fix his wound. Hot on his trail is Gerard and team. It is time for Kimble to do some investigating of his own, and desperately find out who is behind his wife's murder. He runs into a co-worker Dr. Charles Nichols( Jeroen Krabbe), who lend him some cash. Kimble rents a place and starts his own investigating. He makes a phone call to a colleague, and lies about his location. When Gerard finds out he has come back to Chicago by listening from the recorded phone call they start their search again.Kimble's first stop is Cook County hospital were he can disguise himself as a janitor. Their he can use their computers to do some searching for a man with a prosthetic arm. A man who uses a mid-humerus prosthetic right arm. He narrows his search down little by little until it is down to 48.While Kimble is doing his investigating, Gerard and Team are interviewing his fellow co-workers at Chicago Memorial. One in particular is Kimble's fellow co-worker, Dr. Nichol's. Most of Kimble's co-workers said they would help him and claim they would never find him. Plus one went as far to tell them that he didn't murder his wife.On a busy day Kimble is in his disguise, and is asked to move a patient. A boy whole is misdiagnosed, but Kimble looks at the X-Ray's. He changes them which get's the doctor's attention who asked him to help out. When Kimble comes down she confronts him pulls his I.D. and alerts authorities. Gerard and his team rush to the hospital ask how the boy is, she tells him he saved his life. While Kimble is nowhere to be found, Gerard has an idea what he might be doing.Kimble starts calling people who fit the description and one of them is in Cook CO. lock up. when Kimble goes there he realizes he has made a mistake a leaves. This looks odd to personal and they wonder what is going on. Gerard and his team decide check it out. While Kimble is leaving Gerard is going up the stairs. They meet half way and the chase begins, and Kimble almost gets caught. Kimble is not out of the woods, Gerard and his team are hot on his trail.Kimble stops at a bar and continues his search. While there he calls a Fredrick Sykes. When he leaves he notices undercover officers and plays it cool. Sykes is a retired Chicago police officer who claims to have lost his arm in the line of duty. He is the perfect suspect so Kimble goes to Sykes place, breaks in and finds some interesting info. that Dr. Nichol's had hidden from Kimble. It involves his colleague, Sykes, and a new drug called Provazic. Fredrick Sykes now works for a pharmaceutical company and helps Nichols gets his Provazic approved. The drug is nothing but money making scheme that involves Kimble. Kimble was a fall guy, because Nichols was using his liver cells to get the drug approved. At a convention for Nichols new drug, Kimble approaches him about it. The piece of the puzzle is finally solved when Gerard from a distance tells him he is innocent. The night of the murder Nichols borrowed Kimble's car, he called Sykes from the car. Nichol's had the keys let Sykes in and Helen was a pawn. There is no explanation why she was killed. I assume she new what was going on?This movie is a high octane thriller from beginning to end. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford make this movie a great hit. A highly recommended thriller with the cat and mouse chase until the end. The final piece of the puzzle leaves the audience spellbound.",The Fugitive
136,Ddey65,Better Than The TV Series,7,26 December 1998,"What makes the 1993 version of ""The Fugitive"" better than the TV Series? Is it the special effects? Maybe, but I think it's the origin of the one-armed-man. In the TV Series, David Jannsen's nemesis seemed to be using his handicap as an excuse to carry out a life of crime. He seemed like he was looking for sympathy, and didn't deserve it. No wonder handicapped-rights groups took offense to it. Harrison Ford's one-armed-man was a lot better. He was bad, just because he was bad. He sounded like the kind of guy who didn't need an excuse to be dirty, however lame it may have been. Incidentally, the phrase ""one-armed-bandit"" is also slang for slot machines. I'm surprised that neither the writers of the movie or the show tried to make the prosecutors accuse Kimble of being a compulsive gambler.",The Fugitive

138,gary-444,Superb Action Thriller,10,16 June 2010,"Probably the greatest modern post Hitchcock action thriller. A terrific cast led by two towering performances from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of an intelligent script and superb direction. The 60's television series provided a firm base for the story, but this feature length, densely plotted movie, takes proceedings to new heights of drama, and excellence.The central premise is as old as the hills. ""The wrong that must be righted"". Ford playing Dr Richard Kimble is falsely accused of murdering his wife and the forces of good, the Police, become the agents of bad, in trying to recapture him after he escapes in a spectacular train and bus crash, as good an action sequence as you will ever see at the cinema.Tommy Lee Jones is imperious as Marshall Sam Gerrard charged with tracking him down. Wonderfully gnarled and taciturn, Gerrard starts out simply doing his job, but things change as he not only comes to respect his quarry, but also starts to have doubts about Kimble's guilt.The first half is all action, particularly the magnificent scene where a cornered Kimble dives down the face of a dam to escape his pursuers. The second half becomes a detective movie as Kimble returns to Chicago to find the real murderer- and clear his name. Full of twists and turns, there is an inevitable showdown at the end, and a text book ending as to how you wrap this sort of story up.Director Andrew Davis's previous work gave no hint of his ability to deliver such a masterpiece, although his previous effort ""Under Siege"" will have sharpened up his action skills. And subsequently, he never quite scaled these heights again.",The Fugitive
139,jldmp1,Prosthetic,3,22 July 2006,"Lots of dull sleuthing here, in the vein of ""Witness"". The only way to bring life to this was to attach parts of movie predecessors. Most notably, we get ""Silver Streak"" (the train crash), ""First Blood"" (the leap off the sheer wall of the dam), & ""The 39 Steps"" (the escape by mingling with the parade). The climax on the roof is from ""Die Hard"". Otherwise, the visual story is drearily colorless.Likewise, the story is completely gray. The writers should have taken notes from ""No Way Out"", or even ""Presumed Innocent"", which at least attempted to string us along that Ford could be the culprit.This could have been worthwhile if it had one element really of interest. The problem is, it's so basic and drab...simple enough for the unsophisticated Ford to handle, but that's it. Jones plays this as a joke, which is good enough for an Academy statue...but he's a one-trick actor as far as I'm concerned, and he played that trick out long before this.",The Fugitive
140,deepfrieddodo,Ford & Jones Shine,10,11 February 2021,"This is the ultimate version of a story that has been much repeated; someone wrongly convicted of a crime must evade the law and clear his name. The Fugitive far exceeds many others following the same narrative for many reasons.The acting of all the main cast is faultless, and whilst Ford is the star, it is Tommy Lee Jones who truly shines in his role of the US Marshal. The storyline is consistently swift and engaging, each distinct section leading seemlessly to the next allowing discovery along the way, punctuated by pulsating action or chase scenes. The plot is intelligent and unexpected, as the audience are able to piece together what has happened along with the lead. The fights aren't all that believeable in parts, and the use of a manikin at the dam is evident (although impossible to film otherwise), but it would be harsh to mark The Fugitive down based on this. It is a non-stop smart thriller, and a perfect example of the genre.",The Fugitive
141,MogwaiMovieReviews,The Fugitive,8,14 June 2020,"I must have seen this a long time ago, but my recollection of it was of a generic, almost made-for-TV thriller with only the bit with Harrison Ford jumping off the dam being memorable. For me it kind of got lumped in with that late 80s, early 90s Presumed Innocent/Fatal Attraction-era of 'grown-up' thrillers, that I guess eventually got replaced by all those John Grisham courtroom dramas later on.But I've just rewatched it again, and this time round found it to be an extremely well-made rollercoaster of entertainment, with a star-making performance by Tommy Lee Jones. There's a few TV detective-type moments and some cliches in the writing, but it's all done with such verve and force that you are carried along and gripped to the end. Watching it really brought home to me what a rarity a film like this would be today, in the sea of incompetence and identity politics we're all forced to swim. Just a simple, streamlined, fat-free story, built by professionals with the singleminded goal of rewarding the audience's attention with some fun. They just don't make 'em like that anymore.",The Fugitive
142,mhasheider,This film is both exciting and very tense.,9,7 November 2000,"Based on the great original t.v. series from the sixities, ""The Fugitive"", directed by Andrew Davis (""Under Siege"") is just as entertaining as the tv series itself.   It's about Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who is convicted for the murder of his wife, Helen (Sela Ward) in Chicago.  The local detectives think Kimble did it for the money while Kimble knows that he was framed by a man with artificial limb.   He gets the chance to prove his innocence by escaping a frightening train-bus wreck.   Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, who won a Best Supporting Oscar) and his small band of U.S. Marshals arrive at the scene and follow the clues that Kimble leaves for them.  It doesn't take too long for Gerard and Kimble to meet face-to-face, they meet in a sewer.    Kimble, who's holding Gerard's gun, says to Gerard in a scared tone, "" I didn't kill my wife."" Gerard quickly replies, "" I don't care."" That leads to one of the best scenes in the movie where Kimble jumps off the edge of a dam right into a river. That's pure filmmaking and stunts like this are common in a Davis film.   I liked Gerard's description of Kimble's escape to Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantliano), his main deputy ""He did a 'Peter Pan' right off the top of this dam.  Right here.""   The second half of the film is mostly a patient cat-and-mouse chase.  It isn't fast-paced as the first and the ending is well-made.  What makes ""The Fugitive"" work so well is I didn't only root for Kimble, but I rooted (and laughed) for Gerard as well.  Besides Davis's smart direction and handling of the film's pace, the story by David S. Twohy is masterfully written and is near perfection.     Harrison Ford gives another unforgettable performance as Kimble, but Jones is the stand out here as Gerard.  The supporting cast is great, too and ""The Fugitive"" is a classic film that shouldn't go unseen.",The Fugitive
143,Herag,Best Action Film,8,21 July 2011,"Most of the action films are stupid, involving hillbillies in junk car crashes, directed by Hollywood B directors, and acted out by C actors from San Fernando Valley (during a break from Pno, movies!) meant for people with double digit IQ's, who frequent Denny's for gourmet food. This movie was ""loosely"" based on Dr. Sam Shepard murder case, in Clevland Ohio, in 1954. In that case the intruder was blamed for the murder of his wife Marilyn Reese Sheppard, as she lay sleeping. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath, was convicted with evidence and motive (she intended to divorce him, muddy his reputation and take his hard earned money) He was released after ten years in jail, but died only 4 years later at the age of 46, due to drug, alcohol overdose and Remorse? The two writers-who are just brilliant-take the story and give an incredible twist to this case that makes this action picture a marvel of a movie.The action is gripping and never ending! This is the challenge of the intellect of one man vs the resources of the machine (practically any one with a uniform and a ID badge.) Tommy Lee Jones, is terrific (won Oscar.) Harrison Ford, is a good action actor more than an actor known for his acting. We also have Julianne Moore, as a very sexy looking Dr. Eastman in an otherwise drab County hospital.

150,brefane,Fugitive from concern,4,10 January 2010,"Despite the fact that it was nominated for Best Picture and Tommy Lee Jones' performance took supporting actor, The Fugitve is a middling time killer with a dull Harrison Ford, a mediocre script, and a predictable outcome. An unnecessary film adapted from the 60's TV series, the direction lacks flair, and the locations and cinematography are standard television quality. The TV series had the advantage of a introducing various settings and characters as Dr. Richard Kimble fled the law and recognition. In the film, the action is repetitive and fugitive Kimbel's continued access to the hospital where he once practiced stretches both credulity and patience. In truth, for me it all just didn't really matter and the film seems somewhat overblown. There are a few good scenes, and the perennial interest in seeing the wrongly accused prevail held my attention.",The Fugitive
151,HelloTexas11,three great performances,8,22 March 2008,"'The Fugitive' is quite a bit more faithful to its source material than many other feature films inspired by old television series, at least in an elemental sense. Most of the key reference points are there; innocent Dr. Richard Kimble, his wife's murder, the dogged pursuit by police Lt. Gerard, and of course the one-armed man. We hardly expect the main actors to impersonate their antecedents and they don't, though the thought of Harrison Ford mimicking David Janssen is an amusing one. But where the film really deviates from the TV show is in Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of the Gerard character. Barry Morse's staid police lieutenant may have had just a touch of deviousness to him, but it's nothing compared to Jones' flamboyant, in-your-face, control-freakish turn as the U.S. marshal on Kimble's trail. Jones' Gerard is every bit as much a lead character as Ford's quieter, determined Kimble. There are new twists (and a new sub-plot concerning pharmaceutical subterfuge) added to the familiar plot of Dr. Kimble on the run, trying to locate evidence that the one-armed man killed his wife and thus prove his innocence. Kimble is certainly nothing if not resourceful and not surprisingly, a certain suspension of disbelief is required by the audience to accept his ability to get out of scrapes and avoid the police throughout the film. In fact, there are primarily two sources of great enjoyment in 'The Fugitive,' one being Jones' over-the-top performance and the other Kimble's ingenuity at tracking down the murderer even while he himself is being pursued. Another actor deserves mention: Jeroen Krabbe, who plays a doctor friend of Kimble's who ultimately turns out to be one of the baddies. With his cultured accent and sophisticated manner, Krabbe exudes a kind of upper-crust menace very effectively, so that when his character's true nature is revealed, there is a real sense of justice prevailing in his getting his comeuppance. There is a certain infuriating quality about Gerard, for all his wiseass remarks and endearing devil-may-care attitude towards protocol, in that he seemingly never stops to consider whether Kimble just might be innocent, at least not until very late in the film. It stands in contrast to some of Kimble's old friends at the hospital he visits, who are just as unswervingly convinced that he isn't guilty without any physical evidence or proof to back up this belief. Kimble inhabits a no-man's land in the middle, slipping in and out of each alternate universe, one where he's damned for all time and the other where he's a great guy, and don't be silly, of course he didn't kill his wife. It's that tension that propels 'The Fugitive' along but also makes the ending not entirely satisfactory. You want to hit Lt. Gerard on the head when he finally realizes the truth and tell him, ""Of course he didn't kill his wife, you fool!""",The Fugitive
152,monkeysgalore,Arguably Harrison Ford's Best Film,10,8 February 2019,"The Fugitive is a first-rate action thriller film with an all-star cast and a masterful screenplay. This 1993 film, based on the original 60s TV show of the same name, surpasses its predecessor, at least for me. It also may be Harrison Ford's best movie, competing with Witness (1985), Air Force One (1997), the Indiana Jones films, Patriot Games (1992), and Clear and Present Danger (1994), but if it's not, it's definitely one of his best. It is a wonderful movie, and well worth your valuable time.So many thrillers often aren't thrilling, and substitute gratuitous profanity, violence, and sex/nudity for a plot of real substance, but this film is different. It's highly suspenseful, with a very thoughtful, intelligent story with few holes, and it managed to be that without any really bad language or sex. David Twohy and Jeb Stuart have constructed a really excellent, fast-paced and coherent script that really manages to keep you on the edge of your seat while also developing characters we as an audience can identify with, invest in, and care about. Jeb Stuart has a really impressive resume, having helped write the spectacular Die Hard (1988), Lock Up (1989), and one of my personal favorites, Another 48 HRS (1990). Point is, the story was really well constructed and executed, and as I say often, I never once found myself bored with what was going on.Andrew Davis also did a tremendous job as director, and he really, really nailed it here. Every scene is shot and executed so well, and he caused the script to flow very quickly and naturally. Davis, known for such films as Code of Silence (1985), Above the Law (1988), Under Siege (1992) and another film I really enjoyed, Collateral Damage (2002), really has a knack for directing action/thriller films, and he really shines here in brutal but realistic action sequences, and intense chase scenes.The cast were all brilliant, with Harrison Ford delivering his usual smashing performance. Ford always manages to sell his roles, regardless of the movie, and he has such a presence and charisma, and he's very likable and believable. Tommy Lee Jones really did an excellent job here, and if Ford wasn't the highlight of this film, then it's definitely Jones. Both are so good that you find yourself wanting to root for both, and neither, at the same time. Excellent performances from the whole cast.There was some great action in this movie, with the suspenseful house fight scene flashbacks, the bus/train crash scene, the sewer chase, the house shootout, the train fight scene, and the final fight. All of these scenes were skillfully directed and handled, and pretty realistic, aside from maybe the sewer scene, which I'm not sure could really happen, but it was still awesome.All in all, it's a really great movie, and you really should watch it, especially if you're a Harrison Ford or Tommy Lee Jones fan.",The Fugitive
153,manendra-lodhi,"""Makes you think, is there a formula for filmmaking?""",9,26 March 2013,"The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times.MESSAGE: ""Everyone gets a chance.""VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",The Fugitive

The Fugitive is a timeless classic that gets better with each watch. You'll like it the first time you see it, but it will get more and more likable with each subsequent view. Tommy Lee Jones stands out and delivers a crisp performance, nailing every layer, note, and nuance of his character. Deservedly, he won the Academy Award. Harrison Ford, at the peak of his box office star pull, also gives one of his all time career best performances as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man on the run.From start to finish, The Fugitive barely lets up.

He now must find the one-armed man who did it, while fleeing from U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his well-deserved Oscar-winning role). Every time I watch this I'm completely engaged in watching Kimble and Gerard solve this mystery. It proves to be the most interesting and fun movie I've ever seen. Jones gives the greatest film performance of all time, in my opinion. I don't know what else to say about it, since the film really has to be seen to understand why it is so great.

As a big Tommy Lee Jones fan, I'd have to say he stole most of my attention, but there were so many great lines and scenes that only Harrison Ford could have pulled off the way he did.

A spectacular train wreck with a bus of prison-bound felons gets the action underway at which point Tommy Lee Jones enters the picture and takes over the film by sheer force of personality and doesn't let go. Harrison, a resourceful type, stays just ahead of Jones in this taut cat-and-mouse thriller and adroitly leaves just enough clues for the police as he closes in on the killer.

I was pulled into the story dealing with Richard Kimball's desperate attempt to find his wife's killer and clear his name. ""Wrongly accused"" stories always are intriguing. This part of the film was good, you really are pulling for Harrison Ford here. HOWEVER, then you have the supporting cast and story. Here is where it all goes bad. The group of marshals led by Tommy Lee Jones have a script that consists of about three lines. The problem is that they dominate half of the screen time. The result is overacting at its worst. Overplaying skimpy lines and doing it so badly. Dominating camera time and not having anything to do or say. I was shocked at scenes that were included in this film. So much empty filler. There is one marshal with a ponytail, and he is about the worst actor I have ever seen. Am I the only person that saw this? I guess the casting idea was that he was realistic as a marshal, because a real marshal probably would not know how to act either? Is it his fault, or does he just not have a well written role? Not sure, but it is bad. Truth be told, this is a rather simplistic action story. However, by putting Ford and Jones in the leads, you get some credibility. I just wish that they had spent a little more time trying to develop a smarter script and some better acting.",The Fugitive
161,ryan_kuhn,"""I didn't kill my wife.""",9,29 April 2005,"Can you picture anyone other than Harrison Ford playing Dr. Richard Kimble? Can you picture anyone other than Tommy Lee Jones playing Marshal Gerard? The Fugitive is one of the rare remakes. It took an established entertainment product (The Fugitive was a hugely popular television show in the 1960s) and redefined it for new viewers. Older movie goers might not have been able to accept Ford and Jones in their roles, but for the younger movie-goers, the actors inhabited their roles so much that they became those characters. Tommy Lee Jones has been living off of his hard boiled image established in The Fugitive for the past decade. The Fugitive pretty much tells the same story that the TV show did. Dr. Kimble comes home from work to find his wife dead and he becomes the prime suspect. Dr. Kimble is then sentenced to death after his trial. During the transport back to jail, some of the other prisoners attempt a daring escape, resulting in Dr. Kimble escaping the transport bus himself. Now free himself, Kimble attempts to clear his name by finding his wife's murder, he's looking for the infamous one-armed man. Kimble is able to stay one step ahead of the US Marshals trying to relocate him, lead by Gerard. Directed by Andrew Davis, the movie features the right about of action and classic whodunit to keep viewers guessing. The scenes that were most effective were the ones that Kimble hides in plain sight as a janitor, where every person that looks at him might be the one who turns him in. The ending is satisfactory, in so much we finally see Tommy Lee Jones smile. Perhaps we can pause that moment and tell our kids that it did happen once.",The Fugitive

Andrew Davis, probably one of the most underrated and finest action directors, really delivers in The Fugitive. The script was unfinished when they started filming and they, Davis, David Twohy and Harrison Ford, added to and tweaked it as they went along, yet it appears to be a well planned and cohesive script. The film was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture, winning one for Best Supporting Actor - Tommy Lee Jones, who was most deserving. Harrison Ford, Jeroen Krabbe and Jones were terrific as was the cinematography, directing, music score, stunts, special effects and editing. The film moves at a fast pace from the first frame, never letting up until the end. If you are bored with this film you need to seek help! Roy Huggins and David Janssen would be proud of this effort to bring their excellent TV series to the movie screen. I highly recommend it for viewing and repeat viewing.",The Fugitive
163,daniellawson-14-787057,One of the best films of its genre,9,2 June 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as Samuel Gerrard: so much dry and deadpan humour combined with stone cold seriousness and dedication to his job
2) The two central plot strands of the murder mystery and the cat and mouse game work very well together. This is especially so because of the differing motivations of the two leads. Ford's character is desperate to solve the murder mystery and tries to avoid the cat and mouse game. Meanwhile Jones' character is desperate to win the cat and mouse game and when confronted with the murder mystery proclaims ""I don't care!""
3) The action / chase set pieces are fantastic. Especially the dam chase and the St Patrick's Day chase
4) I love the way in which the film shows us, through actions rather than words, that Richard Kimble is a good man. This is done through how he saves the black prison officer's life twice and then saves the little boy's life in the hospitalNEGATIVES:1) In the third act, it is mentioned that it has been a year since The Fugitive escaped at the start of the film. This seems unrealistic to me. Also, I think the film would seem more compact and engaging if all the events took place over a few days
2) While the Tommy Lee Jones scenes are perfect, some of the Harrison Ford scenes drag on a bit. I do think that the runtime could have 20 minutes or so taken off it from these scenes
3) The film definitely asks you to suspend your disbelief a lot; especially with how Ford's character has no military / espionage experience and yet is able to simultaneously evade law enforcement and conduct a murder investigation",The Fugitive

I've never seen the TV show this movie is based on, but I loved the movie. They managed to take the formulaic ""cat and mouse"" game and turn it into a first-rate thriller.The story is gripping and keeps your attention with constant plot twists. The atmosphere in Chicago is amazing, perfectly capturing the mood and feel of a crime-ridden town.The performances from the leads were phenomenal. Tommy Lee Jones is tough, gritty, and totally believable as Deputy Gerard. Harrison Ford is equally amazing as Dr. Richard Kimble, the wrongly accused man.

I had ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" on my list for 10 years but this movie trumps that, a long 16 years after release! Question is, was it worth the wait? Well, yes and no. Obviously, no film is worth waiting that long for unless you're the sort of obsessive fan associated with certain sci-fi franchises. But ""The Fugitive"" is, perhaps surprisingly, still a quality action movie that continues to be a benchmark after all this time. Tense, thrilling and lifted further by Tommy Lee Jones in blistering form, this is one movie that has not lost its power over time.Based on the TV show of the same name, ""The Fugitive"" opens with the brutal murder of Helen Kimble (Sela Ward), the wife of brilliant Chicago surgeon Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford). Wrongly convicted of her murder and sentenced to death, Dr Kimble escapes and sets out to find the one-armed man who did kill her. Trying to catch him is relentless US Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) and his dedicated team who don't really care whether Kimble did it or not. And so begins arguably the best manhunt ever committed to film...A bold statement but compare this to the half-hearted sequel ""US Marshalls"" (despite Jones' presence) and you begin to understand why ""The Fugitive"" is held in high regard. There's no CG stunt work, no pointless explosions or needlessly slow-mo gun fights. This is simply a great film that doesn't patronise or try to be anything other than a gripping battle of wills that never lets go of your attention. In fact, the only fault I can think of is that you are just as likely to cheer for Jones as you are for Ford - he thoroughly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as the helplessly charismatic Gerard. Actually, there is another fault but only if you're a fan of the TV show ""Scrubs"" - Neil Flynn's all-too-brief appearance will raise a faint smile which breaks the tension somewhat but it quickly passes, thankfully. But from the moment where Kimble escapes from a wonderfully staged train crash, the film rarely lets the tension relax as both Kimble and Gerard get increasingly desperate to get what they both want.Chances are, though, that you won't have waited 16 years to catch this fantastic action blockbuster. But if you have then prepare yourself for a movie that not only thrills and entertains with ease but one that still can produce the goods today. It stands head-and-shoulders above any other chase movie you could think of (including director Andrew Davis' other famous chase movie ""Chain Reaction"") but is also a cracking thriller movie that actually delivers the goods.

169,Jonathon_Natsis,Is it just me...,8,3 December 2011,"Or are all American thrillers basically the same movie, just slightly altered and repackaged each time? Okay, I know at heart that there are some obvious details in each film that make it different to ones before it, but I can't be the only one who's thought that, by simply pulling a bunch of dangerous-sounding buzz words out of the air (words like 'prosecution', 'corruption', 'mistaken identity' and 'manhunt') I could form the foundation of the next big action thriller. So why, then, is Andrew Davis' The Fugitive, a film that contains all these base ingredients and more, so much fun to watch? Short answer: a solid story, good acting and a cast of characters that fit into their respective roles like a favourite pair of pyjamas. Long answer: by all means, read on.Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a respected man sentenced to prison for murdering his wife, despite being adamant that it was not him, but a mysterious one-armed man, who committed the crime. On the bus ride to the big house, the other prisoners stage a daring escape, allowing Kimble to flee and begin a life of anonymity whilst seeking out the real killer. That is, until he crosses paths with Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), a hard-nosed US Marshal who cares not for Kimble's excuses, and whose only concern is restoring the status quo.Excluding the excellent Indiana Jones trilogy (notice I've left out the fourth instalment, which I refuse to mention by name), Ford has made this genre his forte, making him a natural fit for the desperate, determined Kimble. Jones earns the Best Supporting Actor Oscar by playing the typical Jones role to great effect: a no-nonsense tough guy with a sideswiping sense of humour. And Joe Pantoliano, best known as Ralph Cifaretto (or Cypher, if you're no Sopranos fan) makes under-appreciated contributions as Gerard's right-hand man.Suspense is on high supply throughout. My personal favourite is Kimble's attempt to hide in plain sight at the hospital, a tense and dramatic set piece that sets a paranoid tone for the rest of the film. But there is a plethora of energetic, 'edge-of-your-seat' moments to satisfy film connoisseurs and action junkies alike, including the sewer chase, the St. Patrick's Day parade and the rooftop climax, all of which comply with the conventions of an action thriller nicely against the backdrop of a bleak, but not quite noir, Chicago CBD.Speaking of conventions, it's clear that Davis has made a tight pace the top priority in The Fugitive, as the entire film is determined to remove any and all obstacles that would otherwise slow the movie down. Character development is restricted mainly to Ford's character, but is sprinkled in just enough to keep the rest of the cast from looking like cardboard cut-outs. But most pleasing was the omission of a romantic subplot. At different times during production, both Julianne Moore and Jane Lynch were scripted as Kimble's love interest. Despite the obvious pitfalls this would create from a logical perspective (considering Kimble spends the whole movie trying to avenge his beloved wife), it also sounds like the director has dodged a minefield of clichés by avoiding the beaten path; something I am very grateful for.Admittedly, the film becomes a little convoluted in the third act. Depending on how much you've enjoyed The Fugitive, this alone might be enough to warrant a second viewing, but otherwise it's nothing that a quick trip to the IMDb won't fix. If you're looking for a theme to take away, I suppose the movie could act as an exposition of human nature in desperate times. However, I doubt that was on the agenda during filming, and so the film should instead be enjoyed as was intended: an absorbing, high-drama roller-coaster, which I expect will remain a staple of this genre for many decades to come.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

It also happens to be one of the more entertaining films I have seen in a long time. I had a ton of fun watching this movie and will gladly see it again some day in the future. Everything in this movie from the direction, cinematography, script and the excellent score by James Newton Howard screams 90's and reminds me of an era where things were just more simple.Andrew Davis did a really good job directing this movie, as every scene is filled with tension, but also functions as a build-up for the next sequence. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both fantastic in this movie, definitely one of their best performances for both of them, simply outstanding job. John Pantoliano is also excellent here, I think he's one of the most underrated actors out there, not a lot of people talk about him. He was amazing in The Sopranos, The Matrix and also here.Like I said, this movie just screams 90's, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I think it works both as a positive and a negative for the movie. This is a film that, while watching it, you are instantly reminded of a certain age in cinema and how movies were produced during that time, which is very interesting. However, that also tells me that the film hasn't aged as well as I would have liked. A few lines here and there seem a bit too cheesy and I found the ending to be very predictable, because I think most of the movies produced during this time and considering the tone of the film early on, I knew Harrison Ford was gonna be innocent. It's also kind of obvious that his other doctor friend was somehow involved in the whole crime. And the ending with the reporters asking stuff about the conclusion of the movie, letting us know that the world now knows that Harrison Ford is considered innocent in the public eye.There were some things that I don't think made a lot of sense. First off, if they wanted to kill Harrison Ford, why did they send a one-armed man? Couldn't they find someone better for the job? I mean the guy was clearly a psycho, since he ended up killing his wife instead of Harrison Ford. And then, how did Harrison Ford get so much money to survive for so long? I believe they mention at some point that it had been a year since he escaped and unless I missed something, the only money he gets is the money he borrows from his evil friend, which I take it it wasn't a lot, since it was only what he had on him at the time. Also, the final fight between the two is just schlock.But, even with all its apparent flaws, The Fugitive is a very entertaining movie and I really liked it.",The Fugitive

174,Camoo,One of the best films of the 90s,10,12 October 2019,"There is a thriftiness to the Fugitive which demands appreciation: fifteen minutes in and we're on that prison bus, having been brought up to speed with an introduction that has seen the good doctor Richard Kimble falsely accused of murdering his own wife, and sentenced to death by lethal injection. Seventeen minutes in, after an amazing twist of fate, Richard is free. This is where the story begins; and what follows is a relentless, desperate pursuit, and a masterclass in adrenalized filmmaking.Captivating from its opening scenes, the film draws its characters flawlessly and with intelligence, setting them into a classic Hitchcock-like story of a falsely accused man, and his pursuers who begin to suspect he is innocent. The narrative would be overly complex if it wasn't told so deftly: three simultaneous investigations play out - the search for Richard, Richard's search for his wife's killer, the elusive 'one armed man', and the US Marshals who begin to take Richard's side, and re-open the investigation into his wife's murder. The growing bond between Richard and Marshal Samuel Gerard, who spend most of the film running toward or from one another, is the heart.There is a haunting sense of the inevitable in the Fugitive which is unforgettable, even all these years later; its mournful score has fused itself into my memory, and its wonderful set of actors irremovable from the characters they play. I've seen it countless times; it has the ability to completely remove me from critical thought, and just forces me to sit back and enjoy the ride.This is a technically genius, highly re-watchable film, which has both brains and brawn.",The Fugitive

What ends up happening is Tommy Lee Jones is hired as one of the U.S. Marshall's to hunt down Ford. As the troubled doctor, Ford conveys his emotions perfectly, showing a soft side yet a grim determination to find out what really happened. As the Marshall, Tommy Lee Jones gives off one of his most serious performances that injects a very well- crafted hard edge. Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones was awarded an Academy Award for his performance, and it was a definite must that Schindler's List star Ralph F. should have won. The script is kinetic and perfectly structured by providing fierce energy with some very witty and carefully worded dialogue. The direction is unusually emotional as it dwells quite a bit upon Ford's trauma on the death of his wife. Things connect well enough but there are some flaws too. Some of the chase sequences (Ford jumping into the water) were just downright insane and stood out as being totally unrealistic. Also, the pace was too slow sometimes as it got repeating from chase to chase to chase. A similar problem was encountered in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me if You Can. The Fugitive stands out as one of the few sharp modern thrillers and is a definite must for fans of the genre. 9/10",The Fugitive
176,possumopossum,Harrison Ford vs. David Janssen,9,28 September 2006,"When this movie came out in 1993, I was curious about several things. (1) How Harrison Ford would play the role as opposed to David Janssen. Ford did a great job of playing a specialist in a big city hospital. I thought, though, that since David Janssen's Dr. Kimble was a pediatrician in a small town, his was a more likable character. Also, Harrison Ford's Dr. Kimble had a pretty weak motive. Why would a vascular surgeon want to murder his wife for money? David Janssen's Dr. Kimble at least had a bone of contention with his wife, although I know we can't blame Harrison Ford for that.(2) How would they handle Dr. Kimble roaming from town to town solving everyone's problems and moving on in the neighborhood of two hours? (3) How long could Dr. Kimble run and hide, considering forensics were much better in the mid 90s than they were in the mid 60s? I admit I went into that movie ready to compare it to the original TV series, and was ready to rip it to shreds. However, the more I got involved in the movie, the more I forgot that it was spawned from my all-time favorite television show. This movie is pretty doggone exciting.

A man he had never seen before. A man who has not yet been found. Richard Kimble ponders his fate as he looks at the world for the last time. And sees only darkness. But in that darkness, fate moves its huge hand."" 
And with those words, David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, began a four year television odyssey as The Fugitive, the innocent man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife.  For four years Kimble managed to just barely stay one step ahead of Philip Gerard, the police Lieutenant obsessed with his capture.  The question is could such a premise be translated in an entertaining manner to the Big Screen with just a little over two hours to do it in?  The answer is yes, yes, and yes.In Director Andrew Davis's film version, he gives us a lesson in how to translate a television series to the big screen.  You update the story enough so it will appeal to the audiences of the nineties, you find actors such as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones for the lead, and you keep the heart and soul of what the original series was about. 
In this version of The Fugitive, Ford plays the part of renown surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble.  One night after coming home from an emergency operation, he encounters a man with a prosthetic arm in the process of killing his wife, Helen(nicely played with beauty and grace by Sela Ward).  After a brief struggle, the one armed man escapes and Kimble tries unsuccessfully to revive his wife.  Kimble is questioned then arrested and convicted for the murder of Helen.  All this is cleverly portrayed on the screen by interlacing flashbacks with courtroom testimony.  It enables director Davis to have the story quickly progress, yet fill us in with enough background that we are immediately sympathetic to Kimball's plight.  Later, as Kimball is being transferred with other prisoners on a bus, an escape attempt by the other inmates goes awry, causing a spectacular train crash which enables Kimball to escape.  From this point on, the suspense is piled on and will keep you riveted until the final outcome.David Janssen will always be remembered for his dark brooding characterization of Kimball on television, but in what I consider one of his best portrayals ever, Ford brings his own special quality to the role.  He makes us so aware of his deep love and devotion to Helen in the early parts of the film, so that we can immediately identify with him.  Like Janssen's Kimball, Ford's portrayal is often quiet and unspoken but in a way that makes us believe this is because of necessity rather than a character trait. In the original series, Kimball would always interact in the lives of many strangers he met every week, to give us insight into his character.  In this film version we meet many of the people who have known and worked with Kimball. What this does is give us more of an insight into his character in a short space of time.  Through this plot device, we understand that Kimball is not just a good surgeon, but an equally good human being.  It's adjustments such as this in the storyline that makes this series to motion picture translation work so well.There are other things.  In the original series, Lt. Gerard was an Indiana police lieutenant.  In this version he is now a Deputy U.S. Marshall. Whereas Barry Morse's portrayal of Gerard in the series was of a single minded almost business like attitude, Tommy Lee Joneses Gerard is also single minded but hardly business like.  He brings a whole new dimension to the role of the U.S. Marshall who has only one intention, to do his job no matter what, and bring his prey in anyway he can even if it's on a stretcher.  Tommy Lee Jones has played many interesting and complex characters, but when he is on the screen as Gerard, he commands the attention of not only his deputies, but the motion picture audience as well.Writers Jeb Stuart and David Twohy also prove it's possible to put entertaining and interesting dialog into a script along with action and suspense.  Just as there were numerous near captures by Gerard in the TV series, there are many here also.  By incorporating all the latest crime solving technology into their story, the writers are also able to add even more to the suspense as it makes it that much more difficult for Kimball to find his wife's killer while he continually evades capture. 
Director Davis and his writers use one more clever device that is perhaps what really makes this film work.  Through early events that happen in the film, it is perfectly clear that Gerard doesn't care whether or not Kimball killed his wife.  The only thing he cares about is recapturing Kimball and returning him to prison.  As Kimball begins to unravel the mystery of his wife's death, he leaves clues for Gerard as to what his intentions are.  As the film progresses, and although he would never admit to it, we see Gerard develop a vast curiosity about the Kimball case, enough so that he does begin to care.  Because of this, when the end of the film does come, it is that much more satisfying.All in all, this is not only the best action/suspense film of the nineties, it is easily one of the most entertaining films of that decade.  And when a film is that good, you have no choice but to give it my grade which is an A+.",The Fugitive

The twists and turns during the second half of the film add plenty of unpredictability that I was simply not expecting. Harrison Ford gives a solid performance here but Tommy Lee Jones is definitely the stand-out. Jones's charisma jumps off the screen in every scene he is in.

The more humanity, character depth, and intelligence a character shows through his dialog and actions, the better the movie, and this applies to all characters in the story, certainly all the main ones.""The Fugitive"" (1993) does this very well, better than any other famous action movie I ever saw.Another thing which makes ""The Fugitive"" (1993) a superior movie is the complete absence of four letter word expletives commonly heard in most other ""action movies"" (espcially Bruce Willis movies).

188,daviddaphneredding,intriguing movie all the way about trying to catch a slippery eel,10,4 August 2012,"""I DON'T CARE!"" ""Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimball. Go find him."" These lines of Tommy Lee Jones practically set the tone for the chase for the vascular surgeon who was accused of killing his wife in Chicago in this superior Warner Brothers production. The storyline, especially for me and others in my generation who watched the TV series by the same name in the 60's, is very familiar: Dr. Kimball is, to reiterate, falsely accused of killing his wife, though Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard very stubbornly refuses to believe it. An unfair judge at an unfair trial sentences Kimball to be killed, but on the way by bus to the place where the execution is to take place there is a wreck where, after an attempted killing on the bus, the bus gets swayed onto a railroad when a fast train plunges into the bus, (which is real in the movie), leaving Kimball to escape to run back to Chicago, and so he does. I was impressed with the acting. Tommy Lee Jones justly earned the Best Supporting Actor Award for 1993, and Harrison Ford aptly conveyed the fact that he was a bitter and upset man, knowing he was unjustly accused of murder and very angry that his wife was dead and he did not know who the real killer was. Sela Ward was very appealing as Kimball's wife Helen, and Jereon Krabbe portrayed well the two-faced, crooked physician. The setting was and was not drawing: the Carolina woods made a beautiful part of nature, but some of the parts of Chicago were dismal at best. I was glued to the movie because of the story itself and the concomitant excitement. My late Mother, who was in her late 70's when she watched the DVD of it with me one night, like it as well, and she was very picky. Arnold Kopelson was a capable producer, and Andrew Davis was a skillful director, and I was especially impressed with the music of James Newton Howard.

189,Mickey-2,"A murder is committed, an innocent husband convicted, an escape happens, and the chase for ""The Fugitive"" is on.",9,7 February 2004,"This movie version, based on the television series of the same title, hits on all cylinders that can make a movie great.  There's action aplenty, astonishing escapes by the fugitive, played by Harrison Ford, near-misses by the pursuing US Marshall, played by Tommy Lee Jones, fantastic stunts on screen, and suspense that holds the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. This is a definite film to grace a collection of any home viewer.If one recalls, the TV series had a doctor wrongly convicted of the crime of murdering his wife, when the real killer was an one-armed man.  Dr. Kimble escaped from his prison lock-up, then spent several tv seasons hunting for the guilty killer, and at the same time, trying to avoid being recaptured by a Lt. Gerard.  The movie makes use of the basic program, but then alters the escape of Dr. Kimble, limits the locality to Chicago, and introduces a drug-related scheme that Kimble stumbled onto, and would have prevented a medical company from reaping millions of dollars in the drug's sale.The viewer is asked to follow ""The Fugitive"" as he stays just one jump, literally, ahead of the law.  There's a very realistic train wreck staged, which helps spring the good doctor, a leap down a waterfall, which keeps him out of the clutches of the US Marshal Gerard, and many more realistic stunts.  Catch this film, on tape, or DVD.  9/10",The Fugitive
190,knucklebreather,Another triumphant 90s thriller,8,3 April 2010,"""The Fugitive"" is, for most of the movie, a simple enough story: all the evidence says Dr. Richard Kimble killed his wife, except there was no particular motive (why would a wealthy man kill his wife for money?) and everyone who knows him thinks he's one of the finest human beings around. To prove his innocence, he has to escape from prison and, despite being the subject of a massive manhunt by the tenacious but ultimately fair and just Deputy Gerard, single-handedly prove his innocence by tracking down his wife's real killer. Ultimately he just gets some medical records and makes some phone calls, which apparently he couldn't hire a private detective to do before the trial despite being rich, but hey, the beauty of the movie is you probably won't even notice or care.The movie is paced brilliantly, and if you read about the production of this movie, the director and key actors were given a great deal of freedom to write scenes on the fly, famously shooting the parade sequence with real parade participants who didn't even know they were going to be in a movie (neither did the director until the day of the shoot - they got permission to film the parade that very day). Then, after a great deal of footage was shot, thousands of edits were made, cutting entire subplots if that's what it took, and the end result was a fine-tuned movie with pacing that, for much of the movie, is almost irresistibly riveting.The movie is known for its iconic action scenes - there is of course a real train derailment captured on film and Harrison Ford jumps hundreds of feet off a dam. Many movies in the 90s has these, but what makes the Fugative work so well is that you can actually enjoy the non-action elements of the film too. Tommy Lee Jones and his crew are consistently funny and entertaining while still seeming believable as they track down Kimble. Kimble wows the audience with his brilliant moves at every step (although one wonders why he didn't think of any of this stuff *before* the trial... grumble grumble) and of course, the audience can't help be sympathetic to him as he has the compassion to save lives despite being one wrong move away from arrest and a death sentence for the entire movie.If the movie has one weak point, it has to be the way it wraps up the story, which involves an overly convoluted conspiracy that comes out of left field. It's not exactly bad, but after every single detail in the first two thirds of the movie was absolutely perfect, the unwieldy explanation of why Kimble was framed seems a bit disappointing. Perhaps any explanation would have had this problem, though, because it's trying to provide a logical explanation for what was basically a fantasy sequence of events, so whatever you come up with is going to be a let-down.Ultimately, this is a wonderful movie with two nit-picky flaws that shouldn't ruin the movie for anyone. It's one of the best thrillers of the 90s because it remembers that it's not all about the action scenes - it has pacing and it has characters you actually care about. It's a great package.",The Fugitive

Harrison Ford in his leading man prime plays a doctor who is framed for his wife's murder and goes on the run to prove his innocence while being pursued by a relentless U.S marshall played by Tommy Lee Jones.
It's just over 2 hours long but it doesn't feel like a long movie because not a single scene is wasted, there's always something happening and the plot moves forward at a break neck pace. The characters feel like real people in the way they act and speak and nothing is over exaggerated which is something i love about these kinds of movies. There's some really great stunt work especially during the famous dam scene and the train crash where i'm not sure if it was an optical effect or a stunt man risking his life for the shot.

193,fleagles,A Perfect Thriller,10,17 May 2000,"One of the greatest thrillers of all time, The Fugitive is a textbook example of a thriller that keeps its audience glued without insulting their intelligence. Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a Chicago surgeon, is wrongly convicted of killing his wife (Sela Ward), escapes from prison and heads back to his hometown in search of the real killer, a mysterious one-armed man that Kimble struggled with in his house after his wife's murder. U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his Oscar-winning role) and his deputies relentlessly pursue Kimble in and around Chicago, always staying a few steps behind. This movie works on so many levels, but it begins with the actors. Harrison Ford, is one of his best roles, perfectly portrays the dignity and righteous indignation that Kimble feels. He should have received an Oscar nomination for the sheer physical and emotional effort that he put into this character. Jones is a perfect choice for Gerard: He is relentless, shrewd and sarcastic in his quest to track down Kimble. He always projects a smarmy, superior quality that attracts the viewer, yet makes us want him to lose his prey. The terrific supporting cast includes Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, Daniel Roebuck, and Jeroen Krabbe. Director Andrew Davis takes the audience along for the chase, and uses Chicago as his landscape, including a busy St. Patrick's Day Parade for one scene. These locations enhance the film by using the city as a maze through which this chase occurs. Another terrific feature is James Newton Howard's score, which manages to add color and tension to scenes, even when there is no dialogue.

That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them.Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role.The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film.As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals.I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever.

203,movieman9,One of the best action movies of the decade; Ford and Jones are in top form.,10,26 June 1999,"Nothing is more thrilling to see than two characters with superior intelligences, pitting their wits against each other. A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. For these reasons, ""The Fugitive"" is a huge blessing for a movie critic such as I. I was just thrilled by the excitement, the performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and the whole Hitchcockian aura that this sensational film delivered. Even though we have been seeing too many films based on television series come out lately, ""The Fugitive"" is certainly not one of those that we can add to that routine bushel.Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by Lt. Gerard (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious ""one-armed man."" As I have stated, this is a simple plot that requires no superficial decoration.Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character. Jones, who has never really been considered a headliner until now, creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent. His only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin.I have not previously been a fan of the director Andrew Davis's work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked my interest. With such films as ""Under Siege,"" ""Code of Silence,"" and ""Above the Law,"" he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris). Here, he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot). With quick pacing, a never-a-dull-moment storyline, and great actors, ""The Fugitive"" ranks itself as one of the best action films of this decade, and definitely one of the best films of 1993. Rating: Four stars.",The Fugitive

Great directing from Andrew Davis, great writing, great filming,great acting from all the actors from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones down to the sidekicks L. Scott Caldwell and Daniel Roebuck.  I guess one thing I can say about it is that a friend of mine in high school and I disagreed over whether Harrison Ford was nominated for an oscar or not.  I said he wasn't but that he definitely deserved it.   Very true.",The Fugitive
205,Sharkey360,Great to watch!,10,25 September 1999,"The Fugitive is simply a modern classic in movies. Harrison Ford makes a great fugitive, Tommy Lee Jones makes a great supporting role with the now ""legendary"" Samuel Gerard, and Andrew Davis' directing is great and deserving of an Oscar nomination for Best Director. The story is very well told along with some puzzling portions to make you think well in figuring out what's going on.While The Fugitive is great, the inspiration of this film is of great magnitude. To confirm that, check both The Fugitive and U.S. Marshalls together. You'll notice that the sequel has many ""clone moments"" derived from The Fugitive.

208,orourkec-292-269155,Richly entertaining.,7,18 May 2015,"The good things about The Fugitive, first of all, are its leading actors. I liked both Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford in this movie. Not only did I think they played well, but I also thought that they were well matched together in this movie and that they had smart chemistry. The use of settings is another admirable thing in the movie, and that includes the sewers and the St. Patrick Parade. When my mind connects sewers and St. Patrick Parade to the plot of an innocent fugitive being tracked down by the authorities, I'm thinking ""Nothing better. I like it. I truly do. I think it matches the plot in a smart way."". Talking about sewers, Harrison Ford's character's daring jump into the water from out of the sewers at a formidable height, I thought was one hell of a masterful scene act and a scene act worth remembering for decades to come. It's without any doubt the absolute best scene act I've ever seen in movies in my life, and the best scene act of the entire film. However, what I liked the most about this film is its pacing. The pacing in The Fugitive is superb and a pure master's work. Furthermore, I thought that the movie had nice charm, a nicely developed story, enough drama and tension, a few good surprises and a flawless scenes structure. Short reflection on The Fugitive: what an enjoyable and impactive ride. The Fugitive is the kind of film that leaves you wowed after you finish watching it. I'm glad to have watched this movie, and I worship it. Because of all the good things I said about the film, for me The Fugitive deserves to stand as a classic.

210,roger-pettit1,A very good thriller with an excellent performance from both leading actors,8,4 July 2012,"I take it all back! I used to think of Harrison Ford as one of the most overrated Hollywood actors of recent years (and Nicolas Cage as another). I continue to subscribe to my view of the latter. But, in the light of his excellent performance in this slick, entertaining and tense thriller, I think I may have to amend my judgement of Ford. His performance is a masterclass of controlled, understated and believable acting and contributes hugely to one's enjoyment of what is an intelligent and gripping film. Ford plays Dr Richard Kimble, an eminent vascular surgeon in Chicago, who, having been wrongly convicted of his wife's murder, escapes police custody on his way to prison (where he will face the death penalty) and goes on the run in a desperate attempt to track down the real culprit. His escape is facilitated by a spectacular collision between the bus in which he is being transported to jail and a train. In the immediate aftermath of that incident, Kimble manages to escape the clutches of the security officers who are responsible for his transfer. While on the run, he is tenaciously pursued by wisecracking Marshal Sam Gerard (played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones). The film, which is loosely based on a TV series of the same name that was made in the 1960s, features the cat and mouse chase between Kimble and Gerard and the former's quest to overturn the miscarriage of justice of which he is a victim.""The Fugitive"" is essentially a chase movie. But it is a rather better one than many films of its kind. The acting, direction, dialogue and glossy cinematography are all first class. The train and bus collision that allows Kimble to make his getaway is brilliantly and spectacularly depicted. And a scene in which he dives into a waterfall is also wonderfully filmed. I do, however, have some reservations about the movie. In particular, certain elements of the plot strain credulity. The ease with which Kimble is seemingly able to enter and wander around hospital buildings unchallenged is, frankly, incredible. That goes especially for one such incident in which he is mistakenly regarded by a medic as a hospital porter and is asked to transport a young patient to the operating theatre. En route, and after a brief chat with the patient about his medical history, Kimble makes use of his knowledge and expertise and amends the patient's medical notes and the written details of the treatment recommended for him. By doing so, he saves the patient's life! The way in which Kimble manages to evade Gerard by making a giant leap into the gurgling waterfall of a massive dam and emerge mentally and physically unscathed, with the contents of a wallet in a pocket of his trousers undamaged, frankly beggars belief. There are one or two other scenes that do not ring true for the same reason. There are also some minor continuity errors. But the film somehow gets away with these mistakes, primarily because there is far more that is right about it than is wrong. ""The Fugitive"" is an energetic, intelligent and entertaining film that is well worth watching. 8/10.",The Fugitive

Tommy lee jones won the oscar for best supporting actor for this movie and Harrison ford plays the man who is on the run and pleaded innocent for the killing of his wife, Helen Kimble.

Harrison Ford was, as usual, great. Tommy Lee Jones, who won the Academy Award for Supporting Actor was at his very best and may well be known for his role here, as the unrelenting US Marshall that chases Ford throughout the movie, when he is long gone. The pacing of this movie is excellent and is never boring or dull. There is not one scene where the viewers gets bored. Some of the most intense scenes in movie history are the bus crash scene and the jumping down the waterfall scene. I don't remember seeing this in the theater but if I did, it makes it that much better. AFI named the movie a top 100 Thrillers in movie history, I don't know where it landed exactly but it was a real gem. One of the best movies of 1993.",The Fugitive
213,sugar_daddyo,"Excellent, but ending unrealistic",7,26 April 2007,"I was a young man in college when this movie came out and Harrison Ford's acting was so forceful that I briefly considered becoming a vascular surgeon! From the beginning this movie keeps you involved. The train wreck on the silver screen felt like you were there, no surprise since the director derailed an actual train for the footage (I have seen the wreckage myself in S.C.).The only complaint I have is the end when Dr. Nichols, a highly regarded doctor despite his under-handed dealings with the drug company, suddenly transforms quite unexpectedly into the prototypical, dastardly villain bent on killing Harrison Ford's character even if it means taking out a few marshals in the process. I don't recall the absurdity of the end in the theater, but subsequent airings on TV have made it more than apparent that the studio was in a hurry to wrap up the filming versus a more thoughtful and dramatic ending.At any rate, having lived in Chicago the past couple of years, it has also been fun recognizing the filming locations.",The Fugitive

The number of explosions, deaths and stunts is actually quite small, although the legendary train wreck still holds up as a remarkable action set piece. What creates the majority of the film's tension are the remarkable performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford; the one generating such an incandescent intensity he appears as an inescapable Nemesis, the other showing more in one look of his tortured eyes than a page of dialogue could convey. The script is almost air-tight. There are so few plot holes that when they do appear they seem out of place. The cinematopgraphy is as naturalistic as possible, creating a sense of realism that most thrillers eschew in favour of slick fantasy. The music, by the gifted composer Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Six Feet Under) is quite possibly the best action film score ever. The editing, particularly in the beginning, is beyond belief. All in all, a near perfect film.",The Fugitive
216,Freddy_Levit,Simply the Best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Brilliant!!!!! 10/10,10,31 July 2002,"One of Harrison Ford's most magnificant, significant and most highly acclaimed performances of his career. The Fugitive explores the themes of Justice and Betrayal from a murder case. Harrison Ford plays as Dr. Richard Kimble, a highly respected doctor in Chicago. He has all that he wants; a wife and a succesful promising career. But one night his life turned around. There is someone in his house.........his wife is dead. Now he must run for his life to find the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. With a whole police force behind his back, he will not give up until he finds the man who killed his wife. Co-starring Tommy Lee Jones, this movie is one of the best thrillers out there. It makes us think hard on the themes portrayed in the movie and reminds us that Justice is not always achieved in our world.

217,hfhfdfse,One of the bleakest movies,3,4 April 2005,"Why do people love this movie? Lots of my friends keep on saying that The Fugitive is ""so cool"", none of them being able to provide a clear explanation of what this ""so cool"" means. First, the story of a respectable doctor-turned-wrongly accused fugitive is not convincing at all. The character portrayed by exceptionally gifted Harrison Ford manages to hide from police, forge ID papers and lead an alternative crime investigation of his own tracking down real murderer unbelievably easy. How and where could this upper-class, a pillar of a community surgeon have learned all these tricks? Did he take a course in surviving skills? Second, Tommy Lee Jones plays a hard-boiled gun-waving cop, nothing special, a stereotyped character seen so many times before. Some lines, some chases. And he got an Oscar for the Best Performance in Supporting Rol;e..Oops The plot develops slowly, dragging to the happy end we are sure must be. And last but not least, the court room scene when the prosecutor uses the answering machine tape with the last words of the main character's wife as the key evidence to prove that the defendant is guilty is so soap operish. It just makes me laugh.",The Fugitive
218,iron t,**1/2 stars,5,19 May 1999,"It has a good beginning and ending, but the middle of this flick drags on for too long with too many near misses between Jones and Ford. Jones isn't a good villain, because he isn't evil or intimidating, just annoying. I kept hoping Rybeck would show up from UNDER SIEGE to stick a knife in Jones' cranium again so I wouldn't have to listen to any more of his ranting and raving. Plus I don't like action films where the screenwriters go out of their way to make a more three dimensional, ""realistic"" action hero, but have him do things that make some of Bond or Rambo's heroics look plausible.

The music is classy and fits in any modern detective movie. It has many great punch- lines. I loved the U.S. Marshals too. They were ever-ready and completely active. Harrison Ford was great. He is a smart fugitive who is convicted of killing his own wife and he is innocent. His efforts to prove his innocence was quite smart and that's the most entertaining part. But, in my opinion, Tommy Lee Jones was the best. He acted very well as a bad ass U.S.Marshal who will stop at nothing. His role in this movie is one of my all time favorites.

The surprise comes when the real murderer is actually his good friend. When Samuel (Jones) realizes the police is chasing the wrong man, he quits being the 'bad' guy and pretty much teams up with Ford in the end to catch the real culprit.The director wins my praise by not wasting time on long and meaningless dialog unrelated to the story, but rather lets the action to speak for itself from the desperate measures a man can go to clear his name.

So many of the old TV shows re-done these days on the big screen are backward and silly, precisely because they were never intended to be two-hour movies, just laugh-tracked escapist fare for a more innocent time. The Fugitive on the other hand, is a silly old TV premise, that works great in the form of a movie. So, having taken an old show with some real promise, the film makers then managed to surprise us all by really delivering where it counted. From the jarring, disjointed opening sequence, to the white-knuckle chase scenes, the Fugitive is never boring. And even better than that, they came up with the brilliant idea of making the crew of U.S. Marshals to be the most engaging, entertaining part of it all.

Everything, from needed clothing just being available at the right time and place to be of use to Kimble, to a subway car stopping short in an emergency, but with its door just happening to be in position to allow access to the station platform, almost laughably discredit any link to reality the movie may lay claim to.

He never overplays and has just the right amount of quietness and anxiousness throughout. Tommy Lee Jones is superb in the brash and grimly amusing Gerard.The Fugitive is also something of a movie to learn some aspects of filmaking by, in the way the story is revealed.

He accuses Charles of secretly falsifying research in order to capture medical investor funds from the release of a new drug wrongfully proved 100% safe and effective with no side effects.Dr. Nichols is first seen at the initial fundraiser when he returned keys from a car loaned to him by Richard. These same keys were used in the home invasion later that night. Dr. Nichols is thrown from his address and meets Richard in a hotel antechamber where they engage in a violent dance of death that takes them into the inner recesses of the grand hotel followed by police. Charles echoes ""You never give up, do you Richard?""Richard has gained in his quest and is able to outsmart Charles who closes the gap on Richard. Charles is clubbed and defeated before he guns down the Deputy US Marshall and Richard is able to grab badly needed credibility before the law.Resourceful, noteworthy and polished performances, including the tender-loving Dr. Charles Nichols. The Fugitive offers consistent dramatic shock value inside of 130 minutes.",The Fugitive
238,Guido-12,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,5 September 1998,"This 1993 recreation of the famous 60's tv show is without doubt one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite.

(yes, it is even better than Schindler's List) It is also one of top 50 favorites of all time. Harrison Ford, and Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones add so much excitement and suspense to the screen that the film never becomes tedious or boring. This clever game of cat and mouse is one of the 10 best films of the decade. In fact, it is so good that you'll almost forget that the film was based on the popular 1960's TV show. This is certainly one of Harrison Ford's finest pictures, right up there with the Star Wars, and Indiana Jones' films. A must see 5-star film.",The Fugitive

Tommy Lee Jones won an Oscar for this, but Ford could have won just as well.Ford plays a doctor, an innocent man sentenced to death, for murdering his wife. His character while not an action hero, is obviously smart, and that's masterfully written into the script in several nail-biters, where he is able to use his fast thinking and knowledge of the hospital world. Jones is the federal agent, trying to catch him.The suspense never lets go. This is among the greatest, up there with classics like Rear Window and Vertigo. I wish they'd still make movies like this.There's basically two implausible moments, one, no woman would offer him a ride in night-time Chicago lol. Two, the dam jump would have been lethal.",The Fugitive

243,rbrooksie12,Brooks--The Fugitive Review,9,11 August 2014,"The Fugitive is a great movie based on the 1960s television series of the same name. The performances of both Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Girard and Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble are great, but it is Jones who gives the best performance. He well-deservingly won the Best Supporting Actor for 1993 in the Academy Awards that year.Dr. Richard Kimble is wrongly accused of murdering his wife. He is sent to jail, but when a security guard is stabbed and another one is unconscious, Kimble uses that chance to run away from the law. The great thing about this is that Kimble is not running away to be free, but he is running away to solve the crime. Tommy Lee Jones plays Deputy Samuel Girard who is trying to track down Kimble. He has one run-in with Kimble, but Kimble gets away.The movie is great, and in my opinion it is one of the best films of 1993. There are however a few things about this film which are ridiculous. First, when Kimble is driving the ambulance and Girard and his men are going after him and they trap him in a tunnel. Despite at least ten marshals going after Kimble, he manages to crawl into the sewer without one of them seeing him. Also, when Kimble is in the sewer and Girard and his men are going after him in the sewer and Girard finds him and has him trapped and Kimble jumps approximately 100 feet off of a dam and survives. I mean come on can this really happen? Also, when Kimble is walking up the street and a woman stops next to him and asks him if he wants a ride. Would you go up to a stranger and ask for a ride? These things are minor things and would not affect your viewing on the film, but these are things that you stop and ask yourself can this really happen? This is a great movie and if you have never seen this movie and are fans of Ford and Jones or action films I encourage you to check out.",The Fugitive
244,the_barnacle,The only thing I want to ask for is Moore...,8,8 October 2019,"...but I think cutting out a possible romance between Harrison Ford and Julianne Moore was the right decision as that would have made Kimble's love for his dead wife inauthentic. However, putting Julianne Moore as the fourth credited cast member for a five minute scene is utterly insane!My good friend commented: ""The Fugitive is what Fast and Furious should have been.' I believe he is right in that the narrative development is logical, being sensible with an element of ridiculousness, which makes the film entertaining without it being totally laughable (unlike what could be said about the 'ride or die' franchise). The lightness of the cheesy quotes and the impossibility of Kimble surviving in certain situations match well with the more puzzling and unexpected methods he employs when solving his wife's murder.But most important of all: Michael Bay would be envious of that train crash!PS: Say what you want about this review: ""I don't care!""",The Fugitive

247,tsd333,It doesn't come much better than this,9,24 January 2011,"The Fugitive (1993) 9 User reviews are instructive in their often uniform dissection of what makes this such a fine movie drama. That, and IMDb contributors' high level of excitement and firm conviction of The Fugitive as being in the top 100 movies. It all adds up to rare praise. This reviewer thoroughly agrees. Director Andrew Davis must take much of the credit, because even though by now most audiences are familiar with the basic plot, the movie loses nothing when seen again. It is intelligent. The action scenes are spectacular yet believable, the pace constant and even. Harrison Ford, he of the permanent expression of dismay, is ideal as Dr Richard Kimble, convicted of murdering his beautiful wife for the insurance money. His defense team wasn't up to much: Richard is slated for a lethal injection, but fate frees him and he winds up on the run. This is enough to draw Marshal Samuel Gerard into the equation, in the person of Tommy Lee Jones. He has a blank expression akin to ""you don't say?"", and we see it lots as doctor and cop try to out-think each other. The doctor must avoid capture long enough to prove his innocence. The marshal, an assertive hunter, just wants to bring his quarry in. In the process, the audience is swept away with these two, and no wonder. It's not a matter of picking sides. Both men are smart and well-intentioned. Sit back and enjoy the magic.",The Fugitive
248,MilB12,One of the BEST movies of the 90's,10,17 February 2004,"Rarely do we see a classic TV series brought to life so well on the big screen.  Even though McHales Navy, The Brady Bunch, and Lost In Space were not very good shows, the film adaptations of them were even worse.  The Fugitive was a very good TV show, full of great plot, drama, and suspense, but the film version is even better.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, need I say more?  These two actors brought more intensity, feeling, and flat out great acting to The Fugitive than no other two actors could have hoped to.  The plot of the film is fantastic:  A doctor (Harrison Ford) is framed for the murder of his wife and sentenced to death, he escapes during a train wreck and is pursued by an obsessed U.S. Marshall (Tommy Lee Jones) as the good doctor works to prove that the one armed man, and not himself, is guilty of his wifes murder.
While Harrison Ford is great, and very believable, Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as the man who will stop at nothing to catch Dr. Richard Kimball. You can feel the fear of Dr. Kimball as he runs for his life, and fears capture every day, as do you feel the need for the U.S. Marshalls to catch this man.  The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford in the scenes that they do share could never be re-created.  The suspense is very intense.  I would rate this film as one of the 10 best films of all time, it unfolds before you so beautifully, and the ending is excellent.  If you've never seen it, then you should steal a car, go rent it, then blame it on the one-armed man.",The Fugitive
249,dmackiepi,Tommy Lee Jones talks too fast.,7,16 March 2019,"As a retired peace officer I worked on a crime impact team for three and a half years. Everything Tommy Lee Jones says he's always dictating for someone else to do. In real police work Detectives do their own legwork. I know this is a movie but they need to start making this a little more realistic. During the court scene where Kimball is sentence to death row, in real life this trial would have taken years to go to trial. Not to mention the defendant is a vascular surgeon and has plenty of money for an excellent team of attorneys to defend him. Of course the defendant's fingerprints are going to be all over the gun and they say the bullets. I have never seen or lifted any prints off of bullets in my life. Of course this is 1993 and DNA was in an early infancy stages. The movie does an excellent job in regards to Fantasy entertainment. However most of it is extremely far-fetched. I gave the fugitive a 7 just for entertainment. I did watch the series also entitled The Fugitive which was made back in the 1950s.
I believe the series ran over 6 years and got extremely boring because Kimball was nearly caught on every episode and just narrowly escaped. I got tired of seeing him carrying his little bag with him while he was either hitchhiking or riding a bus. Avoiding law enforcement continuously. Tommy Lee Jones did win an Academy Award for his role as the supervisor Marshall however I believe there were better people that could have played the role far more believable than he did.",The Fugitive

251,karlito5,Great film with a powerful message.,9,1 March 2007,"The Fugitive has very simple plot which can be summed up in a few lines: a woman is murdered her, husband is - wrongly - convicted of her murder and sentenced to death, he then escapes and attempts to prove his innocence whilst being pursued by a relentless US Marshall who will stop at nothing to get his man. That man is Dr Richard Kimble who is played brilliantly by Harrison Ford, in his best performance after Indiana Jones.Ford is very convincing as the man on the run - in my opinion he gets the nervousness, of a man constantly looking over his shoulder, spot on. Meanwhile Tommy Lee Jones is highly entertaining as the US Marshall Samuel Gerrard he refuses to give in until he has Kimble - dead or alive. Jeroen Krabbe meanwhile is quite menacing and very slippery as Doctor Charles Nichols, his financial motive contrasts nicely with the Chicago Police Department's belief that Kimble killed his wife for the money, even if it is a little unconvincing that a Doctor (who is ""already rich"") would go such extraordinary lengths - that of faking the results of a drugs trial and murder - simply for financial gain.The Fugitive is great entertainment with a fast paced plot that keeps you interested with just the right amount of twists and turns which are placed evenly through the film. The action meanwhile is fantastically over the top - the train crash and the dam scene are classic moments in cinema history, they are all the more entertaining for the fact that Kimble is clearly no action man and (like Indiana Jones) is not quite up to the job of evading Samuel Gerrard and the scheming of Nichols.Lastly it is worth noting that The Fugitive quite subtly points out the insanity of the death penalty - which in fact makes the film all the more uplifting for a Brit like me.",The Fugitive

257,falcon135,"One of the best thrillers, the chase is suspenseful throughout",8,17 January 2005,"The fugitive, in a nutshell is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The pace never lets up, and the best touch is that the director uses brain action to drive the plot instead of violent action, which lets us identify with the characters. And what brilliantly constructed characters! First there's Dr. Richard Kimble(well played by Harrison ford), falsely accused of murdering his wife and on the run after a brutal bus wreck. We start to identify with him as well as root for him as he searches for his wife's killer. And then there's United States Marshall Sam Gerard(in Tommy Lee Jone's academy award winning role) who attempts to hunts Kimble down. The interesting thing about Gerard is that we begin to root for him too, seeing his tough,relentless character at work.There are moments in this film when Jone's is so unbelievable you heart skips a beat,yet Ford nor Jones take the spotlight. The lead is shared. In the few scenes they have together the interplay is near perfect. The murder and the conviction take place very quickly at the beginning allowing for the rest of the story to evolve over a longer time.This is well done, though it leaves us wondering why Kimble was sentenced to death on such circumstantial evidence. Hats off to the support cast! Joe pantoliano and Julianne Moore both turn in excellent performances. The one problem I have with this film is that the Dam scene is overrated. The previous scene in the tunnel was exceptional yet the stunt in question happened too fast and is undeserving of it's fame. The best scene in the film is when Kimble struggles to get through the electronic door at the prison as Gerard thunders after him. In say, James Bond films you hold your breath while the hero is in danger and let it go when he escapes. In this film you hold your breath for the full two hours until the final shot when you'll let it go. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys films and if you haven't already seen it go to the video store and rent a copy of this definitive classic.",The Fugitive

It's just one of those things that make it a great movie that you may not even notice.

266,Mariano_Anderson,Good film update of old series,6,25 September 2008,"Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) and his wife, Helen (Sela Ward) seem to have it all, until she is murdered. The police believe that Richard killed her, and there is enough evidence to convict him, and a serious miscarriage of justice results in Richard being on a train on his way to prison. But, there is a train accident, Richard escapes, and he goes on a quest for his wife's true killer, while trying to keep one step ahead of the police, led by Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). The television series from the 1960's, where David Janssen had the role of Dr. Kimble, was an ongoing drama, where Dr. Kimble sought the one-armed killer of his wife while trying to figure out why she was killed, and while keeping ahead of the police and helping people along the way. My father was a fan of David Janssen and of the original series, and was not thrilled with this movie. He went into it with the idea: How can they condense an entire series into one movie? I did not watch the series as a small child, and I really liked this film, with a few reservations. By the way, the television series finale for ""The Fugitive"" was one of the most-watched episodes in television history. Why did I like this film? First of all, while the story is not that complex, it is a riveting tale that the film tells quite well. There are even hints that the police knew, all along, that Dr. Kimble might not be guilty. Secondly, there is a lot of action to blend in with the well-told story, and some excellent cinematography (for which Michael Chapman was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award) really enhances the suspense factor. The main reason that I liked this film, though, was the Oscar-winning performance of Tommy Lee Jones. He could have portrayed Marshal Sam Gerard in several ways, but chose the best way, giving us a Gerard who was intelligent, dogged in his pursuit of Kimble, honorable, and dedicated to doing his job to the best of his ability. Harrison Ford was the wrongly-accused Good Guy, but Tommy Lee Jones was not the Bad Guy. He was a Good Guy who just happened to be wrong. Tommy Lee Jones is a very intense actor, and that fit this role perfectly. Even as he (and Don Cheadle) rescued ""Volcano"" from an absurd premise, Jones manages to outshine Harrison Ford here. Ah, that brings me to my one reservation about this film: Harrison Ford. I want to quickly say that Mr. Ford did a good job in portraying Dr. Richard Kimble. But, that role in this movie had the potential to be an Academy-Award winning performance, but Harrison Ford did not give us that. What we saw was, instead, a well-executed portrayal of a well-known character, with no stamp of individualism on it. If you asked me to name Harrison Ford movies, I would likely forget this one, as it just as well could have been several other actors, (e.g., Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson). Whereas Tommy Lee Jones gave us an A+ performance, Harrison Ford probably earned a respectable but unspectacular A- or B+. That's not bad, but it could've been better. Well, now that I've finished my little rant, which will likely tick some people off, I will conclude by saying that this is a very good action-suspense film with good cinematography and a wonderful performance by Tommy Lee Jones, and it is a very enjoyable viewing experience.",The Fugitive

Ford plays the wrongfully accused doctor that after escaping from his prison transport becomes a fugitive. Jones puts in an Oscar winning performance as the US Marshal that goes after him.The chemistry between the Ford/Jones duo is a pleasure to watch.

272,thomas458-1,Pretty good - but a little drawn out.,6,10 August 2009,"This movie is the typical plot of a man who is innocent and is then wrongfully charged with murder. Harrison Ford plays this man - a doctor, who supposedly kills his wife. Right away the movie sets it up where you really care for Ford.. and you want his justice served. The cops are of course dumber than dumb - Ford just shaves his beard - and dyes his hair.. and can walk around conducting his own investigation. While the movie is well done given the above scenario, there came a point where I thought: ""OMG"" how much longer can this plot line be played out? We all know what is going to happen in the end anyways! It seem to me that better editing (shortening) would have made this movie much better. As it is, it takes too long to wrap up.

273,CerebralInTheCity,A well done thriller,8,10 January 2010,"I saw THE FUGITIVE on cable. I really enjoyed it. It is a winning story, based on an old TV series. The characters were created by Roy Huggins. The story, written by David Twohy, and the screenplay written by Twohy and Jeb Stuart, created many highs and lows, and kept it suspenseful all the way through. It is about a doctor's wife that is murdered. The murderer gets away and the doctor is convicted of the crime. The doctor escapes from going to prison and tries to find the real killer, while a persistent U.S. marshal is on his tail.The direction by Andrew Davis was superb, mixing a human drama within a thriller with lots of action sequences.This movie worked very well as a movie. The story and the script seemed very crafty.

The dialogue was nothing spectacular, but not notably bad, like many action movie recently. However, the major letdown was the casting. Don't get me wrong, Harrison Ford is a fine actor, but he is not completely versatile and I didn't feel this role was entirely suited for him. Tommy Lee Jones is worse, and I don't believe he's that good of an actor to begin with. And in some parts of this movie he seriously reminds me of Mugatu in Zoolander. There are some actors like Gary Oldman and Johnny Depp who can play practically anyone, unfortunately Tommy Lee Jones is not one of them. This would be a practically flawless movie if Johnny Depp and Gary Oldman played the leads. Hmm.",The Fugitive
275,somegravity,A well-written adaptation and film,9,12 July 2007,"Truth be told,the job of a vascular surgeon is not the most pleasant job that there is to be found out there. But,for vascular surgeon Richard Kimble(Harrison Ford),life could be better. This is due to Richard Kimble being a rich,successful,and respected vascular surgeon. On top of that,Richard Kimble has a beautiful wife with whom he has a loving relationship with,Helen (Sela Ward). This has made Richard Kimble's life perfect,and given Kimble what most people dream for/of.But,one night,everything perfect and wonderful in the life of Richard Kimble suddenly comes to an end. This is when Richard Kimble comes home,only to discover that his beloved Helen is being murdered by a man with a prosthetic arm. And then,before Richard Kimble knows it,he is falsely convicted for the murder of his wife. The result? Kimble being sentenced to Death Row.However,one night,a stroke of ""fate"" steps in for Richard Kimble. This stroke of ""fate"" allows Richard Kimble to escape imprisonment,and allows Kimble to return to Chicago(his hometown)to solve the murder of his wife. Richard Kimble has several loyal,trusted and respected friends/colleagues. Because of this,Kimble has a very strong chance at solving the murder of his wife,and bringing the people who are responsible for it to justice. But,the Chicago Police and the United States Marshals have a tight watch over Richard Kimble. This complicates Kimble trying to solve the murder of his wife and bringing the people who are responsible for it to justice. On top of that? The man leading the case against Richard Kimble is Samuel Gerard(Tommy Lee Jones),a United States Marshal who's determination and obsession in finding Richard Kimble is aided by his intelligence.The only things that will tell who is able to win the whole ""case"" between Richard Kimble and his friends/colleagues and Samuel Gerard and his team of United States Marshals,alongside the Chicago Police Department? Time,decisions,and intelligence.The script for ""The Fugitive"" is a bit unarranged,and could have been easily fixed by director Andrew Davis before its release. But,other than that,""The Fugitive"" is a well-written film and adaptation. Based off of a 1960's television series created by the late Roy Huggins (RIP),""The Fugitive"" succeeds in taking the television show that it based off of,and keeping several elements of the show,remaining true and original without recycling the show. There are a lot of original elements to ""The Fugitive"",which helps it out a lot,at the same time. And,despite the fact that the script for ""The Fugitive"" happens to be a bit unarranged,it does a good job at documenting Richard Kimble trying to solve the murder of his wife,and the case being lead against Kimble. The way that everything leads up to another is perfectly arranged. At the same time,""The Fugitive"" successfully takes crime drama,action,and plenty of chemistry,alongside a small amount of humor,and blending it all together in one.There are also a lot of strong performances that are to be found in ""The Fugitive"". In Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble,Ford turns in a richly executed performance. This is by Harrison Ford understanding how his character of Richard Kimble is feeling,and bringing Kimble's feelings to life. The beauty of it? Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble does not find Ford portraying Kimble as a big,tough guy who's enemies better look out for themselves. Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble paints a picture of Kimble as a smart and laid-back man,who is just trying to solve his wife's murder and bring the people responsible for it to justice. What makes this performance tick is viewers seeing that Richard Kimble is no tough guy whatsoever--letting the plot and script have an interesting and creative ""twist"" to them. In Tommy Lee Jones's performances as Samuel Gerard,Jones understands how Gerard feels about the case of Richard Kimble,and Gerard's determination and obsession to find Kimble,alongside the intelligence of Gerard. This keeps ""The Fugitive"" moving along well at a well-structured and constructed pace. It helps viewers of ""The Fugitive"" clearly know and understand the two sides of the story. Anytime a scene in ""The Fugitive"" calls for humor out of Tommy Lee Jones' performance of Samuel Gerard,Jones takes the humor and brings it to life,allowing the humor to be worthwhile and viewers of ""The Fugitive"" have a few laughs. All of these elements all work not only being blended together,but also for the scenes in this film that feature both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones and the scenes with action (the action here is well-mixed in with the script;it is fitting and suitable,but does not push itself a mile to being an action film,on behalf of the way it is arranged in the script for ""The Fugitive"" and the performances in the scene with the action).It is also worth noting that even though you will only find Sela Ward through a small half of ""The Fugitive"",Ward's performance as Helen Kimble is one of the film's highlights. Why? In Sela Ward's performance as Helen Kimble,Ward puts a good amount of compassion into her scenes,and even though very little,emotion when it is called for (You'll know what I mean.....). Sela Ward's performance of Helen Kimble contribute to ""The Fugitive"" being as good and successful as it turned out to be. It also succeeds in allowing viewers of ""The Fugitive"" know how Richard Kimble feels as they watch Richard solve Helen's murder. All of this allows ""The Fugitive"" to fully come together,and be the good and successful film that it turned out to be.Overall,whether you have or have not watched the television show that ""The Fugitive"" is based off of,if you enjoy crime drama films and enjoy a film with a good cast and good acting (most of the cast here is obscure,but they are all great actors who are perfect in their roles here),""The Fugitive"" is the film is for you.9/10",The Fugitive

281,mleenyc-1,Not a Credible Script,3,26 April 2010,"Despite the great acting, cinematography and directorial pace, I could not otherwise get into this movie, because of the terrible premise. A rich doctor with a competent lawyer and well-placed specialist doctor friends, Richard Kimble is convicted of first-degree murder and is sentenced to death. After the train crash, Kimble only then begins searching for the man with the prosthetic arm. And what was Kimble and his lawyer doing before the trial ? Were they even contemplating and investigating and preparing a trial defense at all !!? Why does it take a trial conviction for Kimble to start his own investigating? Unbelievable.Generally, a poor criminal defendant will be the one who gets a death penalty. Kimble with well-connected, rich friends and active in high-profile charity work is not the kind of defendant who gets a death sentence. What's wrong with this picture ? An intelligent doctor friend makes the comment to the Tommy Lee Jones' character, ""You will never find {Dr Kimble}. He's too smart."" This is an astonishing statement for a smart doctor to make. Kimble is an experienced vascular surgeon, not an undercover James Bond comparable. It would be like the doctor friend saying, ""You'll never catch Albert Einstein, he's too smart."" Incredible.And if the doctor friend is so smart, he would not admit to felonious assistance of a convicted felon. And if he is so helpful and loyal to Kimble, where was he at the trial preparation and post-trial sentencing? Why does it take a death sentence for this doctor to become interested in helping Kimble? And why didn't he do his own investigation for the man with a prosthetic arm? He had access to the hospital records. Or was he just too busy ?First-degree murder involves a pre-meditated killing. Nothing in the movie indicates how Kimble performed pre-meditated acts or planned the killing. If it were planned, it surely did not look like it in the movie.",The Fugitive

Harrison Ford, who can act the gamut from A to B, was even wasted here.The owners of the original should sue, but I guess they probably sold their souls, so can't. What a travesty! Just read the summaries of the original to see what this show was about.Let's ignore any precursor. Can this movie stand on its own? No. Horrible pacing; illogical plot; inaccurate scenes like the RR, the dam, everybody running into each other, inability of Kimble to disguise himself, involvement of US Marshals in local jurisdiction, etc. etc.I'm glad I saw this mess, because now I don't ever have to see it again, and maybe I can save a few others from wasting their time.",The Fugitive
283,rmorley,"Good, but definitely not great",6,12 October 2008,"This was a decent action/detective movie with good pacing and good acting all around. My main problem with the movie centers around the holes in the plot: while it's suggested, it's never clearly stated why Helen was murdered; the fudged clinical trials of the drug all being ultimately controlled by one doctor seems rather unlikely; the number of times Kimble goes unrecognized by people who should know him on-sight (even without the beard) goes beyond the realm of unlikely into the realm of ludicrous; Kimble's skill at creating a false pass and faking out people who work at the hospital also seems rather lame. I'm sure I could come up with more if I watched it again.In the end, it was a good enough movie to be enjoyable, but some very basic believability issues marred the overall story. Obviously the 90% or so of users who rated this movie better than I did will disagree with me on this, but I have a hard time understanding why this movie is so highly-rated.

285,loutel-905-833810,A first rate thriller with two great lead actors.,10,19 February 2014,"The Fugitive (1993) is about a vascular surgeon named Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) who was accused of killing his wife. As he escapes from being executed he goes on the run to prove his innocence while avoiding getting caught by a team of U.S Marshals lead by the determined Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). I will start off by saying that I don't just like, but love this film. Everything about this film is perfect. This is an exhilarating film and I enjoyed every minute of it. The Fugitive is a great action thriller that is highly entertaining and filled with heart pounding moments. The film is directed by Andrew Davis. Andrew Davis is one of the few directors who in his prime knew how to craft a well made action film. As far as his films go, this is his best one and my favorite. The scenes between Ford and Jones are engaging and suspenseful. The entire film is a perfect example of great suspense. One of my two favorite scenes in this film are where Kimble is chased by Gerard. One is the dam chase and the other is the stairway chase. Both of the scenes are terrific examples of great thrills. The performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are outstanding. Harrison Ford is great as Dr. Richard Kimble. You really feel the characters vulnerability and you really root for him. I am in general a huge fan of Harrison Ford and as far as his performances go this is one of his best. Tommy Lee Jones as the determined U.S Marshal Samuel Gerard is magnificent. Tommy Lee Jones is another one of those actors who is basically good in just everything he is in. He also won an academy award for best supporting actor and I got to say that he truly deserved it. The supporting cast may not be on par with the two lead actors, however they still do capable job in their roles. The score by James Newton Howard is wonderful and add more excitement during the action scenes. Overall, it is a first rate thriller that will appeal to action fans and to those who in general like a good film that features top notch suspense and a well written story with wonderful lead actors. I absolutely have no problems with this film. 10/10 stars.",The Fugitive

287,kingismyworld,The first to show that TV series makes a great film,10,10 August 2007,"Well here's a rarity. A film based on a 1963-67 TV series would've been laughed at in the early 1990's. In 1993, Andrew Davis took a beloved TV series and turned it not only a critically acclaimed movie but a $183 million dollar box office smash that also won the 1994 People's Choice Awards, Golden Globe nominations, The Critic's Choice Awards and not but not least, The Oscar For Tommy Lee Jones as best support actor. Very rare that a movie based on a TV series would earn such praise.Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford)is a surgeon who after a party, finds his wife, Helen (Sela Ward) murdered and is attacked by a one armed burglar. With his wife dead, fingerprints all over the crime scene and a 911 call by Helen, this would seem to indicate that Kimble is the killer. Kimble proclaims his innocence but the evidence seals his fate. Convicted and sent to die by lethal injection, fate has an unusual hand for Kimble. On a prisoner transport. a riot ensues, causing a train wreck that frees Kimble and begins his quest to clear his name. On his trail is US Marshall Sam Gerard (Jones) an officer that is determined to get Kimble,alive or dead. As the two men play cat and mouse, Kimble will find evidence pointing that the murder of Helen was meant for him and uncovers a web of greed and medical corruption while Gerard also finds the same evidence that shows that Kimble may be innocent. Will Kimble find the answers to clear his name or will Gerard and his team capture him? Sounds like a great premise for a movie and in 1993, it was. With a great script, taut direction and great performances by everyone, The Fugitive destroyed the notion that TV shows can't make great movies. By taking basic ingredients and turning it into there own, the film wound up being the first film to get award nominations and publicly acclaimed too. Buy it or rent it and see why it remains a classic even today.",The Fugitive
288,99Tfl,"Tense, Brilliant and Essentially Perfect",10,28 December 2018,"We all know the basic plot: Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a successful surgeon, is convicted of murdering his wife Helen (Sela Ward) and sentenced to death. But he's innocent. When his prison bus collides with a freight train, he sees an opportunity to learn the truth of his wife's death, find the 'one-armed man' who killed her, and clear his own name, and so goes on the run to do so, while being pursued by the wily U.S. Marshal Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones).Based on the TV series of the same name, 'The Fugitive' is probably the best film ever made out of a TV show. Ford and Jones stand out in particular-Ford as the wronged widower out to find his wife's killer and why, and Jones as the dogged marshal who comes to doubt Kimble's guilt over the course of his pursuit.The film is filled with Hitchcockian suspense and tension to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat-Will Kimble succeed in evading the authorities? Will Gerard learn the truth? Will the 'one-armed man' be caught? James Newton Howard's brilliant score (one of his best) also helps in this.Pacing is one thing the film also gets right-not once does it feel to be slowing down, or moving too fast. Instead it moves at the right pace, slowing down when needed, and picking up when required. Perfect for a tense thriller.Of course, the story and plot are great too: as Kimble searches for the 'one-armed man', he learns the sinister truth and conspiracy behind his wife's murder; confronted by the arrogant dismissals of the Chicago Police and Kimble's own actions, Gerard comes to believe Kimble is innocent.Bottom line: this is one of Harrison Ford's best films, one of the best action films of the 1990s and one of the best remakes period.",The Fugitive

Second, the actors are so well cast that there is not a single threat of them pulling out a bad performance. third, the plot is simple and very, very effective. And fourth, the film is BRILLIANT - It is a very flowing yet tense action film that has you hanging on every scene. You want to see him pull through at the end and the result is entertaining even after a decade. There isn't another one like it.",The Fugitive
303,samuel-ag1,Good!,8,3 February 2012,"There is nothing wrong with pilfering the premises of old TV-shows provided, I think, that they are plot-driven and not character-driven. It would be wrong, for example, to re-make Hogan's Heroes because it was the quirky mix of characters and the acting that made it a success, not the ridiculous plot. The Fugitive, however, is different because the story provided the impetus rather than the cast, who are merely characters rather than personalities (the wrongly-accused doctor, the obsessed marshal, the one-armed man). Because of this, skilled actors such as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones can slip into the roles like they are well-worn suits and, together with the enhanced opportunities offered by big-budget cinematics, can create something terrific.Part of the reason this re-make works is that Harrison Ford plays this type of role so well: the reluctant hero, resourceful everyman and unfairly-treated victim. Just about anyone can identify with Ford's plight and imagine themselves in the same situation, and conversely hope that they might use the same courage and initiative. On the other side of the coin is US Marshal Tommy Lee Jones, who is conscientious to the verge of obsession and strives to think like his quarry - but not so blindly that he also doesn't empathise for him. That's what makes The Fugitive better than the average cop-and-crim chase movie: both characters are likable, and the climactic meeting between them doesn't disappoint.It has its fair dose of action, but not so much that it overrides or smothers the tension and suspense of the plot. While not at the pinnacle of film-making, The Fugitive is great viewing that treats both its substance and its audience with respect and intelligence.",The Fugitive
304,samin09,The best of its genre,10,13 July 2005,"The Fugitive is up there with the best thrillers of all time. I cannot believe this movie is not there with the IMFD top 250. Harrison Ford was terrific as usual. From, the very beginning of the film you felt compassion for this man. He also captured the essence of a man struggling to find the killer in this giant city. Tommy Lee Jones brought wit and charisma to the film. He deserved the Oscar he got and his quotes were brilliant. Everything in this movie was great and designed to keep the audience in the edge of their seats. It was difficult to watch it in the theater because of the huge sound effects coming from the other auditorium that was playing Jurrassic Park. I recommend this movie for anyone and it is one of the great movies of all time.",The Fugitive

It has everything great Actors, great scenes and it is long and you don't even realise it. My favourite scene that sums up the whole movie is where Richard Kimble is asleep and he is dreaming of a beautiful time with his wife and he wakes up to discover that he half buried in the ground and is on the run from his pursuers. The persistence and determination to make things right is inspirational. I've got to see it again.",The Fugitive

311,Boutique,Insider review from an Extra on the Movie,7,9 August 2008,"Well, looking back on this movie it is pretty decent, but not one of the better ones I have seen (I have worked as an extra on a few movies and sadly, none of them were all that great).The plot was OK, but hate to say it the acting was a bit stilted and somewhat over the top.I do have to agree with the ""tounge in cheek"" comment on the performance by Tommy Lee Jones. It is subtle, but the irony is there.I was in a few scenes but the ""Convention Dinner"" scene where they end up chasing the Fugitive through the hall was pretty realistic (if you discount the fact that you have to repeat it 5, 6 or 20 times) and Tommy Lee had this scary-intense aura about him.You can see me - I am the redhead who flips around in her seat a moment before he and the other guy leave the room and continue their battle. Funny sidebar - during one of the repeat takes Ford tripped over the leg of my chair and nearly fell face down. A PA (producton assistant)came over and gave me a dirty look and told me to move my chair in further(duh).This one scene took all night to film ( extras arrived at about 8pm and left somewhere around 7 the next morning). I would never choose to do this as a profession. If you ever decide to be an extra, bring a good novel or some homework with you to read during the 4-5 hours of down-time that usually is the norm, and expect to be there for 10 - 14 hours.No wonder movies cost millions to make.",The Fugitive
312,annacage1,"In the parade sequence, I believe I spotted Mr. Roland Burris marching with a big green banner across his chest",9,10 January 2009,"I loved this movie. It has been many years since I first saw it, so I decided to watch it with a friend. I didn't remember the whole plot, so it was like watching it for the first time. Imagine my surprise when I saw a familiar face in the parade. His face has been on all the networks for the past week or so. My friend and I backed up the movie and watched the parade section over and over. In the parade sequence, we believe I spotted Mr. Roland Burris marching with a big green banner across his chest. I couldn't make out the writing on the banner, but it seemed like it was part of a group marching together. Roland Burris is the gentleman Illinois Governor Balgojevich appointed to replace Senator Obama. At the present time, the governor has been impeached. We don't know the fate of Roland Burris' appointment. If you watch for him, the scene is right after the close up of the drum corps. I am so sure that this is him. I would love for someone to verify this information. If he is a prominent citizen it is logical that he would be part of a Chicago parade.",The Fugitive
313,nexthendrix25,Surprisingly intimate and emotional action film - 9/10 stars,9,16 March 2003,"Although it is listed most commonly as an action film, ""The Fugitive"" is a delightfully dynamic film, surprisingly intimate and emotional as well as dramatic and thrilling. The movie keeps the viewer on the edge with its well choreographed chase and fight scenes, and the plot thickens effectively and challenges the audience to figure out the truth. There are many decent action films that share these characteristics, but ""The Fugitive"" has more depth and muscle than most other works of the genre due to its touching emotional context. Ford's subtle depression, the somber city and wilderness settings, the graphic flashbacks and the haunting musical score make enable the audience to understand the characters and empathize with them. There is also a good deal of humor, much of it improvised on the part of Tommy Lee Jones and his partners, which adds to the naturalistic feel of the film and credibility of the storyline. And the extraordinary plot twist and climax keeps the film from suffering the generic letdown of many potentially good thrillers. Overall this is an excellent film with an excellent plot that reveals more subtleties every time it is watched.",The Fugitive
314,lisa-w1,Fast paced action with great performances,9,24 March 2011,"The fugitive is just a great film for so many reasons. First of all, I love it because Sam Gerard, the US marshal on the hunt for the wrongly accused DR. Richard Kimble treats his team whom he refers to as his ""kids"" like family. He actually mothers them, telling the lone female on the team to wear two coats, while advising Noah not to let someone give him any you know what about his pony tail. This type of camaraderie really appeals to me. And as far as performances are concerned, Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding. His vocal intonation is very expressive, conveying a gamut of emotion from humor to kindness to menace.And hey, let's give it to the guy, he wasn't exactly a teenager when this movie came out but he was running and jumping with the best of them. And I really admire Sam Gerard because he was totally dedicated to what he thought was the truth--Kimble was convicted in a court of law and that was all he needed to know. This is why he says he doesn't care when Kimble tells him he didn't kill his wife. But at the end of the movie when the truth comes out about who actually killed Helen Kimble Gerard is totally willing to accept it no holds barred. I love that.Love the ""Peter Pan"" dive into the water, train wreck, running around in the st paddy's day parade, all of it. See it if you can.",The Fugitive
315,carlfire,No hose on Fire Engine,10,25 March 2005,"After the one armed man became a suspect police were assigned to watch the house. The one armed man was told to take care of Dr Richard Kimble. Knowing the police were watching the one armed man had to create a diversion to enable him to leave the house. At this time the one armed man called the fire department. The Fire Engine pulled up in front of the house and the fire jumped off the truck. The fire engine was at least a 1950 or 1960 model with no decals, however the big mistake was yet to come. As the firefighters rounded the engine it was obvious to firefighters like myself that the engine had NO HOSE in the hose bed. Although most people would not notice the mistake any firefighter would have. It was probably a poor attempt at saving money. The Chicago firefighters are good but not that good.",The Fugitive
316,verasdawghouse,discrepancy in the movie - about Kimble's keys,9,18 April 2005,"What I don't understand: there is a comment toward the end of the movie by Girard that Dr. Nichols borrowed Richard K.'s car and his keys, and ""thus there was no forced entry."" But WHEN were the keys used? How did Sykes use the keys, and yet get them back to Dr. Nichols just about the same time, so that Nichols could get them back to Richard? Because Sykes had stayed in the apartment - he attacked Kimble after attacking his wife. Did one of those 2 (N, S) make copies? The time frame would not allow the scenario as presented. To me, there is a great inconsistency here, a puzzle that annoys the heck out of me. Anyone notice this? Anyone can explain it all to me? Or am I missing something obvious? I watched the movie twice this weekend and still didn't get that solved.",The Fugitive

I have seen it five times already, and the last time it was almost as amusing to me as the first time I saw it. My guess is that the main responsible for this can only be the director.All Andrew Davis' films I saw were interesting, but still not that good as this one. It seems that the order of the scenes is interesting, so that when you see one scene it makes you want to see the next one. The Tommy Lee Jones' character in the movie is one of the best detective characters I've ever seen. ""The Fugitive"" is not an artistic film,but it doesn't have to be, it is interesting enough as it is.",The Fugitive

This is not specific to this movie, I get extremely bored when the final confrontation and fight is unnecessarily prolonged at the end of such movies, when everybody knows how its going to end by that point.",The Fugitive
