0,bkoganbing,First Camera Perspective,6,2 February 2008,"Unless there was a lot of clover in the fields of Central Park where some of the story of Cloverfield takes place, I'm not sure of the significance of the title here.Director Matt Reeves had the interesting idea of filming this movie in the first camera perspective. The film is the recorded viewpoint of a video camera and whomever is holding it at the time. Just about every one of those Fifties Science Fiction films takes it from the viewpoint of the people who will eventually slay the monster or defeat the aliens, whatever. You see masses of folks running in panic from whatever the threat is.What we've got in Cloverfield is a group of ordinary 20 somethings having a party. When some kind of alien invasion hits New York City. Then the group of them take off in understandable panic in search of safety. The film is about that quest for safety.No name players of any kind are used here and to be sure that does give the audience a good identification. They're not a terribly interesting bunch though, I'm not sure if I really cared whether they made it or not.Cloverfield is an interesting, but not terribly entertaining science fiction film.",Cloverfield
1,Leofwine_draca,A classic of the 'found footage' genre,9,26 February 2016,"CLOVERFIELD is a simple film that deserves a simple review. The brainchild of producer J. J. Abrams, the man who gave us the tricksy TV series LOST, this is a monster flick with a difference: it's shown entirely from the ground, from the point of view of the humans caught up in the carnage. As such, when the first twenty-minute set up is over and the film begins for real, you're in for a real, original treat with this movie. I've long been a fan of monster flicks and this is no doubt the scariest ""giant creature rampage"" you'll see.The hand-held camera vantage point manages to combine gritty on-the-street realism with glossy mega-bucks effects work, and the result is often phenomenal on a visual level. Buildings crumble like on 9/11; people are infected by hideous spider-like parasites and everything is burning, blowing up or getting crushed. The monster itself is a rarely-seen beastie that came from the sea and should have stayed there; it's origins are never fully described and that works in the film's favour.The acting's great from the cast, and I could fault no performances; I especially liked cameraman Hud, whose simple-minded footage works in the movie's favour. Some have compared this to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and indeed it IS like that film, except down with a multi-million dollar budget. It's not quite as frightening but there are plenty of pants-wetting moments, like the bit in the tunnel and the (literally) overwhelming climax. Forget about that awful US remake of GODZILLA: CLOVERFIELD is what that film SHOULD have been. It's taut, short, straightforward and simple: people running around a city while a monster and its minions wreak havoc. Gruesome, dark fun throughout.",Cloverfield
2,SnoopyStyle,traditional creature feature in found footage style,8,17 January 2016,The military recovers a camera from Central Park in NYC after a mysterious incident. The movie consists of the footage found on the camera. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) and girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable) are going to Coney Island. Then the tape is recorded over at a later date. Jason Hawkins (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) are throwing a surprise farewell party for his brother Rob who is moving to Japan for work. Idiot friend Hud Platt (T.J. Miller) is given the job of recording. He starts flirting with disinterested friend of a friend Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan). Then things start happening and the group goes out into the streets.The story is a traditional creature feature. The young cast is photogenic and charismatic. The found footage is good as far as the new style goes. The main problem I have is the camera always finding just the right frame. It gets a little too obvious over time. I like all the big effects but the scariest stuff happens in the dark tunnel. This is bigger than most found footage movies and done well.,Cloverfield
3,Hitchcoc,"LIke Most Films About Survival, It Does a Decent Job",6,26 May 2016,"There are so many plot holes that it's hard to feel positively about this film. Still, it had a modicum of suspense and characters that we sort of cared for. The protagonist leads his peers on what should have been a hopeless venture. As a monster is attacking Manhattan, he manages to get to an apartment building, go into a building next door, and cross over to rescue his girlfriend. The possibility of any of this is beyond belief. Sad as he feels over his poor girlfriend's plight, he isn't going to rescue her. Oops! I spoke way too soon. Why are these monsters so set on knocking down skyscrapers? Are they hungry? Why would the idiot continue to film when everyone is running for their lives. But if you don't want to think too much, it will entertain you pretty well.",Cloverfield
4,claudio_carvalho,"""Godzilla"" à la ""Blair Witch Project"" Style",5,31 October 2008,"The US Defense Department finds a videotape in the former Central Park. The footage shows a group of friends celebrating a surprise farewell party in the apartment of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) in Lower Manhattan. Rob is a young man that is leaving New York to work in Japan and his friend Hud (T.J. Miller) is recording messages from his friends. Out of the blue, they are surprised by an earthquake and they see on the news that a ship has capsized in the harbor area. They go to the penthouse to see the accident and they actually witness explosions everywhere; when power goes out in the building, they run to the streets trying to save their lives from the attack of the monster.The unoriginal tragedy movie ""Cloverfield"" is a boring combination of ""Godzilla"" à la ""Blair Witch Project"" style. The story is disclosed through the viewfinder of a hand-held video camera, and the dialogs and situations in the farewell party are silly, uninteresting and tiresome. The movie improves with the special effects of the attack of the monster, but the shaking camera and the characters are annoying. I had good expectations based on the overrated IMDb User Rating (7.5/10 @ 102,264 votes) and I was absolutely disappointed in the end. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Cloverfield Monstro"" (""Cloverfield Monster"")",Cloverfield
5,nogodnomasters,"Whatever it is, it's winning.",4,22 March 2019,"I finally got around to watch what would be the prequel to films I have already seen. (May have plot spoilers).At a going away party everyone discovers Rob and Beth had sex. And oh BTW aliens are invading the city. Rob and Beth get separated and he spends the film looking for her, dodging aliens. Very bad amateur footage. We have the scream cam, the foot cam, the running cam, the panting cam, the motion sickness herky-jerky cam, green cam and the I don't know how to use the camera cam.Alien looked cool.",Cloverfield
6,kosmasp,Knowledge,7,22 January 2017,"When I watched this (years after the actual release of the movie), I did know what this was about, as opposed to the people who may have gone with little knowledge into this. I still think it works out pretty neatly and even holds up after all those years. You can call this an adventure if you want to.So it is mostly pretty people doing their thing and it is ""found footage"", but this never really bothered me much. I was surprised by the different endings on it. Some not that bad to be truthful, but that's up to you to decide if they chose the right one. But before that you get a tension filled movie, that could've been a romantic comedy, but has as you probably know a twist to it ... Enjoy the (well executed) mayhem!",Cloverfield
7,classicsoncall,"""I had a good day.""",6,8 August 2018,"I didn't mind the shaky camera business too much, but the whole exercise seemed rather pointless. I suppose if you considered the action in the story as something you would have to undergo if faced with a similar catastrophe, then I guess it works. But I just got tired of the whole thing after a while and didn't care much about what would happen. A funny thought crossed my mind at one point when much of the dialog sounded like it could have come from the old ""Dick Van Dyke Show"". That was when some character started calling out ""Rob, Rob, Oh Rob"". If you're of a more recent era you won't get the reference, but for us old timers, I thought that was hilarious.So in the Awards section for this film, I see it won a Golden Schmoe in 2008 as Best Horror Movie of the Year. Not having seen any of it's competition for that year, I would have thought it would also walk away with the Trippiest Movie of the Year as well. Oh well, I guess you can't win them all.",Cloverfield
8,lee_eisenberg,"imagine a very good hand-held version of ""The Birds""",8,16 June 2008,"First of all, ""Cloverfield"" is probably the last title that I would envision for a horror/sci-fi movie. But aside from the fact that it is, there are two specific things that I find very impressive about the film. The main aspect of course is that it's shot with a hand-held camera and contains a cast of unknowns so as to create very realistic sense. But I also would say that it follows the same structure as Alfred Hitchcock's movie ""The Birds"". You see, during the first fifteen or so minutes, both movies look as though they're going to be romantic comedies. But then the horrific element arrives and dominates the rest of the movie. And both films have the same sort of ending (although different things happen).Anyway, this is more than a monster movie. I totally recommend it.",Cloverfield
9,jboothmillard,Cloverfield,5,21 July 2010,"Cashing in on the successful ""found footage"" format, seen in successful low-budget movies like The Blair Witch Project, and Paranormal Activity, this ambitious bigger budget film does it to make a disaster movie, produced by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Super 8, Star Trek, Star Wars), directed by Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Basically, the footage seen is recovered by the United States Department of Defense in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"", for a case titled ""Cloverfield"". It is footage captured by a group of friends across New York City and Coney Island, with clips from a former recording seen is parts throughout. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) is leaving the city to travel to Japan for a new job, so his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Jason's girlfriend Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) have thrown a farewell party. Their friend Hudson 'Hud' Platt (T.J. Miller) films testimonials for Rob during the party, while Rob's ex-girlfriend Elizabeth 'Beth' McIntyre (Odette Annable) shows up with a new man. Rob and Beth have an argument, during which a supposed earthquake strikes, and a brief citywide power outage occurs. Suddenly, many loud noises are heard, and explosions are seen from a distance. When the partygoers leave the building, the severed head of the Statue of Liberty is hurled into the street in front of them. Then an enormous creature is seen several blocks away collapsing the Woolworth Building. Later, during the city's evacuation, the Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed by the creature's tail, killing Jason and several other people. News reports show the army troops and vehicles attacking the monster. Smaller ""parasite"" creatures fall off its body and attack nearby pedestrians and soldiers. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud escape the subway, Lily, and another partygoer, Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), venture into Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They get caught in a battle between the creature and the Army National Guard and run into the subway, soon attacked by several of the parasitic creatures. Marlena is bitten, but the four escape and find a command centre and field hospital. Marlena bleeds from her eyes in reaction to the bite. She is dragged into a tent, where she appears to explode. Rob, intending to save Beth, persuades one of the military leaders to let him go. The man then tells Rob when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its plan to destroy Manhattan hoping to kill the monster. The group manage to climb the building opposite to enter the apartment building leaning next to it, and they find Beth impaled on exposed rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site at Grand Central Terminal, where they encounter the creature once again. Lily is rushed into a departing Marine Corps helicopter and escapes. Moments later, Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being bombed. The bombing causes the creature to fall, but it lunges at the group's helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park. On the crashed helicopter's radio, the group are warned that a second bombing will commence in fifteen minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee; Hud retrieves the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Sirens blare and the bombing starts, Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch. Rob and Beth take turns to leave their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge crumbles, and the camera is knocked out of Rob's hand and buried under rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off, with both screaming while the monster roars. Also starring Margot Farley as Jenn, Theo Rossi as Antonio, Brian Klugman as Charlie, Kelvin Yu as Clark, and Ben Feldman as Travis. The performances are average, the special effects are reasonable, and the camera is often shaky, but these faults aside, you can get into it and enjoy things going crash and bang. I originally thought that this film was either naff or silly, but I'm glad I watched it again and gave it a second, it is an interesting enough alternative to the typical monster movie, a watchable science-fiction action thriller. Worth watching!",Cloverfield
10,Woodyanders,Super intense creature feature,8,6 December 2018,"A group of young folks find themselves in considerable jeopardy after a vicious giant monster suddenly attacks New York City.Director Matt Reeves, working from a tight script by Drew Goddard, takes time to develop the characters, grounds the fantastic premise in a believable everyday reality, and generates plenty of nerve-wracking tension. The total absence of a music score and the expert use of a shaky hand-held portable camera give this picture a bracing, riveting, and above all extremely harrowing sense of immediacy and intimacy that basically puts the viewer in the thick of the terrifying action just like the hapless people in the movie; the acute feeling of blind panic and complete chaos is frighteningly well captured. Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel, and Odette Annable are all credible as the imperiled protagonists. The scenes of destruction -- the Statue of Liberty's decapitated head rolls down a street, the Brooklyn Bridge gets demolished -- are quite potent and startling. The grim ending also packs a shocking punch. The special effects are convincingly done. An on the money nail biter.",Cloverfield
11,Tweekums,Good found footage monster movie,7,3 November 2012,"When Hudson 'Hud' Platt gets roped in to film his friend Rob's going away party in Manhattan he doesn't expect that he will end up documenting the destruction of the city. After about twenty minutes the party is disturbed by what appears to be an earthquake. Wanting to see what has happened they all head to the roof and learn it certainly wasn't an Earthquake; they see buildings collapsing and what appears to be flaming meteorites crashing down into the city. Realising the danger they rush downstairs into the street and are stunning when part of a very familiar monument crashes into the ground in front of them! With the danger clearly extreme they head for the Brooklyn Bridge but it is destroyed as they try to cross. When Rob gets a call from the girl he loves saying she is unable to move in her apartment he decides that he must help save her; his friends go with him and along the way they encounter further dangers.Having managed to avoid major spoilers I was intrigued to see this film as I remembered all the hype in the run up to its release. The most obvious feature of this film is the way the camera is constantly moving around; this does serve to make it look as if it was really filmed by somebody caught up in the events but it is quietly to cause a degree of motion sickness if watched on a larger screen. The feeling of realism is increased by the use of an unknown, at least to me, cast. The cast did a good job, meaning that for the duration of the film I could believe they were caught up in this terrible situation. The special effects were also pretty good; it helped that we didn't see too much of the creatures till near then end. The DVD case quoted a review that said it was 'truly terrifying' but despite enjoying it as a gripping thriller I didn't find it particularly scary; I certainly didn't find it anywhere near as frightening as that other found footage film 'The Blair Witch Project'. At seventy minutes, excluding credits, this film is very short but this can be justified by the fact that it is meant to be recorded on a single tape this idea is reinforced by occasional gaps in the filming where we see what was on the tape before. Overall I wouldn't call this a much see film but it is worth watching if it is on TV or picking up if you see the DVD in the bargain bin.",Cloverfield

13,BA_Harrison,"Who cares where it came from; it's big, ugly and mean, and that's all that matters.",8,29 September 2009,"The impressive teaser trailers for Cloverfield revealed some stunning footage of the destruction of New York, but refused to reveal the film's title, creating much conjecture and discussion about the true nature of the project amongst film fans. Ironically, it was this well orchestrated hype that made me give this one a miss at the cinema, for I had fallen for this kind of marketing ploy before and wasn't about to be duped again. It's a shame, because for once, the film lives up to the hype and I would have dearly loved to have seen this in all of its big budget, blockbuster glory on the silver screen.Written by J.J. Abrams, the man who created compulsive but confusing TV series Lost, Cloverfield has been described as The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla, a summary that proves to be very accurate: utilising hand-held POV camera-work (video footage supposedly shot by one of the characters) to achieve a sense of naturalistic realism, the film follows several 20-something New Yorkers as they try and escape from Manhattan after it is attacked by a huge and very destructive monster.Director Matt Reeves imagery is deliberately reminiscent of footage taken during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and instantly brings to mind the horror of that unforgettable event; this connection with something so real and terrible makes Cloverfield all the more harrowing. Add to this Abram's well constructed script featuring credible and occasionally witty dialogue (my favourite lines: What was that? I don't know... something else, also terrible), an impossibly good looking but largely unknown cast who all give very plausible performances, and superb special effects that merge seamlessly into the live action, and the result is a surprisingly enjoyable experience from start to depressing finish (like REC, Cannibal Holocaust, and The Blair Witch Project, which also used the documentary style to great effect, Cloverfield ends on an extremely downbeat note).",Cloverfield
14,Quinoa1984,"a contradiction that works, up to a point: big Hollywood blockbuster/monster movie meets (stylized) subjective POV",7,26 January 2008,"JJ Abrams is very clever at delivering projects that drive up the hype machine like some kind of crazy storm, which can either go off smashingly (Lost) or not so much (Felicity). Cloverfield is an experiment that needed some clever marketing - hence the ""what the ?"" trailer that came out last summer with people partying in a video camera viewpoint, and then looking out at a big explosion over New York City. What the film is is a bit different from the mystery surrounding the buzz on it, though the director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard (the former's first movie since The Pallbearer, the latter his first feature script after years of television), end up delivering some clever ideas and some good scares, even surprisingly juicy metaphors, while also making the audience suspend an incredible amount of disbelief.And it's this amount of disbelief that had me personally feeling very mixed about the picture when it ended. I knew I had seen some good entertainment in the sense of delivering the shocks and thrills that a good monster movie can provide (some of it, arguably, reminds one of the recent film the Mist). But there's more than just the ambiguity around where the huge would-kick-Godzilla's-toosh monster that reigns havoc all over midtown Manhattan, though that's a part of it. There's a specific purpose in having the characters Reeves and Goddard have in the picture, who are shallow, self-obsessed twenty-something cretins that look like a cross between your suburban Abercrombie acquaintances and rejects from MTV reality shows. The filmmakers bring the audience early on- and in increases steadily as the story goes on- to despising these people, not simply for their actions (have any of these people heard of the phrase ""every man for himself and huge f***ing creature against all?""), but for doing the stupid things that happen in most horror films.And yet, at the same time, the filmmakers have something special going on here, aside from the technique, which is of course part of the message (medium-message yada yada). The monster and its minions, for these kids as well as everyone else in the city, is like what philosophers call ""the big other"". Look at the scene where looters rush into an electronics store, and on TV there's news footage of the monster ripping apart the city. All the looters stop dead in their tracks, and for Rob and Lily and especially Hud the creature is like some unfathomable presence that can't be stopped, and despite being right where they can see it is something they can't totally grasp their collective consciousness around. That, plus some (slightly obvious) allusions to 9/11, and a slight tip of the hat to Japan (the kid going off to Japan, almost clever by half I'd say), make this a movie that does have some good metaphors going for it under the surface.This being said, there's something about the aforementioned characters that sort of bugged me, startling early on with the twenty minute lot of scenes with the party, and trickling down as the film went along. The style is meant to convey something specific, that we're right along with the viewer as they go through an extremely chaotic situation that is inconceivable (at least, unless, you haven't seen your share of Godzilla movies). Which, in its own way, treks back to the legacy left by Blair Witch Project, where one cared about what would happen to the trio as their defenses whittled down to a nub in the midst of the dark woods. In the case of Cloverfield, however, we're put in a situation where the subjective point of view is intense, a way of revealing a creature that is designed like out of some weird graphic novel. This part, of revealing the horror elements, works fine and effectively (particularly the spiders in the subway)...And at the same time the characters don't quite follow the reality that would be for most people. It's good to see a movie like Cloverfield with an audience (especially, if you're lucky, in Manhattan itself) to see the kind of response it gets, which to me seemed like a collective form of stretching the suspension of disbelief. Aside from the character Marlena, who is arguably the most sympathetic (or just least ""what the ?"" of the characters in what they do or say or act), they're like most characters we see in many a horror movie, following a logic that is more based on getting through the points that will lead the story through its harrowing end. I'll be able to suspend disbelief even in the sorts of things one has to go with in Cloverfield. But it takes some identification, some sympathy with the characters, to make it really worthwhile. I didn't get that from the picture, adding to it a muddled (if slightly exciting) climax.In the end, Cloverfield left me with mixed feelings, and I'm not sure when I would watch it again. But as the biggest hit so far in 2008, it's hard not to want to see what it has to offer, as a tip of the hat to old classic monster-destroys-city movie while trying a different approach. Least I can say is Abrams fans wont be too dissatisfied.",Cloverfield
15,Coventry,"It Came From ... Who knows, who cares?",3,9 March 2008,"Okay, once again it seems as if I missed out on a gigantic hype and once more I do not at all seem to comprehend the huge success of this superficially attractive but eventually bland and substantially void hybrid between an amateur YouTube video and a massively budgeted monster flick. The short trailers and secretive teaser clips didn't miss their effect, as ""Cloverfield"" quickly became one of the most anticipated movies ever, but does the finished product really live up to the beforehand promoted hype? That's a big fat ""NO"", in my humble opinion, because all I saw was an overlong (at barely 85 minutes, can you imagine), preposterous and pretentious blockbuster with very few redeeming qualities. This isn't a monster movie at all. Admittedly I might be a bit biased because I swear by the monster flicks and alien invasion movies from the fifties and early sixties, but at least they were charming and spectacular in a non-exploitative fashion. For the action and mayhem in their film ""Cloverfield"", Matt Reeves and Drew Goddard obviously cash in on the fear & paranoia caused by the 9/11 tragedy. People nervously and hectically force their way through collapsing skyscrapers and giant clouds of dust, unaware of what happened exactly, yet they resolutely continue to register their own misery and agony on a digital hand-held camera. That's like shamelessly promoting voyeurism and gratuitously manipulating people's deepest fears. And yet, whenever parts of buildings are falling down for (still) unknown reasons, ""Cloverfield"" is a tremendously boring film! Especially the wraparound story prior to the first big bang is almost intolerable dull and overlong. A bunch of irritating twenty-something people gather in someone's Manhattan apartment for a goodbye party and it seems to go on forever. Nobody cares about their romantic issues and the more they open their mouths, the dumber they appear, anyway. Particularly Hud, the guy operating the camera through tick and thin, makes some of the dumbest remarks I've ever heard. The continuously shaky camera wasn't as bad as everyone said, and at several times it clearly noticeable that professional cinematographers are holding the device instead of one of the players. I understand that, since J.J Abrams pumped quite a lot of budget into fancy digital effects that had to be shown at least a bit properly. The eventual nature of the menace actually raises more questions than it provides answers and logic and its design is not the least bit impressive. Rudimentary the concept of ""Cloverfield"" has a lot in common with the much better Korean monster-highlight ""The Host""; only the latter didn't cause motion sickness to any of its viewers of course. ""The Host"" is just far superior. First and foremost the monster looks more original, the character drawings are more realistic and likable and the production doesn't purely thrive on pretension.",Cloverfield

17,Theo Robertson,Blair Witch Meets Godzilla,5,26 October 2011,"Marketing played a large part in CLOVERFIELD's commercial success . It was very enigmatic and no shots of the monster appeared in the trailers and TV spots .In fact the marketing made more that it was produced by JJ Abrahams creator of ALIA and LOST than the plot itself . With hindsight this was very slick marketing as a tagline of "" Blair Witch Meets Godzilla "" would turn of a prospective cinema audience . I know it would in my case which is why I didn't bother about it until it appeared on TV Make no mistake BLAIR WITCH meets GODZILLA is the perfect description of this movie though it also makes several other references in the horror sci-fi genre . Rats running around the New York subway is a nod to 28 DAYS LATER , along with its sequel etc . In fact watching this film would make a good drinking - you gulp down a shot of booze evreytime you're reminded of another movie but the downside of that is you'd be dead of alcohol poisoning tho thirds of the way throughThis doesn't necessarily make CLOVERFIELD a bad film and it's not a bad film but is a very unoriginal one , a fact reflected in the marketing . It does suffer from being a "" fly on the wall documentary "" realist style movie though . For example almost the first third of the running time is taken up with character filming party . You can understand the director trying to make these characters empathetic to the audience but for the most part you don't really feel strongly about them one way or the other . The style also means the alien remains enigmatic and mostly unseen through out the film when I would have preferred to have seen scientists running around a lab feverishly trying to find a solution to the menace than having the characters running down yet another dark street",Cloverfield
18,Scarecrow-88,Cloverfield,5,3 May 2008,"A party given by Jason(Mike Vogel)to his brother, Rob(Michael Stahl-David)whose moving to Japan for a spell is interrupted when a rampaging monster wreaks havoc on New York City leaving absolute devastation in it's wake, while also ""leaving behind"" little creatures to terrorize citizens on foot. Through the use of a camcorder, operated by Rob's best friend Hudson(TJ Miller), we are witness to the monster's attack and how the city appears once it leaves for other areas to destroy. Following the monster's attack on the bridge they're walking, Rob decides to return to find his beloved Beth(Odette Yustman), who sends him a call claiming to have been hurt, with Marlena(Lizzy Caplan), an unfortunate victim attending the party, Lily(Jessica Lucas)a dear friend set up the party, and Hud, taping everything he can.I think the most effective moments are when we witness the aftermath of the monster's rampage with a city crumbling with buildings and cars destroyed. The monster itself didn't really impress me, to tell you the truth, and perhaps should've been left to the imagination. The little creatures which seemed like off-spring from the monster were pretty creepy, especially when they attack our heroes in a subway tunnel. The bridge attack was a bit effective and the the smoke and terror on the faces of those who just witnessed their city attacked rather works. But, to tell you the truth, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" was basically made in the same fashion, except for the ""Blair Witch Project"" type of ""real footage found"" governmental set-up. The city is attacked, we witness the carnage and horrified people, and follow certain protagonists as they try to move to a desired location. I agree with others that the camcorder used is top of the line and takes a licking and keeps on ticking. I do digress..I don't think Hud would follow behind Rob, or Marlena, for that matter. Being best friends is one thing, but returning to find someone that's very possibly dead, Hud wouldn't be criticized if he joined those being evacuated...although, I realize we wouldn't have the ""Cloverfield experience"" if that was the case. You can read on this site the numerous factual errors that are looked over in impacting the viewer like Beth's damaged building leaning against another skyscraper or the Statue of Liberty's head. As far as the constant dizzying movement, it didn't bother as much as others, but there were times where I wanted him to hold the damn thing still..I guess we must understand the situation Hud was facing and take it from there.",Cloverfield
19,Hey_Sweden,A good thrill ride.,7,10 May 2014,"Basically a melding of ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", this high-concept movie is a better than usual example of what has come to be known as the ""found footage"" genre.

It just thrusts characters and the audience alike into a horrifying situation that nobody can explain and seemingly with little to no chance for escape. It starts out mildly and then around the 18 minute mark it abruptly shifts gears. It's genuinely spooky at times and features a monster that is frightening in its capacity for violence, not to mention its immense *size*. Director Matt Reeves and company, working from Drew Goddards' script, follow conventional wisdom in showing this thing just a bit at a time, gearing up for the big reveal.The story starts out as a group of friends in Manhattan have a farewell party for one of their number, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who's moving on to a job in Japan. But things go seriously awry when this monster shows up and creates chaos and panic. While the military works feverishly to try to take the monster down and evacuate the citizens, Rob and his friends embark on a mission to locate and rescue Beth (Odette Annable); all the while, the character of ""Hud"" (T.J. Miller), who was given a video camera to record testimonials at this party, insists on documenting the unfolding events.One good thing is that, at least from this viewers' perspective, the six main characters are basically likable even as they attempt something that looks foolish and suicidal. Once the action starts, it achieves a respectable intensity level, although there are quieter moments when our protagonists desperately try to take a breather. The special effects are generally decent (the image of the Statue of Liberty's head in a street is a memorable one), and the monster itself is amusingly designed and completely bad ass.If one can stomach the overactive camera work (a bone of contention for many who've seen it), ""Cloverfield"" does manage to be a solidly enjoyable thriller.Seven out of 10.",Cloverfield
20,poolandrews,Bettr than I expected.,6,8 June 2010,"Cloverfield is set in New York City as a farewell party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) who has got a new job in Japan & is leaving soon, all his friends are there but after a row with his girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman) she takes off. Then suddenly the ground shakes, looking outside the guests see huge explosions & building's collapsing. Soon it becomes apparent that a huge monster is making it's way through Manhattan destroying everything in it's path, Rob phone's Beth & learns that she is hurt, together with his best friend Hud (T.J. Miller) & a couple of girls from the party Rob decides to rescue Beth who is trapped inside her apartment but with a huge monster on the loose & the US military trying to kill it there's plenty of obstacles in their way...Directed by Matt Reeves I have to say that I enjoyed Cloverfield for what it was even though I didn't expect to, in fact I usually rant on about how I hate the modern hand-held jerky camera movement that to me just looks awful but here in Cloverfield it's used to good effect. The best way to describe Cloverfield would be a giant monster film like Godzilla (1998) but told from the perspective of a bunch of normal people caught up in the situation unaware of what is happening & acting on instinct. The idea that you would want to save your friends & family is perfectly natural to me although if you would go up against a huge monster to do so is another issue I suppose, I really liked the average person perspective actually & the character's here do feel quite natural & ordinary. Portable video devices are everywhere these days so recording the events isn't a stretch either although that camera does seem quite robust considering what it goes through. While watching some of the spectacular sequences in Cloverfield I couldn't help but think if this was meant to be a 9/11 thing with terrified people on the ground running from falling buildings & the utter confusion, fear & panic that would inevitably happen. At only 80 odd minutes this moves along like a rocket & after the first fifteen minutes never lets up, I thought it was pretty gripping & intense & I liked the downbeat ending as well, far too many Hollywood films take the easy happy option. Having said that Cloverfield isn't perfect, there is no explanation about the monsters origin or it's fate & I am not sure it would stand up to multiple viewings.The whole realistic shaky hand-held camera really does give the impression that your watching events unfold from some guy's point of view but it is a little too dark at times & a little too jerky although I am sure these were intentional by the makers. There's no real gore or violence, just a splash of blood really, Some of the CGI effects are very impressive, the monster itself, building's falling down, explosions & the Statue of Liberty's head getting dumped in the middle of New York. When you think about it though the makers of Cloverfield went to great lengths & probably spent a fair bit of money trying to make it look as low tech & low budget as they could, does anyone else see any sort of irony in that? Apart from during the end credits Cloverfield has no musical score & again that gives it a realistic feel.Filmed in just 34 days in Los Angeles & New York on a $25,000,000 budget Cloverfield looks cheap & inept but that was a very deliberate look & some of the CGI effects are very impressive. The acting by total unknown's is pretty good to be fair.Cloverfield is a monster film that tries to tell it's story from the viewpoint of the ordinary person, the person who is terrified & doesn't know what it going on & only instinct is make sure his family & friends are safe. It's also a 9/11 film, the imagery & it's implication is too blatant to be merely coincidence.",Cloverfield
21,CinemaSerf,Close up monster hunt...,6,15 November 2021,"I suppose the first thing to warn of is - it is shot entirely POV, and for many (including me) that can prove to be really quite annoying at times (and particularly difficult to light effectively). The premiss is that ""Jason"" (Mike Vogel) and girlfriend ""Lily"" (Jessica Lucas) are living the happy lives of a young couple. When one night they set off to attend a leaving do for their pal ""Rob"" (Michael Stahl-David) their party is shattered by what seems like an earthquake, followed by a desperate hunt for his girlfriend ""Beth"" (Odette Annable) as something ginormous is stalking the streets of New York. The camera passes from person to person, so that does give us a different perspective of the ensuing mania - but actually I didn't find them a particularly engaging bunch of panic-stricken folks so I can't say I was very concerned for their safety. Some of the decisions they make - admittedly under a fair degree of duress - seem staggeringly risky and/or stupid; the sound editing overdoes the screeching and wailing to such an extent that the dialogue can be barely audible at times, and though well paced eventually, it still takes just a bit too long to actually get going. It is certainly an interesting concept, and if the style of cinematography doesn't drive you mad after twenty minutes, then I reckon you will quite enjoy the intimacy of the thing - at times, it is actually quite scary.",Cloverfield
22,dbborroughs,"Great monster, the rest I'm not too sure about",6,21 January 2008,"Supposed found footage of a civilian's eye view of a monster invasion of New York. Beginning at a party the action then shifts as something is seen and felt invading New York. When a desperate message is received from a friend trapped in her building several friends head off to rescue her...I'm of mixed emotions. Certainly when the film gets things right its gangbusters and some of the best film making of its type. When it doesn't work its downright tedious.What doesn't work for me (aside from a bent sense of New York) boils down to two things. First the twenty minute or so set up is way way way too long. Especially when you consider that the film sans end credits is about 70 minutes. the party sequence goes on and on and on and had I not been waiting for monsters I probably would have bailed. Hud, our cameraman, is a bit of an idiot and I hate that we are trapped with him for most of the film. The other problem for me is that the camera is constantly recording. Hud insists on recording everything at the party and then once things start to happen he constantly has the camera rolling. To be certain if he didn't we'd miss things but I doubt the batteries on the camera would last that long and I get real tired of him filming walking upstairs or down a street with nothing happening except him babbling. Events toward the end, that probably should have not been filmed because the camera would have been dropped, are also seen. (The hand held nature of the film is annoying but its the central conceit of the film so you have to go with it.) I could also go into the deus ex machina sequences (the electronics store looting) that are there simply to move the plot along, but I won't. I kept thinking that had they filmed this with out the conceit of the camera this would have been a better movie.I know that the POV allowed for a cheaper film, but at the same time I wanted to see more. I think perhaps I would have like how it was filmed better had I connected with someone in the film. I really didn't connect to anyone, I don't think we really saw anyone long enough to connect. It is at times like watching someone's wedding home video or home movie. You can see that these are real people but at the same time you're left wondering who are these people. I don't think we're ever really given enough to really care about anyone.What the film gets right is the panic of the attack. The beasties, completely unexplained, are terrifying because no one knows whats going on. The fact that the film takes place over six hours keeps up the tension of the unknown. the attacks themselves are also really well done because we see only just enough to scare us. The monster stuff is great and probably some of the best giant monster stuff put on film, certainly its better than the American Godzilla which shares a couple of locations. There is a tension that is created that is rare in movies of this sort and when the film is firing on all cylinders the film is very tense and scary. This is the bread and butter of the film, this is the reason the film exists and its very well done.How do I rate the film over all? I don't know. There is much to love and much to dislike. I know why it is and how it is. I just wish it was better. Is it worth seeing? yes at some point. I know I'll probably get the DVD and watch the monster stuff again. I doubt I will ever really watch the early party sequences. If pushed I'd say 6 out of 10. Some better parts than that some worse. Worth a bargain matinée, but too short (and too uneven) for a full priced admission.",Cloverfield
23,Bunuel1976,"CLOVERFIELD (Matt Reeves, 2008) ***",7,14 April 2008,"To begin with, I found this to be somewhat better than I had anticipated (though, admittedly, advance reviews had been generally positive). That said, the opening fifteen minutes are quite deadly - (even if the extended party footage helps to flesh out characters and, thus, heighten the later relentless anxiety passages). Thankfully, the teen relationships stuff gets forgotten pretty quickly  but, when they occur, the elegiac intermittent video footage of the happier past gives one a much-needed breather.This is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) meets THE HOST (2006) or, if you, like a Hollywood monster movie of yore updated for the MTV generation and filtered through with a post-9/11 sensibility. SCREAM (1996), THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT itself and SAW (2004) are all recent examples of the next big thing in Horror films; and, yet, who today recalls (or even misses) the film-makers of BLAIR WITCH? The director of this one, Matt Reeves, is already 42  and his previous film had been the comedy THE PALLBEARER (1996); in any case, CLOVERFIELD is more renowned for being a J.J. Abrams project (who produced it).The film is compact (even with its tight 75 minutes duration, barring the typically lengthy closing credits, it stills sags slightly and interest starts to wane towards the end), the title obscure, the monster(s) undefined (the shapeless main creature is creepy and admirably one only gets to have a real good look at it when gobbling up the Hud character! The young cast is variable, anonymous (with the most interesting characters being the misfits  Helena for being a Latina and Hud a geek) and, fashionably, indiscriminately disposed of. As for the cine'-verite' approach, the film-makers' over-reliance on it becomes rather self-defeating: would it be plausible for someone to keep filming this stuff? Besides, while aiding in the immediacy of the destruction and the ensuing panic (with such effective shock sequences as the demolition of the Brooklyn bridge, the tunnel attack and Helena's mysteriously violent and messy death), it never allows the audience a moment for reflection  coming across as a sensation rather than an experience and, given that nothing at all is explained, one isn't any the wiser by the end of it! In retrospect, it seems obvious that the traumatic 9/11 events has transported the U.S. back to the days of political/nuclear/alien paranoia which, back then, was also transmitted into cinematic terms via any number of sci-fi parables but where it's evident that the film-makers of that time were utmost professionals (in their strict majority) whose mission was to provide thought-provoking entertainment rather than merely computer-generated publicity stunts. At least, it does manage a couple of lingering images: the disembodied head of the Statue Of Liberty tumbling to the ground and an empty horse-carriage eerily wandering by night on a practically deserted city street. Sadly enough, but hardly surprising, a sequel is already in the works; the film, then, is no masterpiece but very well done nonetheless: smart, exciting and highly effective  in essence, what the much-hyped Hollywood remake of GODZILLA (1998) should have been in the first place! In spite of my reservations, I still consider it to be the first must-see movie of 2008 (which I chose not to watch it in the theater for fear of the dizzy camera syndrome proving to be a bit much but, actually, one gets used to it pretty quickly).",Cloverfield
24,zardoz-13,"A Pathetic Post-Modernist Pseudo-""Godzilla"" Rip-Off",1,25 January 2008,"The late great circus showman P.T. Barnum would stand up in his grave and applaud the advertising campaign that ""Lost"" creator J.J. Abrams designed for his new monster movie ""Cloverfield,"" an allegory for the 9/11 disaster aimed at the You Tube generation. Essentially, ""Cloverfield"" is ""The Blair Witch Project"" meets ""Godzilla"" with a bit of ""Independence Day."" Sadly, this appalling 85-minute epic about a quartet of twentysomething adults out to rescue one of their own generates only a modicum of excitement, suspense, and horror. Like ""Blair Witch,"" ""Cloverfield"" relies on the gimmick of shooting its catastrophic action entirely from the viewpoint of a guy looking into the viewfinder of a camcorder. Actually, ""84 Charlie Mopic,"" a little known, low-budget, 1989 Vietnam War movie, utilized the same gimmick with greater imagination than either ""Blair Witch"" or ""Cloverfield."" Indeed, whether they realize it or not, the people that made ""Cloverfield"" have imitated most of what ""84 Charlie Mopic"" did with its saga about a combat photographer shadowing a special seven man reconnaissance unit on a dangerous mission.People that suffer from motion sickness might want to gobble some Dramamine before they see ""Cloverfield."" The action chronicles a troupe of Yuppies throwing a farewell soirée for Robert Hawkins (newcomer Michael Stahl-David of NBC-TV's ""The Black Donnellys"") who is bound for a new job in Japan. Anyway, Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel of ""Poseidon"") is supposed to shoot video testimonials. Jason pawns this chore off on his pal, Hud Platt (T.J. Miller of ABC-TV's ""Carpoolers""), who uses it as a way to greet girls. Meanwhile, Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman of ""Transformers"") quarrel. She retreats to her Central Park high-rise apartment. Not long afterward, shock tremors typically associated with an earthquake stagger New York City. TV news stations televise images of pandemonium. Out of nowhere the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty careens like a bowling ball down a Manhattan street. Eventually, word of a ""Godzilla"" sized reptile rampaging through Manhattan reaches our heroes. The power flickers everywhere, and panic erupts. Our heroes learn that nothing in the Pentagon's arsenal has been able to thwart this humongous monster's stompfest. Rob ignores warnings from the Army and sets to rescue Beth trapped in her own apartment. Along the way, Rob and his friends battle baby monsters that spring from the main monster.""Pallbearer"" director Matt Reeves and ""Lost"" scenarist Drew Goddard take a fantastic idea and fluff it. The camcorder that Hud tapes the action with doesn't sport a stabilizer so you'll feel like you're being whirled around in a Cuisinart. Unfortunately, aside from a few eerie shots, ""Cloverfield"" lacks adequate hysteria or suspense. The characters behave as idiotically as ""Friday the 13th"" victims, especially when they plunge into a dark creepy subway tunnel. The monster resembles the offspring of Dr. Seuss' Horton the Elephant character. Nothing emerges as remotely scary, and gore is held to a PG-13 minimum. ""Cloverfield"" offers no closure, and it makes you pine for a man in a rubber Godzilla suit.",Cloverfield

26,Boba_Fett1138,Perhaps the only movie in history that got really made by its marketing.,10,21 July 2008,"Of course every big movie has a marketing strategy and whole team behind it but in this case it really seems as if it was the marketing idea that made this movie, rather than the actual movie inspired its marketing strategy. I don't know if it's true but I would suspect that the marketing strategy was already ready way before the movie got completed. It was it's mysterious marketing approach that made this movie one of the most anticipated and mysterious movies ever released. No one really knew what this movie was about, until the time of its actual release. Before that we got to see mysterious looking trailers in which nothing got revealed. For a long time even the movie its title was a mystery, with only the name ""1-18-08"" as the promotional title. But does the movie also lives up to its hype and expectations? In my opinion it seriously does and the movie is better than I even could had ever hoped for.""Cloverfield"" got made for a fairly low budget (about $25,000,000), which is mostly due to its approach. It's entirely shot with an hand-held camera and the movie is made to look as if it was shot by a group of 'bystanders' who happened to have a video camera at hand at the moment New York City mysteriously fell under attack. This of course gives the movie an unique as well as realistic look and feeling to it. It also helps that the movie its cast are unknowns, so you're never too sure about it who is going to die in the movie and when.Despite its low budget, it's still a visually impressive movie. Buildings are collapsing and things are exploding- as well as the Cloverfield-monster itself is great and realistic looking. For most of the time you can only see her(?) tail or a leg but toward the end you of course get to see more and more, perhaps a bit too much at times. Too much because it at moments goes at the expense of the movie its realism. Where ever our main heroes go, there is the monster as well and not just miles away but often right next, or even right above or below them.The movie is a very original new way to bring 'monster' movies. The movie isn't following a real script, in which it tries to explain everything. This provides the movie with an uncomfortable feeling and also makes it an unpredictable to watch. It's its approach and actual handling of the concept that makes ""Cloverfield"" such an highly effective, as well as a modern classic to watch.Beauty about this entire concept as well is that you can bring countless more sequels without having to worry about continuity or characters. You can tell endlessly new stories, from survivors who shot the whole event with a video-camera. You can tell the same story basically over and over again that way from different angels, each time perhaps giving away some more information each time about where the creature came from and how, what and why all.

27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Excellent from start to finish,10,14 February 2008,"I haven't followed the hype-campaign for this, so I can't really say if it's good to watch this if you have done so or not. I was interested in this from when I first saw the teaser trailer. Yes, this does evoke images of 9/11. Yes, the entire film is presented as something that was taped on a camcorder. And yes, this camcorder does have rather impressive zooming capabilities, and a battery the durability of which is remarkable. But this is an awesome film. It's a thrill-ride, intense throughout, once it starts to be(and I wasn't bored with what was going on before that). It is incredibly well-paced, it never gets to be overwhelming, but it never lets you relax all the way, either. For about an hour and a half, you will feel the sense of not really being safe. J.J. doesn't disappoint. The masterful story-telling, the marvelous concept(which is a very interesting new angle on a very familiar type of movie/story... this is like The Blair Witch Project, only, you know, quality stuff), which was executed exceptionally well, the rich characters(which are developed and introduced subtly and skillfully), the dialog(it's ""real"", clever/expertly written, or both)... all the way, the traits of his productions and his talent are there(here's hoping Lost doesn't suffer). The acting is flawless. I found the amount of exposure of the creature to be about perfect, I'm not sure I would have gone with neither more nor less. There's enough that you won't wonder what it looked like, and yet it's in such sparse amounts that it never loses its effectiveness, it never ceases to be scary to us. The way the film is presented is a reasonably simple idea, but the way it's used and what it does is great. I don't remember when I was last this into a movie, or had such a fun time at the cinema(in fact, on that last one, this may be the first time for that). The film is perhaps not entirely without clichés, but they are quite rare, almost non-existent. It pulled the rug out from under me again and again, as J.J. has before shown a knack for being able to. The special effects are amazing, and never really feel like such. Watch this for the ride, for the well-told story within a monster flick told from an original perspective, and/or for, well, the J.J. Any fan of his may love this, if not necessarily as much as I did, and for anyone who isn't, well, this may very well have made a fan out of my dad... and he's usually into realistic and authentic films, more than ""spectacle"" ones. I recommend this to anyone who feels they would enjoy it. Keep working, J.J., I'm definitely behind you. 10/10",Cloverfield

If I were watching a real life documentary, then O.K., I'll watch whatever footage is available, but we're talking about a feature film of a fictitious event. Get the funding necessary and use a big boy camera like all the other movies do. At first it was cute, then it just got annoying. You tell me who is dumb enough to tote a camera around for 7 hours while the world is falling apart around them, a huge creature is attacking the city, and miniature creatures are running loose infecting people. And not only does our beloved cameraman Hud run scared through the streets of New York filming, but he keeps the camera up most of the time capturing key events. He's even better than that though, because he also has the presence of mind to make sure to hit the pause button every once in a while so as to conserve tape.RIDICULOUS. The entire movie I have to suffer through a bobbling camera, miscellaneous screams, and useless banter, all the while I'm starving to see some great shots of the action. I didn't care to see some incredibly dumb and naive New Yorkers run through the city to save a girl when they heard the Army say that they were going to level all of Manhattan.

It's a terrific looking film and it's capably acted -- when you watch the special features on the DVD and realize that most of the time actors were interacting with nothing but green screens, it makes both the acting and the effects that much more impressive. But it's one of those gimmick movies that's pinned down by the very element that makes it unique (I use the word ""unique"" loosely, since ""The Blair Witch Project"" has already covered this ground, to an extent). The hook in this film is that the destruction of New York and the attempts of a small band of twenty-somethings to stay alive is captured on a camcorder by one of the kids. But the technical necessities required to pull off this stunt result in too many logical flaws, not the least of which is how long would it take someone running for his life from a giant monster ravaging downtown Manhattan to ditch the camera?

That is unconventional. Director Matt Reeves (""Felicity"" is his main claim) doesn't give us too many real shots of the monster, which is probably a good thing.Pretty sure most of this was filmed on a sound stage and I assume there were numerous camera operators ... one's arms would get awfully tired jiggling a camera around non-stop.

Just look for the creature landing in the ocean during the last shot.If you see it now for the first time, you may wonder what all the fuss was about, but if you were there, tracking every viral campaign the makers did, and that beautiful one sheet, you know the fuss was worth it.A great disaster movie.",Cloverfield

So now the hype has died down and finally I've seen the film and all I can say is that I'm relieved I didn't rush out to see it because after spending barely seventy minutes on the film, all I really have to say about it is that it's boring! Cloverfield begins with around fifteen minutes of character building and it's a major turn off. The main characters are all twenty something good looking ""cool guys"" that say things like 'dude' a lot. One of them is going away and he fancies one of the girls or something like that...etc etc. It reminded me a lot of one of those American TV dramas that I never watch. Anyway, they're all huddled together at a dull 'leaving party' when all of a sudden; Manhattan is shaken by an ""earthquake"". However, it's not an earthquake and in fact New York is being invaded by CGI monsters.The film's main gimmick is that it's all filmed on a camera held by one of the main protagonists - in the same style as that film from 1999 that shall not be mentioned. Surprisingly, this isn't one of the main things I didn't like about the movie. The film is basically a special effects-fest and there's two ways that the budget is used; firstly we've got the shots of buildings falling and various things being destroyed, which is fairly well done. But then we've got the shots of the monsters, which are awful! They're poorly designed and the effects just look cheap. The film has enough problems to ensure that cheap-looking CGI isn't enough to spoil it on its own, but it doesn't help either. The effects are generally shown briefly, and in the case of the monsters this is a very good thing. Undoubtedly the most 'interesting' thing about the movie is the shots of helpless people panicking; but even this is not used to good - or exciting - effect. I would imagine that this film will be a great watch for any movie buffs that live in New York; if the movie were set in my home town, I'm sure that I'd have a great time watching everything get pummelled, but for the 99.9% of viewers that live elsewhere, this movie is unlikely to deliver the thrills you're after.",Cloverfield
36,zetes,Bland yuppie characters don't make me care much that they might die. But the monster is scary!,7,20 January 2008,"I've been thinking of this movie as the Blair Godzilla Project for months now, and I was pretty much entirely correct on what to expect. It's a good concept. I mean, everyone decided to hate The Blair Witch Project after it opened wide, but it was an excellent idea, and an effective film. It didn't work more than once, but that first time packed quite a wallop (for me at least). Cloverfield has the same flaws as that film. You spend a lot of time wondering why the character with the camera wouldn't at least set the camera aside some of the time (they do attempt to make it more believable than BWP did, but it's not always convincing). Also as in BWP, the characters are bland, vapid and not much worth caring about. They're all very TV-style good looking (in fact, most everyone involved with the movie came from that medium), and you'd certainly stare at the girls' butts if you saw them on the street. But on TV or in the movies, they're average. Does any real-life woman actually find the scruffy, unshaven look sexy? Hollywood has been shoving that look upon us for years now, and I don't think I've ever known of a female who wants her face ground down by stubble every time she gets close to her guy. Two of the male characters look so much alike I was relieved when one of them bit the dust. At least I wouldn't be confused anymore. But, oh yeah, there's a monster. And it's pretty scary. And the filmmakers are smart enough to hold back on what you see (although I should mention that Korean director Bong Joon-Ho made a much better monster movie last year in which the monster is seen in toto almost immediately). All in all, Cloverfield is a moderately entertaining monster movie. If you didn't like The Blair Witch Project, I would definitely avoid it. But if you did like BWP, and like Godzilla, it's not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. Make sure, if you do see it, to sit through the credits sequence. There's a lot of buzz about an impossible-to-hear mumble that is audible right before the studio logo comes up, but the real reason to stick around is to hear Michael Giacchino's bombastic and hilariously unnecessary closing overture and what it's called. It makes the movie.",Cloverfield
37,trashgang,Is this worth a hype?,5,19 August 2008,"After seeing the trailer for this flick we thought it was worth waiting for. At last, available here in Belgium but what a disappointment it was. Knowing the director for the sublime 'Alias' this flick is just one to see and to forget. It starts out fine by getting to understand the individuals and suddenly hell breaks out. After the first attack of the monster a cellphone is ringing and suddenly it's all about romantic. It made me think of that other crap 'Godzilla the remake'. there is no gore let's even say any suspense in this flick. It's normal that this one will be compared with Blair Witch but BWP was at least creepy. I understand that in the US people were talking about the attack on NY remembering 9/11. I'm glad that I have seen the movie but will not buy it and will never have any moment of wanting to see it again. And knowing that they are talking about Cloverfield 2 only makes me shiver, no thanks",Cloverfield
38,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Cloverfield,9,17 January 2008,"OMIGAWD! OMIGAWD! RUN! OMIGAWD! HELP! GET THE HELL OUT! OMIGAWD!You'd be expecting to hear a lot of that, but not to fret, the rest of this review is spoiler free, guaranteed! So we've weathered a six month wait since the teaser trailer premiered with Michael Bay's Transformers (and draws some parallels, more on that later), and set the net buzzing with its many viral marketing sites appearing online, some red herrings, some dangling treats for those who can't wait to guess just what the movie will be titled (well, just Cloverfield), and speculate on how the creature, if it was one, would look like.In recent history, Hollywood had tried this stunt before. Remember the Godzilla of 1998? Audiences were teased with a tail here, a roar there, and the filmmakers pretty much had the monster kept under tight wraps. Until it opened, and because it failed to live up to its hype, and didn't meet everyone's expectations of how the good old Japanese lizard would look like and behave, it tanked at the box office. Now, Cloverfield adopted similar strategies in having us hear a roar, and to witness its destructive powers, without a visual clue of what it looked like. Did it deliver?Strangely enough, in my opinion, yes. Don't get me wrong, as I was leaning toward, and close to committing the cardinal sin of loathing a movie prior to experiencing it for myself first hand. I was apprehensive about watching something that perpetually couldn't keep still, and yet its technique adopted in presenting the movie worked perfectly. Like Blair Witch Project, we witness a series of events as unfolded through the lens of a hand-held consumer camera. In doing so, we forgo watching the movie from a third person perspective, and get plunged head on to first person instead. In this age of reality television, exclusive news scoops, youtube voyeurism, this shakycam technique works in putting us there where the action is, watching things unfold, raw.Imagine, just if, a big unknown were to happen. You push and probe, and frankly, get scared, wondering what to do next, worry about your loved ones, and probably would just follow the masses. Cloverfield took a simple, tried and tested story about a monster invasion in the scale of Godzilla's, and played with us - what if we were caught in the same situation with the monster pounding everything in sight - what would we do? We take pictures for our blogs. Then run.I would put my neck out even to say that there is no grounds of comparison between Cloverfield, and one of my recent monster movie favourite The Host, simply because it's like comparing apples and oranges. The latter decided to show all very early in the movie, and had a strong focus and emphasis on the family of characters. Here, we don't feel much for the yuppies, we somehow become one of them, the videocam being our eyes and ears. And the creature, while we don't see it in full glory clearly, makes it all the more menacing. It plays on actual fear - we catch a glimpse, then quickly run away - and I thought it made the 1998 Godzilla look like a pussy with so much unexplained, that this uncertainty breeds and grows within you.But of course there will be some quick to dismiss this along the lines similar to those who dislike Transformers on the grounds that there isn't enough screen time for what mattered to them - ""we're here to see robots/monsters, so give us the robots/monsters!"" As mentioned, there are nice moments where we sneak a peek at the rampaging creature, but there will be those whose appetite remain insatiate. Bear in mind though the point here is to experience what it would be like if you're stuck in a similar situation yourself (wonder why this wasn't available in IMAX format), rather than watching in God mode, the narrative unfold in extended Starship Troopers style. And similar to Transformers, Odette Yustman is your new Megan Fox, except that she goes back to being the classic damsel.Cloverfield, if it makes enough money at the box office, leaves plenty of room with multiple doors wide open to possibilities of spin offs, prequels, sequels, and probably even a television series, animated or live action, or through any other visual medium. You can essentially repeat the same premise, but from different points of view - trust me, there are enough - and can probably build an entire community of creative work just around this one simple flint to sustain a campfire.OMIGAWD!",Cloverfield
39,siderite,Refreshing immersive view in a Godzilla clone,8,26 June 2008,"The movie was definitely well thought and done. I give it high marks because of the actual thinking that was involved in creating the concept of the movie. After all, anything else in a film is secondary to the main concept. The actors played well, the music score was suitable and the special effects great.However, something was missing from it. Or something was extra. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Whenever I got closer to their state of mind that annoying guy would start shouting 'Oh, my god' again and again and that spoiled it immensely. What can I say, maybe Americans or at least New Yorkers would feel differently watching the film. The greatest problem, I think, was that they first 20 minutes were completely useless. If you watch the movie from minute 17, actually, you are not missing anything relevant.Bottom line: it is a great tension movie. A bit of horror, a little monster here and there, lots of 'out of control' fear... I think it worth watching and definitely one of the best horror movies around.",Cloverfield
40,StevePulaski,Post-9/11 reaction/response intimately examined through the lens of a raucous creature feature,9,10 March 2016,"Matt Reeves' Cloverfield would be a significant film if it was only noteworthy for being the film that resurrected the found footage genre. With a minimalist marketing campaign of MySpace pages and trailers that emphasized the film's theatrical release date and nothing more, plus a whirlwind of positive buzz that hyped the film for much of the start of the 2008 year, Cloverfield was destined to be a history-making hit when it finally hit the scenes. However, as an encapsulation of post-9/11/""War on Terror"" fear, the film is an unequivocal cultural staple of such simply by showing senseless disaster unfold and showcasing lives that we, the audience, otherwise wouldn't care about had they not been the focal point of this particular film. Few other films about this little find themselves saying so much.The film opens with a disclaimer by the United States Department of Defense that the film contained on the camcorder herein was seized as a piece of evidence that was found at a location by the name of ""Cloverfield,"" ""formerly known as Central Park."" The tape largely includes footage from a going-away party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), who will be traveling to Japan to become the vice president for a new company, only on occasion cutting away to a video shot after both Rob and his friend Beth (Odette Yustman) have sex, indicating the film being taped over. During his going-away party, thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and filmed by his buddy Hudson Platt (T.J. Miller), who is traversing the entire loft to get video testimonies to congratulate his pal, not only does Rob's secret of sleeping with Beth come out, but so does a gigantic monster that begins destroying New York City in every conceivable way.At first, a thunderous shakeup and a brief power outage suggest an abruptly violent earthquake, but when buildings begin to explode and skyscrapers start crumbling, we can see that a bigger, more unexplainable force is behind these bouts of chaos. Through short glimpses captured by Hudson's camera, we can see that a strange, gray beast of about thirty stories resembling the most deformed monster that Godzilla would fight, is practically walking all over New York City, to the point where it is killing innocent lives and making everything a horrifying mess for everyone within the vicinity. The plan for the group of friends, which also includes Lily (Jessica Lucas), Jason's girlfriend, is to evacuate New York as quickly as possible, but that changes when Rob's call to Beth reveals nothing more than a distressed, blood-curdling scream that suggests she is pinned underneath the rubble of a building. The gang winds up deviating the course instructed by the U.S. Army in order to try and rescue Beth and dodge the towering monster.Cloverfield takes a Jaws-like approach to profiling the monster in the picture (or ""monsters,"" as I'd like to keep open as a possibility for myself) in that it shows the creature largely in small, blink-and-you-miss-it glimpses. This has become common practice for found footage films, but Cloverfield employs the tactic with a bit of grace and buildup. Rather than acting like a metaphorical ""dollar on a live fishing reel,"" director Matt Reeves makes sure to conjure up adequate suspense before he even thinks about showing us the monster at hand. After that, every small sip we get of the monster makes us fear that we'll eventually get a longer ""gulp"" of the monster that we could choke on if we're not ready.Reeves keeps us on edge most of the film, and the chaos portrayed in this film is anything but controlled. The videography has the aesthetic grace of an unedited video in a warzone, the sound editing and mixing occasionally feels like it was sent through a blender, and the film, as a work of cinema and the respective found footage genre, is a sensory annihilation. As frustrating as this can be, this process, much like Reaves' directorial conservatism of showing us just small features of the monster and his destructive actions throughout the course of the seventy-three minute film, manages to reveal some truly beautiful and telling moments. Consider the scene when the group of partygoers, and the remainder of New York City for that matter, witness the monster throw the head of the Statue of Liberty over a mile in length before it crashes before them on a busy street. The gaggle of people stand in awe, some frozen in fear, some quick to snap a picture, and some sprinting to safety.The location of this film and the confusing circumstances are not coincidental; Cloverfield is, in some big ways, a reference to the mass hysteria and uncertainty that the 9/11 terrorist attacks brought on the United States. Actions that we were used to hearing about occurring overseas were suddenly in our metaphorical, and some literal, backyards, and the casualties, the incalculable destruction, and the disregard for life were something we could not ignore. Cloverfield attempts to replicate that feeling right down to its marketing campaign, which tells us little and leaves us with limited expectations. What we witness, however, is something that will leave a mark on many of us, or at least remind us of a similar time in America.Starring: Michael Stahl-David, T.J. Miller, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel, and Jessica Lucas. Directed by: Matt Reeves.",Cloverfield
41,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I have to say, I am extremely impressed",8,4 February 2008,"I didn't want to see Cloverfield when I saw the trailer, it looked like another Blair Witch Project, it was going to get all our hopes up and then when it played, it would disappoint. But when my friend saw the film, she said that it was interesting and worth a look. So I went ahead and saw the film today and I was very impressed with the story. Even though the camera work made me a little nauseous, from where the story was told from made it all more real. It was interesting to see the film from the character's point of view and not only that, it looked so real and really scared the heck out of me. I was thinking how weird it was though that someone would record the whole thing, but in today's world, unfortunately, we have those people who think they are automatically professional documentations. This film was a mix of the 1950's sci-fi and Blair Witch that was actually scary.A group of friends are having a celebration for a their friend, Rob, who is going away to Japan. In the middle of the party, Rob and a girl friend of his, Beth have a fight and she leaves. While a friend, Hud, is filming the party, a huge crash happens in the middle of Manhattan, they go outside and see the Statue of Liberty's head in the middle of the street and see something like Godzilla destroying the city. As the group makes a run for it, Rob hears a voice mail on his cell from Beth that she's trapped, he, his brother's girlfriend, Lily, Hud with the camera, and Marlena go to get her, but end up getting attacked by little creatures. But when three survive, they continue on to save Beth, but time is running out before Manhattan is truly gone.Cloverfield is a good film because it's different than any other horror film we have seen for a while. Believe me, it's a thousand times better than the Blair Witch Project, this has truly scary and intense moments that will leave you breathless and make you feel like you're right there with the group just wishing to get out of there. Strangely, there is a love story in here that was actually touching, Rob is so determined to get to Beth and he risks his life big time, even though there's a possibility she's already dead, so it added some terrific emotion to the story. Cloverfield is a great horror film, I was very impressed and I highly recommend it.8/10",Cloverfield
42,lasttimeisaw,Cloverfield,7,31 May 2012,"As the instigator of pseudo-documentary horror/sci-fi, four-years later, I finally got the chance to watch it, stripped down to the film per se, a 80 minutes running time has testified the audience's extreme endurance toward the dizziness side effect thanks to the unbreakable Super 8 which could shoot 8 hours non-stop, surely with an ultra-battery. This J.J. Abrams co-produced work was a tremendous success in the spring box office at its time and astutely centers on a firsthand POV of a group of average Joes, facing an unknown monster ravaging Manhattan, in order to keep the DV on the spot, leading by a tacky individual heroism, four friends goes back into the danger zone to rescue another friend in the name of love, clearly casualties are inevitable, but the viscerally thrilling involvement is the chief payoff owing to the vivid participation out of the shaky disturbance along the entire excursion, say the night vision adventure in the metro tunnel is a highlight. Another great asset is the jaw-dropping SFX of the monster and the aftermath it creates, after tons of SFX mega-products' impetus, this relatively low-budget film could still get some awesome wows which is simply remarkable and at least on an equal level with J.J.'s own DV- intrigued supernatural monster thriller SUPER 8 (2011). Being a feigned fly-on-the-wall scheme, there is no room for scores except the solemn ending-credit ""CLOVERFIELD OVERTURE"" from Michael Giacchino, a surprisingly remarkable piece of work which I was not expected at all. Anyway, I feel lucky I hadn't watch the film in a screen time of a multiplex, I highly doubt myself could sustain the upsetting 80 minutes, which prompts a more innovative wake-up call in the realm of technology progress, we are in desperate seeking of the further development of a stable DV, maybe when that time arrives, a remake will be on the agenda.",Cloverfield

44,KineticSeoul,First high quality found footage movie I saw when it came out,7,16 June 2016,"This is probably the first high budget found footage movie I have seen. it's a giant monster movie that shows it from the normal civilians point of view with a simple story. The simplistic direction for the most part works for a movie such as this as a whole. Cause I don't see how making the whole thing more complex would make this film any better. It's sort of outdated when it comes to today's standards when it comes to movies. But then again there is multiple ""Paranormal Activity"" movies that is just there to rake in the cash. Without giving much away, just think of a Godzilla movie except it goes in a found footage direction where just about everything is in first person view mode. And at it's core, it's a love story about a guy and his friends going the distance. I think this is the movie that started the high quality found footage movie trend. Overall, it was actually something new when I saw it in theaters in 2008. And it's still a watchable movie today.7.4/10",Cloverfield
45,OllieSuave-007,Had to take a Dramaine to watch this.,4,25 May 2014,"This is an entire movie shot with a shaky camcorder that tells about a monster attack in New York, told from the point-of-view of a group of youngsters. Because of the shakiness of the picture, the film was an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience. I had to take a Dramamine and lay down on the sofa to watch the movie. I know the filmmakers wanted to make a unique film that captures the tension and atmosphere of the people with the camcorder's viewpoint; however, this film did have several flaws: The story was confusing to follow - just a lot of mishmash and running around; the character developments were non-existent; visual effects were bad (you can hardly see the monster); and the acting was below average.I do have to admit that the overall monster presence was pretty thrilling, reminding you of a Godzilla-like creature. However, I would pass on this film over something more steadier to watch. There are a lot much better giant monster movies out there. Grade D-",Cloverfield
46,sddavis63,It Has Ups And Downs But Mostly Ups,7,14 November 2008,"Cloverfield surely has to rank as one of the better ""monster"" movies made in a long time. It's filmed in a style reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project"" - one of the characters has a hand held camera and records the unbelievable events surrounding an attack on New York by a huge, somewhat dinosaur looking monster (although we never really get a clear look at it) that somehow drops little ""mini-monsters"" that create their own havoc. The film is then supposedly discovered by the government after the event. The weakest part of the movie, I thought, was the opening 20 minutes or so, focused on a party being given for one of the characters who's moving to Japan. To be honest, I found that whole thing a bore (and some of the rather unimportant material introduced in that opening kept seeping into the rest of the movie unfortunately) but once the monster is introduced (by way of what seemed to be a sort of earthquake that rattled everything and even made me jump) it becomes a very entertaining and at times rather frightening movie. It's at times confusing - and deliberately so, since it's attempting to draw you into the absolute chaos and terror that has suddenly engulfed this group of people. There's an eerie resemblance here to scenes of 9/11, with buildings collapsing and clouds of dust choking everything and papers flying through the air. Overall, it's very well done, definitely draws you in after that slow start and maintains the atmosphere of panic all the way through. 7/10",Cloverfield
47,Buddy-51,stunning visuals overcome narrative weaknesses,7,10 May 2008,"You sure gotta' give those New Yorkers props for resilience. If they aren't doing battle with space aliens, a bio-engineered plague, or a global warming-inspired ice age, they're fending off a nondescript creature that's come out of nowhere to lay waste to large sections of Lower and Midtown Manhattan. And indeed, after ""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" and now ""Cloverfield,"" one wonders just how much abuse one little island should be expected to take before finally crying uncle.Blending the content of ""Godzilla"" with the style of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the makers of ""Cloverfield"" relate their story entirely through the use of a hand-held camera, as a group of twenty-something friends have their cocktail party rudely interrupted by the sudden appearance of a monster capable of tipping over skyscrapers and squashing cars as if they were bugs. The movie follows a remnant of partygoers as they wend their way through the smoky chaos of the ruined city, with one of them recording the horrors and devastation on a camcorder as he goes.Despite having a relatively low budget for a film of this type, ""Cloverfield"" does a remarkable job in blending CGI graphics with home video technology. It may be true that the inky blackness of the nighttime setting helps to cover a multitude of special effects sins (some viewers may be frustrated by the murky indistinctiveness of the monster itself), but, on the whole, director Matt Reeves, cinematographer Michael Bonvillain, editor Kevin Stitt, and a team of highly talented FX and production artists are to be commended for achieving so much with so little.The advantage of the you-are-there approach that the filmmakers have adopted is that it makes the audience feel more a part of the actual event than if the story were given a slicker, more conventional presentation. Suffice it to say there's no Will Smith here slapping on a flight suit and zooming off into the wild blue yonder to duke it out mano-a-mano with the creature and singlehandedly save the world. These are ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and it's no coincidence that much of the imagery is clearly intended to evoke memories of 9/11. After all, a world where post-apocalyptic paranoia runs rampant is no place for conventional action heroes. Therefore, the verisimilitude of the piece is greatly enhanced by the use of relatively unknown players in the key roles (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel).The disadvantage of this 1st person-restricted approach is that it occasionally leads to repetitiveness in the storytelling, with even the gimmick itself threatening to wear out its welcome quicker than the monster himself does. The narrow focus is also liable to drive some viewers crazy by not providing any kind of resolution or explanation to neatly wrap things up at the end (to me, this is a strength rather than a weakness).Finally, theatergoers who were rendered nauseated by the nonstop bobbing-and-weaving camera-work on the big screen should know that the effect is much less pronounced when viewed on TV.The characters and their relationships may be no more than mere window dressing placed at the service of the story, but that really doesn't matter, for in the case of ""Cloverfield,"" the film-making itself is the star.",Cloverfield
48,thesar-2,Godzilla VS. the Blair Witch,6,16 October 2009,"What an achievement 'Cloverfield' was. From no-name actors, to no-name title, to one of the most influential advertising campaigns to the movie it mimicked: 'Blair Witch Project.' It also ranks as one of the shortest movies I've ever seen (actual screen time: 73 minutes) yet it seems 3x that. And this includes a 19 minute introduction that seems like 4x that. So, in total, you get a real 54 minutes of movie you wanted: Monster attacking NYC. Unfortunately, it's short on depth for characters, even with that lovey-dovey 19 minute prelude with yuppies we are supposed to care about, but don't. If anything, we care more about the fabulous view from their apartment(s) than their shallow lives. After the initial 19 shaky-camera minutes trying to find out who's who and why, you get an almost identical remake of the remake of 'Godzilla' (1998.) You're treated to a giant whatchamacalit who spawns off little creatures to get in those ""hard-to-reach"" areas the beast can't fit in. Okay, I liked the movie. It's fun, it's completely realistic; where there is complete chaos and without the news at your fingertips, you really don't know what's going on. You have to give it to the film makers to making possibly the most plausible monster B-Movie of all time. Unfortunately, even with (as mentioned) just 54 minutes of true footage, you get the feeling they stretched this out as thin as it would go. In addition, you get incredibly, and I mean down-right unbelievably stupid people to follow during this crisis. Half the movie is a senseless rescue mission. My friend and I made a pack following the film: if I were caught, leave me be, save yourself! Honestly, I would love to see a sequel, to learn more, but please drop the camera.",Cloverfield
49,cherold,Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying,6,18 October 2011,"Take the hand-held camera gimmick of The Blair Witch Project and marry it to a standard monster-destroys-city flick and you've got Cloverfield. It's an interesting way to tell a monster movie, seen closely through the eyes of a small, bland group of friends caught up in the disaster, yet while I found it interesting it never really pulled me in, and the ending did not make me happy.You can't talking about this movie without talking about Blair Witch, mainly because Blair Witch took the same gimmick and got so much more out of it. Even though that earlier movie had a fraction of the budget, it used the device so much more effectively; compare the final talking to the camera scenes from both films and tell me Cloverfield's is even a tenth as effective.It is also less convincing as a premise. The guy with the camera is oddly devoted to documenting the event, to the point where he will stand back and film when he should be helping. In the real world, one of his friends would have grabbed the camera and threw it against a wall. Because of the way it's done, you never forget that this is just a clever device. Blair Witch was more convincing because the camera was the whole point and you were dealing with someone who would think in those terms.Still, it does have it's good points. Because we see everything from one point of view, we get information in bits and pieces and never get anything like a real explanation of what's going on. There are individually effective scenes. The cameraman is vaguely likable, although everyone else is pretty forgettable.Ultimately though, the hand-held single view camera is not an effective way to film action or horror scenes, the story and characters fail to be interesting, and the ending is very disappointing. It's interesting enough to watch, but it could have been so much better.",Cloverfield

51,Robert_duder,The first big monster hit of the New Year fares well,8,23 January 2008,"Shrouded in mystery Cloverfield will likely be remembered for a brilliant marketing campaign that left everyone who saw Transformers in the summer wondering what the heck is that monster clobbering New York City. My first instinct was whatever was big and strong enough to decapitate the State of Liberty and make that much disaster was going to get over hyped and be disappointing to finally see on the big screen but I was dead wrong in that aspect. I wasn't even remotely disappointed by the monster. JJ Abrams is a brilliant director, and writer and has created some really terrific things including the mystery shrouded ""Lost"" TV Series and you can definitely see some of that carry over into Cloverfield. The one thing that everyone should know and will know coming out of this is that all the questions you have going into the film, you'll have the same ones coming out and probably a lot more. But this is the idea because you're not watching this film...you're experiencing it. You're right there with all the other survivors trying to stay alive and there are numerous ways that they went about doing this. The first if the much debated about 'hand cam.' I do agree it was overplayed, a little annoying, but didn't make me motion sick. They left it still enough to really get the feeling of the whole situation but I just really wanted to see everything slower and more stable. I understand perfectly why they did it that way...I just wasn't a huge fan. Second of all I've never sat in a movie where the sound was so carefully plotted. When that beast roars for the first time it literally vibrated my seat and you felt like you were right there.The literal cast of nobodies are brilliant. Michael Stahl-David is the lead Rob Hawkins who is looking at moving up in the corporate world and is attending a surprise going away party for him when disaster strikes. Stahl-David is a hero because he's just a regular guy caught in disastrous situations. He looks smooth, cool, well liked and yet normal. He goes through the emotions perfectly and draws you in and has great charisma on screen. T.J. Miller is a very important character but probably has less than 5 minutes of screen time and is yet probably 'on screen' more than anyone else. He's the man behind the hand cam and his acting relies on his voice and his emotion and his actions and he does well. He's inappropriately funny at times but I think that IS his character's way. He is basically narrating the situation while experiencing it and it works. Jessica Lucas is Rob's brother's girlfriend and does a good job in her role. She is sort of the scream queen of the situation and in that aspect she does very well. Lizzy Caplan is terrific as the straight faced, goth like girl who is the only one victim to being actually bitten by part of this beast. She has one of the most talked about and mysterious scenes and she is terrific in a very subtle quiet way.There is obviously a certain suspension of belief required to see Cloverfield and kudos to Abrams for attempting to deal with it. The idea that someone in this situation would continually ensure they were holding on to a video camera no matter what is kind of ludicrous and although he insists in the film that people will want to see this...there is a point when any normal person would have dropped the camera and ran like hell. Still I completely understand why they opted to do the hand camera...it feels real and it works. I also understand why they left the shroud of mystery BUT it doesn't make either one of those things any more tolerable. I enjoyed experiencing this monster attack but I wanted from an entertainment value to KNOW the background, the secrets, the origin....nobody likes leaving with that many questions and maybe they'll serialize Cloverfield but it'll never have the same impact that this original film has. Despite some unfortunate fatal flaws Cloverfield is a monster of a movie and a great time at the movies. The first blockbuster of the year. And it makes people argue, debate, and wonder and that is always healthy for intellect. 8/10*************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work.",Cloverfield
52,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Looks like King Kong's got some competition...,9,1 March 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Morning *** Friday Night ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Some up scale Manhattan teenagers are celebrating the leaving do of one of their top mates, only to hear a loud crashing noise outside and for absolute chaos and pandemonium to follow quickly after. Hordes of panicky people start rampaging through the city, running, rioting and looting and the destruction doesn't seem to be stopping. It soon becomes clear that a huge monster is stampeding through the city, with no clear plan of attack and destroying everything in it's path. This is one problem that'll take more than Mayor Giuliani to sort out.Okay, I'm not watching anymore films set in New York for the rest of the year until I've actually been. I said it in my recent I Am Legend review and I'm saying it now. I want my first ever trip there later this year to be as big a surprise as possible and I don't want to see all the best bits in the films before I go, thank you very much.There, now I've got that little rant off my chest lets get onto the actual film itself. It's one of those weird, high concept films that's been doing pretty well mainly down to word of mouth and will now probably get a cult status as a result. And I'm happy to say, it does really deserve it.Spinning off from the style of The Blair Witch Project, with it's use of a hand-held camera recording the words and actions of unknown actors in the face of absolute terror, the film creates an impressive mood of claustrophobia and bewilderment, with some genuinely terrifying jump moments to move it along. A big budget must have been required for the monster effects and special effects through-out but the film is shot all the way through in camcorder footage, which some have struggled to adapt to, but in these post 9/11 (which was first caught on camera) days is actually all the more terrifying, even if at times you want to laugh out loud at how ludicrous and far fetched the story actually is, as well as the absurdity of someone filming it all at a time when they must be quavering for their lives.Kong was taken to NY against his will. The Cloverfield monster wants to be there. And you want to see him. ****",Cloverfield
53,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Frenetic and in-the-moment but ever-so-slightly one-note.,6,19 October 2018,"'Cloverfield (2008)' is an insular alien invasion film that puts its focus on its in-the-moment, frenetic action as our characters scramble to survive the large-scale situation in which they're placed. This is really all it does with any degree of certainty - or confidence, perhaps - as it lacks the character depth or narrative prowess to provide any deeper investment or, even, enjoyment. The hand-held, found-footage style is usually handled well and most of the piece is believable (a few dodgy effects aside). It's no more believable than it would've been if filmed traditionally, though, and the lack of any extra personality or intimacy, which could've quite easily come with such a conceit, makes it feel ever-so-slightly one note; it's certainly no 'Searching (2018)', that's for sure. However, there's entertainment to be had when the alien threat puts our core players - and almost, by extension, us - in real, hectic danger. 6/10",Cloverfield
54,dromasca,Godzila Meets the Blair Witch Project,7,3 June 2009,"It could have been a very banal horror movie. Or it could have been a special effects blockbuster. Yet director Matt Reeves chose to do something different here. He put a video camera in the hands of one of his rather uninteresting yuppie characters and pretended that the whole film is a documentary starting with a good-bye party in Manhattan and continuing with a monster attack that plunges into pure horror, sometimes looking painfully similar to the amateur shots of the terror attacks on 9/11.This improbable combination works better than expected. The amateur camera pretext beautifully compensates for the low budget of the special effects. With the course of action cut every few seconds by the pretended lack of skills of the camera handler or better said handlers the linearity and simplicity of the characters are hidden and the holes of the plot not so evident. We never see too much of the monster because as soon as we see him the human holding the video camera needs to run for his life, but this adds to the unknown of the story. And by the end it looks like the camera may be the only survivor of the bloody series of events.This film could have been yet another teen horror or monster flick. It tries, dares, and succeeds to be something different.",Cloverfield
55,ThomasDrufke,Found Footage Masterpiece,8,18 February 2016,"Even though it supposedly doesn't have a ton of links to the original, I thought it may be a good idea to take back at Cloverfield in preparation for the forthcoming 10 Cloverfield Lane. Cloverfield is about a group of friends attending a going away party in New York City when suddenly a gigantic creature attacks the city. The group is thrust into the unbelievable task of making their way through the streets of New York in hopes of saving one of their friends.In an era where the term found footage films started to become a gimmick that people scoffed at, Cloverfield manages to make use of its filming technique to perfection. More impressive though, is the filmmakers ability to get us to care about each and every one of the main characters so that when an emotional scene arrives, we feel for them. Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams did a wonderful job of bringing this film to life as the director and producer respectively. Not only is the film incredibly original in its story telling, but the special effects and realistic take on a monster invasion felt so refreshing to watch. Not everybody makes it out alive and when people die, you don't see it coming. That to me, is a film that nails exactly what its going for.The cast wasn't and to a certain extent still isn't all that well- known. TJ Miller and Lizzy Caplan being the exceptions as they have broken out into fame. Even with that said, I thought the performances all around were exceptional. I got the vibe from all of the characters that they were really seeing a monster/creatures for the first time and the decision to use hand-held cameras was extremely effective. Miller was perfect for the character who filmed everything as he brought just the right amount of humor and terror to every scene. I also believed and cared for the love story they were trying to sell me on with Rob trying to reach Beth for a good portion of the film.In many ways, Cloverfield is a look inside the lives of people who would be on the streets in any invasion/superhero film. Perhaps rightfully so, we don't really ever get a chance to see from a normal person's view of the events. The emotion and humor are definitely present, and the action is also handled extremely well as there are a fair share of necessary jump scares. Cloverfield is easily my favorite found footage film along with one of the best invasion sci-fi films of the last decade or so.+Reeves & Abrams direction+Scary & haunting at times+Performances+Found footage choice made sense+Balance of humor and emotion was on point8.7/10",Cloverfield
56,Cineanalyst,America's Godzilla,5,17 April 2020,"Although Hollywood has remade ""Godzilla"" a few times, it never made much sense as an American monster movie. That's because the original ""Gojira"" was an allegory for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. ""Cloverfield"" is a similar cinematic processing in the kaiju tradition of national tragedy, that of 9/11. Others have done likewise with sci-fi adaptation (""War of the Worlds"" (2005)), superhero fare (""The Avengers"" (2012), Man of Steel"" (2013)) and still others merely add robots to combat the kaiju (""Pacific Rim"" (2013)), or make the kaiju robotic (""Transformers""). In other words, there's been a lot of movies translating the attacks to an invasion from outer-space aliens--one world fighting another and usually turned into a cinematic universe or, otherwise, a franchise. ""Avatar"" (2009) even reverses the trajectory by having Americans as the invaders of an alien planet. Anyways, ""Cloverfield"" appropriately enough includes, reportedly, blinking footage from early American monster movies ""King Kong"" (1933), ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" (1953) and ""Them!"" (1954) (although the Statue of Liberty head, referencing ""Escape from New York"" (1981), is better done).The gimmick added on this in ""Cloverfield,"" besides the much remarked upon paratextual marketing schemes of the franchise, is the pretending found footage--a technique popularized in horror movies by ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) and preceded by ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (1980). Theoretically, this offers the simplicity of the spectator's gaze, already associated with or directed by that of the camera, to be directly associated with a character or multiple ones--something that classically is done more loosely by a series of looks (e.g. shot of protagonist looking at something or someone being followed by a direct cut to a shot of what they're looking at). Unfortunately, the main character as camera here is portrayed by T.J. Miller. On the other hand, the handheld camerawork putting us in the point-of-view of the character also distances us from him to the extent that he's largely removed from the footage. That the footage is supposedly found further removes them. In a sense, they're already dead even if the characters didn't turn out that way by movie's end.Besides the tediousness, if not downright offensiveness, of making cinematic spectacle out of 9/11--an act of terrorism that was already remarkable, for among other obvious reasons, as a televised spectacle--""Cloverfield"" also offers a hackneyed and simplistic setup, of a surprise party and unrequited love--this time, abruptly interrupted by immersive alien invasion pandemonium. Miller's idiot doesn't even provide effective comedic relief, and the other characters are wooden. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016) is better simply because it has compelling characterizations, and its black humor rather works.Others have also commented on the obscuring of the view of the aliens, as aided by the found-footage style--as a character more afraid for their life and running away rather than trying to capture the best camera angles, but we get pretty good and increasingly better looks at the monster and monsters and their destruction before that final facial close-up. It's hardly Lovecraftian, and if anything the camerawork is suspiciously too good to pull off the effect. One of many alien-invasion 9/11 movie metaphors and another horror flick to employ the found-footage technique is not a philosophically cosmic exploration of the unknown, either. Regardless, the technique does echo how much of 9/11 was actually recorded and presented on TV, and it's interesting to track how tragic national events, from WWII and before through the War on Terror have been represented figuratively in cinema. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a slew of pandemic parables on screen in the years to come. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" already resonates more today with much of the world under shelter-in-place orders. This is the second time I've seen the original ""Cloverfield,"" as well, but it hasn't improved as such with age; if anything, what may have been seen by some as novel in 2008 isn't very impressive with hindsight.",Cloverfield
57,g-bodyl,Very Intense!,9,16 January 2009,"I remember when I first saw the trailer for this. There was no title for this film. I was anxious to view this film. Over a year and a half later, I finally got the chance. This is very good. It is filmed as if this movie is reality: a hand-held camera, unknown people screaming, etc.The beginning is calm and peaceful. There is a party being held for Rob, the main character, because he is leaving for work in Japan. All the sudden, trembling begins and an oil tanker is capsized. It was caused by a gigantic, Godzilla-like monster. Now, NYC is being evacuated. But someone is trapped.....The actors did a great job. Most of these actor are relatively unknown. I had the feeling that these actors were actually scared. Towards the end, there are great special effects. Also, the monster scared me. It looked like an ugly beast with the cross between Godzilla and an elephant.I was disappointed about a few things. There was no music to add to the suspense and the camera was a little shaky at times.Overall, this is an intense film that fans of horror movies will like. I rate this movie 9/10.",Cloverfield

59,CuriosityKilledShawn,Stomps all over Roland Emmerich's Godzilla,8,10 February 2008,"Only once in a rare while are we treated to a movie so innovative and unique. It's sad to think that there will only be so many film-going experiences like Cloverfield in my life while the void is filled with more generic fare. In terms of story it is very similar to the awful 1998 clunker Godzilla, but is a world apart when it comes to execution.Everyone by now knows the premise of the filming of a loft party being interrupted by the arrival of a giant monster in Manhattan, so I won't go into loads of description over that. I'm a firm believer in the fact that the camera is the eyes of the person watching the film and with Cloverfield (like The Blair Witch Project before it) we are put right into the central character's shoes as he stumbles around the darkest corners of the city with his ever diminishing group of friends.It's been repeated a million times, but I too believe that what we DON'T see is scarier than what we do. Once you bring the monster out of the shadows all the mystery and fear evaporates. For the majority of the movie we never really get to see all of the monster, perhaps a tentacle here or a foot there, but not much of the whole thing. We do get to see a lot of the ugly parasites that cling to its body however.There are some brilliant and eternally memorable scenes in Cloverfield, the best being hard to nail down but I loved the idea of entering a crooked skyscraper via the deserted tower that it's leaning against. What a truly unique set-piece.Of course the movie is going to have it's critics and there will be plenty who are not satisfied with the ending. JJ Abrams has said that he plans to do a single sequel from another point of view, but I feel this will ruin the magic.In fact, JJ Abrams' marketing campaign and back-story has already tarnished the film for me a little bit. He has stated that the monster comes from the sea but I prefer to not know for certain where it comes from. I imagined it coming from outer space myself as the idea of a random creature arriving from the infinite darkness of space to far more terrifying than a monster from the limited environment of our own oceans. And the viral marketing is way out of hand. Let me put set it all straight.Rob Hawkins has been made vice president of a company in Japan. That company is the Slusho soft drink firm. Marlena is seen drinking plenty of Slusho at the beginning of the film. The parasites on the creature apparently eat the secret ingredient of Slusho deep in the ocean. They smelled this on her, which explains why she is the only one of the group who is bitten. The near-unnoticeable 'splash' in the water at the end of the film is part of a satellite which has fallen out of space and apparently wakes up the monster somehow.What a load of garbage! Is Rob Hawkins the centre of the universe or something? Why is all this contrived crap revolving around him? Why they came up with this drivel instead of leaving it all unexplained is beyond me. Nevertheless, I will still be looking forward to the sequel next year.",Cloverfield
60,tabuno,"Boring, Manipulative, Unconvincing, and Dull",3,21 January 2019,"20 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. Except for the very last shot, Cloverfield is a rip off of The Blair Witch Project (1999) of the worst kind. It attempts to take a hand-held video cam and add a more complex plot along with special effects and expect to actually re-create the magic of the original attempt. Unfortunately, from a personal perspective, this was one of the worst movies I've experienced in a while. There is something to be said about the appropriate media format for the theatrical experience. It was the very idea of this was a video tape that distanced me from the action, I didn't feel that I was part of it, I was watching a filtered version, buffered by time and distance. Most of the movie was boring, like watching a home film movie without any editing. The interesting part is that the attempt to imply property of the U.S. Government, as a document, it would have been more believable and effective if the movie had been based on a collection of edited videotapes of the same event. The beginning segment, pre-monster scenes are too manipulative, the exaggerated attempt to make amateur mistakes in filming the scenes became too clique and made the movie feel unreal and fake. The first obvious technical flaw in the movie occurred with the relative quickness of the live televised news report that was recorded by the apparent video cam. The news report came so suddenly right after the strange pounding, vibration that it added to the manipulative unreality. There was a underground scene where the light from the video cam is used to light a path, except what we mostly see are the lighted backs of people that deflect the light so the people shouldn't be able to see where they are going. There is also a scene where an injured woman is haphazardly taken care of, unlike what would occur in real life and then another women is pealed off a metal rod that would most likely of killed her (as the rod itself was likely sealing broken arteries). We have a helicopter that of course gets too close to the monster, we have only the main character's surviving the crash and not the crew. A more effective movie was Brainstorm (1983) that took virtual reality to a new level more almost a quarter of a century ago when it was released, bringing the audience into the movie not pushing them away. The restrictive nature of the single hand-held camera perspective omits so much more film scenes such as the man who falls to his death off a bridge. There is so much that is missed, so much continuity lost, so much choppy editing that there flow of the movie is overly disturbed. Hopefully, film makers will make movies not this return to live reality movie making unless their prepared to really work to make it more authentic, audience involving, and emotionally interesting. Three out of Ten Stars.",Cloverfield
61,ironhorse_iv,Cloverfield was a monster hit!,7,6 May 2014,"What I love about Cloverfield is how much mystery was leading up to the film premiere and how much the movie after years later; can leaves you with further questions. It's a thinking man's film as you're left asking yourself, what was that movie really about? Directed by Matt Reeves, Cloverfield is a mystery science fiction monster movie. The film is well-known for barely explaining anything. Coming from J.J Abrams, the producer from TV's Show 'Lost', it shouldn't be no surprise that the film will leave you with questions after watching it. Before settling on an official title, the film was marketed as 1-18-08. A lot of people didn't know what the untitled trailer for Cloverfield was about. Some thought it was a live-action adaptation of Voltron, others thought it was work from author H. P. Lovecraft 'The Call of Cthulhu' or spin-off of the TV show Lost. Due to the trailer, not having a title, so people started to use the name 'The Parasite', 'Slusho"" ""Greyshot"" ""Monstrous"" and 'Colossus' to describe it. In the end, Cloverfield was chosen as the title. Cloverfield is a weird title that makes you wonder. What does it mean? It seem to be taken off from a street from California. Well, you don't find out in the movie what it means. The film presented itself as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists video of the events of Friday, May 22, 2009 follows six young New Yorkers attending a going-away party on the night that a gigantic monster attacks the city. Occasionally, older segments are shown from a previous video that was mostly taped over showing a trip to Coney Island. What made this found footage movie different from the others, is how big budget, it was. Instead of showing us, nothing like most found footage does, we see a great deal of the monster attacks. Lots of great special effects and CGI that was scary at some points. Lots of scenery gorn. The violence was a bit graphic at times. Look for the store scene for details about that. It was great, but the shaky camera can makes some audience hurl. The film had this cinéma vérité style to look like it was taped with one hand-held camera. You can also see bits of 9/11 allusions based on the destruction in New York City, that makes the film even more disturbing to some viewers. The movie makes homage to other monsters film such as 1954 Godzilla, 1933 King Kong, 1953, the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and others. There is even homage to action movies like 1981's 'Escape from New York' such in the case of the rip Statue of Liberty head being tossed into the streets. The movie also put in Easter Eggs like the drink Slusho and the Japanese drilling company named Tagruato that served as part of the viral marketing campaign for this movie. You can see, both as Easter Eggs in many of JJ Abrams movies since then. So look forward to that. If you look closing in the Coney Island scenes, you can see a certain item hitting the ocean as foreshadowing of the monster's attack. Having the Coney Island scenes in the film, show that a lot of heart went into this film. It really give the movie so emotional value. After all, the acting is alright, but not memorable. Most of the character act like really dumb people and some can be a bit annoying at times. Without giving too much away of the downer ending, thank goodness for the Coney Island scenes to lower the blow. The DVD includes two alternative endings, which vary only slightly. The movie might hold a possible sequel, as there's a moment on the Brooklyn Bridge, with a background character was filming, the characters of the film. It show a different point of view. Overall: The entire film is one long love letter to Kaiju films but lacked substance, development, and emotional value with its damsel in distress story. The action scenes speak more than the human characters. The camera work can physically as well as mentally nauseated. In the end, it's a good B-movie story with a big blockbuster budget. Watch 2014's Godzilla, first. It works better.",Cloverfield
62,The-Sarkologist,Found Footage Monster Bash,7,5 January 2019,"The thing with found footage films is that I tend to equate them with low budget attempts to break into the film and television industry - like with films such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity (though I'm not all that sure how well such directors go after that initial attempt - as far as I can see Hollywood is still very much a closed shop union town). This actually isn't the case with Cloverfield, since it actually appears to be a big budget monster movie (if $25 mill can be considered big budget), yet done in a way that happens to be a found footage film.
I guess such a style does add an extra dimension to what is going on. Basically we are watching events unfold from the point of view of a small number of characters, and particularly we really only know what they know. The film starts of, well, sort of strangely because we have the main character Rob, and this girl Jesse, as they go on a day trip of Coney Island. However, it turns out that somebody recorded over this for a going away party for Rob. Basically, he has just scored a job in Japan. There are a few other things going on, but a sudden shaking brings the party to an end, and then an explosion in the harbour brings about a new danger - a monster.
The rest of the film is them basically attempting to escape New York City - sort of. The Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed by the monster, and then Rob learns that Jessie is still trapped inside the city, so they decide to go and rescue her, much to the displeasure of the military. Another interesting thing is that this monster is also carrying parasites, which start to fall off it resulting in more nasties running around the city.
I guess the thing about this film is that it sort of gives a new dimension to the found footage genre, and sort of goes further in it being somewhat more professional (that is with a professional studio behind it as opposed to a couple of people attempting to break into the scene). Another thing is that this does suggest the modern world's propensity in basically recording everything, but then again I suspect that this has more to do with the price of technology not only coming down, but also getting a lot smaller.
This film, well, it isn't too bad. At first I was hesitant in watching it because, well, I really don't like found footage. Sure, it was a new direction back in the late 90s, but to me it is still very much in the realm of experimental, and honestly, I really hope it doesn't go too mainstream. In a sense, it is one of those genres that really should be used sparingly, though I am sort of wandering when somebody is doing to do this using a simply moble phone camera?
As for the film, well, it is basically your typical monster movie, though making it found footage certainly adds a different dimension to it. Further, by having the main characters as simply ordinary people means that there is a lot of mystery surrounding what the monster is or where it came from. Sure, there are hints as to its origins, but nothing is ever said about it outright. In a way I thought the film was good, and somewhat enjoyable, but I would be hesitant in saying that it was great.",Cloverfield
63,jacobjohntaylor1,overrated pile pooh,4,10 April 2015,Do people of my generation have to like every thing J.J. Abrams does even if it is just a crappy knock off of the King Kong movies. Show less of the most monster and more of kids who can not act running around New York city doing stupid things and getting killed did not make this movie scary just really cheap. This movie is not scary Godzilla is scary. And I am tired of how the first remake is so underrated and this movie is so overrated. Don't get me wrong I love the original Godzilla from 1954. Even thou I like the 1998 remake more I have that movie to thank for it. It is a great movie in it's self. But this movie is carp. It as an awful ending. It is badly acted. Badly written and cheap. A monster movie were led characters are not soldiers or scientists who are going to resolve the conflict in the movie. Instead it is just stupid collage kids who are all going to be killed. Give me a break. So J.J Abrams made it get over it.,Cloverfield
64,briancham1994,Interesting experiment,8,23 August 2020,"This film was a bit of a let-down after all the hype but it was still good. As an experiment, it takes the handheld approach popularised by The Blair Witch Project (1999) and applies it to a big monster movie. The result is some tension as the characters are kept in the dark. There is some character building at the same time as the mayhem and the actors do a good job. The monster itself is a bit contrived though, as it is not explained within the film itself and it seems too invulnerable to be believable.",Cloverfield
65,zkonedog,An American Godzilla Take (Also Featuring Character Depth),9,10 March 2017,"While on vacation in Japan, film producer J.J. Abrams was startled to still see Godzilla merchandise in stores. After decades in the public eye, that monster still had a hold on the national culture. With that experience in mind, Abrams set out to have his production company--Bad Robot--create a similar tale. It succeeds wildly, not only taking viewers on a rip-roaring disaster-epic adventure, but also buffering it with enough human interest moments to make it all hang together.For a very basic overview, ""Cloverfield"" begins with a bunch of young New Yorkers throwing a going-away party for one of their own. From their high-rise, however, they witness a terrifying creature wreaking havoc on Manhattan Island. As the film's tag line says: Some thing has found us. When one of them becomes trapped and needs assistance, the film turns into a quest to retrieve her, all the while documenting the attack in a found-footage, handheld camera method of filming.There is very little ""setup"" to this movie, which is by design. Director Matt Reeves simply throws viewers into the fracas, which truly makes the experience seem visceral in a lot of ways that other films fail. You will feel as if you are right there with the main characters as they try to navigate the crumbled streets of NYC, every once in awhile getting a glimpse of the hideous, mysterious beast. The filmmakers here very much follow the ""Jaws"" rule of only showing glimpses of the creature in the early goings, building upon the suspense with further looks as the movie goes on.But ""Cloverfield"" isn't just a mindless disaster epic either. Thanks to the documentarian style of filming and the acting, the characters feel like real people (absolutely necessary for the style of the experience). This is a party that you could be at, with people you could very well know. In order to provide even further depth, the ingeniously simple plot device of showing small flashback clips on the videocamera gives all the motivation necessary to hang with the unfolding events as they happen. Multiple references to terrorism themes also center the film in a post-9/11 world.For many, ""Cloverfield"" seems to be a rather polarizing flick. Some don't like the shaky-cam style, while others don't feel it transcends a monster movie destruction epic. For me, though, in terms of pure science fiction (mixed with human drama), I consider this to be one of my favorite little films of all-time. There's never a dull moment (it has less than a 90 minute runtime to begin with) and one just gets the feeling that the entire project was a labor of love and care. While technically a ""studio film"" in the sense that it was distributed by Paramount, it was made for a thrifty $25 million and has a very ""indie"" feel to it.",Cloverfield
66,Floated2,A very rare and unique monster film,8,18 December 2010,"After reading many reviews from this film I decided to check it out. I wasn't all that interesting in the film when it came out back in 2008, so I finally decided to watch it, and I thought it was pretty good. Cloverfield is a unique monster film because of the filming method (its all by a hand-held camera). Its engaging and very entertaining. At first it gets somewhat distracting and annoying then you eventually get used to it. And I thought it actually worked- it made the audience feel as if they were actually there with the group of people seeing the monster attack. Cloverfield has some good thrills, many of them are from jump scenes with the monsters (not too scary and unexpected). The film was pretty interesting but it could have been better had they focused more on the monster. The movie is pretty short. The first 20 mins takes place at a party then the film takes off when the friends notice a monster from outside. Most of the main cast end up dying and since its being filmed by a hand-held camera, you don't see how brutal the death's are- it happens pretty quick.The characters were alright, not really that likable but not that bad. I think they should have done more development on them to have made the film better. Cloverfield is definitely better than that garbage Skyline- which gets compared to because of its recent monster/alien type films. Watching Cloverfield, you could tell that Skyline borrowed many scenes from the film. I think Cloverfield could have been better had they made the film about 20 minutes longer. The actual film ended around the 73rd minute (73.45). This film is definitely not for everyone. Many complaints are from the camera but to watch a film like this you need to have an open mind, and take it for what it is.",Cloverfield
67,johnnyboyz,"Exhilarating and relentless experience that echoes the first-hand, hand-held footage of 9/11 and transforms it into a thing of pure terror and threat without exploitation.",8,4 June 2009,"There is a scene in Roland Emmerich's 1998 film Godzilla in which a character is holding a video camera as the aforementioned monster walks towards him, eventually standing on him, but seeing the character survive. The notion of an individual with a video camera as a large monster gallivants towards them will almost certainly never be seen in the same way again following Cloverfield. Films like Cloverfield are the reason films like Godzilla age; they take the idea to another level and render a prior project, that wasn't done sufficiently well in the first place, close to complete garbage. If, in the past, we were supposed to chuckle at said scene in Godzilla with our tongues firmly within our cheeks, then viewing it again after Cloverfield will produce full-blown laughs; specifically AT the text rather than with it.Some of my favourite films from last year carried a very brooding sense of both overall menace and danger, specifically: There Will Be Blood; Lust, Caution; No Country for Old Men and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days to mention but a few. Cloverfield is additionally one of my favourites from last year, in the sense it carries a brooding sense of danger and menace but maintains a certain style; a certain craft and a certain aesthetic that makes the experience exciting, memorable and equally engaging but through different techniques. Shame on anyone that dismisses this as a shaky-cam, substance-less and seemingly mindless piece of entertainment that cannot rank along said films when in actual fact, it carries the necessary conventions to make it a worthwhile piece.Cloverfield sees a group of contemporary Americans, armed with one of the most durable diegetic cameras in cinematic history, flee their apartment building on the night of a party as a huge explosion and subsequent events both horrific and mysterious transpire. They make their way through the ever-increasingly swamped city of New York, as populated by innocent by-standers trying to fathom what's going on, in the meek hope of finding Beth (Yustman), one of the character's partners. In every sense of the word, the film is punishing, but in a positive sense. The camera in Cloverfield takes more punishment than either of the two featured in The Blair Witch Project; the characters take a battering, the city of New York takes a battering through some impressive special effects and basic-as-you-like generic horror conventions take a battering. Take for example, the scene in the underground railway system in which the lights are off and something's in there with you: a set up so ordinary and so basic is actually made to feel fresh and quite frightening.The film begins in an ominous fashion, with a subtitle telling us the following footage was found in an area 'formerly known as Central Park', planting seeds in our minds that suggest destruction and devastation - something seems to have happened that renders Central Park of the past tense. This additionally introduces the audience into a sense of viewership, thus placing us in the bodies of a highly ranked government official or someone else of vast importance as we sit down and prepare for footage of top secrecy. The film then goes down the very effective route of unfolding all this entirely from a first person perspective, that of a character named Hud (Miller) who is holding the camera, which really immerses us in this unfolding, ensuing action-come-survival film.The point of attack, in the nicest possible way, sees a surprise party held for Rob (Stahl-David) as he heads off to Japan (a reference to the nation that gave us Godzilla) to start a new job. The opening features all the typical, hand-held shots as shot by someone at a party and sets up the shooting style for the rest of the film. During the set up, we get various paper-thin introductions to various people that do not necessarily require immense introduction, but need enough on them for us to be able to invest time with them. This, however basic or mundane, Cloverfield achieves during this segment. The characters that we do follow, along with Hud the camera man, consist of: Jason (Vogel); Marlena (Caplan) and Lilly (Lucas).The film deliberately lacks that narrative drive, with escape from New York and general survival the aim of the game. Primarily, the film sees its characters try as hard as they can to rescue Beth from her apartment in a part of town that has been hit by the destruction hardest. What unfolds is a street level drama that sometimes delves below ground or into the nether-regions of an apartment block in order to get a cross further thrills and chills and it actually works really well. A word on when they actually go below deck; in a scene that sees them begin in a subway station – a further stomping of 1998's Godzilla into a hole that it now thoroughly deserves to be buried in, when, you'll remember, the climax to that film saw equivalently-sized beasties stalk the lead characters through a subway station. Oh, how that is looking old now.",Cloverfield
68,filipemanuelneto,"A good ""found footage"" film where New York is, again, devastated in the cinema.",7,3 May 2020,"This film is based on the appearance of a gigantic and monstrous creature in the middle of New York. It is not a horror film in the strict sense of the term, it is more within Sci Fi and thriller. Directed by Matt Reeves, who ensures an effective and interesting direction, the film works very well.There is much in this film that is not evident. The film plays on it a lot to create more atmosphere and dramatic tension. The creature's origins are never revealed, its real appearance is only shown in very specific moments and the whole film is essentially a race in a besieged city and in great life peril.Filmed using the odious technique of ""found footage"", it works incredibly well, in spite of the shaky image, cinematography knew how to give perspective in the first person and transport us, to the place and to the action. The actors are complete strangers, and this allows us to better identify with the characters and view the film as a true ""found footage"". Personally, I would highlight the good work of Jessica Lucas, Mike Vogel and Michael Stahl-David. The problem is that the characters are so poor that they could be any anonymous face in that crowd, who we really don't care about. The sets and costumes are also very good, especially in the tough task of reconstructing the destruction caused by the monster. Finally, a word of great merit for the special, visual and sound effects, as well as for the effective CGI that was used in the film.",Cloverfield
69,leonblackwood,Pretty intense from the get go! 6/10,6,22 October 2016,"Review: Before I started to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane, I thought that I would watch this movie again, and I must admit, for it's time, it actually wasn't bad. I'm not one whose into paranormal movies, and I hate when films are filmed through a camera, so everything was against this movie right from the beginning but once the massive monster started to attack New York, I actually felt the intensity that the leading characters did. I must admit, the teenagers did get on my nerves after a while, and the camera seemed to have a really LONG battery life. Anyway, the action scenes with the army were quite realistic and the whole evacuation was put together well. I would have liked to have seen more attention to detail with the huge monster, and the little mini monsters but as it was filmed through a hand-held camera, I can understand why it looked sketchy. For a film that was made 8 years ago, it certainly didn't look dated, and you could easily release it today. Personally, I would have used some A-list actors, so they could bring the tension across more effectively but with that aside, I still enjoyed it the second time around. Watchable!Round-Up: After making such a profit at the box office, I'm surprised that it took so long for a sequel. The movie was directed by Matt Reeves, 50, who also brought you Let Me In, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and is due to direct War in the Planet of the Apes, which will be released in 2017. With J.J. Abrams in the producer chair, who is known for directing Mission Impossible III, Super 8, the new Star Trek franchise, and of course, the new Star Wars movies, there certainly was a lot of experience behind the camera. I just wished that they filmed it normally! Anyway, it's definitely one to have in your collection, if your into movies in this genre, and I'm sure that people will be going back to it, in the future.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $171millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/horrors, starring Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel and Brian Klugman. 6/10",Cloverfield

72,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Sci-Fi Thriller and Indie give birth to the exciting creature that is ""Cloverfield""",8,20 January 2008,"In a film where a giant monster attacks Manhattan, there are a lot of questions. What is it? Where did it come from? Why is it being destructive? ""Cloverfield"" doesn't want to answer these questions, it just wants you to ask them.It's a hard concept to grasp, but this film, brought to the screen by LOST's J.J. Abrams and his property Bad Robot, doesn't want you to get caught up in the details. Your job is to experience what goes on and react to it and for much of the film. Sure, it's frustrating, it doesn't make sense, but Abrams and director Matt Reeves are aiming for that for a reason.As soon as disaster strikes, images and feelings of 9/11 are conjured. With a cast of unknowns and a single camcorder as the source of the images, ""Cloverfield"" feels very real. While the film takes off from there as a monster attack/alien invasion, for a majority of it you are interested in what's happening to these people and how they're handling the situation. There is a lot of stuff that's hard to believe, but without it there's not much of a film. In general, the dialogue and the reactions of the people are very realistic and for a majority of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat.In a sense, ""Cloverfield"" is a sci-fi, fictional United 93, a gritty retelling of events (although false). The undertones of tragedy are difficult and it's amazing how these young actors are able to convey such realism.""Cloverfield"" takes several different styles and genres and fuses them into something new and successful. It is the kind of film that if imitated in any way by any future film will clearly not get by without constant references to this film. It is exciting and innovative and exactly the kind of twisting of the norm that Hollywood needs to stay fresh while staying successful. It's not mind-blowing or genius, but it's got style. It goes to show that big blockbuster-style films can be done in small independent film-style ways.",Cloverfield

74,Anonymous_Maxine,Watch that last shot again,9,27 April 2008,"I awaited Cloverfield with almost wild anticipation. Sadly, it was released in theaters about two days before I had to go back to China (I was home in California visiting family for the winter holidays), and I didn't have time to see it before I had to leave. It would have been nice to see it on the big screen (this alleged ""motion sickness"" has never affected me in the least, either here or in the similarly photographed Blair Witch Project), but even on pirated Chinese DVDs the movie looks pretty good. Given that so much of the monster portion of the movie passes without us ever really learning much about the monster, it's odd that the beginning of the movie, which is just a personal home video taken by some friends to congratulate someone on getting married, seems like it goes on about five times longer than it should. Maybe that's because for much of that part of the movie, there seems to be developing a very involved romantic drama which will become meaningless within a few minutes. Of course, it doesn't become entirely meaningless, only about half of it does. In fact, I should mention that, for a romantic subplot squeezed into a monster movie, this one actually works quite well. I hope Bruckheimer is taking notes.At any rate, it is well known that the Statue of Liberty does not fare well in the movie. One of the original teaser trailers famously showed the statue's head being thrown down a New York City street, and they really should have left it at that. In the movie, they don't know how to have people react to such an occurrence. As soon as the head comes to rest, a lot of people gather around it like mindless zombies, snapping photos of it with their cell phones. Evidently these people are so brainwashed by technology that they are more concerned about e-mailing these amazing photos to all their buddies than they are in what exactly threw that head. Personally, I like to think that I'd be amazed if such a thing happened, but for at least the following few seconds, I would be more concerned about where the head came from!Once the movie gets going, however, it never lets up. The monster is a brilliant creation of digital effects, which detract from movies far more often than they add. Th CGI is spectacular in this movie, and that is not a comment that I make often! In the extra features on the DVD, there is a lot of talk about presenting the monster not as an angry beast bent on destroying, but as something like a frightened infant fighting for it's survival. A scared baby monster (one as massive and frightening as this one) being injured and not knowing why is definitely a force to be reckoned with, although there is nothing in the movie to let us know any of that. For all we can see, it's just an angry beast bent on destroying. The only major drawback of the movie is the bonehead holding the camera. Another idea mentioned in the extra features on the DVD is that the movie originally came about as an effort to create America's own movie monster, given that Godzilla, so many decades after its debut, is still a major part of Japanese pop culture. Sadly, this guy ""Hud"" (which stands for Heads-Up Display, not Humanoid Underground Dwellers, but good guess) strikes me as the results of an effort to create the most idiotic, dumbed-down American caricature possible. Here's a bit of sample dialogue:Hud: ""What time does the chopper take off?"" Rob: ""0600."" Hud: ""Uh, what time is that?"" Rob: ""6am!""Hud: ""Oh, yeah. I knew that.""Good thinking, moron. Way to represent the homeland. I live in the heart of Communist China, and I feel I should tell you that, especially with all of the controversy about American protests about Tibet and the Beijing Olympics, many people in the world have much difficulty differentiating between the American people and, say, their government, or their movies. One of the main difficulties that the movie has to overcome, however, is why this Hud would go on holding a video camera while his whole world was being destroyed around him. He was reluctant to take on the job of filming at the beginning of the movie, so it's strange sometimes that he always holds on to it and always points it at what needs to be seen. But surprisingly, this never really seems like a problem to me. Sometimes we have to wonder why he's holding it, like when he climbs onto the roof of a high-rise apartment building which is leaning precariously on the building across the street, but they make excellent use of broken clips, and cuts back to what was originally on the tape, to show times when Hud stopped filming and then started again later.I think many people will be put off by the fact that so little is actually learned about the monster, but I think this might be the film's strongest point. First of all, the movie is left wide open for a sequel, not the least reason for which is because the entire movie consists of a single DV tape that the government found at the ""former location of Central Park."" Think of how many other tapes might be found and made into more movies! But most of all, pay special attention to the right side of the screen in the very last shot of the movie, which looks out over the ocean. In my opinion, that's all we really need to know",Cloverfield
75,jzappa,Truly Brilliant Technical Film-making Applied To A Usually Dull Class Of American Cinema,8,21 July 2008,"Cloverfield transcends the reputable superficiality of Hollywood monster and disaster blockbusters. It goes beyond the simple eye-rollingly indulgent gimmicks and effects. The combined effort of the filmmakers results in a technical masterpiece in terms of suspense. There is an incredible intensity to the story and an extremely impressive relentlessness overall. This is due to the effect of revealing only what is observed through the camcorder incidentally held by only two or three of the film's characters, the reason according to the story why we are privy to any of what goes on at all.It is preposterous for any consumer camcorder to endure past a 300-foot drop as it eventually does here, but nevertheless this technical device does so many wonders for this riveting monster film. It causes the viewer, if the viewer does not remain obstinately opposed to the film's identity as a Hollywood disaster movie, to be absorbed entirely in the story rather than the film-making. The movie's world becomes all too important to us because of how immediately and naturally this gimmick tears down the tangible obstruction between audience and on-screen life. Cloverfield succeeds at something the vast majority of American movies strives to do in this generation, which is tell a story while flaunting directorial style that appeals to the young eyes trained by the high-tech nature of this day and age. The film's premise, a video file recovered from a digital hand-held camera by the US Department of Defense, relies upon the organic use of a camcorder's perspective, a perspective which because of its accessibility ironically seems so much more immediately familiar to our eyes than 35mm film or computer-enhanced color-corrected hi-def video.Cloverfield is a truly scary movie that, despite its depiction of college-age characters with a huge social circle and a Manhattan setting, achieves a nightmarish claustrophobia. Though so much happens and on such a large scale, we only see so much, which is the object of unfolding a story on film. One cannot deny the effect of a giant monster that military is firing at with desperate force yet we cannot see, or destruction seen vaguely from the realistic faraway vantage point, or seeing straight from a character's perspective when they fall victim to alien predator.",Cloverfield

77,Chris Knipp,"""Are you still filming? People will want to know how it all went down""",8,20 March 2008,"'Cloverfield' is an astonishing piece of vérité. Carried to an impossible extreme, as vérité can be sometimes, this movie pretending to be shot with a cheap video camera takes us right into a New York City Armageddon where giant serpents or trolls start out by duplicating the feel of 9/11, only all over midtown, with buildings collapsing or bursting into flames and people rushing around madly in extremis.But it doesn't happen right away, because it's vérité--it really happened, you see--so a guy just happened to have a video camera in his hand while he was at a goodbye party in a downtown loft for a young corporate yuppie man who got a cool assignment to Japan. It's the clever conceit of this movie that a good twenty minutes go by before the Godzilla stuff happens, just long enough so you're actually getting vaguely interested in how it's coming out that something is going on between the party boy Rob( Michael Stahl-David), and his girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman), or something, and you've relaxed and almost forgotten what you were waiting for to happen, when it does. Wham! And then everything is collapsing and somehow the strong survive all the way down to the bottom of the building--this is where 9/11 really echoes in your mind--and out onto the street, with cars and cops and people every which way and pieces of buildings falling into themselves and lights all red and orange, and the camera always a-tilt and running.because somebody has handed it to Hud (T.J. Miller), Rob's not-too-smart but faithful and determined best buddy, at the start of the party with instructions to record people, which he went around doing, till now. And Beth is up on the West Side, and Rob has the crazy notion that they've got to get up there to save her.This being the post-modern media world, it's all a movie-within-a-movie-within-a movie. We are watching a film retrieved by the government from ""the area formerly known as Central Park"" after an ""incident"" code-named ""Cloverfield,"" so this is the government's archival film now, and every so often it glitches back to an earlier film Rob shot, where he's on a first date on Coney Island falling in love with Beth. So you've got the halcyon past, the beyond-hellish present, and the unknown future all right there--in 74 minutes. This is another beauty of a movie that has not garnered enormous critical praise (though Edelstein of New York Magazine likes it and so did the witty Nathan Lee--let's just say it plays well in Manhattan) but has the beauty and extraordinary cachet of being as intense as any horror sci-fi monster movie you will ever see, and in a form utterly concise. And utterly true to Manhattan. The locations are quite vivid and specific and real, and these are 73 New York minutes, full of energy and speed and in-your-face.And there is a monster--of the kind that's gigantic and terrifying but also so Japanese Fifties looking even though in color I tried to look away, because it broke the spell--which gives rise to or sloughs off more human-sized giant spider things that make a deliciously creepy crackling sound, like a giant crunchy rattlesnake, clattering and sliding around in people's faces and if it bites, watch out! You'll have a big bloody wound and after a while you won't feel too good at all.Even though '28 Weeks Later' took us down into a Tube station in similar circumstances, the stay down there in the Spring Street station with Rob and Hud & Co. stays with me. So does the first chaos on the street when they make it down from Rob's loft. This is a moderately high-budget grunge picture; it has the best of both worlds. It has tons of extras and special effects, but it doesn't dazzle you with their glitz, because you're just sort of glimpsing them through the terrified shaky hand of the, well, hand-held camera.But I really can't remember much of it because, well, I was there, man. It all happened too fast. In fact many of the incidents that occur have been seen in other disaster movies, but still, this is what Nabokov meant when he spoke of transcending the tradition in one's own way. Reeves--and bless him, he's already planning a sequel--is a director who makes it all look and sound different, constant, non-stop, and intense. You couldn't take more than 73 minutes; it would be unbearable. And even before that the novelty wears off, and again and again you realize that Hud's still having the camera in his grip and working is wholly implausible. But the style, the look, and the feel of it are compulsive and hypnotic. This may be a bad movie. It is not a movie to take seriously. But it is a good bad movie, a very good one. It will fill you up. And like Chinese food, it will leave you feeling empty two hours later. But it will have been worth it.You don't care about these people. They're shallow, emptily up-to-date, going nowhere. But that makes this all the more vérité. There are no heroes. No (human) villains. No human interest, really. Just stuff happening. Drew Goddard's screenplay deserves credit for that. And kudos to Michael Bonvillain's cinematography with its endlessly chittering video effects and the FX flow, aided by Kevin Stitt's lively cutting, which keeps things moving in and out, in and out, like a dying heart.",Cloverfield

The ""introduction"", however, was too long, and when ""the hell broke loose"", then odd things occurred not possible in such situations, e.g. maintenance of lighting or GSM coverage, and if/when explosions widen and buildings crash closer and closer, people do not remain on the streets and follow them, but run away or find shelter asap. Thus, many of subsequent scenes were airy-fairy, and the found- footage style just added tension (true, I have to admit, quite capably), but again: no way the cam and the film inside could last until the so-called end.So, all in all, Cloverfield is just another mind- and technology- twisting creation meant for them completely in following the events, moods and twists.

79,freemantle_uk,A Really Good Monster Film,9,22 May 2008,"This movie is very enjoyable and done with a brain and a heart. I love how it was done thought a hand-held camera and that it only focuses on people on the ground-level and does not try to explain where the monster comes from. It is also a short film, just under an hour and a half, which is nice to see in an age when movies over 2 hours is becoming the norm.The basic plot of the film is Rob is having a surprise leaving party because he was about to leave for Japan. During this party there is a powercut and in the distance there is an explosion the head of the Statue of Liberty is blasted into the middle of Manhattan. The police and the army come out in full force and try to direct people out of Manhattan. However the Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed and Rob then gets a phone call from his 'girlfriend' and he decides to try and save her and do it before 6 AM.The film starts off slow, but that is because it meant to be like someones home movies. You also get see like bits of Rob's life a few weeks before the attack. The producer J.J. Abrams is a very clever man an know how to make a film and market it. It is scary and you do fill the panic. I also didn't like the bit (in a good way) when the monster attacks the helicopter need the end of the movie.

80,strong-122-478885,Godzilla On Steroids With Attitude,7,4 October 2012,"*This review may contain spoilers*Wow! Cloverfield's ferocious alien invasion started off on a perfectly wonderful note with the creature literally knocking the Statue of Liberty's block off.Yeah. I couldn't have thought of a better way to get the ball rolling in this surprisingly well-done Sci-Fi/Horror film. I must say that seeing that treasured national monument irreparably damaged was a really nice touch.Kudos to director Matt Reeves on that one.Since I already knew in advance that this film was yet another shaky, hand-held camera production, I was all prepared to hate it as much as I ultimately hated the likes of Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project.But, alas, I am pleased to admit that I was quite entertained and pleasantly satisfied with what Cloverfield had to offer me as its final product. I mean, this was clearly no low-budget production.Yes - Cloverfield certainly had its share of terrible moments (like the pure asininity of Rob Hawkins' rescue mission of Beth). But, with that stuff aside, the level of panic and mayhem generated in the story was nothing short of excellent. And, that, coupled with some superb, ass-kicking visual effects had Cloverfield bending over backwards to deliver a considerable sized wallop in the essential categories of thrills and chills.In conclusion - As it was at the beginning of the alien attack with the decapitation of the Statue of Liberty, I thought that it was a very nice final touch that the entire cast of characters were all dead at the end of the film. I mean, considering what I had to endure from that bunch of cell-phone clinging, yuppie puppies at the beginning of the story during Rob's ""going away"" party, they all so rightly deserved to be annihilated, one and all.Bravo to director Matt Reeves for a job well done.",Cloverfield
81,ebiros2,New kind of a Blair Witch Project,2,26 March 2009,"They covered up what this movie is all about very cleverly with its title ""Cloverfield"". No one would have a clue about what the movie is about from its title. If they did, this movie would have not attracted many audiences. There's really nothing special about this movie in essence. It's a cross between the original Godzilla (creature from the ocean depth), Alien, and Blair Witch Project where the entire movie runs through a video camera of one of the characters.The plot connects the lives of ordinary young people with the total destruction of Manhattan, which is type of plot that became common in the beginning of the decade first in manga (Japanese comics), where relationship between an ordinary boy and a girl suddenly connects directly with the destruction of the world. Destruction of the world in this case is not the main theme - the relation of the couple who's involved in it is. You can see this clearly if you watch ""Saikano"" together with this movie. It's my personal taste but taking one's self importance so seriously somehow does not appeal to me. If you take away the connection between the characters personal involvement, which to me is just that - there's nothing that relates back to the audience. The monsters and the special effects are cliché, the production is average, and view point annoying. I couldn't figure out what the point of this movie was all about watching through a very limited visuals of a video camera, all the way to the final non-ending of the movie. The entire movie is about one young guy's video of himself.So, if you've been intrigued by the title and the nice sci-fi like picture on the box, my recommendation is just leave it at that. The content isn't worth the $$.",Cloverfield
82,dfranzen70,"""Amateur"" film looks like a crappy home movie",3,19 January 2008,"Some people may remember the heady days of 1999, when there was slow Internet hype of a low-budget first offering by two unknown filmmakers named Sanchez and Myrick. When it first hit theaters, The Blair Witch Project, was a welcome change from the almost-antiseptic approach that directors were taking to movies; most scary action movies seemed almost too stagy, too unreal, to implausible. Blair Witch used a hand-held camera and was marketed as lost, recovered footage of an experience in the woods gone awry.Here in 2008, though, the anarchic, subversive idea of hand-held, intentionally amateur cinematography is almost passe', isn't it? Since 1999, audiences have seen reality television shows and gritty, dirt-in-your-face movies that aim for an ultrareal effect; consequently, the novelty has worn off. We're no longer amused by footage we could have shot ourselves, and we're no longer automatically terrified when something scary is filmed with a camcorder.In Cloverfield, a group of young people is throwing a going-away party in New York City for one of their own; Rob, who is assuming a high-paying job in Japan. Naturally, one of his best friends, Hud, videotapes the party, asking various guests to offer testimonials to Rob, sort of as one would do at a wedding reception. Then BOOM, there's a loud explosion, and the guests flip on the TV - looks like a giant something or other is attacking the city.Because everything is seen through the camcorder that Hud is lugging around, we're supposed to feel a kinship with these pretty twentysomethings, although to be frank they look and act a little more like teenagers. Using Hud's camera, director Matt Reeves introduces us to a few characters who may or may not make it through to the end of the film. We're told very little about them, but it's quickly evident that the people on whom the camera does linger will be characters we'll follow after the tragedy strikes.On the plus side, the monster is hardly seen at all, really just in shadows and the like, until near the very end of the movie, and no explanation is offered as to where it came from. The result of this, though, is that the focus is shifted to the game effort put forth by our survivors as they attempt an inexplicably dumb quest. The instant they decide that's what they're gonna do, you start guessing which of them will be killed off.At any rate, such a focus means that it's pretty important that the actors themselves turn in strong, evocative performances, and no one here does. The impression one gets is that the actors were hired mainly because they weren't supertalented thespians, that producer J.J. Abrams was going for amateur-looking acting to go along with the amateur-looking camera-work. I get that, I really do, it's just that watching a 90-minute home movie isn't all that interesting when you can tell a lot of the special effects were done with CGI.This movie represents some of the worst aspects of cinema verite. The haphazard, slapdash camera-work is, of course, how you or I might use a camcorder, so it's realistic; on the other hand, most people don't want to watch a homemade film to which they have no connection. If my friends had made this, I might have been into it a bit more, but the film never engages its audience. (The party is an obvious contrivance to attempt to engage us, but it just shows me a bunch of pretty young people acting like doofuses.) And because there are all of these zooms to the left and right and up and down and whoops here we go, falling and gasping, it's tough to make sense of what's going on. Sure, I know, that's how the characters feel, too - what's attacking us? Where should we go? What should we do? - but I am not the characters, and in this case, seeing things through their eyes just makes me dizzy and not care about them much at all.And that, dear friends, is the crux of the problem. The movie wants you to be right down there in the trenches with the characters, but to do that it's got to make you like the characters, root for them in some way, and it just plain fails to do so. Instead, we're treated to nearly 90 minutes of people running here and there and getting attacked by who knows what, and so forth (there are a LOT of shots of feet, as Hud's camera is pointed straight down a lot of the time). To put it simply, it's like watching any other loud, dumb action movie, only instead of excellent camera angles and world-class cinematography that grabs you by the throat and never lets go, you get some brain-damaged diphthong toting a home video camera like it's 1990 and he's at his first no-adults party.I initially thought that the long buildup to the monster attack itself was a bad idea in itself; we get endless shots of the party and the people in it, merely for exposition and empathy. ""Bring on the monster!"" I shouted, internally. And then the attack comes, and for the rest of the film you feel like you're on a roller coaster ride after having eaten fourteen hot dogs.Cloverfield isn't worth the endless, smug, metahype it generated for itself leading up to its release. It means to be edgy and groundbreaking but winds up being tired and played out. The monster does look pretty cool, and some of the stunts are worth watching, and there are some genuine scares, but overall it misses its mark by quite a bit. The rolling head of the Statue of Liberty is clever, but that's about it for wit.",Cloverfield
83,kevin_robbins,Overall this had the potential to be an all time great film but falls short due to some poor writing.,7,3 June 2021,"Cloverfield (2008) is a movie I rewatched for free on Tubi last month. The storyline focuses on an alien invasion in Manhattan and a group of friends that are helping one of their male friends rescue his ex-girlfriend who just cheated on him and is now with the guy she cheated on him with...This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) and stars Lizzy Caplan (Mean Girls), Jessica Lucas (Evil Dead remake), TJ Miller (Deadpool) and Michael Stahl-David (We Win). The storyline for this movie is absolutely awful, I'll never know how it got approved. The cameraman is the most annoying character in a film of all time (on purpose, I know, but still annoying). There are aspects of the film that are super long and annoying also like the opening party scene and the fact they never have a plan and are chickens with their heads cut off the entire film; however, there's some over the top great aspects to this film also. The action scenes are magnificent. Every depiction of big and little alien beings are remarkable. The scenes at the military base, running through the city and in the helicopter that just couldn't have been done better. Overall this had the potential to be an all time great film but falls short due to some poor writing. I'd give this a solid 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",Cloverfield
84,dee.reid,"The ""Cloverfield"" review",10,18 January 2008,"(Before I start this, I just want to say I'm 22, going on 23, and that I grew up watching Japanese monster movies, or ""kaiju-eiga,"" and I consider Godzilla to be the ultimate movie monster. I've also come to love Gamera and Ultraman, and I was gosh-wowed last year by South Korea's contribution to the genre, ""The Host."" Now here we are at ""Cloverfield,"" what I will refer to as ""the first great American monster movie of the 21st century."")It makes no sense to describe the plot to the ""Alias"" J.J. Abrams-produced, Drew-Goddard-written, Matt Reeves-directed flick ""Cloverfield"" in any real detail because therein lies the problem: there is no real detail, only raw, on-the-scene, up close & personal action. In a hype campaign the likes of which haven't been seen in a movie of this type for quite some time now, ""Cloverfield"" remarkably lives up to expectations. Ever since the first trailer appeared during the previews for ""Transformers"" last year, a three-syllable word has come to describe a movie to be released on January 18, 2008, and it was called ""Cloverfield,"" even though early press releases said that wasn't the movie's real title.So what's all the hoopla about? Some suspected a war movie, others a viral outbreak, or a terrorist attack. As you know, the plot has been kept real hush-hush, though sordid details have been allowed to leak on the Internet.Rumor control, these are the facts -All you need to know is this: in an inventively bizarre hybrid that combines elements of both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The War of the Worlds"" with ""Godzilla,"" a monster is laying waste to New York City. Buildings crumble, the Brooklyn Bridge is snapped in two like a twig, the military strikes back, mass hysteria as thousands try to flee the city, and a giant reptilian beast of unknown origin is causing mass destruction. The chaos is captured through the hand-held lens of a couple of terrified New Yorkers as they give a first-hand account of the devastation while trying to reach safety.And that's all you really need to know. First of all, because this is a first-person account of a New York City monster attack, we never get to see a really good picture of the monster until somewhere close to the very end, since it decides to make its debut at nighttime in the City That Never Sleeps, and up until then all we get are brief flashes and glimpses of ""it."" (To get an idea of this creepy critter, imagine a reptile, like a shell-less turtle, combined with a slug and a sea crustacean. And then imagine its nastier, creepy-crawly subordinates that come to chow down on many unsuspecting New Yorkers.) To get this out of the way, this beast is a force to be reckoned with. It's certainly an impressive CGI creature creation, like all the classic Japanese monsters I grew up with - Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Gamera. But what's paramount here, is that this flick, despite any misgivings I'll probably have in the future, is way better than the 1998 American adaptation of ""Godzilla.""""Cloverfield"" does have some pretty wicked special effects sequences, including some genuinely intense moments of peril and a few particularly chilling sights and sounds. Some have panned the shaky and frenetic camera-work; if you were in the middle of all this chaos, would your camera be perfect and composed? The guy's right there, in the thick of it, scared to death with his closest friends; does anyone really think he's going to get the Oscar for Best Cinematography or something, if he makes it out of the city alive? I don't think so.New York has seen some pretty wild sights over the decades. In the post-9/11 world, you would think that ""Cloverfield"" is the last thing Americans would want to see right now, and Abrams will be accused in the future of being insensitive to the feelings of Americans. But it seems that every so often filmmakers need to vent some unstated/unwritten frustration/aggression and this is what we occasionally get sometimes.And as for those poor New Yorkers I was telling about? Well, their footage was found.10/10",Cloverfield

Godzilla's ugly brother shows up in downtown Manhatten and starts reeking havoc. A group of people at a party make their way back into the city to rescue the lead character's girlfriend. We have splices of happier times split into the film. After getting some of his friends killed in terrible ways, the main character and his girlfriend are hiding under a bridge right before the monster gets nuked. Amazingly, the film in the camera survives because JJ Abrams is too much of an idiot to understand concepts like ""Electromagnetic pulse"". (Wow, and this moron is going to write the next Star Trek Film. Nice knowing you, Star Trek Franchise!) I guess I also didn't like it because some of the scenes were too reminiscent of 9/11.

87,meeza,See the magic of Cloverfield!,8,27 December 2009,"A monster movie set in New York? Why not? Maybe not in 2002! But I do not think acclaimed Producer/Director J.J. Abrams was ""lost"" in left field and was timely appropriate in reintroducing the monster movie theme in present time via the narrative form in his ""Cloverfield"". Director Matt Reeves helms this surprisingly fine film about a grandiose monster attacking Manhattan. Hey, I have felt like a monster myself with a few too many Manhattan cocktails. What gives ""Cloverfield"" a visionary edge is that all of the chaos is seen subjectively through the video camera of one of the film's characters named Hud. The film's narrative structure starts in a New York apartment where the lead character of the film Rob has been thrown a ""going away"" surprise party by his friends; including Hud who is videotaping the guests testimonials about Rob using the soon-to-be infamous camera. But the real surprise comes right after in the clash of the Clover Monster; buildings explode, debris is everywhere, and even the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the streets of Manhattan courtesy of monster Clover's unstatuette left hook. The rest of ""Cloverfield"" focuses on the film's hipster characters trying to survive the Clover Monster's destruction. So to end my review of ""Clover"" Oh No! What's that coming at me! It is a humungous monster looking like a 300-foot Roger Ebert telling me to give it up as a film critic! AAHHH!!!! Where is my camera? I want a shot of this! His massive Thumbs Down is about to trample me! Help!!!! OK enough! I did enjoy the ensemble acting of ""Cloverfield"" from newcomers Lizzy Kaplan, Jessica Lucas, Michael Stahl-David, and T.J. Miller. Stahl-David played Rob; and Miller played Lite, I mean Hud. ""Cloverfield"" had extra special visual effects which were monstrous in recreating a New York tackled by a monster. I do not deny that ""Cloverfield"" did a have a few silly rudiments to it, but it did not intercede within the sheer entertainment value of the film; or maybe it was that good luck clover that did it. Nevertheless, ""Cloverfield"" does warrant for you to play its viewing field. **** Good",Cloverfield
88,drqshadow-reviews,A Fresh Blast of Much-Needed Perspective for the Monster Genre,9,10 October 2017,"Perspective from the street-level as a towering, rampaging monster plows straight through the heart of Manhattan. At the time this was released, we were roughly a decade past The Blair Witch Project, long enough for the found footage trope to have thoroughly played itself out. Yet in many ways this feels like a revelation, one which would collapse without that same central gimmick. Like bystander footage from a major disaster, the placement of the camera makes the chaos and mayhem of this sudden, citywide catastrophe feel completely vivid and tangible. It's like we're there with the victims; our pulse racing, our eyes widened by the dead and injured, our skin coated by the dust of so much collapsed concrete. Moments that would've certainly felt cheesy from a traditional POV, high above the action, now deliver beyond any reasonable expectation. We get to know the core characters well, their thoughts and quirks and feelings, and we mourn when they're abruptly taken from us in the confusion. It tells a desperate human story in a genre that usually struggles with such elements, and doesn't shy from the profound, lasting conclusion that everything seems to be building toward from the start. The plot does have holes, some larger than others, but given the frenetic pace and rapid developments, those are relatively easy to shake off and leave behind. I was surprised by how Cloverfield moved me today, nine years after the fact. Surely one of the most memorable, ambitious, effective films of the decade.",Cloverfield

90,XweAponX,Scared the S___ out of me!,10,13 August 2008,"The filmmakers effect of course is that as you watch the handy cam footage, you experience what the protagonists experience.The core of the story is the first bit of video with ""Rob"" and ""Beth"" - Two new, non-familiar non-Hollywood faces, faces you will meet at any party like the party ""Hud"" was filming. Well, not like that particular party.But it takes an invasion by some unknown thing to tell the tale. It also takes the side-story about a Rave-Gone-Bad, which started to go bad the moment ""Hud"" got the camera. Personally, I would have killed ""Hud"" at the start of the film, but we needed Hud to lug the Camera around.This film uses the Hitchcock-ian method of filming with almost NO CUTS as in ""Rope"" and ""Under Capricorn"" - But with the added Handy-Cam kind of footage- This brings the film into an incredible level of first-person experience... Because WE become Hud as Hud films the events of the evening- So we see what Hud sees, and also what the camera sees.At first viewing, we have no initial idea what is happening, no warning, and we are not sure until we see a huge TAIL. And we have not a clue as to why the heads of Statues of Liberties are being flung as if they were crumpled aluminum foil projectiles, and we are teased like that all through the film, a lot of things we see are not really explained. Matt Reeves builds the picture, step by step, and to great effect.But what it comes down to... THIS is probably the GREATEST Monster Movie made in 25 years, not since the Original Alien- As Alien had the Chest Burster scene, this film has...Never mind what it has.

91,MBunge,The most fun I've had almost vomiting,6,13 August 2010,"This movie almost made be vomit. So before I get into this movie, there's something I'd like to convey to any and all current and future filmmakers who might, by odd happenstance, read this review.ENOUGH WITH THE DAMN SHAKY-CAM!!! When the whole sliding, shifting, wandering camera shot first came into common use well over a decade ago, it was a neat innovation. It gave a documentary air of authenticity to fictional tales. It helped audiences think they were seeing something different than the stories they've seen before. However, shaky-cam doesn't do any of that any more. It is now just another cliché.You've probably heard Cloverfield described as ""The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla"". It seems somewhat belittling to label a truly clever idea like that, but it is accurate. This is the story of a group of 20somethings with a video camera who are stuck in the middle when a giant monster invades New York City and the most important thing to know about the movie is that, outside of a few times when the camera calms down to give the audience a clear look at the special effects, Cloverfield is filmed like a drunk guy with a hand held video camera trying to shoot a wedding reception in the middle of a war.The image on the screen spins and shakes and tilts and weaves and it goes on and on and on. In the theater, I only lasted about 30 minutes before I had to walk out. If I hadn't left, I absolutely would have vomited on the person in front of me. I made it through the entire thing, watching the DVD at home, but I had an upset stomach and headache by the end. If you get at all motion sick, avoid Coverfield because it is worse than Blair Witch or any other film shot in this style.If you've got a stronger constitution, though, Cloverfield's a decent film. Beyond the basic concept, it's an utterly pedestrian monster moviebut the concept is strong enough to carry you through the entire 84 minutes. Yeah, it is pretty short but it fits with the pure roller coaster idea of the film. No one really wants to ride a 20 minute long roller coaster. It just becomes too much and I'm not sure Cloverfield would have been improved if they'd spent another 20 or 30 minutes trying to make the story better and the characters more interesting. Ironically, the more engaging the story was and the more you cared about the characters, the more you'd probably get annoyed and angered at the hand held video stuff getting in between you and the story.I do think the filmmakers missed the point of the giant monster genre, however. Giant monster movies are supposed to be fun, but this film embraces a post-9/11 understanding of urban catastrophe that is everything but fun. Watching a giant monster destroy a skyscraper is enjoyable as a mindless spectacle. Watching the traumatized survivors wander about in the rubble afterwards is not that pleasant. Cloverfield also doesn't seem to understand the significance of the giant movie monster. It's such a ridiculous concept that you need to ground it with some real world analogy, the nuclear bomb origins of Godzilla being the most well known, but even the King Kong films can be seen as metaphors for the folly of Man thinking he can control and master the natural world. The Cloverfield monster doesn't have any significance. It's the destructive aftermath of the colossal beast movie in which the movie is interested.The monster itself, when you finally see it, is kind of goofy. However, you sort of have to give the filmmakers a pass on that. By now, it's become incredibly difficult to create any sort of creature that doesn't look like something seen in a previous movie or TV show and anything 350 feet tall starts to look a little silly.Does Cloverfield live up to the hype? No. It doesn't set some bold, new standard for the monster movie, but it is a well-executed, clever idea. That definitely makes this a movie worth seeing, unless you're a easy puker.",Cloverfield

The film starts at a condo party to introduce the characters and then abruptly turns into a survival film as the authorities try to protect the city and people. While the characters aren't really sympathetic, they do show concern for their close friends and the film with all the mayhem and tight editing is engrossing. And you have a turn a blind eye to the cameras battery life and durability but it didn't impact the movie for me as it is a monster movie! Not sure if this is a spoiler or not but the film owned the found footage approach by not revealing how this started or ended, you just get a snapshot of the attack from a few people's harrowing perspectives.",Cloverfield

Watching a bunch of young New Yorkers at a going away party through the shaky, jarring point of view of a hand-held video camera. Thankfully I stuck with it though because after those first 15 minutes, when the sh*t hits the fan, look out! Cloverfield then becomes a total thrill ride as we follow 5 of those partygoers (documentary style) through the city as a giant monster descends on New York. You really feel like you're in it with them due to the unique imagery, reminding me at times of some of the post 911 shots seen on TV. Anyways I ended up getting quite wrapped up in this.The story is pretty good, nothing too original but because of how its been filmed it feels unique as the army descends, N.Y is evacuated and one of the characters attempts the carnage to rescue his girlfriend.I loved how the monster isn't fully seen for quite a while (in a 'Jaws' sort of way) this made it much scarier. ""did you see that?"" ""what the hell was that?"" I think a lot of the dialogue was probably unscripted here too. I also liked the ending which is left...vague, with lots of questions, so that you're asking yourself ""And then what happened?"" Would love to see a sequel to this. 5/31/14",Cloverfield

The movie is shown from the perspective of a hand-held camera owned by the main character in the story and guided most of the time by his friend(who he gave the job to at his going away party). The story is really about a group of friends and what they go through to stay alive and together thru this attack. The whole movie is a government-supported film that was found in the aftermath of the incident and starts with a couple enjoying their day then we're sent to the going away party and the calamity starts. We never really see what the creature attacking the city looks like til halfway thru the movie and not close-up til the very end. What we see instead is the destruction that's caused which makes for a very different movie of this type and adds to the interest. The ending is also very unique in that we don't really know what happens to the main characters or the creature. Although this isn't popular film-making it adds to the intrigue.

99,JoeKarlosi,Cloverfield (2008) ***1/2,8,23 January 2008,"You'd never know it by its generic title, but this is actually one of the finest films about a giant monster destroying a big city ever made. The entire ""movie"" is captured on someone's camcorder a la THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (and recovered, we learn at the start of the film, from ""what was once Central Park""), as a secured government document of the tragic events which a small group of twenty-somethings experienced first-hand. What begins as a harmless home video party at a club in New York City abruptly turns into a long night of mass destruction and decimation, as some type of unexplained creature devastates Manhattan. This is not so much a movie about the creature as it is an intense and downright unnerving POV exercise that puts us as viewers into the chaos. Some scenes play very much like that fateful day of 9/11/01, and any person who witnessed that paralyzing event of buildings collapsing and smoke and debris gushing down the avenues will likely be revisiting the visuals in their minds.I've heard people complaining of nausea and dizziness over the filming technique, but the camcorder craziness didn't bother me as I knew what the movie was trying to do and I just went with it. The special effects here are outstanding, and the monster is never shown all that much to ruin the illusion. I'd also call CLOVERFIELD one of the more genuinely scary monster movies I've seen in a dog's age. You really feel like you're a part of the destruction and it seems very realistic. Would I go so far as to predict future ""classic"" status for this film? Not sure. I do think the tendency by the general public these days is to move on to the next popular movie, and nothing retains a hold on viewers today like cinema giants used to, when life was simpler and perhaps offered not nearly as numerous entertainment options. But it's still what I'd consider a great monster movie. I'd also advise fans who want to see it NOT to wait for video; this needs to be seen on the big screen with thundering sound effects for best impact. ***1/2 out of ****",Cloverfield

It is very reminiscent of a nightmare one might have. It is an unfeeling, noise making monster just bent on destruction.We never really get into the characters, but they do seem to work together fairly well, and are likable enough. They are superior to the cardboard cut outs of the usual delinquents and absolute video arcade characters we usually get. They seem to have genuine feelings, and no unexplained hostility that we get all too often.It revolves around New York City, and seems to dwell on that, even to a chauvinistic effect, so it does turn off non New Yorkers. Not a good idea, as New Yorkers are not close to the majority of the world population.It also seems to have little monsters with the big monster. Not much sense, but at least the movie doesn't try to explain it. We are simply on the ride, so to speak.Helicopter crashes are almost always fatal, so the credibility factor dropped a notch, but not enough to really hurt.All in all, this movie is an in between sort. Not great, not bad. It takes chances, and has some assets. Probably better than most crap produced by the morons in the industry. These people have some sense. It would rate higher if it was more interesting. Still, not a bad movie.",Cloverfield
102,fertilecelluloid,Vomit-inducing style married to impressive effects sequences,6,21 January 2008,"""Cloverfield"", which is even shakier than ""The Blair Witch Project"", induced nausea in me -- not because it was repulsive or uncommonly scary, but because the hand-held style goes way over the top to the point where you need to look away to avoid dizziness. While a bunch of unlikeable twenty something's are celebrating a friend's career move to Japan, disaster strikes New York City. Pandemonium breaks out as the Statue of Liberty's head crashes onto the street and buildings burn and topple 9-11-style. A small bunch of party goers tries making their way across town to rescue a hot, bland babe trapped in a semi-demolished building. Is there nothing guys won't do for pussy? The cause of the commotion is an impressive looking lizard that could be the offspring of the creature in ""The Host"". This slippery critter is pig biting mad at something and is rampaging around Manhattan like it's Legoland. The film's special effects are dazzling and the monster is pretty damn excellent. There are some harrowing scenes of destruction (the collapse of the Brooklyn Bridge, for example) and some flawless, nightmarish imagery involving spider-like critters (ala ""Starship Troopers"") that fall like flakes of dandruff from the big lizard. Unfortunately, the main characters are either arrogant asses, bitches, or embarrassing dorks. Why the writers thought they had to populate their movie with such distasteful people is anybody's guess because you just don't care when they die. The film is recommended with reservations.",Cloverfield
103,I_Ailurophile,Slightly better than average,6,28 February 2021,"Characters we don't care about. Irrelevant exposition. Some disruption. Big destruction. Big monster. More destruction. Apparent escape. ""Gotcha"" ending. And that's a movie!Shuck away most of the details and 'Cloverfield' follows the narrative flow of a great many monster movies, or even disaster movies. Whether or not it's worthwhile depends on the execution, on the little details that do set it apart. What of it?It's not bad. It's a bit fun, even. But 'Cloverfield' is not a game changer; one watch will be enough for most viewers.The best thing that this has going for it is the minor divergence from the typical monster movie. Clover stalks around the streets of New York, destroying buildings and garnering all the attention, and looks good doing it. But at the same time, they bring with them a smaller threat that is in some ways more insidious. Some survivors navigate the underground to find safe haven, and there's more suspense - and a genuine sense of horror - in what goes on below the surface than there is with the would-be kaiju running rampant. Those scenes that take place in the subway tunnels are more memorable than the entire rest of the film, and the most worthy of our attention.For as much press as 'Cloverfield' got when it first came out, at least in part thanks to its ""found footage"" stylings - it seems to have mostly been forgotten in the years since, recalled only in passing with the release of the other two ""Cloverfield"" movies. And that tracks: with 'The Cloverfield Paradox' essentially bringing a narrative connection, there's almost more reason now to rewatch 'Cloverfield' than there was of its own accord.Worth a view if you come across it, but don't go out of your way. Recommended for monster movie fanatics, or if you want to unwind with a movie and aren't particular as to what you watch.",Cloverfield
104,TOMNEL,"Very well done, Great entertainment.",8,1 February 2008,"""Cloverfield"" is just a downright entertaining movie. It's got suspense, good humor and cool looking action scenes. The shaky camera wasn't even bad, it added to the overall effect.Rob is going away for his new job, and a large group of friends throw him a going away party. Unfortunately, the party must end abruptly when a giant grasshopper looking monster begins destroying the city. The cameraman for most of the movie is the comic relief best friend character Hud, and him being the cameraman works very well. Some intense scenes needed a bit of comic relief, and he worked just fine. The action scenes are usually shaky, but they still look great. Because the first 20 minutes of the film are used to introduce the characters and their backgrounds, the audience can actually relate to these likable group of young adults.It's a very entertaining flick. See it in the theaters for the amazing sound effects.My rating: *** out of ****. 74 mins. PG-13 for violence.",Cloverfield
105,aharmas,Shaking all over,10,21 January 2008,"First of all, get over the shaky camera work. What is it supposed to be like when you're running for your life and/or being attacked by some pretty nasty and messy monsters? Our camera man does more than amazing work, hanging on to his video camera as he runs from one battle zone to another, is attacked by some vicious insect-like pests, has to find a way to move between two buildings that are in the best of shapes, and he has to correct a few crisis of his own, as our four characters try to keep one step ahead of a creation that Godzilla would envy, and the U.S. Army has a hell of a time trying to keep under control.One thing is for sure, we are left wanting more, as the X-File look and feel of the film doesn't really tell us much about the origin of the creatures, the final resolution, and well, we want to see more of the damage and destruction that is done to NYC. One thing is certain. there is plenty of nifty special effects, as fire balls, bombs, bullets, minor earthquakes, and some destructive attacks make sure some landmarks go from contemporary masterpieces to historic ruins in seconds. The shots involving the Statue of Liberty and a famous bridge are cinema classic moments now.""Cloverfield"" doesn't lack suspense, excitement, and some very scary moments. Not since ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" have I felt this degree of involvement with the ordeals of the main character. It demands to be seen over and over to appreciate many of the scenes that go by at hair raising speed. It is a great film!",Cloverfield
106,Enchorde,Go Monsters!,6,6 July 2008,"Really, I'm going to write about the ending so don't read if you want to see it for yourself first.Recap: There is a party. Rob is leaving, and this is his going-away party. Not everything is happy though. He and Beth, who seemed to have a relationship going, have a fight and Beth leaves (with another guy). Shortly thereafter the entire building shakes and the lights go out. People go out on the streets fearing an earthquake. But soon buildings seem to collapse randomly and people realize that this is not the forces of nature at play. They are under attack.Comments: Filmed entirely in the way of a home recording so the first word that comes to mind is: Different. It's shaky and of poor quality. Some odd cuts and also some material of a previous recordings acting as flashbacks. I can see how this can be annoying but it didn't disturb me. I think it worked fine.What did disturb me was Hud. Hud is the guy holding the camera most of the time and has one heck of a problem keeping his mouth shut. He also is something quite stupid. Yes, I know, Hud is experiencing some extreme events and some people react that way. But hey, I'm watching a movie about alien monsters attacking New York, so can we keep the annoying but realistic people out of the movie? It's not like it is really an documentary, even if that is some of the point with the camera. I found myself rooting for the monsters trying to kill Hud...The there is the ending. I like open endings most of the times. Leaves something for the viewers to think for themselves. Something different than most movies. And I respect the writers/directors choice to do it this way. But I myself would have gone with a traditional Hollywood-ending were the good guys clearly win. Not as realistic maybe, but leaves you with a lot more feel-good, and you leave the movie a lot more content. Now I got the feeling that it was cut short and I was missing a lot, especially since the movie is just 80 minutes.Otherwise, I did like it. Good effects and I liked the way the monsters were slowly introduced, and never really explained. It got me curious. I really wanted to see the next scene, see what more was revealed, what happened. So I quickly got engaged in the movie, and whenever that happens a lot is won. Therefore it is unfortunate about the abrupt ending. I felt left out. But well, it worked really well for an evening, and I got rid of Hud. Kudos to the monsters! 6/10",Cloverfield
107,Jonny_Numb,Operation Enduring Love,5,5 December 2008,"A lot of things get smashed, destroyed, and brokenheck, most of Manhattan, for that matterin ""Cloverfield,"" but the film never really breaks through the surface of getting us to care much about it. The most high-profile film of 2008's ""found footage"" fad is rife with spectacle in its attempt to postmodernize the drive-in flicks of the 1950s, where some Inexplicable Thing (irradiated bugs, hostile aliens, or plain'ol monsters) bears down on our resourcefulbut all too humanprotagonists. Yet ""Cloverfield"" falls shortthe ultimate result has scattered moments of palpable fear, but never really finds a suitable emotional pitch until it's almost over, and by then the plot machinations render any real sympathy a moot point. The film is problematically populated by narcissistic young-professional types residing in NYC, who are at Ground Zero the night some Inexplicable Thing attacks Manhattan; instead of fleeing, our young heroes instead set out to find the girlfriend of the main protagonist, trapped in her apartment complex. ""Cloverfield"" takes elements from ""Godzilla"" films, Gap ads (the no-name cast is certainly model-caliber, if nothing else), and even ""Shaun of the Dead"" (down-and-out guy trying to win his girl back in the midst of extenuating circumstances), filtering the unraveling spectacle through a first-person perspective; this gimmick, surprisingly, doesn't work as well here as it did in ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Quarantine""instead of heightening visceral experience, it paradoxically draws too much attention to itself ( having the camera guy constantly mentioning his need to ""document"" everything doesn't help matters), while at times wanting to draw attention away from a lot of obvious CGI. And it's hard to be pulled into a survival situation when even the extras look like they've been done up by professional make-up artists. The blatant references to 9/11 don't resonate on a level any deeper than their blaring-neon obviousness, and come across as simplistic attempts to lend the film a social significance it doesn't deserve; and the glossy slickness of the film's look overall actively works against its chances of delivering a terrifying, in-the-moment experience. As with most experiments, ""Cloverfield"" is conceptually impressive, but a maddening disappointment overall.",Cloverfield
108,valleyjohn,Pure Sci- fi Joy.,8,6 February 2018,"The Cloverfield Paradox is the third film of this series . All three are very loosely linked and all three are very different films. I absolutely loved the 2008 Cloverfield film. It was a film that used found footage special affects really well before it became old hat but this is not that kind of movie. This is pure Sci-Fi and I loved it.In the near future, scientists aboard a space station are attempting to aid the Earth's energy crisis. Energy is depleting at an alarming rate, leading scientists to turn to a new source but the crew inside of it notice some serious side effects as the energy source causes them to collide with another dimension .Like the previous films there was a lot of secrecy as to what this film was about. In fact critics only got to see it when it was released on Netflix on Sunday after the Superbowl. 
I predict that lot's of people are going to hate this film. Sci Fi fans can be a funny lot and the cross over of genres won't please everyone.
Sure , it's a bit silly at times but I love the way it tied up why ( or how) the aliens invaded the earth. 
It looks great and at no stage did I not feel thoroughly entertained.

109,AudioFileZ,"One Viewing Seemed Not Enough, Twice Was One Too Many...",6,1 October 2009,"Cloverfield seems as if after watching you could, perhaps, appreciate more about it the second time...Well, not so much. It's a bit off-putting to start a review like this, but I think it's apt. WYSIWYG so just go with it.This movie is a bit slow for, say, 15-minutes. After that it takes off and due to the (no longer a gimmick, but a bona-fide cinema school accepted story-telling vehicle)-jerky camera method keeps you straining not to miss anything. If your a fan of sci-fi and, in particular, the monster genre you are going to definitely be ""in"".Now, since you have a commitment it's going to be a fast past rocky ride so you...Just go with it. And it really doesn't disappoint as even things that seem annoying pass quickly due to great tension. Unlike ""Lost"" we pretty much know what our protagonists are dealing with, an unexplainable unthinkable creature whose appearance has changed everything in short order. What makes it work is the jerky camera, the quite serviceable acting from the heretofore unknowns, and decent special effects. It is, I feel, hard to make a horrific monster that isn't campy, but the producers have succeeded in doing that with the limited revealing segments showing it and it's offspring(?).If you like sci-fi see it, if you are enamored with ""creature movies"" definitely see it...Just, if you're like me, don't expect it to be better or more revealing a second time. With Cloverfield once is enough.",Cloverfield
110,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Found Footage/Giant Monster Film,9,5 February 2019,"This was film I was intrigued by when I first heard of it as I'm a big fan of giant monster films. My first viewing for this one was right after college. I enjoyed it, but that was the only time I'd seen it. The official synopsis is a group of friends venture deep into the streets of New York on a rescue mission during a rampaging monster attack.It starts off telling us that the footage we are about to watch is from the area now know as 'Cloverfield'. It is formerly known as Central Park. The footage begins with a guy looking out of an apartment overlooking the area. He goes into the bedroom where we see Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable). The man is Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David). They plan their day together going to Coney Island.The footage then shifts to Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas). She is with her boyfriend, getting things ready for a party that night. He is Jason (Mike Vogel), Rob's brother. Rob is leaving for Japan for a new job and they are throwing a going away party. They don't realize they are filming over the great day that Rob and Beth spent together.Back Rob's apartment, Hudson 'Hud' Platt (T.J. Miller) is convinced to film the party and to get people to say on their goodbyes on tape. They give a surprise to Rob and he had no idea. He starts to ask about Beth. She shows up with a new guy, upsetting Rob. All the while, Hud is trying to get the attention of Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan) and figuring out what is going on between his best friend and Beth.Things take quite the turn though when an earthquake hits. They turn on the news to hear about a ship overturned in the harbor and then rush up to the roof to see it. There's another earthquake and they flee outside. There's a giant monster that moves past and the head of the Statue of Liberty rolls down the street. They decide they have to flee the island. This all changes when Rob gets a call from Beth. She's trapped in her apartment and he decides to try to save her. This won't be easy with whatever this giant monster and the things that fall off its back.As I've alluded to, this is only the second time I've seen this film. I knew from the first time that I liked it, but after this rewatch, there were a lot of things I didn't remember. The first thing that struck me is the emotion of this film. It starts off as a really good drama. I love the editing of the happy day that Rob and Beth had together, with the reality of where they are today. Building that emotion in the beginning makes sense as to why he is risking his life for her. To be honest, this is something that I've thought about on a regular basis if something like this happened around me. I was a big fan of that aspect.The next thing was I for whatever reason thought they really didn't show the monster much. I was wrong about that. We get to see the monster a lot. I will get into more about the look of it a bit later, but I do love that much like the Godzilla and other giant monster films, we get to see it quite a bit. Making the film found footage is interesting as well, since we get to see it from the perspective of what it would be like trying to survive this.There is a section where the surviving members of the group have a run in with the military. I love what happens to Marlena during this stretch as I found it interesting. Everything all happens in one night, so they wouldn't have the answers yet. It was interesting how this plays out for sure.Now really the only issue I have with this film goes back to the found footage aspect. I believe that Hud would keep the camera and keep filming. It is even more prevalent in today's society that we would film things around us like he is. This is a major event and will change the course of history. There are just times where I'm like; wouldn't you put the camera down here? It just makes it implausible that you would risk yourself to just keep filming. This doesn't hurt the film, but it is an issue with found footage.This brings me to the pacing, which I think is great. The film doesn't waste any time. The introduction of the characters is good and it doesn't take too long. We continue to learn about each one as they try to survive this event. I really dug that aspect of the film. Rob becomes the catalyst for what they are doing and I thought it was interesting how it presents his issue and how he actually grows from it. I thought the ending was good and bringing us to how the footage was found. I dug the making confidential and that the government has confiscated it.Acting was something else was really good. It is crazy that quite a few of these actors have gone on to do other things and this film really shows their potential. Caplan is solid as the outsider. She does bring some sarcasm and I thought her role was good. Lucas is interesting and her frustration was good. She is a good friend throughout. Miller also brings humor. His character isn't that different in Deadpool. I love his nervous tick to just talk, especially about inappropriate things. Stahl-David is good. He is kind of the hero and I thought his growth was solid. I just love that he's scared to fail and can completely understand it. Vogel was also solid as his brother. Annable is gorgeous and it is just a shame she wasn't in the film more. I'm also a big fan of her. It does well at making you care about these characters, so when some of them die, you feel something. The rest of the cast round out the film for what they needed as well.Next would be the effects of the film. To bring a monster like this to life, you have to go CGI, which I thought looked great. The monster looks real and the things they have it doing are as well. There are a few moments where it doesn't hold up, but very little. As I said earlier, I was actually surprised how much they do show the monster. The setting is also great to make New York look as empty as everyone is trying to flee. That is an underrated aspect of the film as well. The film is also shot very well for being found footage. It does make you feel like you are really there.The score is something else that can be tricky in a film like this. The only music I remember was at the party and it felt like we were really there. The rest of the sound design was good to make it feel as real as possible. You get the sounds of monster, the army fighting back and just buildings falling part. I thought this was well done to help build the realism.Now with that said, I'm definitely glad I gave this film a rewatch. I knew that I liked it the first time, but I can confirm this film is really good. As a fan of giant monster films, this one feels so real. Going with found footage like they did make it feel like this really happening and the realism is great. I thought the acting, effects and sound design were really good. The low running time and editing of the film keep the tension building to a satisfying conclusion. I even like the beginning being somewhat of a drama helps us to like the characters and care about what happens to them. If you don't like found footage, I would avoid this. If that's not the case, I think this is a really good film, especially if you like giant monster films.

I did have a bit of an issue that the military letting them go and allowing them to film as much as they do. Not sure that they would, but the only thing would be the humanity of the military officer which could cause him to break protocol. He probably wouldn't be found out so there is that since this is all pretty haphazard.Now really the only issue I have with this film goes back to the found footage aspect.

112,onepotato2,"dumb, across the board",2,23 April 2008,"This is the movie that technically talented but shallow people (people who think Star Wars is deep) would make. Even if you buy the premise, of all the people this event would affect in Manhattan, we have to spend the whole movie with dumb, inarticulate, shouting, self-absorbed 25 year olds (all of them white, natch), who couldn't think their way out of a dumpster. I guess all non-white people over 25 made it off Manhattan. You just get the feeling that these shallow dicks cannot wait to tell everyone it happened to them.The movie takes all of about twenty minutes to squander its potential. It starts with an interminable, dumb party scene whose entire purpose is to convince 25 year old viewers that the characters are cool enough (and the right age) to identify with. There is nothing of later importance that you need to take note of in the party scene. Then we're deposited in the poorly developed, intelligence-free creature half. The design of the creature is just a massive dud. Its semi-revelation comes way too soon, at which point it's such a lame concept that the only thing the movie can be is ""Biggest zoo animal ever, loose in the city."" If you don't have better ideas than that, just never show the damned creature. Just because your chosen format (video journal) doesn't allow the characters to fully understand the story, doesn't mean filmmakers can proceed without one so they can blow crap up. Why an undersea creature farts flaming bombs is just one of the juvenile resolution/conception problems (who knows?). Even if you read about the creature's back story, it makes no sense.I was trying to imagine which idiot would be the tastiest. And couldn't this thing eat them quicker? And then track down the writers? For this to receive accusations of originality is just sad. Everything in the movie is how Hollywood does it. It never feels real (which would have saved it) because characters continually do the same dumb, scripted things that Hollywood would have them do. Eminently fast-forwardable. This is a unusually dumb, very silly movie.",Cloverfield
113,EdgarST,Very good,9,7 July 2011,"A slight problem with films like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"", whose stories we see through the eyes of someone behind a camera, is that it is improbable that in situations of such a stressful nature anyone would keep on registering the events, even in fantasies like this one, which are ruled by parameters far from the realistic. And, as in ""Titanic"", most of the events would probably happen in darkness... It is obvious that nobody would like to watch a dark screen while people shout, but just imagine the real events of the Titanic tragedy, deep in the dark, and in a chilling ocean... This is hard to convey cinematically. This said, ""Cloverfield"" is one very good motion picture, dark, pessimistic, terrifying. You may think I am pushing things too far, but for me this is a most telling metaphor of American people's fears, (the more so with the action taking place in New York), just as the Godzillas, Mothras and Rodans were projections of the Japanese panic after the atomic bomb experience. The film has a by-the-book script with plot points where film industry lawyers unwittingly want them to be, a love story that (not surprisingly) is the raison d'etre of the whole enterprise, adequate rhythm, little music, and it is short as it has to be, before a know-it-all starts making ""Cartesian"" demands.",Cloverfield

Damsel in distress? Check. Idiotic decisions by group and leader? Check. Monster not shown enough/short-changing the audience? Check. Military unable to kill off Beastie til the end despite dropping enough firepower on this thing to level Manhattan? Check! You hadda like the staying power of the camera and it's batteries, by the way. I didn't buy for a second that the BIG GREEN MUTATED SALAMANDER WITH THE FIVE LEGS was able to swat down copters so far up in the air, either. That was-well, silly.I DID like some of the cast-esp. Hud the camera guy, the black gal, and poor unfortunate Marlena who winds being bitten by one of those mutated deer ticks and blows up. I did enjoy some of the whole cliffhanger highjinks involving that leaning skyscraper and the rescuing of the damsel in distress, though the whole segment was idiotic-screw it, that's a monster movie.I THINK the Monster is dead at the end-NUKED, you have to have SOME amount of believability here, ya know?

116,RainDogJr,It's eating people,7,5 February 2008,"When a group of friends are at the goodbye party of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) some strange creature attacks the city of New York. The film show to us the experiences of the friends dealing with this unknown creature.This all the plot of this film and certainly is not the best thing of the film. But the way the film is made with the style of an amateur tape and the hand held camera is great and the visual part is just perfect. To talk about the monster is unnecessary because is still a mystery and is going to be very useful to create a franchise in a very near future. But still i think it missed something with the monster because i don't like the love story that is behind the main plot, i know that they are trying to make us feel something about the characters but for me the love history is not even credible.The cast of the film is good, with new actors making a nice job but still nothing special and again the visual part is more important and in consequence is the best thing.And i haven't watch a marketing for a film like this one in the last years, create almost a cult for the film before it release. I wasn't very excited about the film but i was expecting the revival of the monster film and for me in this film is missing something.Conclusion: judging by the reaction of yesterday's audience, the result was really strange because most of the people didn't feel that the film has an end and some people was like in shock but most was really dissatisfied. I didn't feel any of those feelings and i think that is what is missing, i mean to feel really disappointed or to be in shock and confused about it. Anyway for me is a decent film but of course is not the best sci-fi/monster of the last years but still have some really interesting things. Worth watching it in the cinemas for the perfect visual part, well only before the release of ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" in my country. 7 out of 10",Cloverfield
117,Matt_Layden,An Experiment In Film-making Indeed.,8,20 January 2008,"Rob is about to go away to Japan for a new job, so his friends decide to throw him a good-bye party. The party is quickly disturbed by an earthquake, which is later discovered to be from a giant unknown creature terrorizing the city of New York.To describe this film would be saying what everyone has been saying since its release. Cloverfield is Godzilla meets The Blair Witch Project. This is not a bad thing; to negatives make a positive remember? If it weren't for films like Blair Witch we wouldn't have Cloverfield, then again if it weren't for films like Cannibal Holocaust, we wouldn't have films like Blair Witch. What Cloverfield does is take this idea and spin it on its head. Cloverfield is an experiment in film-making and it is quite successful.Just like Blair Witch the film starts off with a message that this footage was found and we are about to watch this uncut material. For the first 20 or so minutes we get character introductions, these are the people who will be seeing the destruction through; these are the eyes and ears. We don't get much characterization, but enough to know who's who in the grand scheme of things. We see a romantic sub-plot that will no doubt become more important as the film goes on; we meet our cameraman, a sarcastic guy who doesn't have the guts to talk to this one girl, this one girl who is only there to meet up with her other friends later. We also see the main characters brother and girlfriend, but we never get to really know these people. Which is fine, we only get a glimpse into their lives because it's all about the destruction right? The destruction itself is very well done. This is where all the money went. No high tech cameras, just special effects for destruction for New York. Every bit of it was realistic. I was scared this was going to be another monster running around New York bit that Godzilla pulled on us, and yes while it is that, the film is much more. Not once did I ever believe anything in Godzilla, here I was entertain and engaged. I felt like I was actually watching real footage. The unknown actors were a good choice, it adds to the ""found footage"" feel.The monster itself is cool looking as well. You never get a full view of it until the very end, but it's the bits and pieces of it that make it scary. Reeves builds up great tension as the monster is roaming the city and we see the destruction from a distance, yet we still have fear that it could kill us.In addition to the giant creature, there are little ones. Apparently they are parasites. They seem like giant spider-crabs to me and they are quite scary. I'm glad that Abrams and crew decided to go with something original and not re-tell Godzilla. This was a brilliant choice and helped the marketing of the film immensely. The sound is sharp and loud. Specifically when the army blasts away at the creature, it makes the viewer feel like they are there.I never once felt sick with the camcorder shaking around everywhere, but others in the theatre were. They were also disappointed with the ending, as half the theatre moaned and asked if that was it. I don't know what they were expecting, maybe some answers? Well you won't get any here. We saw the destruction through the eyes of this camera; we don't know what's going on. The characters don't know what's going on, they speculate that it could be alien, or government secret. There is no scientist with a white lab coat here explaining what the monster is or where it came from. If you're content with this then you'll love this film.Unlike Snakes On A Plane, which I loved by the way, this film lives up to the hype expected by the fans. All the speculations can go to rest Cloverfield is here. Now let new speculations arise.",Cloverfield
118,lewiskendell,A return of the monster flick.,7,24 June 2010,"""IT'S A LION! IT'S HUGE!""OK, that's not a real quote from the movie. But that meme (and its endless derivations) are a testament to how excellent the viral campaign for Cloverfield was. The initial trailer for the movie was one of the best I've ever seen, and it had me and countless others scouring the trailer and the Internet for any clue to what this movie was going to be about.Once it finally arrived, I have to say that it mostly lived up to all the hype and anticipation. It's basically a monster movie about a group of people who get caught in Manhattan as a huge, powerful creature lays waste to the city. They have to venture across the island to find and rescue a friend of theirs, before attempting to make their escape. It goes without saying that they encounter a lot of danger along the way, including some smaller creatures that seem to fall from the larger beast. The entire movie is filmed from the viewpoint of a camcorder (which apparently caused motion sickness for some viewers), and as a result it's about as realistic as this kind of a movie can be. (I'd also trek across a war zone to get to someone who looks like Odette Yustman, so that's pretty realistic, as well.) The special effects were solid, there's a lot of genuine tension, and all the actors and actresses were authentic enough to pull of the realism that the movie was shooting for (the guy playing Hud was incredibly annoying, though). The monster is seen only in half- glimpses for the majority of the movie (smart), destroyed NY looks amazing, and it's not hard to suspend your sense of disbelief and get drawn into what's happening to the characters. It does strain credibility that this particular group of people encounters the monster so many times, but that's a small niggle. As is the fact that it doesn't hold up quote as well after multiple viewings. If you don't like this movie, this genre just doesn't appeal to you. I just hope you're not susceptible to motion sickness.",Cloverfield
119,yoggwork,the authenticity and impression are perfect,7,18 February 2019,"Some of the intense motion pictures are really dizzy, but the authenticity and impression are perfect, and the actors are very natural in the camera.

120,screenman,Not A Bad Effort,7,8 June 2010,"Frequently compared with 'Blair Witch' as an amateur's movie legacy of terror at ground-zero, 'Cloverfield' comes with a much bigger budget. The scenario spiralling out of control presented from the uninformed 'everyman' perspective rather than that of the more traditional 'expert' was also attempted by Spielberg in his rather hammy, over-the-top borathon remake of 'War Of The Worlds'. Well; Cloverfield is considerably better.The problem - for me, at least - is the lengthy scene-setting preamble. We are treated to a tiresome, hedonistic party of young people, getting highly sexed and pretty drunk, quibbling about their shallow little lives. On and on it goes, with the wobbly hand-cam making for a dizzying sensation. Can there ever be anything more boring than movies of other peoples' parties? For me, it was almost a turn-off.However; for those who stay the course, when things liven-up, they are worth your patience. The wobbly-cam comes into its own. There are some truly excellent scenes of disaster, panic and general chaos, that I would have liked to have dwelt on for a little longer; a great deal of imagination and no little money must have gone into their creation. In the dark, the CGI joins are seldom evident. The main monster is enigmatic and imperfectly seen, which really works better than full-frontal. Late in the movie we do briefly come face-to-face with it in the park as it devours our cameraman, and I found the revelation disappointing - a bit of an anti-climax.As well as the biggie, there's any number of small dog-sized terrors like shrimps or insects that are fast-movie and vicious. So it's not just a case of hiding in a doorway till the 'Godzilla' thing has blundered past.There are plenty of taut little shocks. The set pieces - what can be seen of them - seem excellent.But despite all of the positive technical issues, I come back to the old bugaboo: STORY. It's something that happens to people you are induced to care about. And once again; I wasn't persuaded to give a toss about any of the characters. They are the sort of shallow young brats that inhabit every gore-fest. Freddy Kruger's been dispatching them for years. You'll find 'em in 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'Wolf Creek' - where not? In fact I don't believe I saw a single character above the age of thirty-five. A better mix and more interesting relationships as well as more clearly defined and less stereotypic characters would have been a big plus, and this is where 2 of my stars were lost.As a comparison, I found all of the characters in 'Pitch Black' rather fun, each had something to say, and I was sorry when the got axed.Still; it's got plenty going for it in the effects, sets, and suspense department that are well worth a watch. There's just this rather unfortunate hole where STORY should have been. Some survived, some died. I think the monsters got killed. That's it.",Cloverfield
121,brando647,"""People need to see this, you know...""",8,1 May 2008,"When I first saw the teaser trailer for this movie in the summer of 2007, I was psyched. The image of the Statue of Liberty's head being tossed across Manhatten to land in the streets was enough to hook me. I had to know what it was that was tearing New York to shreds. When I finally got to see the film in mid-January 2008, I felt it lived up to the months of hype surrounding it. The movie puts a new spin on an old concept: it's your usual monster movie with a giant creature stomping through New York but it's told from the perspective of a group of people caught in the middle.Some people are turned off by this film because it's shot entirely from the perspective of a home video camera carried by one of the characters, Hud (probably my favorite character, played by T.J. Miller). As a result of this odd style, the camera is frequently shaky and sometimes disorienting. People with motion sickness should probably just steer clear (or invest in some Dramamine). For those without inner ear issues, it's worth checking out. The home camera POV places you right in the middle of the action, as if you were running right there with them. We see the destruction and, more importantly, the creature from their perspective. At first, we're only treated to short glimpses of the creature...a tail here, a foot there. As the film progresses, we get to see more and more.I personally thought this movie was awesome (even better once it hit DVD...seems easier to watch on the small screen). The unknown actors that were cast in this movie do a great job, giving you reasons to hope they don't end up creature-fodder. The creature is probably the coolest monster to come out of American cinema in years (and it's tons better than that Godzilla fiasco from the 90's). The somber ending (which I won't go into detail on) leaves you wanting more, though not in a bad way. I just wished the movie was longer; the 85 minute running time flies by. The movie take a little while to get into the meat of the action but it soars by when it finally does.",Cloverfield
122,moviewizguy,Blair Witch With Godzilla!,8,19 January 2008,"Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.With an ingenious trailer from J.J. Abrams himself, along with clever marketing, all of us can assume that the film may not be as good as the trailer and marketing. Well, we were wrong. Not only is the film as clever as the trailer, it's also a lot of fun! It's nice to see a great film in January, don't you agree?If you are still in doubt of seeing the film, let me continue on my review. Here's my take on the whole handy cam: Using this in the film makes it feel so realistic. During the action scenes, you feel like you're really there! I know a lot of people said this before but it really does! My only complaint is that it's sometimes annoying when the whole camera shakes around. Some might get stomach cramps.As for the production values, they are really well done. The visual effects are amazing. The action scenes are unbelievable. What else can I say? If you're worried about not seeing the monster, don't. You'll see it. You'll see it up close. And I thought I would never say this but I really like the character development! I would never though character development could take place in a handy cam.I'm also surprised to say, when we feel like we're there, that I actually felt scared. I had chills in my spine when something bad is happening. I laughed when characters popped up jokes. I felt sad when characters died. Also, there's no origin to this story, if you're looking for it. The performances by the unknown cast is above average. The most notable, is Lizzy Caplan, all the way.It's just a big monster movie! So, the film is entertaining, funny, sad, scary, heart-pulsing...The handy cam was a great idea and the action great! What else would you want from a monster movie? This is the movie to see this week! Watch it now!",Cloverfield

I was in total awe and could not take my eyes off the screen all 80 minutes of this excellent suspense work. JJ Abrams is a decent filmmaker and he did a great job here, this Monster is so terribly ferocious and so scary that I was deeply shocked and terrified that could not sleep well. The film is well done, and the fast tempo never gets you feel bored. it sucks you into its plot and makes you totally immersed. The poor main heroes die and you feel a sad, deep, pulsating anguish. They fight so bravely and try to survive that it is a real, real pity they die. The huge monster is so horrible, so scary, so huge that I felt a real pain and real panic it was on the screen.

All is filmed supposedly by the portable camera of Hud, one of them, that's why the thrilling images go up and down all the time. The contents of the movie are rather poor. We don't know who the monster is nor where did he come from and why is he attacking the city. And the final scene is utterly strange and unexplained. Well it keeps you chair-ridden till the end anxious to know the ending but it is quite disappointing and ununderstandable. And what means ""Cloverfield"" in this movie?

125,MartianOctocretr5,Keep that cam-corder running!,7,12 July 2008,"This film is pretty effective in accomplishing what it's trying to do. It obviously is inspired by Blair Witch Project in its ""amatuer filmer involved in the action"" approach, but is more adept in utilizing it to tell a story than Blair Witch was.New York gets it again, as in all the films that this one ""borrows"" from. (Cliché alert: the decapitated Statue's head lands directly in front of our heroes?) A bunch of twenty-somethings are having a beer party, when they're interrupted by the Blair Witch--I mean explosions. The guy who's filming the party wisely keeps the camera going, and through the footage, we experience what's going on as the characters do, through their eyes.The one glaring goof in the movie is that situations arise requiring the guy to put the camera down! Of course the continuous footage is intended to show the audience everything these characters experience, but only a retard would be handling a camera while having a fist fight with a creature in the darkness. The movie makers could have found a better way to solve this problem. The fleeting glimpses of the menace are cool and avoid showing the monster until the time is right; but again, that same unsolved problem: the person taking the footage ""in real life"" would make more of an effort to film this strange invader.The characters, although we learn a little bit of their back story through old footage partially erased (a very clever idea for expository flashbacks), are neither interesting nor likable enough to be identified with. After enduring their endless arguments, dim-witted choices, knotted hair, irritating voices, etc., I was ready for the creature to squish them all. Also, nobody handles a video-cam this poorly, not even the very first time they use it. Was he busy with a can of beer in his other hand throughout this entire episode?In short, I pulled for the invader to win. At least it had some creativity in its actions. And some intelligence.Even with the minor pratfalls noted above, this is an interesting and entertaining film to watch. Note that the abrupt ending with many unanswered questions points directly at a sequel. I hope the guy filming the sequel actually knows how to use a cam-corder.",Cloverfield
126,sme_no_densetsu,A refreshingly original monster movie,8,24 December 2008,"""Cloverfield"" is a monster movie that uses a 'cinéma vérité' approach similar to that previously employed by ""The Blair Witch Project"". The similarities end with the approach, though, as this film has more in common with the classic monster movies of the fifties.The cast, which is devoid of any big names, is a decent one. The actors manage to convey a sense of realism and rarely do their actions seem scripted, which is integral to the film's believability.The story is entertaining and fits well within the framework of the film. The characters and situations are believable for the most part, though I think that the ending seemed unnecessarily forced. One of the things that I really liked about the monster is that for a long time we only see glimpses of it or we see the damage that it has caused. This keeps us on the edge of our seats until the big payoff.The direction by Matt Reeves manages to capture the spirit of the film well; it is believable as an amateur video salvaged from a disaster site. The special effects are well done also, though a lot of the action is wisely left off-camera in order to leave it to the imagination of the viewers.I recommend this movie though I wish that the ending had been handled a little better. However, that is only a minor issue when weighed against the film's other, well-executed elements.",Cloverfield
127,Screen_Blitz,Terrific found-footage thrill ride,7,31 October 2015,"Directed by Matt Reeves and produced by J.J Abrams, this found-footage sci-fi thriller follows a group of friends who vacation to New York City for a going-away party for their friend Rob who is moving to Japan. The party is suddenly interrupted when the city becomes under attack by a giant monster, who destroys the Statue of Liberty and wrecks havoc to the city. When one of the friends' lover is trapped inside a building, they must sprawl across town in attempt to save her while surviving the massive monster mayhem that devastated the city. Featuring the cast of Michael-Stahl David, Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J Miller, Jason Vogel, and Odette Annable, this Godzilla and Blair Witch Project mix packs a punch of brilliant special effects and immense scares and thrills, but is executed with shaky camera-work that can get frustrating at times.This film was met with critical attraction before its release with its poster showing the dismembered Statue of Liberty, which was also shown in the trailer. This film does succeed on living up to its hype. Director Matt Reeves succeeds on keeping this film moving and giving the script a vision. From the point when the monsters began attacking, the film showers with fantastic special effects and CGI with building collapsing and numerous explosions that leave the city devastated with massive debris, hencing a highly intense atmosphere with plenty of action that resemble the Godzilla movies to polish it. The audience awarded with some incredible thrills and edge-of-your-seat scares, as well as some occasional blood and gore that borders on the R rating. There are, however, some flaws that are worthy pointing, the shaky camera-work in particular. As this is found- footage film, the camera-work gets really shaky and often quite nauseating. It can be especially pesky for the action scenes, making it somewhat difficult to tell what is going on. Overall, it didn't take away from its eerie atmosphere too much.Cloverfield may not the best found-footage film, but certainly is one of them. However, I do not recommend this film to those who have grown despised of shaky camera-work. Otherwise, this film would make a good pick.",Cloverfield
128,dunmore_ego,Blair Witch meets Godzilla meets YouTube,4,16 September 2008,"Big secret: what is Cloverfield? They kept the secret pretty well when this movie was in theaters.Not much of a secret. It's a monster. Okay? A big monster that does the Godzilla through Manhattan. The good thing about this banal ripoff is that it is never explained. If you're waiting for the obligatory ""radiation"" or ""extra-terrestrial"" origin, it won't come.The monster goes ""RAAAARRRGH!"", buildings get broke, people get dead. The End.""Cloverfield"" is the code name given to the patch of East Coast that has to be nuked to eradicate the monster threat. And on the DVD, we see that the film-makers affectionately referred to the funny-looking, twenty-storey monster as ""Clover."" How cute.Movie opens with a bunch of New York college kids in a hi-rise apartment, throwing a surprise party for one of their own who has scored a VP job overseas, leaving shortly. Was it too clever-clever foreshadowy that he was going to JAPAN? ... You know, city of GODZILLA?The opening party scene is on a hand-held digital camera, operated by one of the douchebags at the party. So it's choppy, shaky, amateurish and - here's the teeth-grinding part - supposedly unscripted. Scenes of people interacting, giving ""impromptu"" testimonials, camera walking in on scenes in progress; reminds us of the grand opening wedding sequence in THE GODFATHER - only crap.I kept thinking, ""If this hand-held gimmick goes on for very much longer, I'm gonna start peeling my skin off."" It's not that the kids are BAD actors - they're just bad ""natural"" actors. The irony in this age of YouTube and teens-filming-teen-bashings is that these kids can't act like they're NOT on camera! Just as Brando raged onto the scene with The Method, overshadowing the ""theatrical"" actors of his day, now we have a new wave of ""reality acting"" insinuating itself into our culture, not necessarily ""overshadowing"" The Method, but carving a place for itself in certain types of media.On film, unless you do it really well (Gary Oldman's NIL BY MOUTH, Paul Greengrass's UNITED 93), stick to The Method. These kids look like they're ACTING.And it screams inauthentic.Michael Stahl-David is the young VP, who, amongst the decimation, goes in search of his hot girlfriend despite her skyscraper leaning against another one; Jessica Lucas and Lizzy Caplan tag along; T.J. Miller is the douchebag who won't stop filming even when his life depends on it - literally - and Odette Yustman is the hot gf.Written by Dave Goddard, the hand-held format is ingenious in one way, as it provides exposition creatively, and only focuses on the action from he P.O.V. of these few kids, but all the little things start to bother: battery life - the batteries never run out; audio - everyone who we NEED to hear, we hear; the date stamp on screen - it appears whenever necessary, being absent when it threatens to annoy with its intrusion on the action......and it is not implausible that he should continue to film through all the adversity - we're in the generation that does that, unmindful of consequences - but it's implausible WHAT he films. For instance, when a screaming 20-storey monster is rampaging one block away, in clear view, with soldiers firing on it, what sort of a retard would focus on his friends across the street, hiding? See, for the movie's purposes, the camera has to take in as much of the story as possible, whereas if a partying douchebag WAS doing the filming, there is little doubt he'd be transfixed for all of this cam's unlimited battery life by the skyscraper-sized terror right in front of him.There is the iconic image of the decapitated Statue of Liberty - used in all the trailers. Question is: unless this thing came out of the water near Ellis Island, why would it make the tourist trip TO Ellis just to knock the head off that lady in the harbor? Now the giant monster effects are beyond realistic, and its original design was reasonably cool - but then it started dropping off insectoid creatures for the sake of the special effects techs who find it so easy to generate these things now (STARSHIP TROOPERS, KING KONG 2005, LOST IN SPACE). These little crab-like things were a continual annoyance. The movie was on its downslide at this point.Then it REALLY lost me - when it did that thing that all these teen movies do eventually - make unintelligence a favorable trait. The camera guy says, ""Maybe the monster came from a crevasse,"" and one of the girls gives him a look like he's talking PLUTONIAN, whereupon this gutless dweeb immediately changes his wording: ""I mean - a crevice."" Nice going, tool! Systematically driving down not only the intelligence level of the country, but the DESIRE to possess intelligence. How come no one ever retorts with, ""I'm not using any words that aren't in the English dictionary. What's your problem, dweeb?!"" Immediately on the heels of this stupidity, the chick who gave him the look criticizes him for being stupid! This whole plot device of a guy going after his girl is wearing thin with me. After all the mundanity of a monster knocking over buildings, they dial it down to the level of boring chick-rescue movie, then dial it down further with the deplorable acting when we find the gf with a REBAR beam through her shoulder and in the next scenes, she is raising her arms as if there isn't a gaping wound through her torso. Oh, and that shoddy hand-held camera-work? - the whole nauseous movie! (I need a skin graft...) Then the film-makers pretend like they're blasting out on the edge of originality when they have all our stars die at the end. By that point, I was kinda glad.Oh, did I ruin it for you?",Cloverfield
129,KUAlum26,"The Monster movie,from the margins",6,25 May 2008,"Having read through a sampling of some of the other comments on this site,I gotta say that I'm very struck by the fact that this film doesn't inspire much ""in-betwens"": a fair share of either 8s,9s or 10s or else 2s or 1s on the star rating,and more than a couple of angry,sardonic dismissals paired in with a few positive ""I get it"" type reviews.I suppose,having to chose between the negative and positive reviews,I'd be counted on the latter,though barely.At this point,I don't think I'm telling any secrets or revealing anything that isn't already known about this film:producer J.J. Abrams,director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard have constructed a spare,seemingly low-budget concept movie. That this is a creature movie--and what a creature it is,replete with nearly impregnable skin and spouting offspring that's much smaller but nasty and plentiful--seems to be somewhat of a subject experiment. In other words,this is a monster movie,but the monster seems to be of less direct interest than the viewpoint and survival of some of the New Yorkers who are enduring it,in this instance the five-some of friends/family who are coming from a going away party for one of them in mid-town Manhattan. While the five actors Michael David-Stahl,Jessica Lucas,Lizzy Caplan,T.J. Miller and Mike Vogel(searching for a sixth,played by Odette Yustman)seem to show some sparks of interest,humor or emotional depth,their characters have almost no depth and hence,no real reason to care about them. It isn't until the more intimate,scary and tangential moments of the later film does it seem that there's much reason to have any interest into their fates,and by then,it feels like too little and too late.The best part of this film is by far the concept and,in a grudging sense,the execution of it. The hand-held effect of filming a movie,particularly in a horror/sci-fi sense,is something of an work in audience endurance. Since there is a premium on audience fear,confusion and apprehension in any scary film,the objective of the filmmaker is to make that fear roundly and emotionally real. If one can stomach(Literally and figuratively)the bouncy,disjointed and shaky filming process--which seems fairly credible given the circumstances--then the movie's creators have done a fantastic that said viewer will be impressed. Promotion of this film,as mentioned by others,also is the grand mark or opus of this creation,being able to achieve a sense of audience interest and curiosity WELL before its release,an accomplishment that puts it up there with such cult films(which became equally famous for the public interest burnout that followed the initial swell of turnout)as ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Snakes on a PLane"".Overall,I'd say this movie is certainly worth a look,though I wouldn't give any grand superlatives for how brilliant or great it is. It's effective,""BOO!""-type sci-fi/action/horror,that revels more in the concept and image than the volume of the product. NO more,no less.",Cloverfield
130,Pumpkin_Man,Pretty Good!!!,7,16 August 2009,"This movie makes you feel like you are there when everything is happening. It makes it seem more realistic. It was a great storyline, but by the end of the movie, my eyes were hurting, and I had a headache, because of the camera shaking. Maybe it was because I was dumb enough to sit too close to the screen. Here's some advice: sit far back away from the screen. The monster was very creepy. There was a scene where the main characters are in a helicopter, and you see the monster being attacked and falling down, then there's huge smoke where you can't see it. Everyone thinks it's dead, then all of the sudden, the monster jumps up and attacks the helicopter, and it feels like it coming right at you.

New York is attacked by a unidentified monster and the film focuses on a group of friends as they run around in the panic and then decide to rescue another friend.The film starts off a little slow and the camera work is murder on the eyes and mind, but you adapt to the shakiness of the camera and just when the slow start becomes interesting as Rob Hawkins contemplates on whether he should start a relationship with a friend who he has just had sex with.....The attack happens....Panic and hysteria ensue and then we witness the head of the statue of liberty being tossed onto the New York streets.The actors are all brilliant and capture the emotions anyone would experience when the terribly impossible happens, the director definitely knows how to bring in the audience and keeps the monster in the shadows and distance....with the characters constantly saying.""Did you see that?""The special effects are brilliant as the building crumble down and the fire balls scorch through the air, the monsters little bugs that wreck havoc on the people below; the only thing that made this film a little disappointing was the monster itself, it wasn't impressive like on would have imagined.",Cloverfield
133,antoniotierno,original disaster movie,7,11 February 2008,"The experiment is not about an epic disaster but regards a kind of style injecting a strong sense of terror into the whole story. It's not a life changing film but it focuses soberly on the reaction and humanism of a small group of people, on the way they react under such circumstances. The overall effect, probably helped by the moving camera, is terrifying, ""Cloverfield"" is really intense and gripping, scarier than other apocalyptic movies I had seen so far. It was defined a ""Blair Witch's Project"" bigger budget flick but this one is influenced a lot by 9/11 and You Tube. Actors are quite unknown but they did a good job.",Cloverfield
134,Vomitron_G,"A concept that isn't new or refreshing,... but it worked all the same.",7,5 November 2009,"The first 20 minutes or so of the movie, it wasn't the camera work that got on my nerves (it never did, really), but the characters who were introduced to us. Yes, I know, it was necessary, as we're supposed to feel for them, care about their problems, pick up on the romances & sex-talk, etc. etc. But I still saw nothing but a group of shallow twenty-somethings that had nothing substantial to say. Just a bunch of wealthy, modern day yuppies. Not exactly the most interesting social group of our population (although they always think they are). Why not have different groups of people (filming the events with digi-cams & cellphones) and have a couple of their story-lines cross each other at some point. Would have made things a lot more interesting, if you ask me. So, considering this film's high rating on here, I think most people fail to see that behind CLOVERFIELD's impressive façade, there's a better film hidden that simply wasn't made (or the film-makers didn't think about making). Just look at the Korean THE HOST, and you'll know what I mean with a better film. More interesting characters and better monster action. In CLOVERFIELD the monster didn't even form a direct threat for the main characters. There never was any interaction between them and the giant beast. So, one could argue that this isn't really a monster movie, but pretty much an old school disaster flick. Either way, what eventually saved the film, was its up-tempo pace. Aside from the lingering opening 20 minutes, the events followed one another tightly enough.The special effects were fine and the action throughout the film decent enough. And with the hand-held camera swooping around, rest assured: It's not at all nauseating and there are enough shots where you can get a decent look at the giant beast (and some other thingies too). But the only way CLOVERFIELD works, is when you don't think about things. When you do, you'll discover flaws or think of things you would've preferred to have seen handled differently. You'll basically discover scenes & shots that are just too conveniently set up, too well-directed and just aren't very realistic (and with docu-style realism being the complete blue-print of this film, you can consider that a flaw). To add to the implausibility, the character who's filming all the footage practically filmed like everything the whole time. I doubt in reality anyone would be able to do that when trying to save your own life and that of your friends. To ""solve"" this problem, the scriptwriters just had him say things like ""I'm documenting! I have to document this! I'll keep on documenting!"" one too many times. It had me thinking ""Yes, I know this is supposed to be real found footage"", so instead of enforcing the authenticity of it all, it kind of took me out of the action and made me more aware of the fact that it was just a normal movie. I'm sure I wasn't the only one experiencing this.But who gives a damn about these minor quibbles. I even ended up being forgiving, because I did enjoy the ride. So, regardless, CLOVERFIELD still is a fine GODZILLA-inspired monster-flick. And due to its bleak ending (of which we already get a pretty good hint because of the footage having been labeled ""The Area Formerly Known As Central Park"" at the beginning of the film), it's a whole lot less sappy than Roland Emmerich's blockbuster from 1998. That one ""feelgood summer hit-film"" true GOJIRA fans refuse to speak of and had the tag-line ""Size Does Matter"". At any rate, if you take out the popcorn and switch off your brain, you can have fun with both films. Big, dumb, loud, stomping grounds & levelling buildings. Works for me. The only real problem with both CLOVERFIELD and the American GODZILLA, is that they also pretend to be something else. Delusions of grandeur. Happens in all lines of work, I guess. I can forgive that if enough entertainment is provided.Oh yes, why isn't this concept not all that new or refreshing? Just check out a film like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST (1980). Heck, the concept of a ""faux documentary"" even goes back to the days of silent film-making, with a film like HÄXAN (1991). So, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT may deserve some credit, but sure as hell not all of it.",Cloverfield

It really is a home video. The ""characters"" are introduced to us through way of home video shots at a party. I'm assuming the film-makers thought this would make me feel more connected to the so-called characters, but it did the opposite. I was more distanced and I didn't care about them, worse than that, after so long of this party nonsense, I didn't care who the characters were anymore. But then something happens.The something was some kind of disaster that they weren't sure about at the beginning. Could be an earthquake, or could be some external presence. But remember this is all shot as a home video. Can you imagine what your home video would look like if an earthquake or some other disaster occurred? Yes, that's right, not much was captured. Lots of feet shots and screams of ""what's going on?"".The whole ""movie"" was pretty much shaky shots of people screaming and then shots of the ground as they start running.

136,lambiepie-2,Wanted....better,7,16 June 2008,"The problem I had with Cloverfield was not in the way ""nameless"" actors played their parts or even in the way a single camera recorded what was going on - it was in the telling of the tale.I grew up in New York City and no matter how one wants to romanticize it - no one in their right mind, no matter how ""in love"" they are with a person would be ABLE to go and get them in a disaster of proportions such as this. It's not about compassion - of course you'd have it, but it is about survival - yours. And New Yorkers know better than anyone that self-preservation is the number one thing on their minds. Especially when Godzilla - or a reasonable fact similar - comes to town.Again, this was NOT a feature film. I could have seen this in the SCI-FI cable channel and have been thoroughly entertained. Especially with it's running time.There is something marketable about the idea of this film, but when you pay upwards $15 to sit down and look at it, you're pretty much ticked. The beginning of the film - the set up - was plausible enough - but it just went on too long for my tastes. And there were a few plot holes left for the viewer that could have easily been worked out more for the suspense of it all, which it was not. Sorry, but I felt that the film was ""going somewhere"" - - then the strike happened and they had it end it abruptly to get it to the theaters.They're doing a sequel and for the first time I'm going to write: GOOD. This is one film that needs one, and my fingers are crossed that they don't fall into the same mistakes as before. If not, Cloverfield 2 can be a major chilling, scary, possible classic and a wonderful ""let's pick up where we left off and fill those holes for ya"" film. There is potential here.",Cloverfield

The film is exactly what you expect it to be - a first person thriller full of scares, screams and CGI. It's unoriginal, uninspiring and unspectacular, but it was never intended to be in the first place.If you can put your brain into neutral for an hour an a half, 'Cloverfield' is a decent if unremarkable piece of entertainment.

139,TheUnknown837-1,Was all the hype and anticipation worth it? Not really.,5,18 October 2008,"The marketing techniques that were used to promote the new low-budget American monster movie ""Cloverfield"" were used so well that the movie was destined to attract hordes of people to the theater just to answer their questions. An enormous amount of hype and eager anticipation was created as a result of the clever promotion efforts. But was the movie worth the wait and the hype? Not really.I will not expose the plot of the movie in a complex manner, because there's really no complexity to the plot at all. A monster of unexplained origin attacks New York City and a few survivors document the attack via a hand-held camcorder and thus, the entire movie is shown through this in a ""Blair Witch Project"" (1999) style. There is no music score to adhere to the documentary-like style.This could have been a good movie. This could have been a wonderful movie. But it isn't. Some people, such as my parents, disliked the film enormously for the reason that it is shot in the ""shaky camera"" fashion where the camera goes out of focus, jiggles around nonstop, and so forth. I personally am not fond of the shaky camera, but that's not the reason I didn't like the film.""Cloverfield"" is tediously slow, boring, highly uninteresting, features a few moments of well-done thrills and it does a good job and creating an illusion that all that is happening on the screen was real, but it fails to scare us, surprise us, and even really generally entertain us. This is a movie that was advertised really well, but amazingly the marketing was better than the product itself. ""Cloverfield"" is only about eighty-four minutes long and even then, its mercilessly long due to the fact that nothing really happens in it. The first half hour is pure nonstop dreck-style talking and yammering about pointless nonsense from these mostly annoying characters and then even when the monster attack finally arrives, ""Cloverfield"" has caused us to lose interest. Soon enough, the monster becomes uninteresting as well.To me, ""Cloverfield"" was just like cheesy low-budget science-fiction monster flicks that you will always find on the Sci-Fi channel. Examples including ""Python"" (2000), ""Boa vs. Python"" (2004), and ""100 Million B.C. (2008). The only difference is, it has better special effects and better acting.

They just know it's big and dangerous.What makes this movie an instant classic. Is that it's nothing compared to other monster related movies. For instants it's all filmed on a video camera. Giving it a realistic feel to it. Plus we as the audience will be confused and befouled by what is going on. Because there are no other pointer views besides the group of teens we see throughout the movie.I like that effect for the movie. Because if they revealed too much of what is happening. Then it be too ordinary to watch. Being questionable like the main cast makes the whole thing worth watching entirely.And if this was filmed with a cinema camera then it be no different than any other ordinary monster film. If you're looking for something that looks basic but entirely original. Then Cloverfield won't disappoint you.

142,ElijahCSkuggs,Young Hollywood's take on the Monster Genre,5,19 January 2008,"My topic alone should tell you straight away if you're going to enjoy this movie or not. There is a group of people who actually enjoy Young Hollywood and their movies, and then there are people, like myself who can't f@ckin stand 90% of the sh!t they feed us. I suppose you can guess from this last sentence what I thought of this movie. There are people in the middle ground where they tend to enjoy Y.Hollywood's flicks more or less, but I'd be the first to shake my head at their tastes....though with an open ear.Anyways, about the movie. The story is, as you know, found footage of a group of rich, young adults who are filming the destruction of NYC. And as you know again, it's by a giant monster. But what is the movie? Just them running and running just trying to escape, which would be the smart thing to do. No, instead they are on a rescue mission to find a girlfriend, or that's the easiest way to describe their relationship. Big surprise there huh? Y. Hollywood just HAS to include a nonsensical love mission that completely endangers everyone to unimaginable heights. Sure, I'd agree that it's a bold and brave thing to do, but when the guy in charge of this rescue mission is a complete narcissist who has ONLY this one agenda on his mind, it goes from being heroic to completely out-of-line and (insert negative word). How many times do you have to scream his name in his face for him to even glimpse at you?? But he gets away with it. The others obviously don't really care about living that much and I guess are in love with Beth as much as he is. Or do they just love this Hero so much that they'd follow him to the depths of hell? The whole rescue mission really doesn't even pay off very well. The actors are you're typical WB/FOX type pretties, and mixed with that typical Hollywood acting you're also given a very, very Y.Hollywood screenplay. If any of you are even slightly aware of the route Y.Hollywood has taken with humor, you'd know that the coolest humor at the moment is the type of humor the Fat Jewish Kid in Superbad delivers. I enjoyed Superbad by the way. Anyways, the actor using the camera delivers lines incredibly similar to the Fat Kid in Superbad. Though he did sound like Jake Busey....which ain't bad. The humor is very weak and predictable and just lame. But hey, it has it's fans, I'm just not one of them. I can go on and on about how pathetic this group of friends are, but maybe that was what the writer was trying to get across. How self-obsession still remains prevalent even when sh!t hits the fan. They should have dropped that love story right off the bat, but what do you expect from the creators of Felicity.Getting to the monster. It's cool. It's not bad. But it's a TOTAL rip-off of the PS3 launch title Resistance: Fall of Man. Go ahead, look up the game, and look at the creature designs. The resemblance is uncanny, and if you know of the game, when seeing the monster(s) for the first time, the surprise is nothing of a surprise. But, if you're not like me, you should enjoy the way it looks, it's unique, right Insomniac games? But I do still have another issue related to the Monster. The monster drops little creatures that are about the size of large Capibaras (ha!). Why do all monster movies these days have to include little creatures? Yeah I get that it's heightens the danger factor, but it's officially getting old, and it's pretty lame thinking. Creativity in Y.Hollywood is crap.And for people looking for scares, no, there are zero genuine scares. There are jump scenes, which use the played out formula combining Incredibly Quick Visuals mixed with Sudden Loud Music/Sound Effects. And even when they're in a tunnel that's pitch dark, you still see the scares coming a mile away. ""I can't see!"" ""Oh it has Night Vision, here let me help you."" Okay, what happens when they turn on the night vision? Yep.The only good aspects to this movie are the impressive visuals, cool monster *ahem*, and when the monster is on screen the movie actually works very well. But there is far, far too much Y.Hollywood bullcrap and no way near enough Monster. This is just more over-hyped Hollywood sh!t, that fails to deliver. But hell, if you do enjoy Y.Hollywood flicks, this movie will be you're film of the year. It's got everything you want, the pretty faces, the lame script, the side story of love....ugh, what a piece of crap. 4.5 outta 10",Cloverfield
143,jaredmobarak,Good luck tonight TravisCloverfield,9,18 January 2008,"Cloverfield is a damn good time at the moviessomething that one can't say very often in January, the month usually utilized to dump films while Oscar-bait from the previous year gets released. Seeing the first teaser attached to Transformers in July literally gave me goosebumps at the potential for what it could be. I will admit that while the hype was high, the past couple months saw it wane. The gimmick started getting a tad stale and the TV spots began to ruin the momentum it carried so well before anyone knew what it was. Producer J.J. Abrams knew what he was doing, though, as the end result exceeded expectations, taking the colossal monster genre as background dressing for the human tale of love and regret which came up front and center. I just feel bad for director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard because it is their film yet everyone describes it as Abrams'. Whoever deserves credit, they are receiving a ton from me. Every detail was painstakingly considered, there were actually some genuine scares (usually hard to come by for me), and the story had some weight and meaning, allowing the fine performances to have something to play for, rather than just running for their lives with egos and self-preservation the only thing worth living for.My main fear was on whether we would see the monster and how that visual would ruin the movie. Stuff like this only truly works for me if the creature creating all the havoc is something foreboding and unseen, always lurking and able to attack at any moment. Here, though, we actually get a look at the behemoth pretty early. From its tale attack on the Brooklyn Bridge to its full visual on TV screens in a local electronics store, we know exactly what it is causing all the destruction. The beauty of the filmmakers is that they never needed the monster for the film to work. It is a secondary character used only as motivation for our lead Rob to hunt out his love Beth and a means to preventing him from reaching her easily. Maybe the world falling apart around them is the catalyst for their feelings to finally boil to the surface, however, the fight is always going on around them; it's not about defeating the enemy, it is about living for something bigger then yourself, doing what you can for the people you love in a time of desperate need.Cloverfield asks a lot of its actors throughout. Filmed on a first-person camera, there are many long takes and unbroken scenes to express the aesthetic choice of this being a real primary account of the invasion found later on after the smoke settles. Emotions run high, death takes a realistic toll on both body and mind, and adrenaline flows forth to keep these heroes on the run to get out of Manhattan alive and intact. Each holds his/her own to make it all seem real, injecting humor so that the bleak moments can break with levity. Death is starring them in the face and, like anyone of us would do in that situation, they try to mask their fear with laughter in order to release some of the tension building higher and higher inside of them. Michael Stahl-David, as Rob, is by far the best of the group. He needs to go from deeply in love to tragically scorned and angry, happily surprised by his friends to scared for his life, and confident to risk his own being for another to devastated as he must explain the death of someone close to him over the phone. His emotions run the gamut and he pulls them all off with grace. Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, and Odette Yustman hold their own with the immense pressure of their situation weighing down on them as well. When tragedy strikes, and it does often, they must react realistically to every situation. Special mention also goes to T.J. Miller as Hud Platt, our surrogate guide through the mayhem, acting as our camera operator, complete with commentary and comedic relief with every turn.With the strong performances and the taut, simple script from Goddard, I have to praise the work of Reeves at helming the piece. With little to work with in order to have the audience relate to and rally behind these characters, we are thrust into the action pretty early on. Goddard crafted a yarn that succeeds from getting the small things right. Rather than go big budget effects, he relies on the human interactions to portray the action. Reeves understands this and allows for a brilliant documentary feel. If you are susceptible to motion sickness, be warned that the camera is very shaky and possibly even handled by Miller while he chases after his friends. The askew angles and amateurish cropping of frame add to this completely, keeping all the action truncated on the edges because if it were real, the viewer would only look when something catches his eye. Turning to see what they think they saw shows off the end result, increasing the fear and anticipation for what might come next. All the monster effects are adequately rendered and the utilization of digital camera tricksfantastic use of nightvision in the subway, awesome instance of auto-focus confusion with Hud, and precise usage of the fact that this is all taping over a previously filmed event (Rob and Beth's day out in Coney Island) which shows through wonderfullyshown to full effect. Complete with an ending that truly encapsulates what went on this fateful day in NYC, Cloverfield delivers on all its promises and becomes so much more than just Blair Witch Project mainstream. Every moment is real and touches you in a very personal way. It is an experience, a spectacle; not to be confused with the monster movies that only show you what is happening, this one puts you in the action, making you feel it all yourself.",Cloverfield

145,hall895,So very stupid,4,8 April 2011,"Cloverfield is what The Blair Witch Project would have been had Blair Witch been set in Manhattan and also been completely terrible. This movie is brain-dead, an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Perhaps you are willing to accept the basic premise of a giant, indestructible monster rampaging through Manhattan. OK, fine. But that doesn't excuse everything else in the movie which, by and large, is complete and utter nonsense. Things happen which simply cannot happen. Characters do and say things they absolutely could not or would not do. It's a giant mess of implausibility, absurdity and stupidity. And inanity. Let's not forget the inanity. As well as insulting your intelligence it may well also assault your sense of common decency. Manhattan skyscrapers crumble, people flee in terror from the ensuing debris clouds...gee, now where have I seen that before? In fact, the filmmakers actually brag about having studied 9/11 footage to make sure they got the look just right. Some people really have no shame. And why does it always have to be New York City anyway? You'd think just once one of these giant movie monsters would wash ashore in Boston or Miami or some random small town in Delaware. But then of course we'd be deprived of the sight of the Statue of Liberty's head lying on the ground. Because that's real original.Absolutely the only positive thing you can say about this movie is that the visual effects are for the most part very well done. The story is stupid. The scary moments are a lot less scary than the filmmakers would have hoped. The main characters are so boring, annoying or moronic (or all three) that you may well be rooting for the monster to chomp them in half. A special mention for the character of Hud, who also serves as the shaky-cam operator documenting events. Stuck as he is behind the camera for most of the movie you hardly ever see him. And yet he still manages to be one of the most annoying characters in movie history. The guy just will not shut up. And he apparently has an IQ of approximately 12. On and on this blabbermouth goes with absolutely nothing useful to say. Certainly nothing funny to say even though the character is apparently meant to serve as comic relief. Just another way in which Cloverfield fails miserably. T.J. Miller is the actor playing Hud and I will be doing my best to avoid anything he appears in going forward. He's beyond terrible, the rest of the cast isn't much better. Probably the only one to come away with any credit at all is Lizzy Caplan who you get the sense is wondering what the heck she is doing here. Her performance gives off the ""I know this is a terrible movie, I'm sorry"" vibe. In fact Caplan has since stated that she signed on for the movie not knowing anything about it and in the future she would not do a film without knowing full well what it is. Smart girl. If you decide to watch this movie knowing full well what it is that's your problem. Personally I'm ashamed that I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this garbage.",Cloverfield

Instead of a story you get an experience it is like a roller coaster. You get thrills, excitement, shocks, moments of white knuckled terror. Then before you can collect your thoughts it is all over and you are coasting towards the exit.The affects are amazing, Hudson gives some really nice little comedic lines and there is no senseless gore or bloodletting.Clovefield is more akin to The Poseidon Adventure than it is to say Godzilla as the monster really does only play a supporting role to the nasty situations the people are face with.",Cloverfield
147,MrGKB,An ambitious monster movie that can't crawl out from under its vapid script...,6,11 March 2008,"...""Cloverfield"" represents a triumph of what is known as ""viral marketing"" (mainly lots of teasers scattered about the Internet), which secured it a powerhouse opening weekend and more than enough butts in the seats over its theatrical run to guarantee a sequel, but in terms of storytelling left an awful lot to desire. As Shakespeare would have described it, the film amounts to ""a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" I caught this one second-run, and am glad I economized.Screenwriter Drew ""Lost"" Goddard is unable to transfer his success in television to the big screen, primarily by failing to get the audience to identify with his characters, despite spending the bulk of ""Cloverfield""'s first act introducing them. By the time they start dying, I didn't really care one way or the other; I had no emotional investment in them. Now, perhaps that's because I'm no longer a 20-something. But, my kids are, and I think that's the key; these 20-somethings didn't remind me of my kids, or any of their friends. They had no real identity, or real personality. Rob (Michael ""The Black Donnellys"" Stahl-David) is a VP of something-or-other heading for Japan to do who-knows-what. His brother, Jason (Mike ""Poseidon"" Vogel), has thrown a surprise bon voyage party for him, and among the attendees are Jason's girlfriend, Lily (Jessica ""The Covenant"" Lucas), Rob's best buddy, Hud (T.J. ""Carpoolers"" Miller), who ends up as the film's cinematic POV, Lily's friend, Marlena (Lizzy ""The Class"" Caplan), and Rob's ex-lover, Beth (Odette ""South Beach"" Yustman), who leaves the party early and provides the supposed motivation for the rest of the cast's trek across a monster-mashed NYC. Some might say she's little more than the film's MacGuffin, and they wouldn't be far wrong. Beth and the rest of the main characters have nothing in the script to latch onto to flesh themselves out, and seem virtually interchangeable. They're barely more than the impersonal statistics they'd have become otherwise had the camera not been there to record them.Then again, it's just a big ol' monster movie, right? And it's the rare monster movie that provides us with characters we care about. ""King Kong"" (both versions) springs to mind, as does ""Jurassic Park"" and a few others. Even ""Gwoemul/The Host"" does a better job of eliciting our empathy than ""Cloverfield,"" despite the cultural dissonance of the former. The acting is nowhere near as bad as some critics have complained, but Goddard's script just doesn't give them enough to wrap their chops around. More's the shame, because Matt ""Felicity"" Reeves does a remarkably good job for not having directed a feature film since the forgettable ""The Pallbearer"" over a decade ago, and the production values are outstanding, including the herky-jerky digital cinematography by Michael ""Lost"" Bonvillain, and superb SFX work by the likes of Tippett Studio (""Robocop"") and Double Negative (""Pitch Black"").It's all in the plotting, and ""Cloverfield""'s story is a simple one: boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy meets monster, boy rescues girl, boy and girl end up unhappy ever after. The film has its share of ""oh, c'mons,"" mostly ones involving the dubiously-motivated actions of its leads, but the audience's visceral thrill at being in the center of things somewhat overcomes that. Still, this viewer was left with the feeling that Goddard should stick with scripting television; small wonder that ""Cloverfield"" clocks in at barely 80 minutes.I'll watch ""Cloverfield"" again when it's released on DVD, but I'm not sure it'll find a place in my collection unless it has a ton of extras. Despite the stylistic similarities to the much more engaging ""The Blair Witch Project,"" this marketing monster just doesn't have the same legs.10.21.08 edit: Having finally caught up to the DVD (thank you, public library!), I stand by my comments above. My viewing companion mostly agreed with me, but did note, interestingly enough, that she was reminded of ""Friends,"" and suspects that the story was subconsciously written with that show in mind. Rob is Ross, Beth is Rachel, Jason and Lily are Chandler and Monica, Marlena is Phoebe, and Hud is Joey. Makes sense to me, and gives the characters more than enough back story to make them more engaging. The DVD includes a number of featurettes, a director commentary, deleted scenes, two vaguely ""alternate"" endings, and a few previews. The transfer is excellent, really showcasing the technical achievements of the film. Too bad it really wasn't a long episode of ""Friends""; now that would have been memorable!",Cloverfield
148,vip_ebriega,What the American Godzilla should have been.,8,3 October 2009,"My Take: An exciting modern take on the old-fashioned monster movie.Take a worn-out premise, give it a modern spin and make it just as scary and exciting for today's audiences. That's exactly what producer J.J. Abrams (ALIAS) and director Matt Reeves does and the premise being the old-fashioned ""attack-of-the-giant-monster"". The result was CLOVERFIELD, an exciting and frightening modern monster movie. I almost never get scared in scary movies nowadays, but this BLAIR WITCH meets GODZILLA does the trick. Here's a movie that begs to be seen on the big screen, where the loud sound system could take advantage of your senses. But seeing the movie on the small screen, with maybe a few lights dimmed and a bag of popcorn at hand, the movie is nonetheless effective.The premise is simple: A giant unseen monster attacks good ol' New York, as seen from the perspective of someone with a digital camera. The movie opens with a surprise farewell party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who's leaving New York for a new job in Japan. Documenting the event is Hud (T.J. Miller) was asked to interview Rob's friends during the entire party, including Rob's girlfriend Beth (Jessica Lucas) who expresses her reluctance for leaving. But once Hud films an explosion and a decapitated Statue of Liberty in the distance, the movie gets going. The disembodied head of the Statue flies across the street and the giant unseen behemoth proceeds to rip apart the Big Apple, and the movie gives us that uneasy feeling of being there as mayhem arises. The characters aren't exactly authentic, but here's an instance where they don't need to be. By the end of the film, you couldn't care less if Rob would choose the job in Japan or stay with his girlfriend; you just want them to get the hell out of there alive. That's what makes them effective.After 9/11, it's hard not to think that the mayhem in CLOVERFIELD echoes the events of that tragic event. This is probably the most accurate metaphoric view of the 9/11 since Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS. But above all, CLOVERFIELD is a great monster movie. It takes this usually worn-put genre and makes it just as scary and as exciting as such classics as KING KONG, THEM! and THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS used to be. CLOVERFIELD is bound to join other luminaries in the genre as one of the best monster movies of all time, and if that sounds like a faint praise, it isn't.Rating: **** out of 5.",Cloverfield

Studios have paid for positive reviews for decades, surely the internet hasn't changed that.Longing for Richard Carlson in ""It Came From Outer Space"" or even Dakota Fanning in ""War of the Worlds"" instead we get another of those hand-held camera things wherein the filmmakers are incapable of making a real movie, with real suspense, and rely 100% on cheap, stupid tricks. There isn't a trace of suspense or horror because the director has no clue how that's done.From the makers of ABC's ""LOST"" -- in my opinion the best TV series in decades -- we expected a first rate movie.

I know that this film was generally over hyped, but the truth is I didn't feel let down in the slightest bit. In fact, I feel I got more than I bargained for. The sound and action in the film are amazing, a perfect blend of horror, thrill, and even comedy. And the fact that it was taped through an ordinary camera makes it so real and exciting at the same time. You feel like you are in the film watching what goes down. The monster is awesome, and the film is damn good, I recommend this film to everyone.go watch it in theaters!",Cloverfield
152,fwomp,Godzilla Meets The Blair Witch Project? Sorta...,8,1 May 2008,"It's always nice to see someone in Hollywood take chances and move outside normal filming practices. Although CLOVERFIELD isn't wholly original, it does have an original feel thanks to the incredibly myopic look the audience gets via its length through one camera lens.Labeled as GODZILLA meets THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, Cloverfield definitely incorporates portions of both but comes out the other end as its own animal.The myopic view was seen, as stated earlier, in The Blair Witch Project, which had a hand-held camera being buoyed around by an amateur film maker, allowing the viewer to get up-close and personal with the story. With Cloverfield, we get the same experience but with a bit more high-tech status along the way. New York skyscrapers crumble and explode. The head of lady liberty comes hurtling down the street. The Brooklyn Bridge gets twisted and ripped apart like tissue paper. And the ""monster"" causing all this ...well ...you'll have to see that for yourself. I will say, however, that it was nice to only get glimpses of the creature and its 'offspring' since that is the way it would truly happen if viewed through one person's eyes.Which brings us to the Godzilla aspects of the film. Japan has that monster, and J.J. Abrams (LOST) gives us a new American one here. Unique is size, shape, and color, this new beast is just as tough to kill as Godzilla and has many smaller monsters (about the size of a regular dog) that it sheds like lice. And you don't want to get bitten by one of these lice; trust me! The more unique and intriguing thing about this new creature is that we know nothing about it since the story is all coming from one herky-jerky camera lens. Alien? Radioactive giant? Government experiment gone wrong? Who knows. This added to the realism of the story.Although I understand the need for character development, I felt that the opening 20 minutes dragged on a bit too long. The love story between Jason (Mike Vogel, RUMOR HAS IT) and Beth (Odette Yustman, TRANSFORMERS) added to the story in the end but was overly forced upon us in the beginning (""We get it! They're in love already!"") Two other notable items must be mentioned. The first is the realism of the camera movements and the klutzy guy who carries it named Hudd (comedian T.J. Miller). Although why he continued to carry it sometimes bordered on ludicrous, his dopey demeanor helped make this easier to swallow. The second item is the sound quality. Absolutely amazing! The thumps, bumps, and explosions were an awesome thing to hear, and the dolby digital sound quality really shone through.Certainly something to watch on a big screen TV with a great sound system. This one is sure to please monster movie afficionados.",Cloverfield
153,Bob-45,WARNING: May Induce Post Traumatic Stress,10,2 June 2008,"What brought me to ""Cloverfield,"" was not that it was an over-hyped, star-studded extravaganza, with a compelling storyline. Quite the contrary, ""Cloverfield"" is none of those things. What brought me to ""Cloverfield"" was the most compelling TV trailer I'd seen since ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" over 40 years ago.While watching ""Cloverfield,"" I thought, ""While always clever, the first 20 minutes are almost tedious; and what follows is not particularly suspenseful or scary."" I needn't share these thoughts with my wife, as she hated ""Cloverfield,"" without my help. THEN I had the first movie-induced nightmare I'd experienced in 50 years. I now understand the real power of ""Cloverfield"". Part ""Blair Witch,"" part ""Spielberg's War of the Worlds,"" part ""X-files,"" part generic teen movie, ""Cloverfield"" is also a whole lot more. ""Cloverfield"" is the closest replication of a nightmare I've ever experienced. Time and spatial elements are cleverly distorted. Sound effects elements are muffled. While the gore is convincingly explicit, it's not exploited, and much of the violence is suggested. The emotions I experienced must be a lot like those radio listeners felt while listening to the infamous Mercury Theater ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast. It was the spatial anomalies, however, that disturbed me the most. While the creature was impossibly enormous, it was also unbelievably flexible, apparently capable of extending itself several times its actual size. Aren't fears, at first, suggested, then ""in your face,"" the stuff of nightmares? Aren't darkness and confusion, ""the stuff,"" as well? ""Cloverfield"" has all of these. Further, the monster's progeny, spider-like creatures the size of hogs, create the more immediate threat, and the fear of ""What's moving on the ceiling of my bedroom?"" Kudos to the entire cast for making such ""ordinary"" characters memorable. Even more kudos to the production team of ""Cloverfield"" for doing what I always thought was impossible, i.e. the perfect recreation of the nightmare experience.I caution anyone who either directly experienced or lost loved ones on 911 that this movie could induce unbearable post traumatic stress. Certainly, ""Cloverfield"" and its resultant nightmare will haunt me for many years to come. I can state, without a doubt, ""Cloverfield"" is the most provocative science fiction film since ""The Matrix"" and may well be the best science fiction / fantasy film ever made. It's also likely to be one of the ten best genre films of the decade. I give ""Cloverfield"" a ""10"".",Cloverfield

And as a bonus, this movie was way funnier than I thought it would be.",Cloverfield
155,cultfilmfan,Cloverfield,7,26 January 2008,"Cloverfield is about a group of young adults who while having a party discover that some enormous creature is rampaging through the streets and that buildings are being destroyed and people are dying. The film features only a handful of main characters fleeing from the monster and one of them has a hand-held camera with him, so basically what he films is what we see. There were things I liked about Cloverfield and some things that only made it an okay film for me instead of a great one. The whole idea of a film being seen from the hand-held camera point of view isn't exactly new, but I thought the filmmakers did an interesting twist with this and it gave us a more personal side to the people running from the creature. While the hand-held camera movements were very shaky and did make me kind of motion sick and nauseated, I still appreciated this original way of storytelling and handling the movie. Another thing I liked about the film is that even though it is released by a big mainstream distributor and got a wide release, it didn't really feel like a big Hollywood movie at all because of how everything happened realistically and for a monster film it didn't really feel all that preposterous at times because of how real the characters, their situation and how they handled it was. Also there are not a lot of big fancy special effects, or camera tricks here making the film look more gritty and real. Because the film is not predictable and doesn't suffer from old horror movie formulas that have been done to death I applauded the film for it's original take on this genre of film as well as the direction and storytelling. Other than making me a bit nauseated, which I don't count as a negative feeling for the movie the only real problem I had with the film is that it started to drag a bit in the middle and the suspense and intensity of the film as well as the characters really started to die off for me in the second half. Had it been a little more suspenseful and had a little bit more action, or just anything else to keep my interest up, it would have made this film a really good one rather than just an okay one. Still, I was pleased that a mainstream Hollywood company would release a film as different and original as this, so I can say that that impresses me, but the film itself is only okay and I do feel it could have been a bit better.",Cloverfield
156,carbuff,"A classic in the ""found footage"" monster/horror genre, which will determine how you feel about it.",8,27 June 2020,"""Cloverfield"" is a truly top-notch monster/horror film in the ""found footage"" genre, which means you're probably going to love it or hate it. I enjoy all kinds of films, although horror isn't my favorite film type. The biggest problem I had with the film was that the protagonists were a bunch of smug, spoiled, young, New York, hipsters. I never felt particularly emotionally invested in their fates, because in real life I tend to find these kinds of people to be aggravating and self-important. To my way of thinking, in this film a bunch of people at the top of the metaphorical food chain get to experience what it's like to be at the actual bottom. Setting aside those admittedly snide remarks, I still found this film to be a compelling film experience, and, as an added bonus, the run-time was about perfect. So, if you're into the ""found footage"" stuff, you owe it to yourself to see this one, but if that kind of film only makes you nauseous, there's nothing here that you haven't seen in any number of monster movies before, just shot from a different perspective. I'll leave it up to you.",Cloverfield
157,rbrb,How a director /filming technique etc can ruin a half decent Movie.......,5,30 March 2009,"Recently saw a film called Quarantine at a movie house and the same technique used in that film as this one; hand held camera used to give more realism to the picture. Perhaps because it was on a wide screen the hand held formula worked in the afore named film, not in this one, and perhaps also because I viewed this one on the television. Indeed both films have similar story lines and similar endings; in essence a group of people trapped trying to escape monsters.Indeed I will be corrected but is not Blair Witch more or less the same?And also the same type of plot etc ? A lot of copying going on and not much originality, eh! So hence to repeat what is annoying about this movie is the way it is filmed; though despite that there are some good special effects and monsters but unfortunately none of the characters in the movie are particularly likable and indeed quite the opposite. Therefore a generous: 5/10.",Cloverfield
158,aesgaard41,Over-Hyped and Under-Appreciated,2,18 December 2009,"For me, Cloverfield is a good movie, but it's just not scary to me. It was best by fast-forwarding through the monster scenes and watching the character sequences. The special effects are really well done, but a real creature at the size depicted would have collapsed under its weight. The movie itself has a very ""Blair Witch Project"" feel where you follow the characters, but you're not allowed to learn anything or are you allowed to learn anything. The brief scenes of the creature (or creatures?) is something like a bald ape, frog, grasshopper and tick; it's never seen in full form and that's what makes it really annoying. There's a lot of overdone devastation, but not enough plot. I'm just not terribly impressed by it.",Cloverfield

A lot of people won't like the ""Blair Witch""-style, first person/shaky-cam method used to tell the story, but this is exactly what sets it apart from and above your ""average"" monster mash.

160,MihaiSorinToma,Bad...bad...BAD!!!,2,3 February 2018,"While at a farewell party a couple of teenagers find themselves in the middle of an alien attack, which seems to rip the whole New York apart. With one of the ""documenting"" the event, they venture into the war zone in an attempt to rescue one of their friends. Presented through the camera which films whatever they do, we follow their desperate adventures throughout the entire movie.As said above, the movie is presented through the ""eyes"" of their hand-held camera. Unfortunately, to say the least, this is the biggest flaw of the movie. The whole experience, if you can call it this way, is just a series of amateur filmed footage. To make matters worse, we're not talking about a good amateur film, but something coming from the sloppy hands of someone how hasn't seen such a device in his life and apparently isn't able to keep it straight most of the time. As a result, you'll soon get a headache which will only get worse as the film progresses. I cannot explain the sensation you'll have after seeing for over an hour an series of images which shake erratically, without any purpose or artistic direction. I can understand that it tried to be authentic, presenting all as it was filmed right from where the events happened, but the overall experience is simply unacceptable.And I haven't reached the plot yet. Speaking of which, is simply awful and without any logic. In the beginning, we're presented for about half an hour some sort of introduction, or better said a series of irrelevant and boring events, which were supposed to present the characters, their relations and their feelings. And just when you're about to give up and close the agony, the attack begins. As you would imagine, panic everywhere, military start to fight and evacuate everyone, and what do you think that our group of survivors start to do? Seek shelter? Evacuate maybe? Nope. They are ALL going to save the girlfriend of one of them, who just half an hour ago had a fight with her and separated like they weren't even friends anymore, but somehow decided to leave him a message that she's trapped in her apartment. And now, he suddenly realises that he loves her, that he knows what he's doing (you simply cannot be serious with this line), and that he's going to save her. Not to mention that his brother just died minutes ago and he didn't even shed one tear for him. As you could have imagined by now, the plot is lacks basic logic at its core, not to mention what is going to happen and what each character decides to do in each and every scene. I can understand that this type of movie cannot exist without a couple of stupid characters, but they've simply gone too far with this aspect. Due to the above mentioned, the atmosphere is dull and not interesting, caring about the characters is out of the question while the finale simply can't do anything in terms of good. Oh, about the finale, I won't spoil it for you but I have to mention that it is as sudden, as pointless and as predictable as the entire movie. What else can I say? Simply put, it's a movie which shouldn't exist. The fact that anyone would want to see this nightmare for the eyes is simply puzzling. The fact that someone would even go that far to consider it good is simply mind-blowing. Stay away, avoid or don't get any closer to it are simply understatements when speaking of this amateur footage!",Cloverfield
161,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"You've seen it before, but not like this.",8,10 October 2008,"Putting audiences right in the middle of the action is what many thrillers try to do. Many succeed, many do not, but what is true that ""Cloverfield"" succeeds tremendously. The hand-held camera gimmick and pseudo-documentary, that has been around since at least the infamous film ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and greatly popularized by ""The Blair Witch Project,"" is given a new genre - the monster disaster film, a la ""Godzilla."" The Hollywood version of ""Godzilla"" even took place in Manhattan just like this film, which also includes massive destruction to large parts of the city. Some of it is eerily similar to 9/11 as dust from collapsing buildings floods down a street engulfing fleeing people.The difference here is that ""Cloverfield"" isn't about awing audiences with tremendous special effects, but locking them into a thrilling point of view. Think of it like a roller-coaster; once it gets going it is fast paced with many things being just a blur, but the end experience leaves you breathless. That invites multiple viewings to see what might have been missed first time around, because once the main part starts ""Cloverfield"" is remarkably tense. The cinematography evokes that frenetic action of a helpless person running with a camcorder amidst destruction, but it is very well done and a careful viewing reveals more than might have been originally thought in all that blur and shake. The sound is also great. There is a possibility that it sticks out due to the shaky visuals and thus a viewer is forced to listen more carefully to get information, but when a film encourages its viewers to more closely inspect its details, rather than spoon-feeding it outright, can only be a good thing.ASIDE: it remains amusing that a standard camcorder can record so well after going through so much punishment!All in all, the dramatic aspects of the film aren't that original and thus the film is ultimately something that has been done before. However, it hasn't been done in this manner and that alone makes this a cinematic ride well worth taking. --- 8/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- terror/violence",Cloverfield

I noticed the movie listed and because I'd already seen or knew I didn't want to see every other movie on the list (yes modern movie making is that bad) and I kinda just felt like sitting in a movie for a couple of hours we thought we'd check this one out. we checked it on IMDb first and no one knew much about it and there were no votes but we thought we'd risk it, a costly thing these days but we hadn't treated ourselves for a few weeks.The initial few minutes were not promising, not boring or anything but just a handy cam being played back of some teens party. then it all kicked in, and it was an exhilarating ride.Yes the whole movie is seen through the eyes of a handy cam, yes Blair witch did the same thing, but this is not Blair witch. This is a big movie. the special effects were stunning. The sound was mind-blowing, surround sound (a feature which no handy cam I know of records, but I'm just being picky, i wouldn't want to downgrade the experience with mono camera sound). The concept was handy cam but this was no low budget amateur movie. The picture quality was well better than home movie, the lighting was good, scenes and camera angles all contributing to the story. i.e. they didn't get too hung up on the concept, but used it to make the whole experience non stop edge of the seat thrilling.The story was nothing much, a love story spread over the main feature, an unexplained massive creature gets p!ssed off and rips Manhattan to pieces. basically Godzilla, but that was the point, it's really a concept movie, nothing more nothing less and as that it succeeds amazingly. this was one entertaining ride and maybe it shows what it would be like to be under siege by enemy forces without having to deal with all the hassles of politics, or maybe it's just a piece of well made entertainment.Afterward I was slightly disturbed by how this movie was marketed. as in I'd seen nothing of it, and its no small movie. What was their plan?. to get people used to going to see movies on a whim and being pleasantly surprised after years of mostly being disappointed with the dross that Hollywood serves up. I felt kind of manipulated even though in my case there was no manipulation cos I just turned up on a whim and was one of the first people in the world to see it. So I guess I'm playing right into the ad mans hands and spreading the word of mouth to get you to go and see this movie, cos it is what you want a movie to be, something you couldn't experience at home (the sound is amazing and no home cinema or laptop is going to reproduce that).This is a genre defining great movie.

163,mario_c,A false documentary,7,1 January 2009,"CLOVERFIELD is a movie that - like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT did some years ago  is based on a false documentary. I mean there's an amateur film, shot in the first person, about something else and then something strange, which was definitely not supposed to happen, occurs, creating the point of interest of this false documentary. That's what happened with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and that's what happens with CLOVERFIELD. However there're too many differences between these two movies, and almost all of them, in a good point, in favour of CLOVERFIELD. I can tell two of them: First, CLOVERFIELD never tries to induce the viewer that what was been taped was real, was actually truth, unlike BLAIR WITCH which tried to do so with terrible consequences... Second, the plot is very different and definitely CLOVERFIELD has a lot more of action, interest and suspense. Yet the ending is very similar and, again, too many people claimed a typical ""Oh, that's it? Has it already ended?!"" But in my opinion I think it's a very good ending, the most logical one, and it could have happened even earlier I must say!

The movie had an enormous amount of hype throughout its marketing, the minimally teaser trailer kept people barely waiting for what's to come; surprisingly it's not about the big secret that makes Cloverfield such an exciting and vital experience, it's the simple and smartly pulled-off invention of it. Never before has a monster-movie been so frightening; terror and chaos isn't filmed by professionals all the time, in this day of age it's just as likely captured by a DV-camera or a phone-camera - and this creates a unsettling realism into the whole experience. Just as the main characters, we in the audience know nothing about why this monster attacks us and why nothing can stop it - the only thing to do is to save your life.Receiving mixed reviews because of its visuals by always shaking, rolling, running, tumbling and jumping camera-work many reviewers left Cloverfield nauseas.

Period.,8,15 February 2008,"After first having seen the now famous teaser trailer a couple of months ago, I thought that this movie - then tentatively referred to as ""Untitled J.J. Abrams Project"" - was going to be a fluke. A minor hit fueled by a clever marketing strategy. The teaser got me curious, but I thought the CGI-shot of the statue head landing in the New York streets looked cheap and fake. Unexpectedly, I was proved wrong. A lot of very positive reviews preceded the Austrian theatrical release of ""Cloverfield"" and having finally seen the movie now I have to say that all the praise is more than deserved. And the CGI has thankfully been worked on.What makes ""Cloverfield"" work better than any other behemoth movie is quite simply the concept of having the whole thing being shot by one of the characters. Sure, that idea isn't new at all. ""The Blair Witch Project"" had done it years before ""Cloverfield"". Even George A. Romero has made his latest ""Living Dead"" flick with that technique. Still, the concept works best here. Somehow the contrast between this giant monster wrecking a whole city and this one guy with a small camera creates amazing tension. Showing the main characters' adventurous journey through the lens of a shaky, hand-held camera puts the audience right in the middle of the events. We never get an overview over the whole situation - neither visually nor plot-wise. Rockets, wreckage and monsters fly around our heads left and right and make us feel as if we were in the middle of a war. Don't see this without a Dolby Surround system! The sound design is brilliant. From the roars of the behemoth to the creepy, blood-thirsty gargling of its crab babies it makes your skin crawl. What adds to the realism of the movie is that there's no music, which also makes the jumps completely unpredictable.""Cloverfield"" plays out almost like a Haunted House or a roller-coaster ride. We never know what waits around the corner for us. We only get very brief glimpses of the giant monster and its even more horrific little spider babies and every time we see something it scares the crap out of us. There's one scene that I liked in particular: the characters run through the streets and into an underground station. Shortly before they walk down the stairs the ""cameraman"" looks up and there's the monster letting out a terrifying roar. That moment is ten times more effective than any high gloss production like Roland Emmerich's ""Godzilla"" could ever have hoped to be.Of course, another reason why the perspective of the guys in the streets running through the ruins of New York is so genuinely horrific these days, is because we've seen scenes like that on TV in real life-news. It's the memories of 9/11 that ""Cloverfield"" is toying with. Just like every good horror movie this one is incorporating current imagery of terror and fear.The hand-held camera is not only used for action purposes, though. It also backs up the story brilliantly with occasional flashbacks that appear as the remains of previously filmed material on the video cassette in the camera. That is a very original stylistic touch and one of the great things about ""Cloverfield"": the movie is bursting with fresh ideas. This can also be said about the various settings, most of all a nerve grinding walk through the staircase of a half-collapsed skyscraper and a helicopter ride that you're never going to forget.Even less spectacular scenes like the exposition at the beginning, which has been dismissed by some reviewers as being too long, is brilliant and fast paced to an extend where I thought, that I couldn't care less if a monster was coming any time soon or not. The characters alone, played solidly by a largely unknown cast, were interesting and well-crafted enough.Finally, let's talk about the main attraction, the behemoth and its spawn. The big one itself must be one of the most memorable monsters in movie history, looking like something that jumped out of a Derek Hess-painting. Its spider babies are even creepier, though. Although they don't look that original, you can never go wrong with aggressive arachnids that lurk in the dark (see also ""Starship Troopers"" or ""Gremlins 2""). The CGI is fantastic, and even though it may not age well, in 2008 it looks flawless. There wasn't one special effects-scene in the movie that I didn't buy and that's also due to the fact that the camera is used so thoughtfully.Which brings us to the direction. Director Matt Reeves does a superb job in that the whole ""filmed by an amateur""-feel never seems forced. We're shown exactly what Reeves wants us to see, yet it all feels completely coincidental and natural. I even bought the fact that the guy holding the camera would go on filming throughout the entire trip.""Cloverfield"" sets new standards in its field. It outshines every other behemoth movie that has been released, yet, and raises the bar for the whole subgenre. You can't make them much better than Reeves and Abrams did with ""Cloverfield"", because this doesn't rely on CGI mostly, but on character development and tension. Similar projects will have a hard time topping this movie in the future.",Cloverfield
170,RJBurke1942,How bad is bad? Watch this and find out,4,26 January 2010,"There are two things going for this movie: first, it's shot so darkly (with a hand-held camera), you can't see much the stupid antics of the characters in this so-called story. And, second, it ends after seventy-one excruciatingly boring minutes. And, not a minute too soon...If you're into excessive use of CGI and special effects, then by all means see it.If you're looking for a rip-off from maybe a dozen other movies e.g. The Thing (1982), The Blair Witch Project (1999), Predator (1987), Alien (1979), Godzilla (1998), King Kong (1933, 1976, 2005) etc etc, then, by all means do go and see it.As a metaphor for the tragedy of 9/11, however, it just stinks. Shame on the whole production cast for making this piece of trash.On the other hand, I give it points for those special effects, the CGI (albeit excessive) and the frenetic editing (which is still often annoying). And, I give the (forgettable) actors a point for having the moxie to actually appear in this pile o'sh**t.Not recommended for (real) kids or serious movie-goers.And, look, if you want a much better non-stop action/terror flick, using hand-held camera, see REC(2007) – but, only the Spanish version.",Cloverfield
171,tomimt,It's all about the monster,6,19 June 2010,"It took me some time to finally see Cloverfield despite it was pretty hyped movie when it originally came out. The reason was, I really didn't like the style that was shown in the trailers. And now, after seeing it, I still don't like the style, but the movie has aspects in it, that makes some of it a fun watch. Though, I did find the movie a bit boring, despite it was trying so hard to be frantic and portray a feeling of a great urgency. And that isn't a good thing, as the movie isn't that long either.The scenes I'm talking here are of course the scenes of destruction and pretty much everything the monster of the movie has a bigger part in. The destruction of Manhattan is fantastically done and the monster itself is just glorious, even in the close shots it looks stunningly real. The monster is the real star of the movie and the way it has been executed manages to save a lot in this story. While it's a good thing the movie wasn't centered around some standard gun ho military personnel trying to kill the beast, I didn't warm up to the pretty forced plot line of good bye party turned into a rescue mission of one true love.The actors are surprisingly pretty good, but honestly, this movie works only because there's a huge monster mashing things around.",Cloverfield
172,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,24 February 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, follow my blog :)A surprise going-away party between friends is interrupted when a monster of massive dimensions starts to destroy New York City. They need to leave the city before a heavy weapon is unleashed on it and rescue as many of them as they can.J.J. Abrams is one of the best producers in movie/television history, so a film with him and with the direction of Matt Reeves is definitely worth taking a peek.I don't recall watching a found footage movie ever, so when I first saw Cloverfield I was not that excited. However, I really enjoyed the film the first time and now that The Cloverfield Paradox came out, I wanted to review the previous two installments of the franchise, so here we are again.I read that a lot of people felt nauseated during this movie due to the shaky-cam that is used throughout the entire runtime, but I didn't feel that at all. In fact, even though I have no experience in watching films with this type of filming, I actually think this is a great directing achievement by Matt Reeves. He does an excellent job handling the camera like this, I rarely felt lost in space or didn't realize what was happening. I always know where everyone is compared to the others and sometimes this is difficult to achieve even with a steady-cam.Additionally, it helps to hide the ""ok"" visuals effects which are not that great, even having in mind the year of the movie's release. Quality-wise, Reeves also implements some cool long takes which can battle the obvious issues that arise from a found footage film. The editing has its ups and downs since it is obvious that some scenes are too dark or too shaky to follow seamlessly. Plus, the movie repeats itself by having a lot of running with the camera looking down to the ground or way up to the sky/buildings.Some jump scares can't escape the cliche build-up which does not exactly help to improve the horror genre present in the film. The first act might drag a little too much in order to introduce the characters and their backstories. Besides, the setups for each character are really brief and this might not give you enough time to care about them. Nevertheless, I think I am one of the few people out there to actually love this movie!Yes, it has flaws. Yes, the characters are not amazingly compelling or extremely well-developed. But, by God, this film is awesome! The story is incredibly intriguing and the fact that it only runs for 84 minutes, just makes it even better. This is not a movie about a character's journey or an emotional drama with a meaningful message to deliver. It is a pure science fiction monster flick with a really cool action-heavy story and a freaking badass monster.It is a bit hard to distinguish good performances from the bad ones through a shaky-cam. That said, I think everyone is more than fine and Michael Stahl-David (Rob) excellently leads this film. Lizzy Caplan (Marlena) and T.J. Miller (Hud) also deliver some good displays. The characters they portray might not be unique or fully-developed, but they are introduced to us on a very personal level. Even though it is a very short first act, it does more than enough for me to at least care about their mission to rescue their friends.From the moment the ""event"" occurs, I did not stop having fun, not for one minute. The build-up to the first appearance of the Cloverfield monster is brilliantly executed, every scene with a small flash of a part of its body is bone-chilling and this mystery vibe never fades away. There is never a dull moment and everything feels uncommonly realistic (the sense of urgency and danger is always present), the cinematography is pretty decent.Every act is better than its last, as the palpable action and the extreme suspense levels go higher and higher towards its fantastic ending (one that gives rise to well-deserved sequels). A lot of theories regarding the monster's origin have been developed and that is due to the last scene of the movie. After my rating, I will explain what happens since it might be a spoiler for the next films.All in all, Cloverfield is freaking amazing. I might be one of the few people truly loving it, but the issues with the shaky-cam or with the characters didn't affect me as much as it did with others. Excellent direction from Matt Reeves, very entertaining screenplay from Drew Goddard and fantastic production of J.J. Abrams, who clearly has a heavy hand on this. The cast works fine for the plot which is the reason why this movie is a success. A science fiction monster film at its best, with suspenseful action and a tremendous sense of urgency. It has a more than satisfactory control of the shaky-cam and a mysterious ending that deserves some exceptional sequels.Rating: A-****************** SPOILER WARNING ******************
In the very last scene, we see Rob and Beth (Odette Annable) near the beach. We can see the sand and the whole ocean with a beautiful wide shot. Knowing J.J. Abrams, this couldn't be just a random ending to a sci-fi movie. It is extremely easy to miss, but if you pay close attention to the upper right corner of the screen, you will see something falling from the sky into the water.Some say it was the monster arriving at the planet. Some think it was something like a satellite or a meteor and that it had awakened the monster living at the bottom of the ocean (during the film, Hud actually says something regarding the monster's origin being the deep ocean and that he had crawled up through an opening ... Once again, knowing J.J. Abrams, this is a hint not just random funny dialogue).Which one do I think it is true? Well, I am strongly in favor of the satellite theory, but I will explain myself better in my next review of 10 Cloverfield Lane.",Cloverfield
173,DonFishies,A uniquely enigmatic and satisfying monster movie,7,18 January 2008,"So here it is, after months of speculation and hype, Cloverfield has finally arrived in theatres. And the wait just may have been well worth the price of admission.A plot synopsis this late in the game may sound a bit like overkill, but suffice to say, a gigantic creature appears in New York City, and lays waste to it. Meanwhile, a group of friends, who happen to have a videocamera, record their point-of-view of the attack as they try to make it out of the city alive.What is surprising about Cloverfield is how it lacks any real depth or three-dimensional motivations for any of the characters (including the monster), but it draws you in anyway. It works in a way of saying very little, but packing a lot of strength into the things it does say. You feel an enigmatic sting right after the movie gets going, and it never manages to subside. It leaves a lot to the imagination, but at the same time, it works in so much that you fail to notice the many discrepancies and minimal plot details that would otherwise destroy a film.The storyline itself is heavily convoluted, and at times, melodramatic at best. I realize that the subplot of the party is integral to getting the group together (and the explanation for the camera), and I realize that some of these characters needed to be more than just a walking cliché waiting to get killed, but it really seems like a bit of work could have been done for them. The pathos for their situation is there (and their varying heartbreaks, including one powerfully done scene on a train platform), but the film never seems to take a crack at really making us feel for them. A lot of the dialogue exchanges between the characters are what drag the film down in its already blazingly fast running time, and could have easily been fixed up. They have their poetic moments, but they could all have had some work done (not to say that the adrenaline saturated performances here are not terrifically done as it is).Instead of focusing on the characters so much, the film's key strength is what is going on in the background. The satire and political allegories are just stunning in more than a handful of occasions. All at once the film draws on xenophobic ideals drilled into us by 9/11, old monster movies of yore (especially Godzilla) and the war on terror. The film even has a sequence that borders on being a recreation of 9/11, bringing the true realism and fear of the characters home to the audience. Seeing some of these scenes are downright terrifying, and mainly because we have seen scenes just like them in real life. Hell, the film even toys with the actions of the current generation. Instead of running for their lives, a group of people take pictures of the fallen head of the Statue of Liberty with their camera phones, presumably to later post on Facebook or MySpace. It prods around with these ideals, and in the process, creates a film that is undoubtedly immediate, and belongs to the kids of 2008. It may feel a little too close in touch with its excellent Korean brethren The Host, but its uniqueness lends itself to being more than a copy.And while some may write off the use of the handi-cam as a gimmick, it is what makes the film so enthralling and so strong. I had my doubts about the movie being entirely shot in this format, but as I watched it, I could not imagine it being nearly as powerful, or nearly as watchable if it were made with a standard film camera. Instead, the camera treats us into a sort of all-access pass, allowing the audience to feel as if they are a character themselves. And once the actual characters get running, the audience may feel like they are in for an endurance test as well. The edge of your seat mentality the film lends itself is more than enough to suggest that the film will get your blood pumping. It is not blazingly original, but for a suspense filled, mass-marketed, Hollywood film, it is definitely somewhat of a unique experience. Yes, the dizziness of some of the camera work is a bit jarring, and more often than not you may not be able to tell what is going on (and you will unlikely realize all the little things going on in the backgrounds of shot until it is too late), but these minor inconveniences only make for a more immediate and gratifying trip. The audience involvement tactic may not be for everyone, but is something that those who are willing to try, should. What impressed me the most however was how great the monster itself looks. It never stays in one spot for long, but the fear and terror that grips the characters as they catch glimpses of it is just enough. For such a small budgeted film, I was expecting something a little less realistic. Instead, it looks authentic and scary enough to be more than just someone's nightmare. Describing it will ruin the fun (and watching it tear up New York is the real treat), but the short glimpses do not last all that long thankfully. I was a little less enthused about the smaller parasitic looking beings that show up halfway into the film (and in one shot, you can tell it is clearly CGI), but they still look very well done anyway.Cloverfield is a flawed creation, but it is also very strong. Its enigmatic presence and genuine satire is something that monster movies tend to lack, but is quite hard hitting here. A little less melodrama could have made this terrifyingly and satisfyingly quick ride a whole lot less bumpy.8.5/10.",Cloverfield
174,timdalton007,Don't Let Your Curiosity Get The Best Of You,1,18 January 2008,"There's an old saying about how curiosity killed the cat. My curiosity was raised by the trailer for this film I saw when I saw Transformers and the lack of anything really being said about it. So my curiosity led me to seeing the movie. And the old saying is true...seeing this almost killed me. Don't get me wrong it's got some good stuff about it. First off the concept of doing the film from the point of view of people running around with camcorders is an original idea. It helped to ground the film in some kind of reality, something that was desperately needed in this genre. Unfortunately, nothing else does but more on that later. Then there is the special effects which were terrific, particularly with the creature and its minions (for lack of a better word). Then there's the music over the end credits by Michael Giacchino. And that's about it.Noiw on the bad stuff...or should I say the rest of the movie? There is not one good performance from anyone in this film at all! Everyone is self-absorbed so much that you can't have sympathy for them. Not to mention that everyone in the film seems to be able to handle cameras without too much difficulty considering that they were under attack from a giant ""soemthing""! I mean even the military comes across that away and it takes a stretch of logic to understand why anyone in their right mind would let an unarmed group of civilians run around Manhatten without at least some military back-up! There's no logic to it at all.And then there's the script. The dialogue is either terrible or bad. It is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. And then there's the lack of explanation. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of 2001: A Space Odseey and Donnie Darko, two films that didn't leave too many clues as to what was going on. But those were cases where explanation wasn't necessary because they were films that didn't need it because they left you with enough to work from to come to some sort of explanation. Coverfield doesn't and its hurt big time from it. These films need (to paraphrase its writer) scientist in the white lab coat who shows up and explains things like that. As I wrote above, the idea gives a sense of reality to the movie but between the bad acting from the horrible script that gives no explanation as to what is going on. They say every film is redeemable in at least some of its aspects. Those would be concept, the special effects and the end credits music for the record. Otherwise, Cloverfield is a disaster. In plain and simple terms that's what it is: a disaster. As I wrote, it is just like every other disaster/monster movie ever made, except with a camcorder telling the story of a group of self-absorbed people caught in the middle. Avoid the film, save your money, and don't let your curiosity get the best of you.",Cloverfield
175,gigan-92,Good and Bad Points,6,25 May 2009,"This film may have been one of the most over hyped and especially over rated films of all time. The way it's shot was a clever idea and creates a sense of realism one could say. It certainly feels real watching it in a crowded theater. There are some scary moments and good terror scenes with our ominous monster and enjoyable characters even. However, I'm a monster movie fan, Godzilla being my #1, and this film was a little too short in my opinion. We never really get a back story of the monster or what becomes of it. Was it finally defeated or did it rampage through Miami next? Plus we never get to see the monster for longer than a few seconds without the camera shaking out of control. Very annoying. And did the couple survive or die like everybody else? Too many questions left unanswered for my taste but some will find it enjoyable.",Cloverfield
176,sashank_kini-1,Its still alive!,9,9 June 2008,"The movie is still alive in my memory as its surely one of the most, enthralling, fast-paced, action-packed, deadly and sadistic film. I call it sadistic because the director lets no one live. I loved the film thoroughly, though the staring was a bit dull and gloomy. But then, all of it happened so suddenly that I was left glued to my couch. How I wish I could have seen it in the theater! Still, even on the television, its really intense.Firstly, I thought that it is a B-movie. There are fresh face actors, who don't look so experienced. A monster attack causes a catastrophe in the city. The plot might sound B-grade but the execution is absolutely great.The shaky camera made me a bit woozy for a while but then, I found it okay. Just one question: Who records something when his life is in grave peril? If an attack really happened, the first thing I'd do is to drop the video camera. But here, the shaky camera made it even more intense.The actors do a fine job. They are scared when they are supposed to be, the shock and the fear can be clearly seen on their faces. Therefore, I was glad not to find any big names as this cast was perfect. I just was a bit irked by the main character, Rob. He was a bit arrogant with everyone many of the times. I preferred Hud's acting the most and was feeling bad when he perished. He had a bit of humor in him when the whole world was in a drastic situation. I especially liked when he started talking anything out of the hat, without realizing that it wasn't the time to talk rubbish. They didn't tell anything about Lily too. I liked her acting too.There were a lot many things that I didn't notice as first, like how the monster landed on earth. Then I realized why they were showing the clips of the main characters to the island. I also was surprised by the abrupt end. It was a good end but not satisfying. I so wished that the monster was killed. The action scenes were brutal, especially the way people were killed. I loved the gory deaths, especially of Marlena's . It was wicked and disturbing, yet excellent. The director showed no mercy for any of the characters.If you like some action packed movie that is brutal, wicked, unforgiving, sadistic, merciless and ruthless, then Cloverfield is just for you. Enjoy! 9 out of 10.",Cloverfield
177,moviesleuth2,Near brilliant,8,18 January 2008,"Man, what a rush! ""Cloverfield"" is, in short, a wild ride.I'm not going to go into the story at all because there isn't much more to the story than everyone knows. It's not that kind of a movie.What it is, however, is near brilliant. Not everything works (almost everything does though), but all in all, it's well worth the admission price.The decision to make it using a hand held camera was genius. It really puts you into the middle of the chaos, and makes the need for richly-developed characters not needed. Plus it intensifies everything by about 100 times. Some will complain that this makes the film have a dizzying effect, but except in a few spots, that's not really an issue.The best part of the movie is the dialogue and the acting. For the most part, particularly in the beginning, the film feels almost unscripted. The people say things and talk almost exactly like real people do, and the actors supplement that quality by acting like real people, and not like movie characters. Again, this heightens the movie's immediacy and realism, and avoids making this movie having an intelligence level of zero.In any review of this movie, there is going to be some mention of 9/11. This is as unavoidable as it is necessary to discuss. In a few spots, it brings back unsettling memories of that tragedy. I can't fault the filmmakers for this because since the event was so traumatic, it was probably unavoidable. Or maybe it was intentional. If so, it works.This is a summer action movie without a doubt. Why the producers decided to release this in January is quite obvious. This time of year is a bridge between Oscar-movies and movies that would cost less to flop than to shelve. Since this is a radically new approach (one that has never been tried with a big-budget action movie-at least for the whole film), the producers probably didn't want their whole summer resting on the shoulders of something they weren't confident would work. Releasing ""Cloverfield"" at this time would cover two bases: if it was a huge, unexpected success, it could be up for some Oscars (as it looks now, that is highly unlikely except for the awards that typically go to action movies, since the Golden Globes are typically good indicators of the Oscar nominees). However, if the movie flopped, it would disappear along with the rest of the post-Oscar trash without so much as a blip on the radar screen.I really hope this movie does well. Given how stingy mainstream movie producers are with new ideas, they probably won't try this approach unless it makes big (and I mean BIG) bucks. That would be a shame, because when used appropriately, the use of a hand-held camera can be very effective. However, it is a little early for the post-Oscar garbage (that usually comes in February), so there is a definite threat that it might get lost in the Oscar racing movies. Should this happen, mainstream movie producers would probably assume that this movie was rotten as a whole, thus ending the careers of the approach as well as the actors (which would be horrible, since all are great, especially Michael Stahl-David, who is excellent). Only time will tell what the future holds for this kind of movie.",Cloverfield
178,ThurstonHunger,Recommend post midnight watching,6,23 November 2014,"So I managed to wait till 1am on a Sunday morning/Sat night to see this film and I think that helped and worked better than say Tu @ 10 am or other times.If you want a roller-coaster movie and you've read enough of the Blair Witch/Godzilla analogies to be interested, I'd say stop and just check out the movie at a time that works for you.Spoilers may follow:To me, while the idea of this being a visceral response to 911 is understandable, I took it in a broader sense of a response to death. Like death, the monster is mostly kept out of our view; arguably a better film and a better life comes from incorporating the monster more forthrightly, but this film is not the place to have that argument.There's not time, there's a friggin' monster on the loose. Any sense of security is false, and death has many manifestations, not just the overwhelming black shadows cast from above....there are smaller crazier minions and even some form of micro-organism infiltration that can really get under your skin.Death is inevitable, so the response from this film is a quest for love. And that seems fair enough for me. Death still sucks.Plenty of ""Harrison Ford School of Acting"" (people physically damaged, never mind their mental interiors). The Gen Y dialog and Hud as an affable, goofy, overly talkative big teddy bear of an Ishmael might be a deal-breaker for some, but I found him as endearing as he was essential in this film.I could see other interpretations coming out of this movie in film theory classes (the monster as celebrity, and Hud as the paparazzi?) could be fun to read over.Really more of a 6.5 for me....tricky to balance how much to (over)think about this.",Cloverfield

180,WriterDave,Pretty Close to Something Terrible...,6,21 January 2008,"At one point during the mayhem of ""Cloverfield"" our jerky-jokey cameraman Hud (an annoying T. J. Miller) remarks that the monster ravaging New York City is ""something terrible."" Well, ""Cloverfield"" is pretty close to something terrible, but it's also laugh-out-loud funny and loads of fun.Taking cues from ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Godzilla"", and our current YouTube/MySpace crazed youth oriented culture that believes everyone's point of view deserves to be recorded, producer J. J. Abrams' opportunistic ""Cloverfield"" operates at a mercifully quick clip to maximize entertainment value with a minimum of effort (and budget) while showing us allegedly top-secret video footage recovered after a massive monster attack on NYC.Though barely ninety minutes long, we still have to suffer through an excruciatingly banal opening twenty minutes of vapid, spoiled twenty-somethings partying the night away before the monster strikes. There was a moment somewhere during this that I actually zoned out completely and found myself staring at the dark theater wall. The cast of unknowns thankfully contains a few people who might be able to act if given the chance in a normal film. Standouts include the painfully lovely Jessica Lucas as the feisty Lily and Zooey Deschanel look-a-like Lizzy Caplan as the sarcastic Marlena. These two young actresses acquitted themselves nicely while a group of anonymous and interchangeable actors playing stupid characters making bad decision after bad decision whirled around them. It made for one of those odd movie-going experiences where you actually start routing for certain characters to die in horrible ways while you hope the pretty girls make it out alive because, well, they're cute.As a gimmick film, ""Cloverfield"" is as shallow as they come. It's also too silly and too much fun to end up mad about it. At least the idiot hand-held cameraman/character wants to see the monster and the destruction as much as we do. This leads to some great money-shots of the creature and its tour of terror through midtown Manhattan. It would've been more thrilling had I not seen very similarly designed creature effects in last fall's ""The Mist"". Like that film, ""Cloverfield"" certainly has its moments of giddy monster oriented fun, but it ultimately implodes and leaves behind a wreck of a movie that is pretty close to something terrible.",Cloverfield
181,dr_foreman,"A decent time at the movies, but no classic.",6,22 January 2008,"I like monster movies a lot, including both ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Godzilla"" (the Japanese one, not the Matthew Broderick one). So I guess it was inevitable that I'd see ""Cloverfield,"" which is frequently described as the love child of those two films.Unfortunately, I didn't find ""Cloverfield"" to be as good as its source material. This movie, unlike the Blair Witch or Godzilla films, focuses an awful lot on character development. That might work, except the characters in ""Cloverfield"" are mainly annoying yuppies involved in really shallow, neurotic romances. I felt sympathy for them during certain scenes, yes, but that was only because they were suffering - not because I especially liked them as people.The other disadvantage ""Cloverfield"" has in comparison with its predecessors is that it features a sort of lame monster. I mean, sure, Godzilla looks fake and all, but at least I can identify him as a dragon-dinosaur hybrid, which is cool. Without giving too much away, the beast in ""Cloverfield"" just looks...bizarre. Icky. Messed up. I didn't think that it had a particularly iconic or memorable design, in short. I doubt that anybody will remember what it looked like 10 years from now.I guess I'm being a little harsh, though, because ""Cloverfield"" has some good suspense moments and memorable apocalyptic imagery. And the characters aren't a total loss - at least they're loyal to each other, and occasionally one of them gets a good line.It's just not a great movie, that's all. I'm a little tired, I guess, of horror films that focus on 20-something ""beautiful people,"" and I long for the days when monster movies featured wise middle-aged professor characters and plucky journalists instead of rejects from ""Dawson's Creek."" Still, if you're interested in enjoying a few scares and experiencing mild nausea in the process, ""Cloverfield"" will deliver for you.",Cloverfield
182,vampyrecowboy,Irritatiing to the extreme,1,26 December 2008,"20 minutes into the movie - we get something happening, until then it's just shitty camera work, uninteresting plot buildup, no character development - not even bad character development.Really...who has a party that big for somebody who is going away? How many pretty people were there? 200 for a going away party? Yeah...right...and they all were young, pretty people.No scars, no zits, not even bad teeth.Shitty movie...The monster had more personality.The movie insults anybody who lived through the 911 attacks on New York city.It's just bad judgment to use NYC for this movie...Chicago would have been better.The camera work is just horrible and the dialogue is sooooo bad. Just hundreds of people screaming into a camera.Not a good movie...go watch Sesame Street if you want to see monsters in downtown New York City.30 minutes into the movie and I'm still not interested.I hope there's no sequel to this piece of crap. It doesn't deserve one.I've watched 10 movies in the last two days and this had to be the worst.I look forward to bad television commercials or to getting my haircut.It's just pretty damn boring and irritating.30 minutes into it, I turned off the movie and didn't feel bad about doing so.",Cloverfield
183,Antagonisten,Original,7,4 May 2008,"Cloverfield made me curious when it came out. The whole thing with the film-makers not wanting to give anything away before the release has been done before. And the other similarities to ""Godzilla"" were also worrying... But i chose to ignore them and feel curious nevertheless. Cloverfield looked it had something pretty unique to offer. But you never know until you actually watch it.And was it unique? Both yes and no i guess. The whole ""monster attacks New York""-thing is old as King Kong. But Cloverfield did have a few things to offer that sets it apart from most other movies. First of all the whole home-movie style works pretty well. We only get to see what the people in the movie see, nothing else. It creates both a sense of urgency and actually being there. That was a good move. I might also mention that the camera work is still not that bad considering it's supposed to be handy-cam. The picture is clear, the effects are really good and there is very little of nausea i can feel sometimes when the camera is waved around a lot.There are however a few things that i didn't like as much. While Cloverfield highlights the way the feel of a movie can really benefit from an unusual approach (handycams), it also shows one of the classic weaknesses of horror movies. Namely the monster itself. I'm afraid it works just as bad as it did in Godzilla. In the end the movie is also a more or less standardized action movie with a more interesting presentation.I did like Cloverfield fairly well. I think there are things that could have been done better. Not least the monster (how hard can it be?) and also it could have been more experimental with the story, like it was with the presentation of the story. But in the end this movie is pretty original and i did enjoy it. I think it's good to see something that at least tries to break the mold a little bit. I rate it 7/10.",Cloverfield
184,raypdaley182,I really wanted to like this film,1,27 April 2008,"Seeing how many trailers ran for this before it's release I was already worried this film was going to be truly awful. Anything getting hyped that much normally is awful. The film is all shot on hand-held cameras which is an incredibly bad idea. If Blair Witch taught us anything, it was hand-held cameras in a movie look abysmal! And this movie is no different.It's incredibly slow to get started, with no action until your 20 minutes into the film & that's where they jump the shark. If your in a building & just experienced an earthquake then on a roof to see an explosion & running downstairs from falling fireballs the VERY last thing your going to do is carry on filming at eye-level from a hand-held camera. Your either going to drop it or lower it down to waist height to allow yourself to run faster.And thats the kind of basic rookie mistake that ruins films. The bad hand-held camera work was already doing that anyway but a stupid goof like that killed the film before it ever got started. The people photographing the head of The Statue Of Liberty are just WAY too calm. There would be absolute hysteria, people would be going mental! As far all the destroyed buildings & falling rubble? In a post 9/11 climate is a movie with these images really a good idea or just incredibly stupid. The latter I feel.Rob getting a call from Beth on his cell phone? Highly unlikely after that kind of city devastation, lines would be restricted to emergency calls only. The scene on The Brooklyn Bridge is not believable at all. No-one seems frightened. Even when the bridge collapses the camera guy turns around to film whats happening. No-one would do that, you'd be too busy running away or getting trampled in the panic.When we finally do see bits of the monster it's an incredibly cheap looking effect. Even 1970's Dr Who would have been embarrassed about that thing. It looked like it cost all of $10, if that. A very cheap rubbery monster. A cheap Godzilla rip-off.Rob's motivation for rescuing Beth is zero. They had a huge argument at the party and he was upset when she left. His mood towards her suddenly changing is incredibly suspect & a very POOR plot device. The soldiers they encountered, not 1 said get down (before they started firing), not 1 said turn back. It just wouldn't happen. The plausibility of the movie just gets less & less by the scene.You also have to question Hud not knocking Rob out by the time their in the subway. Even truly good friends would have punched his lights out by then. As for ""walking the tunnels""? If there's a light on the camera, why isn't Hud walking at the front so everyone behind him can see? As far as them being attacked by those creatures? The movie should have ended right there because they were outnumbered & should have all been killed.The way they just suddenly meet the soldiers is far too simple. Marlena dies (even though you never see anything, she's bleeding from her eyes then is taken behind a curtain where you see an explosion of blood so its safe to assume she's VERY dead).With Rob saying to the soldier ""If you want to stop me you'll have to shoot me"", the soldier should have pulled out his gun and done us ALL a favour. Even after seeing Beth's building half knocked down Rob STILL thinks she's alive? I'm sorry but 1 of the 2 remaining friends would have actually knocked him out cold at that point.After pulling Beth off the spike, why wasn't she bleeding like crazy? Also the awful & incredibly predictable scare when the monster hits the helicopter? And they survive the crash? I think at this point in the movie they had run out of ideas & were just doing anything to kill time.Hud gets an excellent death (bitten in half by the monster) & then you get Rob & Beth talking to the camera, an explosion, rubble falling, Coney Island then nothing. No ending, no resolution? And to those who think they saw a splash in the sea at the end? It's a ship sailing from left to right, certainly nothing splashing into the sea like so many claims I've read. What an awful film. From start to lack of finish, utter garbage! Not recommended to anyone, ever.",Cloverfield
185,haildevilman,A wild ride.,10,5 June 2008,"This is not for those with motion sickness tendencies.I lived in Japan for 14 years and they did monster movies over there better than anyone. Despite the cheesy effects, the thrills were NON STOP. This is America's best monster flick since the original King Kong.It took a while to figure out why kind of creature it was. It looked like a cat with a hellish face at first. The spider like parasites were a nice touch as well.Plot-wise, it didn't really break new ground. But sandwiching the the story about the new job in Japan (a wink to the inspiration perhaps?) and the potential romances added flair. And the Coney Island scenes on the tape was a nice touch too.Did anyone see the object fall into the ocean earlier? While the creature was never explained, this gave us a slight hint. It also ended the way more films should, with a sudden open stop.Best scare was the creatures face suddenly charging out of the smoke caused by the bombing run and grabbing the chopper. We all thought it had been nixed. But nope.The return of the monster movie.",Cloverfield
186,LazySod,Annoying waste of celluloid,4,30 January 2008,"The trailers to this film show a party in Manhattan, and people there being startled by a heavy explosion and the head of the statue of liberty flying around. They then go out on the street to investigate and end up fleeing what looks like a terrible disaster/act of terror. No further information is given about what actually happened and with that the trailer is good. Curiosity is at a high level, people go see the film. I am one of those people that went to see it.I am one of the people that regrets having seen this film because it is one more example of how current day film makers know nothing better anymore then to copy other films and copy them poorly. Again, every single cliché is pulled out of the high hat and glued together with random things flying around, sometimes literally.Added to that is the fact the film is too short (just 90 minutes) and even in those 90 minutes manages to spend about 25 on a slow introduction on the main characters. Although introduction is a necessity to have people bond with the characters in some way I feel that nearly a third of the film is too much of an introduction, leaving too little for the ""real"" film.The one plus it has is nothing more but a gimmick, but that gimmick is not enough to make it work.4 out of 10 running victims",Cloverfield
187,suspiria10,S10 Review's 'Cloverfield' (2007),8,18 January 2008,"Its 1-18-08. The virally advertised monster simply known as 'Clover' has finally been loosed upon the cinema screens. Good old fashioned monster stomping has joined the 21st century.Suckered into taping testimonials, Hud (T.J. Miller) blinders his way around a party interviewing attendees of Rob's (Michael Stahl-David) farewell party before he leaves for his new Vice-President Job in Japan tomorrow. Just as the personal drama reaches its crescendo the fun begins. A loud boom shakes the Manhattan apartment like an earthquake. As people make their way to the streets and roofs they are witness to a building exploding barely in the distance. Debris rains down from the heavens and with more explosions and panic the shocked crowds see Lady Liberty's head skittering down the avenue. Through the smoke and haze, shaky hand-held camera and news reports we learn that out of the Atlantic has come a monster and those unlucky enough to to be caught on the island maybe in for a war the likes no ones has seen. First up if the shaky camera-work of 'The Blair Witch Project' made you want to hurl than this one won't be for you. Once the monster action begins it gets really shaky and hectic at times. The characters of the film in the end are irrelevant I mean after all what we want is destruction right? But they do manage to create some decent characters in the first 25 minuted before the maelstrom. They even manage to generate sympathy for their plight, a key ingredient for a disaster flick. Script-wise you can't really say much. Due to its nature most of the dialogue was probably improvised and much the same can probably said for the direction. Told with a hand-held camera 'Cloverfield' adds the 'Blair Witch' element to a typical 'Godzilla' style romp. It works too. The final hour has plenty tension and suspense and quite a few excellent setpieces. The sound design is phenomenal. All the gunplay and bass grop you smack dab into the action. The creature {which I won't spoil for you) is nicely done and you wisely see only bits and pieces of it until the end. Let's just say that it doesn't stray too far from your typical city stomping monsters, ias a matter of fact fans of classic monster flicks like the Harryhausen films and 'Godzilla' will notice all sorts of familiar parts. The CGI worked well too.In the end I had a grand old time. Monster movie fans should have a blast provided the camera work isn't a problem. It is definitely played for terror and an interesting discussion may be had in the post 9/11 world. You can debate it to dust but 10 years ago an Americanized 'Godzilla' put the smackdown on New York City and hardly was not half as effective. 4/5",Cloverfield
188,ronakkotian,The craft is exceptional but the characters are lacking,7,6 July 2021,"I love found footage films as well as monsters so I wanted to see Cloverfield for some time now. Having seen it now, I can say I enjoyed it.Cloverfield follows a group of friends that try to rescue another friend in New York whilst it's being attacked by monsters.Found footage is a genre of horror that I love. Sadly there are many films that do not execute it well except for The Blair Witch Project, which is my favourite, but Cloverfield is certainly one of the better found footage films I've seen. The film does take its time setting up the characters but when the attack finally happens, the film becomes very exciting. The CGI work in this film is really well done as we see known landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and tall skyscrapers be absolutely annihilated without looking fake at all. Choosing to shoot this film in a handheld style was a great choice in my opinion as I felt like I was a part of the action. The shakyness added to the frantic tone and kept the intensity of the situation going. A lot of found footage films are shot with very high quality cameras but Cloverfield uses one that doesn't display a high quality image and that made the entire premise more believable to me.The acting was fine by everyone involved. I thought T. J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Michael Stahl-David and Jessica Lucas did a decent job. The main problem with Cloverfield is the characters. The film sets them up in the beginning to develop them but I wasn't able to connect with any of them. I really didn't care about them and that's why some of the more emotional moments of the film didn't work for me.Cloverfield is a well made found footage film. In terms of its craft, Matt Reeves and the entire crew did an exceptional job creating the attack and making it look real but the film was missing that connection we're meant to have with the characters onscreen.",Cloverfield
189,dragokin,what was all the fuss about?,2,18 April 2014,"Shortly before it's release, it had been hard to miss the online banners, adds and trailers for Cloverfield. And when the day finally came to see it, i felt cheated. In a way, this has been the same feeling of disappointment when watching The Blair Witch Project. The only difference has been that with the latter movie people recommended it.In any case, the premise sounded good and execution looked promising for a couple of minutes. Afterwards we slip into the regular Hollywood action/thriller movie with predictable plot and mediocre acting. I'm not sure whether i should use the word Hollywood, but this is a word associated with movies in which the return of investment counts, not the artistic merit.I've read somewhere that a group of executives or a group of overpaid ladies and gentlemen responsible for the big bucks thought for a long time about the finishing sequences of the movie. Well, a group of gamers would have chosen better plot twists for the price of pizza and a couple of rounds of soft drinks and beer...",Cloverfield
190,shark-43,"It's a GIANT MONSTER ATTACKS movie - that's it, people",7,24 January 2008,"I think people are getting waaay too worked up over this (put down the Taurine and step away from the computer) - let's strip everything else away and focus on what CLOVERFIELD truly is - it's a giant monster attacks a city movie - that's it - from Godzilla to Reptillicus to Beast from 20,000 Fathoms - it has been done forever and the fact that these filmmakers tried to create a new way to do it while still remaining faithful to the genre itself - well - they should be commended. Many things in the movie work - first off, I really appreciated the FACT that they did NOT explain the monster - who cares - you want a military scientist rushed in and blab on about toxins in the water or pollution or microwaves or Lindsay Lohan being responsible for it - all the old movies have that and you don't need it - whatever caused it - it's there and it's ticked off and ready to destroy. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)I loved how we saw glimpses of it - in my humble opinion - you did not need the big shots of it over Hud at the end - it was on camera too long and that's when the whole CGI of it looked lame to me. I tried to go with the whole premise of Hud filming as much as he did (otherwise you don't have a movie) but that was too much to swallow at times - like, hey dude - there are tiny scorpion/spider thingys trying to kill us - could you put down the *^&%$% camera and help me shut the door on them, please thank you very much? The way they taped over the previous Coney Island day was clever and I thought that was effective. There are some great scenes - the bridge being attacked - the initial ""earthquake"" - the news cameras showing glimpses of the creature moving through the avenues - the subway tunnels scene and the helicopter crash - in fact, if the movie had ended when the copter crashed - that would have been fine with me - I did like how it seemed all the main characters died. Good ending. As for this talk that something is possibly seen falling in the ocean at the end of the Coney Island tape - I thought I saw something too and I liked that touch very much. See, that is one thing I did enjoy - they didn't overexplain, they let you figure stuff or analyze stuff yourself. Use the old brainbox, what. Don't need to be spoonfed everything.",Cloverfield

192,loganx-2,The Beast Returns,8,29 February 2008,"One of the most enjoyable movie going experiences I've had in a long while. There is an inordinate amount of references from critics to this films 9/11 visual allusions, which I think are more projected than anything. There is an essay called ""The Imagination Of Disaster"" by Susan Sontag, which can really be applied to this film in a lot of ways. One thing Sontag notes is the depiction of the scientific/military/industrial complex in monster/disaster films; the heroic scientist, The UN security councils, the hard ass general, the plucky journalist, the madman's daughter, etc, all of which distract us from the people being killed in the exploding buildings. Cloverfield, doesn't give us a tour through aesthetic destruction, nor does it re-enforce the political models of the salvation through military force, it confines itself in the most literal sense to showing people caught in a terrifying and surreal experience. The last Godzilla film with Mathew Broderick showed New York being destroyed, but this didn't point to 9/11, so much as it points to our obsession with New York as the center symbol of modern American life and achievement, it's buildings are the great symbols of modern urban life, something terrorists and science fiction writers understand as they knock them down. The first thing that happens in this film action wise is the statue of liberty having it's head knocked off, does this mean liberty is dead, the country is without a liberated mind, or is it just a reference to the poster for ""Escape From New York(""another NY disaster flick), or is it all of the above? These aren't really appropriate questions for Cloverfield, which is a film without answers, but a clever one that subverts a lot of the cliché's of the monster movie genre, without any pretensions(save its advertising campaign). What I liked about this movie so much was that it was just the camera, a few people, and some monsters, and it was gripping stuff. A fifty foot monster is much scarier if it's too big to capture on camera, only seen at a glance surrounded by screams and debris, something I cant think another film doing. The shabbiness of the camera at first made me a little dizzy, but it improves as the film goes on. I actually think this kind of film making has a much bigger future than people think, another film this year ""The Diving Bell and The Butterfly"" used a very similar technique of withholding camera perspective to very different and very successful effect. All and all, I thought it was really good, scary even at times, and much better than any modern monster movie I can think of, maybe not ""The Host"", but then again...Anyway If there is any art to making monster movies, Cloverfield is it's new watermark, and is going to be the one to beat in the future. It ends and begins on Conney Island a day spent reliving old thrills from the past in ends there as well, as we relive our great Godzilla fantasies and fears.",Cloverfield

194,J_Batek_II,"Decent Sci-Fi/Disaster Film w Great Casting. A Little Slow, But Worth Watching.",6,30 December 2019,"For this review, I watched 'Cloverfield' (2008) for the third time. Previously, I was under the impression that this was a J.J. Abrams film, because the marketing told me it was. This film may have used a little of J.J.'s money and his name, but it's not a J.J. Abrams film.As for the content, the film is a little slow. The idea seemed to be that the viewer would come for the disasters, and would learn to care about the characters. Ok, then give us a disaster inside of 45 minutes. At times, it's easy to forget that this was supposed to be a disaster film, because there is no disaster and the filming of the party gets boring.Lizzy Caplan is great in every role she plays, and she carries this film.Another interesting aspect in 2019 is use of the technology in the film. ""Taping Over"" something is a concept that some viewers in 2019 (and most viewers in the future) will not understand. Since ""taping over the past"" is central to the storyline, 'Cloverfield' (2008) will eventually become a cultural nostalgia piece. The effects are dated and cheesy, the technology is dated already, and this will become a film that people watch to see the past - not to enjoy a SciFi/Disaster film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

195,ethanbresnett,Such a waste of a cool idea,5,28 March 2020,"This film could have been so much better. I'm very disappointed truth be told.First and foremost I cannot stress enough how boring and uninteresting the first 20 minutes of the film were (considering this film is not long over an hour that's really not ideal). I didn't watch Cloverfield for relationship drama I came for the giant monster. If you are going to spend 25% of your movie before the monster even arrives at least make the human interactions interesting.This leads to a second key criticism which is the whole plot of the movie. The initial set up established this potential relationship between Rob and Beth, therefore he was determined to go and find her. I just found this to be so frustrating and ridiculous. It beggars belief why directors and screenwriters are under the impression that audiences revel in characters making stupid and frustrating decisions. Bad writing and plot points aren't the only way to put characters in tense and dangerous situations. The film would have played out much better if they were simply trying to escape rather than rescue somebody. Especially Marlena - why didn't she just bounce - she said at the start she barely knew Rob and didn't remember Hud, so why not just get the hell out of dodge.Some of this could have been excusable if the characters or dialogue were decent - but both were awful. Rob was an annoying character, Hud was wisecracking as if New York wasn't falling apart. There were so many lines where I couldn't help but facepalm.In terms of the found footage style I'm not a fan myself, and it just didn't work in this context. There is just absolutely no reason why somebody would continue to hold a camera throughout this.What I will praise Cloverfield on is the underlying concept. I loved how they didn't try to explain the origin of the creature - it just appeared and started wreaking havoc. Too many films get bogged down in attempting to inject some 'science' into these types of films. Cloverfield fortunately didn't fall into that bracket. The monster design was pretty cool, and props to the sound department for generating some chilling monster screams.Despite all of the above, Cloverfield isn't awful - there are redeeming features and for the most part it is entertaining. I just wish we got to spend the time with an entirely different bunch of characters.",Cloverfield
196,nitzanhavoc,"I am NOT a fan of Found Footage, but wow... Simply wow!!!",9,2 August 2018,"I've only recently grown accustomed to Found Footage films, giving them a chance as a Horror enthusiast who ran out on other Netflix options. I'm not yet a fan, but having recently had some positive experiences and remembering the finer qualities of 10 Cloverfield Lane, I've decided to check out the film that gave birth to J. J. Abrams ""Cloververse"". Wow, was I ever in for a surprise.Cloverfield tells the story of a group of friends in their mid-twenties, celebrating protagonist Rob (Michael Stahl-David)'s move to Japan after receiving a big promotion. As the exposition progresses, it's made apparent that Rob is in love with Beth (Odette Annable), and the film jumps between the currently documented events and previous events filmed prior on the same tape (showing Rob and Beth). Suddenly, something huge and unnatural attacks Manhattan, and the group attempts to run for their lives while doing their best to save each other.So far everything sounds corny, banal and mediocre, but trust me, it's everything but. Everything I dislike about Found Footage is beautifully improved upon in Cloverfield: the acting and characters feel authentic without presumptuous tendencies of being ""overly real"", the plot actually makes sense (minus, of course, the huge 1950's monster), and mty favorite - there is actually a legitimate explanation as to why on earth they keep the camera rolling while running for their lives (which is a lot more that the human crave for attention despite all logic).Cloverfield got me really immersed, at the edge of my seat hoping for the characters' success and love's victory over disaster. Again, sounds corny, but I couldn't help myself. I was on edge the entire film (since the attack) and haven't for one moment felt anything ruining my suspense of disbelief (and I'm a cynical douche at times, especially when it comes to Horror, I have no idea how this film managed to disarm me so, but it did). It's been a while since I've watched a Horror film that felt like it ended too soon for me (not because it did, but because I enjoyed it so much). I'm in absolute awe of how fun great watching this was. Also, without giving any spoilers, the final touch is given towards the end of the credits, so stay tuned!It is of course a matter of opinion. Some of you might hate this film, others might find it to be mediocre at best (a phrase I have used often to describe numerous Horror films), but I simply won't be able to forgive myself if I don't wholeheartedly recommend that you quit reading my fanboy rambling and go watch this. I envy you for being about to experience this film for the first time.",Cloverfield
197,Rautus,A Great modern Monster Movie,10,2 February 2008,"There has been some really great classic monster movies like King Kong and Gojira, Cloverfield is actually a pretty great modern Monster movie. At first I wasn't sure about this film, the trailer looked interesting but sometimes the trailer can make the film look better than the actual film, so me and a few friends went to the cinemas to check it out and see what it was like. When Cloverfield started I still wasn't sure if this was going to be a good film, I thought the shaky camera was going to get annoying. Once the action started to get going the movie started to become really good, I liked the way they made the Creature so mysterious and gradually let you see more of it has the movie progressed. The camera could get a little tedious at times and could make the movie a little confusing because you can't see what's going on clearly but it didn't spoil the movie too much for me. The Creature itself was kind of cool, it's a giant monster but it can also produce these little creatures. Cloverfield does have some great atmospheric scenes like in the subway and the building, the way it's just filmed with an ordinary camera makes it more creepy. Cloverfield doesn't really explain the origins of the Monster but I guess they left that window open for the viewers imagination, the ending was little bit of a disappointment. We was expecting a little bit more, a few other people in the cinemas even stated that as they walked out at the end. Cloverfield did have some good effects like with the Monster and the little creatures, the destroyed city and the statute of liberty head.The film sees a group of people throwing a party for a friend who's going to Japan, suddenly after a while they experience something like an earthquake. They quickly leave the apartments and find a huge explosion happen in the city then the head of the Statue of Liberty flying over and landing near them, soon they go through the city and discover that a huge Monster is attacking Manhatten. Instead of following the other survivors the main four go off to help their friend who's stuck in her apartment, as they go on they get caught up in a battle with the army and the Monster, they hide out in the subway and decide to go through the tunnel where they soon get attacked by these creatures that drop off the giant Monster. They escape from the Creatures and hide in one of the rooms, they decide to leave and continue going but soon meet the army who take them to a temporary base. They discover that one of them was bitten by the creatures and is taken away and the mysterious infection kills her, the others are told that an evacuation chopper is going to pick up the survivors at 6 o'clock, they then decide to find their friend and try and make their way to the evacuation point. But the Monster is destroying the city and it's only a matter of time before it runs into their way and gets them.Cloverfield is a great modern take on the Monster movie genre that tries to do something new and original. The shaky camera may make some people feel a bit queasy but the film itself is a great Monster movie that should be seen. Check this out. 10/10",Cloverfield
198,pfgpowell-1,Just enjoy the ride,7,25 June 2009,"Let's get the obvious quibbles out of the way first: that someone, even someone as apparently irritating as Hud, should carry on filming come what may in they way he did is, well, very hard to swallow. And that battery life! As one of the characters might say: Oh my God! But, of course, without him doing just that there would be no film. Second quibble: surely to goodness Manhattan, what with all its gossips and their cells passing on the latest before it has even happened would surely somehow know a monster is on its way, especially a monster as extremely ugly as the one in Cloverfield. Ugly in Manhattan? Impossible. But apparently not. Having made those two, points, however Cloverfield isn't half bad. And the special effects/visual effects are quite remarkable. I'm assuming, of course, that they were special effects and that Manhattan wasn't destroyed for the sake of art. Plot there is none.

Quite what the point of Cloverfield is is hard to say, so just enjoy the ride.",Cloverfield
199,socrates99,A fun film - the shaking camera thing is NOT a problem,9,5 July 2008,"I'm beginning to think some critics are completely out to lunch. Take a completely improbable premise like -- New York City is being attacked by some strange monster -- and run with it. I'd say the chances of coming up with anything even half as entertaining as 'Cloverfield' is about nil. What amazed me most, besides the wonderful way these filmmakers found to visualize this crazy event, is the almost perfect pitch of the young actors in it. They've done a completely convincing job of putting themselves in this fantasy, and that can't have been easy. I'd say several of them have a long career in front of them, though you will probably be annoyed by the comments of the character, Hud, who's holding the camera. That was clearly overdone, but no matter, it doesn't really spoil the party.I see some are comparing this to the 'Blair Witch' movie because of the digital camera thing. To me it's more reminiscent of the classic 'The Blob', one of Steve McQueen's earliest films, only about 100 times more impressive. I'm looking forward to Bad Robot's next offering.",Cloverfield
200,TwistedContent,It Knows What It Is - A Tremendously Entertaining Ride,8,29 May 2020,"Back when found-footage/mockumentary genre was alive and kicking, out also came ""Cloverfield"", which has kept its place among the better examples of the now almost extinct horror subgenre. And, very importantly, years later, a movie universe was built on it - ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016) and ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" (2018) are the ones. ""Cloverfield"" was also Matt Reeves's start for an amazing run which hasn't stopped yet, for we are all currently waiting (im)patiently for ""The Batman"". Perhaps ""Cloverfield"" can't be called very sophisticated, thoughtful or a prime example of realism, but it is without a doubt one of the most thrilling and fun found-footage horror movies ever made, along with REC, The Troll Hunter etc.In its first 20 minutes, ""Cloverfield"" introduces the group of characters whose fates we're going to witness tonight, it does so via main character's going away party. Even before any real threat has presented itself, the movie feels fast and dynamic, tagging along with no problems whatsoever. When the mysterious monster strikes, it's mostly all-out action and tension till the very end. There are a couple intermissions, of course, but all in good traditions. The hand-held cinematography, trying to pass the feel realism, does feel faux quite often, and some situations have characters doing actions that are questionable, but even in the light of these flaws the entertainment value is impossible to ignore. ""Cloverfield"" is also one of those rare found-footage movies that feel, look (and are) expensive - a galore of special effects and lots of destroyable scenery. I've heard people complaining about the casting - personally I thought all the performances were fine and above, I couldn't care less if they are ""too good looking"". Young people in the same age group, it's more or less justified in the plot. ""Cloverfield"", as a singular unit, works well on all levels and succeeds at most of the tropes it utilizes, even if they are cliché.I believe that this film - and many of its genre relatives - should be viewed as an adventure, a rollercoaster ride, a walk in the haunted house, call it what You will. It's big, loud and feels packed, but ultimately works on simple terms. Unless you get dizzy easily, enjoy the trip. My rating: 8/10.",Cloverfield
201,skybrick736,Cloverfield,6,4 February 2015,"Cloverfield 6/10 The opening twenty minutes of the film might hold the dullest scenes in any movie I've seen. The party provides nothing to the movie, no good character development, interesting dialog or purpose. It's a terrible party I'd leave in real life. Getting past those initial scenes and into the bulk of the monster film is well worth the wait. The fact that the monster is never shown right away is a great tease, which builds up the wanting to see more throughout the film. The monster itself looks realistically clammy and the little monster fleas that come off of it are a great little twist into the equation. The destruction scenes by the movie are great and so are the military action effects. The story, dialog, and action scenes improve as the movie goes forth. Although the ending is typical of a giant monster film its filmed well and tops of the hopeless feeling perfectly.",Cloverfield
202,dead47548,Quite the experience.,9,18 January 2008,"The hand-held camera was a little annoying at first, but once I got used to it, it was phenomenal. The visual effects are outstanding. The monster is one of the most incredible things I've ever seen. It truly scared the hell out of me...and was just technically amazing. I can't even describe it. Those little spider bastards were bloody well done too. The acting all felt really authentic, like we really were just watching these people reacting to the situation. So that was cool. There were definitely some little things that irked me, some people surviving at certain points in the film, a thousand questions that I want some answers for, and the really cheesy ending...but for the most part it was badass. Surprisingly pretty great. The direction was top-notch.",Cloverfield
203,charchuk,Incredibly immersive and nearly flawless,7,20 January 2008,"Well, I thought it was pretty terrific. The characters were likable enough to make me root for them and believable enough that I felt completely absorbed in the action. You won't find any outstanding performances, but they were solid enough and never took me out of the movie - which probably couldn't have happened anyway. The way it was filmed, while making the film incredibly intense and immersive, also allowed for the story to not center on the monster, and I found that really refreshing. Even still, the monster, when seen, is a terrifying beast, mostly due to the impressive effects, and I really loved that you never really found out what it was. This film wasn't about the monster. I thought the end dragged out the inevitable too long, and it got kind of ridiculous when Hud was attacked, but other than that, this is as thrilling a movie as you're likely to find.",Cloverfield
204,johnnymacbest,Unconventional.,9,19 January 2008,"Having seen the preview of this movie last year, I thought it was going to be ""cookie-cutter material"". But when I actually seen it, it was clear to me that this film is not like any sci-fi film I've seen in recent years.It gets slow at first but once things kick into high gear the whole shebang sets in and to be frank, its an exhilarating and frantic experience as the players in this piece become entangled into a nightmarish scenario with scenes that hearkens back to 911. It's almost and allegory, in its depiction. Almost. Fear sets in. What is out there? What's going on? What is happening? Is it a terrorist attack, natural disaster? Or is it something else? Something ominous, deadly, mysterious, and ultimately terrifying? Visually the film is top-notch with its hand-held filming technique and wicked special effects coupled with tension and despair amongst a metropolitan landscape. What makes this film so effective in its storytelling is that its verisimilitude mirrors ours in such spectacular ways. Sure films like Children of Men used some aspects of the techniques described earlier, but to film it entirely in this format is something unheard of before. You actually feel like you're a part of the show. The monsters are hideous and innovative in design and concept. In my opinion, kudos should be given for such impressive displays.The only nitpick I have with this film is vague info about the creature itself. It would have been great if its origin was coherently more fleshed out. But in a way, it works. Keeping the monsters obscure is more effective. Still, the ending left me with a bunch of questions and that's a good thing. A really good thing. The film is unconventional and that's what sets it apart from the cookie-cutter norm that Hollywood is so known for.",Cloverfield
205,kdnor2011,Truly the best Camcorder film,10,1 March 2010,"Now I love the ""found footage"" style of filmmaking. Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch, Quarantine, all great films. But Cloverfield is not only my favorite of this genra, but it one of my favorite movies of all time, number 4 to be exact. How do I begin to describe why this movie kicks so much ass...First the characters: Every single one of these characters are likable. Even the ones that are supposed to be annoying like Hud, despite the fact that he annoys the rest of the characters by never stop filming, he's actually my favorite character because he just so funny. I actually felt sorry for some of these characters when they died. I actually named my cat Marlena, you probably won't get it, so if you want to know why exactly why I named it after her, ask me in the comments. I guess if you want to nitpick, the characters are kind of cliché, Beth is the damsel in distress, Marlena is the weird emo like chick, Hud is the frat boy who doesn't know when to shut up, but this never bothered me.The acting is top notch, these actors had not been in a lot of movies before this film started, but were absolutely great. Never did I think I was watching actors, I was watching real people, in a real situation. And the three actresses who play Marlena, Lily and Beth...smoking hot.The special effects are amazing, I mean it, there is not one part of this movie that I didn't believe was there. That doesn't happen, no matter how good a movie's CGI is, there is always at least one scene that I can tell is CG. That never happened here, maybe it was because it was dark, maybe it was the movement of the camera, but every special effects shot was perfect, and this movie did not have a big budget.The ""found footage"" element is used very well here, I was never feeling motion sick. This movie has fun with the gimmick, as much as I love movies like Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch, and Quarantine, (hell I thought Apollo 18 was OK), those movies seem to take themselves to seriously with the gimmick, we know it ain't real, but they try so hard to convince us that they are. Cloverfield knows it's a movie and takes advantage of it.Speaking of fun, not only is this movie really, really funny at times, but the main reason I love this movie is because it is so much fun. It entertains me every time I watch it, and by the end I want to watch it again.I didn't get into the viral hype, and thus didn't see the movie until it came out on DVD. I really wish I had gone to see this movie in theaters. That's why I hope they make a sequel, I really, really want to see more of what happened that night. Please J.J. Abrams, I couldn't care less about Star Trek 2, make a sequel to this.And if you have the DVD or blu ray, there are some really cool Easter eggs on them.",Cloverfield
206,richard_sleboe,With Hud's own eyes,7,11 February 2008,"Starting with the fabled 16th century ""chain map"" of Florence, Rennaissance draughtsmen would place likenesses of themselves, sketchpad and feather in hand, in the foreground of their cityscapes. These tiny self-portraits act as warrants of authenticity: they had been on site to see their subjects first hand. Similarly, Matt Reeves makes us believe that we witness a monster attack on Manhattan through the lens of a party-goer's hand-held video camera. To authenticate the footage, he has Hudson ""Hud"" Platt (first-time screen actor T.J. Miller) shoot flashes of his own face at regular intervals, exactly the way the draughtsmen inserted themselves into their designs. The camera tilts and jiggles to suggest Hud is actually filming this as he runs from a very ill-tempered lizard the size of the Chrysler building. But the crystal-clear footage is on 35mm film, not videotape, and of course the jiggling isn't at all like the shakes of ""real"" hand-held video. But what's real anyway? The whole thing is an illusion, fabricated to corroborate an illusion. This is also how this is different from ""The Blair Witch Project"", which was actually (mostly) shot on video. ""Cloverfield"" starts out as a fully-fledged rich kid relationship drama. Until the monster hits town some 20 minutes later, you can't even be sure you're in the right movie. All in all, I think it's pretty clever for a mainstream thriller. Oh, and Lizzy Kaplan is very hot in the part of Hud's love interest, deadpan beauty Marlena Diamond.",Cloverfield

Also rather emptier; also way tenser. And what it lacks in auteurist readability it makes up for in the roller-coaster excitement that Romero has consciously forsaken. The lapses in logic have all been well-catalogued, although I'll warrant that the National Guard is so accommodating they could be from Sweden, and that the final long money shot of the M-O-N-S-T-E-R makes me nostalgic for Val Lewton. But the set pieces are classic, and the found-tape structural logic is more convincing than Romero's, too.

210,Scars_Remain,The Best PG-13 Sci-fi/Horror Film in Years,8,20 January 2008,"Let's be totally honest here... PG-13 horror movies absolutely suck with very few exceptions. The characters are annoying and unlikable, the acting is usually bad, and the suspense is terrible. I think this is all due to toning these films down so that they're acceptable for a wider age range, but it's still a pain. This movie goes against that rule fully and completely.I loved so much about this film. The POV cam gave it that real feeling, kind of like watching a home movie of a UFO landing or something like that. The story is simple but it has a right to be as this is only documenting a group of people trying to survive these attacks. I only have one complaint about this film and it's the acting, it was very rough at times and completely unbelievable but the rest of the film made up for it. I will definitely being seeing this again.Anyone who is a fan of films like Gojira and The Host or The Blair Witch Project and Behind the Mask will find a place for this film somewhere in their heart. See it on the big screen!",Cloverfield
211,Danny_G13,Lives up to the hype,8,7 April 2008,"Blair Witch really does meet Godzilla in epic disaster movie which thrills and entertains.It must be said that a fine job was done of using viral networking to promote this movie. This built up hype beyond what marketed promotion can ever achieve, but of course has the knock on effect of creating a monster (no pun intended) which may fail to live up to the expectations.With Blair Witch already having used the same method of advertising, and being of the same filming style, Cloverfield had to hope its product was at least as good as that seminal classic.And quite frankly, it is probably better.Cloverfield, in brief summary, sees Manhattan attacked by a huge beast which appears to come from nowhere. Obviously, this basic premise is caked in 100% fantasy but there are clear 9/11 overtones throughout, particularly the main characters coughing in dust-dense air, but these real life comparisons should end there.This movie is fiction, and is about a group of 20 somethings as they desperately try to survive the onslaught, and of course, the main selling point of the story is that it is all told through the camcorder one of them has, in order to document the whole ordeal. There is no 'fancy' and glossy Hollywood celluloid here, it is all through the eye of a 'gritty' camera. Of course, the wonderful benefit of this is that by having the 'real' look, the actual special effects also manage to convince entirely. Under a glossy movie, it is that bit less convincing, but out of this kind? It really works much, much better - same budget, but real look.The acting is also extremely good, and frankly barely even looks acted - the real look correlates to how the performances come across - they look terrified, confused, and there are even moments where dialogue seems improvised or 'stumbled' - further increasing the realism instead of pristinely articulated lines.A love story is even thrown in for good measure, but rather than being cheesy, it fits well - indeed, the whole movie just fits - and even manages to amuse in places. Hud, in particular, with his inept and ignorantly awkward conduct, provides many laughs.This really is a great movie and a hell of a lot of fun. Yeah, it's only 74 minutes or so long, but I'm not sure more could have been added to it to lengthen it, and of course there's the point about the camera's battery life. Further realism.I highly recommend this one unreservedly.",Cloverfield
212,gary-444,Pretentious Pap,1,8 September 2008,"Don't believe the hype.Advocates of this movie swoon at the hand held camera work, bitty narrative, and edgy imagery.They are wrong. This is a classic case of the Emperors New Clothes, all style and no substance.It is telling that Director Matt Reeve's previous claim to fame was Under Siege 2 (straight to video) and writer Drw Goddards credentials revolve around being a producer on TV Bore fest ""Lost"". It shows.The hand held camera work is fine for the opening ""party"" Act, although I would have left the party during its 20 minute duration.The characters are sketched as quirky and diverse, like a scene setting episode of ""Lost"", but lack any warmth or emotional interest. I was willing them ALL to die half way through the film.However when the action kicks in the camera work is firstly nausea inducing, secondly it is used to artificially create a drama and tension which is not in the narrative.Matt Reeve, by dipping us into this tale and then suddenly dipping us out is essentially telling a short story. And he is not good enough to carry a short story on film off.It fails at virtually every level.I was checking my watch every 10 minutes or so, a good indicator of how poorly the film engages with its audience.A film I will NEVER watch again.

The movie was good, it will keep you on the edge of your seat but it isn't the greatest film as I've heard in other places. The story about a monster trying to destroy a big city isn't new, but this one is different because of the special effects and the ending that in my opinion wasn't the best. It also left me many questions like What is that monster? Where did he come from? Why is he attacking New York City? The camcorder style gives you the feeling of being there but as time passes by, you can get tired and even dizzy with it. The cast doesn't have any known name, thing that makes the movie a little more credible and the performances are convincing enough.",Cloverfield
214,evening1,Post-9/11 us vs. them story via found footage,5,13 November 2019,"On Sept. 11, 2001, for the first time since Pearl Harbor, Americans found themselves attacked when they least expected it.It's party time in the inscrutably titled ""Cloverfield,"" as a roomful of millenials fete Rob (Michael Stahl-David) on the night before he's to leave for a job in Japan. We eavesdrop on conversational trivia, as Rob's best friend Hud (T.J. Miller) makes the rounds with a video camera, filming testimonials and gossip that Rob has bedded his brother's babe, Beth (Odette Annable).From out of nowhere, a thunderous crash resounds, the lights go out, and, just as in America on 9/11, life would never be the same. New York erupts into a chaotic frenzy of panicked humans amidst bombs and collapsing skyscrapers. A clueless TV anchor announces an oil tanker may have capsized near the Statue of Liberty. They wish!The horror in ""Cloverfield"" derives from the pandemonium amidst humans who do not know what is happening. The movie weakens as it reveals we are dealing with monsters here. How much scarier this would have been if the foe had remained amorphous and intangible!This film effectively recreates the type of mayhem that ensued in the minutes and hours following the 9/11 attacks on New York City. How chilling to remember that World Trade Center denizens were told to remain in their office spaces after planes-as-bombs fueled an inferno in the upper reaches of the targets. In a similar case of the blind leading the blind, clueless civil authorities urge throngs to flee Manhattan -- ""If you're not injured, you gotta keep moving...Keep moving in a quick and orderly fashion!"" -- only to witness the Brooklyn Bridge crumble into the East River.Our protagonists retrieve a voicemail from Beth, who begs Rob to help -- she's been pinned to the floor of her Columbus Circle apartment. Reaching her will mean flouting civil authorities' orders to flee south, but they head uptown anyhow. Tramping through a subway tunnel, member of the group Lizzie (Marlena Diamond) helps Hud avoid a monster but gets fatally stabbed. This grim interlude provides a lull in the action, a chance to catch one's breath, but this is only a delay in the next horrible twist in the plot. In ""Cloverfield"" we see the ultimate portrayal of being able to run, but not hide.""We're gonna wait here till this passes,"" Rob pants under a bridge in Central Park. Safe haven? Not in a post-9/11 world. ""I love you,"" says Beth. ""I love you,"" he replies. In the end, that's really all that matters in our short and fragile lives.",Cloverfield
215,freakfire-1,Just never gets going,4,2 October 2008,"This truly bring back the ""Blair Witch"" style of filming, except this was a little better. Although Blair Witch was more vague and it felt like it could happen up to a point. This, however, was very much pure fantasy.The problem with this fantasy is that it fails to really scare the audience. True the monsters were nicely done. However I wish it were a little more scary since it was let on as a real fantasy type film The ending was a little strange. I wish there was a clue that the creature could do such a thing, but its never let on until it happens. And it would have been nice to see how it ended up after the final scene in the movie.The plot holes were intentional to give it a 'real' feel, but I sorely missed them. As a result, this film suffered. It could have been great. ""C-""",Cloverfield
216,jmbwithcats,USA's Godzilla,7,23 January 2008,"I personally did not think I would relate with the characters or feel immersed in their situation or stories, but I did. The dialog was incredibly off the cuff and realistic, the relationships very easy to relate to right down to the love interest with Beth. Perhaps at that age many of us were in love with a girl like Beth who got away. But I digress.I thought this movie was incredible, and hopefully it will have a sequel but of course the sequel would not use the same hand cam reality format, but rather a straight sequel to continue the story. It would not make sense to make another film using the same techniques, but a sequel would definitely help to bring out more of the story and answer questions people will have about what they witnessed in Cloverfield.The way i saw it, it was perfectly designed, but there will have to be a sequel, in which case the film will be very different, obviously no hand cam, but it was set up to be a very personal video the kind that so many kids are into right now, its what drives myspace, and youtube, etc... its really what this generation is all about, talking about our lives with video, and thats why Abrams did it. To reach out to that audience who could relate. Hud was the voice that carried us through the movie, but like Dante's Virgil he can only take us to the gates of Hell, and now that our characters are there, so our guide has left us alone, but the monster is still with us.Perhaps Cloverfield is Hollywood's response to Japan's Godzilla, and if so... we can expect to see more films to follow up and expand on the story. After all it worked for Godzilla, but Godzilla was a very charismatic monster, and only time will tell if our new monster has the staying power of a Godzilla.The problem some are having with the camera surviving the way it did, through all that destruction, is a cautionary tale. That we have made some amazing advances in technology. We can make hand cams that can survive the apocalypse in a word, but we cannot save ourselves. Perhaps it shows a deeper understanding that we are off our path, that we have lost sight of what really matters, and what it really means to be human. I look forward to seeing a sequel and hope one will be forthcoming, the monster looked pretty sweet especially near the end.J.J. Abrams is the master of symbolism, as lovers of the series ""LOST"" will agree, and I knew this movie would not be any different. So I took special care to notice every detail and consider the importance. For those who couldn't care less, you can stop reading now I honestly find no fault with this film. Though it really has to have a sequel, it just HAS to.So, what were some of the symbols that stood out to me? Cloverfield is perhaps our symbol of terrorism in a post 9/11 world just as ""In part, Godzilla is a symbol of the atomic bomb and the tragedy that befell Japan in the final days of the war. But in part Godzilla is a symbol of Japan's future, and its reconstruction into a newly technologized power following the war,"" said Allison, chairman of Duke's cultural anthropology department.The first big one was Sephora, the name on the first building they stop at after the bridge collapse.Sephora written on a wall with black lines.Sephora in Hebrew means bird, and Sephira is singular for the spheres of the tree of life in the kabbalah, and the black line in the tree of life represents the tail end of the abyss, or the dark night of the soul.So you have the bridge, and abyss between the two realms of existence. The bridge has been destroyed, there is no escape, no exit as shown by the sign in the subway we focus on quite clearly. The time is 3:16AM, biblical reference John 3:16.JJ Abrams loves detail and references like this, anyone who watches LOST will attest to that.The first three Sephiroth, called the Supernal Sephiroth, are considered to be the primordial energies of the universe. The next stages of evolution on the Tree of Life are considered to exist beyond a space on the tree, between the Supernals and the other Sephiroth, called the Abyss, because their levels of being are so distinct from each other that they appear to exist in two totally different realities. The Supernal Sephiroth exist on a plane of divine energy. This is why another correspondence for Binah is the idea of suffering, because the Supernal Maternal energy gives birth to a world that is inherently excluded from that Divine Union.The Tree of Life does not only speak of the origins of the physical universe out of the unimaginable, but also of man's place in the universe.Not a well thought out idea here but it's all that comes to mind and though I'm probably just over thinking it, J.J. Abrams has a tendency to delve very deeply into the construct of his films.When Ben places a call in the subway to mother in the subway, it's 3:16 in the morning... possible biblical reference? Also in the subway, closeups of the sign that reads ""NO EXIT"".. perhaps foreshadowing, or simply a simple truth that we are all mortal.The empty carriage being pulled by the white horses... perhaps the pale horse of Death in Revelations.Saturday May 23, 6:42 AM 3 days before Memorial Day Apr 27 6:17PM",Cloverfield

Oh I get it, A bunch of people are resorting to their ""OMG The CAMERA IZ The SHAXZERZ IT MAYKEZ ME DIZZY!!!!!!!11!"" bullcrap. Well guess what? NOBODY CARES.This film was meant to be shaky. You think you can run down a street and hold a camera straight??? If so, you're an idiot. I saw this on opening day and I'll never forget how much tension was going through me. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.The story is: A group of people are throwing a goodbye party for their friend going away to Japan. On the night of the party, a monster attacks and terrorizes the city, and 5 people must fight to stay alive. The movie was taken from the point of Hud and the video camera, and this film is done in the very interesting style of filming an account of the attack.This movie was amazing. Fantastic acting, straight and to-the-point action, wastes no time on character development, and has one of the most chilling apocalyptic endings since The Birds. The ending is rather left open, and that's a good thing, because I'd rather that type of ending than an ending where the monster dies and people celebrate like nothing ever happened.Another thing I like was how there were NO clichés- there is no scene where the scientist steps into the frame and delivers a boring, 5 minute Shakespearian monologue about the origin of the Monster. You don't know where the monster came from... and that's a good thing.So overall, in the time of cliché'd and stupid movies like Sex And The City, Shutter, Meet The Spartans, and 27 Dresses, we get a very tight and fast paced film that is very No-BS, has your heart racing, your adrenaline pumping, and your blood rushing. Overall, a very profound movie. And please kick yourself in the nuts if you didn't see this in the theater. I saw it in the theater on opening day and loved it. I own it on DVD.

As a critic points out, Cloverfield is to monster movies what The Blair Witch Project is to horror. Possibly only the second film to emulate the marketing and filming techniques of The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield's success in drawing mass appeal from everywhere lies from the word-of-mouth rather than relying wholesale on creative posters or spectacular trailers. The 'camcorder' technique or what I term as the 'camera on a trampoline (COAT)' technique has been used sparsely in many films, even as recent as The Bourne Ultimatum. Apart from The Blair Witch Project, it has never been used to compose a full feature-length film before. Forget about Godzilla, or The Host, or a whole bunch of monster flicks you can find at your nearest DVD rental store, Cloverfield is probably the most uniquely assembled film of that genre ever. It kicks you in the butt, and pulls you by the neck, dragging you into an experience that cinema rarely offers - witnessing a monster attack in New York through the lens of a video cam. How I must emphasize that Cloverfield fulfills that precisely. There's no introduction, no ending, no clear explanation on the monster's origin or its demise, and there's bad scripting, editing, and directing - all the characteristics of a tape from a camcorder. What the heck is Cloverfield? Is it even a movie? Why should I put up with something that makes me feel dizzy for ninety minutes? If you did ask such questions, then you weren't mentally prepared for the picture. I have to admit though there are a couple of major flaws. If it's a tape recording, then why is the sound and sound editing (which should be nominated for Oscars) so clear and undistorted? And why is there no dust or soot smearing some part of the lens? Ignoring these flaws mean that Cloverfield is not as realistic as it should have been. But it's a compromise which most viewers will agree. After all, a movie has to be of a certain respectable quality. Cloverfield is a sensation, a movie event that's ought to be experienced (regardless of how it affects the viewer). Yes, it's risky business. The filmmakers dare to try something unorthodox even if it means theater walkouts, viewers' condemnations, and even possible box-office failure. Cloverfield is an important film because it's deviative rather than derivative. To some of us, it's a gem. For the rest, it's an unforgiving, I-feel-like-puking exercise in visual disorientation.

220,curtis-8,"Weak, Weak Flick--On the Level of a Sci-Fi Channel TV Movie",2,22 January 2008,"""Cloverfield"" is a very weak movie no better than your slightly above-average Sci-Fi Channel Original Made-For-Television monster movie. It has so much in common with that kind of stuff--the bland, sub-par, no-name young actors; the same bland, lackwit dialogue; the same lame, clichéd, tacked-on love story; and the same halfway decent, but barely-glimpsed CGI monsters. The ONLY thing ""Cloverfield"" had going for it was the gimmick of telling the story through the ""eyes"" of a camcorder--and they blew that entirely. For that gimmick to work, you'd have to totally commit to the concept--ie, exactly what would this kind of thing look like if captured by an amateur with a camera? And this is the part at which the screenplay, producer, and the director totally fail. They mistake shaking the camera around for ""realism."" But ""realism"" is the exact opposite of the effect that the direction and camera-work of ""Cloverfield"" convey. The movie is supposed to look like someone shot this with a hand-held vidcam, but what it actually looks like is a movie shot by a guy wearing a camera on his head like a hat. ""We see what he sees"" is not what you would get if the cameraman is holding the camera in his hand. You'd get that only if he's holding the camera up to his eye for 90 minutes straightall the while running from a big monster, fighting off smaller monsters, climbing across debris, and jumping from one building to another. And he never drops the camera (though it does hit the ground a couple of times, though that's only because the guy holding the camera hits the ground. And the camera never breaks! That is some great damn camera! Must have a ""super-grip"" handle and be virtually indestructible! I want one!).But that is not the only way that ""Cloverfield"" totally blows its own gimmick. The filmmakers also decided to put their little camcorder in the hands of a guy who, even though he is supposed to be a complete regular-guy dumbass, apparently has an innate gift for pointing said camcorder in exactly the right direction needed in order to catch each bit of clichéd dialogue and each clichéd reaction to said clichéd dialogue.The people who made ""Cloverfield"" took a really lame giant monster story, cast it with your typical young Soap Opera actors, and knew that they would have to depend entirely on the ""shot from someone's vidcam"" gimmick to give the thing its oomph and interest. And they half-assed it all the way.The trailer we all saw last summer was much more entertaining than the finished product.",Cloverfield
221,ExpendableMan,J.J. Abrams does the monster mash,9,21 February 2008,"There have been a lot of questions hovering over this movie ever since the first title-free teaser trailer appeared in cinemas last summer. What's it going to be called? What's the monster? Is it a reinvigorated version of the Godzilla franchise? Just what the hell is Cloverfield anyway? You have to hand it to J.J. Abrams really, he knows how to tantalise the Internet like no other, but all that aside there is still one question that was never properly addressed: will the casual film-goer get as much out of it as the obsessive cinema fan who has been following the hype since day one? The answer is a resounding yes as Cloverfield is unlike any film you're likely to have seen since the late nineties when three documentary students went in search of the Blair Witch and promptly disappeared. It's also a pulse-pounding ride through a devastated cityscape as seen through the eyes of the principal cast and while the introduction is a tad slow, once things kick off, they don't let up until the finale.Shot entirely on a camcorder that is passed around a small group of characters, Cloverfield follows the same 'found footage' scenario of The Blair Witch. This is no low budget amateur film though, this is a big money depiction of a single terrifying night when New York city comes under attack from an unstoppable unknown creature and it's smaller, but equally vicious offspring. So far so very Godzilla, but by filming the entire thing with a hand held, Abrams takes the audience right down into the thick of it. This may be a big budget production with a preposterously good-looking cast, but it still feels like a small and personal film. When they run, we run with them. When they hide, we hide with them and on a level that no other film has ever achieved. Furthermore, there isn't a disaster movie-stereotype to be had, each of them is a genuine human being and their fear, confusion and desperation is only too real in this post-9/11 world.Then there's the monster itself. To put paid to any still-lingering rumours, no it isn't Cthulu or any other theory you might have, it's an entirely new creation. The initial glimpses of a hind leg as it darts behind a skyscraper can only tantalise so far but when fully revealed, it's truly terrifying. Cynics may roll their eyes at the idea of a monster-movie nowadays but this is no fifties throwback, it's a wholly modern fear that carves a swathe of indiscriminate destruction through Manhattan and resists all attempts to destroy it. Plus, when it opens it's mouth and screams, you can almost feel your blood running cold.Admittedly, not everyone is going to like this film. Given that the entire premise centres on a frantic battle to live through one apocalyptic night, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Yes, you do see the monster, but you never find out what it is and are left with nothing but theories. Neither do you ever get to see the morning after and discover what has become of the world in the wake of its rampage which is bound to frustrate a few folks. However, if you're willing to accept that not every thing will be neatly categorised then the somewhat abrupt ending might be a lot easier to tolerate. I for one thought it was an incredibly fitting way to end the movie, but walking out the cinema there was more than one voice complaining.Cloverfield then is a film that captures the mood of the times in a disturbingly accurate way. We might not have giant monsters crawling out of the sea to decimate the landscape, but if they did it's hard not to see lines of people gathering with camera-phones at the ready recording a snapshot of the destruction to post on youtube. Abrams has pulled off a remarkable feat with Cloverfield; he has not only made the monster-movie fresh, exciting and action packed again, but he's also made it relevant for the first time since the first Godzilla movie riffed on Japan's post-nuclear anxiety. Given that the last time he teased us with a mystery monster it turned out to be a little cloud of black smoke, it's all the more remarkable.",Cloverfield
222,Jacques98,True survival horror.,10,31 August 2008,"I hate clichés. I hate when Hollywood takes a story that everyone has known since they were old enough to use the toilet and people think it's utterly amazing. As far as horror movies go, that includes everything from Disturbia to Sweeney Todd. I am shockedREALLY shocked to say that list does not include Cloverfield.Yes, you've heard the story before. (Well, as far as this movie goes, that is. Who knows what the final plot will end up being.) But when it comes to this movie, really, who cares? The only thing I can compare the way this movie made me feel to was the original Alien. The characters were as realistic as really being at a real party. The camera just simply adds yet another added layer of realism. The plot was realistic, as I would have done nothing different than the main characters. I never once would have thought I would be writing the word ""Hollywood"" and ""realism"" anywhere near the same sentence.The whole adventure is just awesome when I look back at it. I feel like I just witnessed some of the coolest scenes ever captured on filmthe bridge, the helicopter, ""We have a bite!"", even the party.I'll never think of movie intensity the same way again.10/10",Cloverfield
223,masoncheek,More than just a monster movie.,8,6 May 2020,This movie had me mad with excitement. I was hooked from the opening scene. The effects are top notch even by today's standards and it's just an overall great movie.,Cloverfield
224,doorsscorpywag,Holy Moly Batman!!!!,10,1 February 2008,"Obviously this movie will be compared to all sorts of things but overall it's a refreshing reminder that thought provoking film making is not dead in the USA. The movie has just opened today here in Blighty and I managed to see it without knowing anything too revealing and it blew me away. Obviously it will be bracketed with utter sewage such as 'Godawful' and that idiot Spielberg's vomit inducing travesty 'War Of The Worlds' but it leaves that tripe way behind choking on its exhaust fumes as it 'zoms' off in the distance with a finger in the air. Doffing a cap to 'The McPherson Tape' and 'Blair Witch' the movie follows the day of a bunch of well off kids having a farewell party for a mate and brother of one of the main characters. I have been to a few wild parties but this one is an unforgettable bash that changes the lives of our revellers in ways they never quite imagined. It's said there was no great character development but it was an 80 minute movie so what can you expect but I did like the way that the director gave us a bit of an insight during the first ten minutes into the main characters and I for one did like them. They were nice people ..via the medium of a guy with a camera and a bit of party gossip we found out enough to know that these guys were OK. Developing the characters in a similar way Chicago writer Jim Cherry introduced his characters in his excellent novel 'Becoming Angel' we discover they were human just like the rest of us and I for one particularly liked Hud the cameraman and the little elfin 'Winona' lookalike Marlena who he quite fancied. And in those first few minutes I found I actually cared about the people in the movie unlike the pathetic attempt of someone like Spielberg to make us give a rats butt about fake ordinary working guy (we know this cos he drove a crane for a nanosecond) Tom Cruise and his family of retards. Where the film scores is in the way the sense of dread develops and never lets go until the last frames. With a rumble we begin to realise that this is no ordinary farewell bash and as the city explodes around them the party goers are off on a flight for survival that had me on the edge of my seat. It was a truly traumatic journey that eventually took us to Central Park and the films climax and the camera work had me feeling I was there with them but glad I was sitting in a nice comfortable seat in a Middlesbrough cinema. Hollywood blockbusters tend to leave this viewer ambivalent when it comes to the end of these kind of movies. Steve Cheeseburghers pitiful WOTW a perfect example 'yeah millions died but we can take solace in the fact Tom Cruise family escaped without a scratch and Boston was looking nice'. Movies like 'Godawful', 'War Of The Worlds' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' never seem to convey a sense of loss but Cloverfield does. I actually felt regret at what was happening rather than 'OK he's dead where are the freaking dinosaurs?'. I liked that about this movie. The final frames were rather poignant and touching and added to the sense of loss brilliantly reminding us that sometimes we need to take our life chances as we never know when a bloody great monster is gonna screw up our day and stomp our town flat. Best way to see it is without reading any of these reviews and keep away from the internet but ignore the nay sayers this is a bloody awesome movie which will sadly be watered down by pitifully weak sequels.",Cloverfield
225,FallenEye,"A Story About a Girl, a Camera and Something.",7,30 March 2018,"The hand held camera format was always going to be an issue, the type where even Reeves, Abrams and Goddard were probably aware of first, long before any other obstacle, so getting it right was an absolute must. Did they get it right? Not completely, but Reeves' directing and the length of the movie went a very long way in cauterizing the bleeding, especially for the viewer's eyes.That camera, that damn camera. The camera is more of a survivor that Tom Hanks in Cast Away, with Destiny's Child playing in the background and Jeff Probst narrating the whole thing.There were some issues I had with the acting, however there were other parts where all the main actors involved redeemed themselves to satisfactory levels. There was also one scene, the tunnel scene, which felt a bit out of touch with reality, given how Cloverfield did such a stellar job at creating a natural and authentic panic.Cloverfield is actually not about the creature, it's about the consequence of it. This film is a prelude, it's an entire movie about depicting an aftermath. It's the movie before the origin story, but not a prequel, and I believe that was a pretty brilliant stance and angle to take.Another awesome touch, is introducing the main couple and telling their story as a recording being recorded over by the current event. A creative way in recounting a flashback.Also, the way Cloverfield ends is, somehow perfect, because though it doesn't provide any kind of closure what-so-ever, it does however, fit extremely well within its approach. If the approach had been executed terribly, then that ending would've been aweful.Cloverfield is an awesome watch. 7.3/10.",Cloverfield
226,Jay_Exiomo,A clever trick but nothing more,6,29 January 2008,"And the monster is out of the bag.Thickly veiled in secrecy and fueled by the hype surrounding it, ""Cloverfield"" is the result of ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" after having a one-night stand. Without saying much, the film revolves around a group of twenty-somethings who hold a farewell party for Japan-bound Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) when a monster attacks New York City.It's a great marketing ploy, actually, and the J.J. Abrams-produced film, directed by Matt Reeves, certainly looks interesting on paper. Written by Drew Goddard, a frequent collaborator with Abrams, the film unfolds through the perspective of a hand-held camcorder as recorded by someone, mostly by Hud Platt (T.J. Miller). The first few minutes is spent introducing us to Rob and his girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) waking up one morning, accidentally recorded over with interviews of a bunch of other people we're going to hang out with as mayhem starts.I have no problems with the shaky camera nor the awkward camera angles. In fact, it helps with the realism and if only for those factors, plus the clever editing, the movie works. Still, the film doesn't present itself as anything more than a cheap catharsis for a post-9/11 New York. One is smacked in the middle of the events yet it doesn't generate the requisite urgency. There are few moments of genuine tension but those fragments never form into a consistently gripping product. You hang out with these people, but you never find the sympathy to care for them, when their motivation is anchored on manipulative gimmickry and their interaction fueled by amateur acting and a hackneyed script best suited for the emo populace.""Cloverfield"" is a clever trick but nothing more. It's the big-screen treatment of a YouTube video, only here the gimmick is more conspicuous, and what usually lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes is stretched to 80 minutes or so.",Cloverfield
227,Jerique,Blair Witch Meets War of the Worlds!,8,10 January 2009,"For many people this is an avoided movie for the fact that the style of filming can create motion sickness. The film is shot with a perspective view of one of the characters trying to do a documentary. You get a first-person view of Hud (T.J. Miller)'s seeing.The film starts off quite boring and remains so for approximately twenty minutes. You are introduced to Hud, Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), his brother Jason (Mike Vogel), Hud's love interest Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), and Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman), and very quickly you catch on there's something between Beth and Rob. After Beth leaves with her date, Rob, Jason and Hud talk on the balcony until something like an earthquake abruptly stops them.As everyone evacuates the building, the statue of liberty's head glides down the street right in front of the camera and Hud. Briefly seen is a monster -the monster- who caused it. As Rob tries to get to Beth to save her, tiny monsters attack multiple people, Hud continues to record the crazed journey and the roller coaster ride takes you for all you got.Overall the movie is well casted, regardless that the cast is primarily unknown actors. The special effects are wonderful and the filming makes you really feel apart of the flick. The romance and comedy are great blankets that keep you tucked from the horror of the monster(s) and everything else has you on the edge of your seat just wondering what will happen next. The end of the film will ultimately leave you breathless and confused, but you will still enjoy what you saw.With the monsters having a theme that fits War of the Worlds (2005) and the filming aspect being similar to Blair Witch Project (1999) the film gives you at least a little chunk of entertainment. You won't regret seeing the film if you can survive the possible nausea. If you did enjoy the film, hopefully you're on board for the sequel.",Cloverfield
228,austin0731,"hey, that's actually pretty good",7,18 March 2016,"Yes, Cloverfield's pretty good. IT had fast paced action with quite a good horror/monster movie premise. The monster was very well done the story makes sense, unlike lots of horror flicks that is just full of dumb people. It was actually scary and quite intense, it is a faced paced movie not an excruciating and long horror movie of some creepy baby attempting to murder someone for two hours. The found footage element was quite well done too, actually I feel that it elevated the movie a lot. In fact if we take that out it wouldn't be half as good as it was, obviously the whole mystery of not knowing what the movie is gonna be about was quite a marketing strategy. It really sort of creates an immersive and real-world vibe to the film.I watched cloverfield just as many others, not knowing what I am getting myself into but the outcome was great. In fact I must reiterate this movie I feel is as good as it is because of the nature of it and that great marketing strategy. Because no expectation= positive outcome even if it's not as good as it is. This is an example of how a movie going experience does not always start in the theatre and in fact the entire marketing campaign building up to it really helps make the experience a much better one. However I think that there are some flaws despite all of those positives, first of all as I have said the movie alone is not so good, it was quite well done but the marketing deserves a lot of credit. Second of all, I do wish that the monster was much better realised, perhaps more focus on the monster that could come with a slightly longer run time. But overall the positives definitely outweighs the negatives",Cloverfield

I did not like that concept at all, other people may but I hated that point of view and really it made it hard to tell what was going on. The monster in the film was OK, but nothing special. The characters in the film were boring and not interesting. I understand that they all were having a party or something, but the story just seemed rushed or something.

230,ultramatt2000-1,What a movie!,10,22 August 2008,"What do you get if you combine THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and GODZILLA? You get that movie. What a way to start the year. This film pays homage to the classic giant monster movies like KING KONG, THE BEAST FROM 20'000 FATHOMS and THEM plus some ma-sized or smaller than man monster films like Dracula (1931) and ALIEN (1979). Now why did I mention Dracula (which is a favorite of mine)? Here's why. There is one scene where they guy rescues his girl-friend and she has a metal bar impaled through her and he takes it off of her off-camera! Just like the way the title vampire gets killed. I also mention ALIEN because there is one scene where you see the small monster comes bursting out of the girl and growls about, which sounds like Donald Duck having a fecal fit or Homestar Runner's The Cheat loosing his mind.Now when I saw the monster, it was sooo original and scary looking. In fact, it could make THE HOST look like a tadpole, King Kong look like a chimpanzee or Godzilla look like Barney. The gigantic beast (created at Tippet Studios, lead by JURASSIC PARK animator Phil Tippet) looks so imaginative, it contains characteristics of various animals (the tail looked like those of an eel). At the end credits, it the music sounded like those of Danny Elfman (MEN IN BLACK, THE SIMPSONS and the SPIDERMAN trilogy) and Akira Ifukube (who did music to a lot Japanese fantasy and science fiction films, but he was known for doing the score to the original GODZILLA). After the credits, you hear a voice, if you mess it around, it says ""Help us."" or ""It still lives.""After the film was a monster smash (no pun intended) at the box office, there was fan-art running rampant on Deviant Art (such as chibi-cloverfield, cute eh?), parodies like the one digital short in Saturday NIGHT LIVE and like KING KONG and THE BEAST FROM 20'000 FATHOMS, imitations of cheesy proportions like Asylum's MONSTER, the low-budget independent schlock-fest MONSTER MOVIE and the porno version, CLEAVAGEFIELD.Usually movies released in the beginning of the year are boring, and not impressive Until there was ELECTRA in 2005. In 2008, there was CLOVERFIELD. I highly recommend it!Rated PG-13 for violence, language, nudity, gore and scary going-ons.",Cloverfield
231,gregeichelberger,A truly annoying cinematic experience,3,18 January 2008,"Movies are supposed to enlighten, educate, edify and mostly entertain. I do not always look for all of these in combination, and usually, the last item on this list will more than suffice.Words I do NOT associate with viewing a motion picture include ""annoy,"" ""irritate"" and ""nauseate,"" among a few others. These words tend to portray the event as not so pleasant.Well, chalk up ""Cloverfield"" as a lesson in the that particular category. It's also another in a very, very long series of films in which the director (in this case, Matt Reeves, making his feature debut after helming a series of television dramas) sees fit to show an entity which should have remained HIDDEN, at least until much later in the movie.Yes, there is a supposed frightening creature here which - if left unseen - is 10,000 times more scary (and interesting) when it is not shown. For some reason, these directors need to keep the monsters hidden as long as possible (see the original ""Alien"").Anyway, Reeves directs a bunch of anonymous cast members (the men all look like Jason Lee/Ryan Gosling hybrids, except for the fact they cannot act, and the women are completely non-descript) in a story of another attack upon New York City (you know, between seeing this film and ""27 Dresses"" - also filmed in the Big Apple, back-to-back, I'm glad I live in Southern California).The gimmick here is, that everything was filmed on a cell phone, thus the above reference to ""nauseate,"" etc. This is why the movie is so off-putting - well, ONE of the reasons. Filmmakers have used this camera jiggling effect in short-term bursts to mimic hand-held news footage or a personal videography of a certain scene or two, but never to THIS extent.Yes friends, the entire movie is filmed from this vantage, Confuse-O-Vision, resulting in dozens of jumpy, jiggly, bizarre point-of-view shots, quick cuts and phantom edits that call for a few doses of Dramamine to get through this picture's thankfully-short 84-minute running time.And speaking of irritating, there's also the plot and the acting (or lack of it) to write about. The story has a group of uninteresting Gen-Xer's, led by Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend, Lili (Jessica Lucas), throwing a surprise party for Jason's brother, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), upon the latter's promotion and transfer to Japan (a little foreshadowing here).Rob, meanwhile, has just broken up with Beth (Odette Yustman), who shows up at the party with a Scott Baio lookalike. All of this drama is being duly recorded by Hud (T.J. Miller), easily the most interesting character of the movie, in the sense we do not see him (just a few brief scene appearances), but he comments on nearly every event.Beth leaves the party and shortly thereafter, a series of earthquakes strike. Not too long after this, massive explosions rip through lower Manhattan, buildings fall, bridges tumble into rivers and the crowned head of the Statue of Liberty is lopped off.It turns out that a huge, multi-story creature has been allegedly loosed from the bowels of the earth and, like its predecessors, Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, among others, it is hellbent on destroying a major city (why wasn't this filmed in Tokyo?!).Meanwhile, our little group of Yuppies is trying to get to Beth, who, in a short five-minute span, was not only able to get all the way across town during the carnage, but also thought it would be a good idea to retreat to her 37th-floor apartment. To reach her, the band has to travel through maddened crowds, falling debris, piles of dead, creepy subway tunnels, battles zones and falling bombs.And as if that isn't enough, the monster exudes spider-like crabs which bite people, infect them and cause them to explode - talk about your bad days. Finally, the group reaches Elizabeth, but you'll have to see for yourself what happens after that, if you really want to shell out a 10 spot to watch this silliness.Another major problem I had was a scene too close to what happened on 9/11. It's a sequence of a collapsing building that's all too familiar for those who remember those events. I'm not saying Reeves had no right to include it - he did - it just may hit a little too close to home for some people.Overall, the jerky hand-held camera work, the talentless cast and the revelation of the creature far too early (and the fact it is not frightening) has me advising the paying viewers to skip this nonsense and catch a showing of ""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster.""",Cloverfield

It uses some interesting filming techniques, as it switches to different people over and over. Your introduced to each character pretty quick, but luckily it works. Next, the tension is pretty interesting because you'll never guess how this 'thing' is going to appear. The attack hits, the movie progresses, and some pretty cool scenes play. I was fully immersed in the action, and I surely enjoyed myself. The main problem I had with Cloverfield is how hard it tried to be something creative, or new. I was fully into it, and such, but at times I was asking myself why did they even do this? Not in a bad way, but sometimes it annoyed me. Otherwise, the movie was pretty good. The acting was pretty average. For new actors that I have never seen, they did good on their part, and I wasn't yelling out how 'unrealistic' it was. The special effects were the highlight of this film. It looked so real at times, but others fell short.

233,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Shake shake shake, shake shake shake (shake your movie, shake your movie)...",8,17 January 2008,"If you're unaware that this movie involves a monster attacking NY, lots of screaming, running, explosions and everything being shot on hand-held camera...then clearly you missed the trailers/marketing for this film. If shaky-cam documentary-style movies aren't your cup of tea, steer clear. However, if you're interested in seeing a different sort of monster movie (ie. it attempts to make something as unbelievable as monsters into something tangible and real), then this one might be for you. It was pretty much what I was expecting: a monster movie done as if it were 'reality'.I thought the trailers did a good job of setting the mood/giving a feeling of eeriness, because you knew nothing about what was attacking the city. The human characters, which others seem to perceive as the 'weakest' part of the movie, were actually what I thought held it all together. Some may have been bored by the movies beginning, as we get to know 'main dude', Rob (whose going-away party is what brings everyone together), and Beth (their 'love story' is really what the film's about at its heart), then Jason (Rob's brother), Lily (Jason's fiancé), Hud (who serves as the cameraman for the majority of the film), and Marlena (Lily's friend who Hud has a thing for).These are the characters we follow throughout, so if you find them unengaging/annoying, then the film is not going to be very 'fun' for you (then again...given what happens to most of them, you might actually derive some morbid amusement from their fates). I myself was invested in following them on their fight to stay alive and I feel they've been judged too harshly by audiences, as I thought they came off as very 'human'. Like all humans, they were not without their flaws. Yes, they make questionable choices/decisions, but given the nature of what's going on around them, one can understand how lapses in judgement might occur.Rob is probably one of the main ones people had issues with. Some might've lost patience with his devotion to Beth, but that's why the beginning of the film needed that set-up of their relationship. It's crucial to where the story goes (regarding the remarks like ""She SO wasn't worth it!""...have you SEEN Odette Yustman? Pretty worth it, in my opinion). I also liked the fact that the 'hero' of the story was not your typical hero. Rob falls down when trying to save someone from a parasite, he doesn't manage to kick a door open on his first go (it takes several) and he focuses solely on who he cares most about...but that's 'real'. Anyway, he doesn't insist others follow him on his quest to save Beth (far from it. He actually gives everyone the chance to go to safety, but they make the CHOICE to follow him. That's important to remember, those of you who blame him for what happens).Hud's the stand-out, though. At first he's a reluctant cameraman, but actually gets really into 'documenting' (one might say 'too much', since he rarely lets go of the camera/seems devoted to filming everything no matter how life-and-death the situation might get). Whilst his remarks/comments about certain things (such as flaming homeless guys) might be a little ill-timed, they kept me amused throughout. I'm unsure how much of all the actors' dialogue was improvised, but considering how natural it sounded, it seemed like quite a bit of it may not have been in the script. The only thing that might've made it sound a bit more 'realistic' would've been some harsher cursing than what they used. In amongst all the action, there are moments where things 'slow down' a bit to catch one's breath (both for the audience and the characters themselves). The little 'human' moments aren't forgotten, as characters bond, comfort each other and break devastating news to relatives. While some might think there are 'contrivances' to get characters from Point A to Point B and so on, I never felt that was the case.For anyone expecting answers to all their questions...there aren't many. The monster's origins are speculated upon by Hud, but most is left unexplained (though pay particular attention to the top of the screen in the very last scene for a possible clue). Questions such as ""What made that girl explode?"", ""What kind of video camera has everlasting battery, a flashlight on it and NIGHT VISION?"", ""How does somebody manage to run around, seemingly fine, after having a rebar through their torso?"" are pretty pointless (though with that last one, my answer would be 'adrenaline'). If you don't need everything spelled out and actually enjoy having some things left open to debate/your own interpretation, then you should be content.As for the complaints about the ending, we are informed right from the start that the video was retrieved from a site ""formerly known as Central Park"" (which suggests that Central Park no longer exists). Taking this into consideration, and given where the last survivors end up...how'd you think this would end? I think if anything kind of 'hurt' the movie, it was the fact that it gave away what the monster looked like fairly early on. I'm sure all those who were worried about being 'robbed' of getting a good long look at the monster were probably rethinking that with the close-up of it towards the end. I myself could've done without so many shots of it. Although the animators did an admirable job (at the time), no matter how good the CGI was, it was never going to look fully convincing.I feel this film achieved what it set out to do, giving us a unique monster movie that we hadn't really seen before. The film's 'look'/lighting/atmosphere also deserves props. If nothing else, stick around for the 'Roar! (Cloverfield Overture)' that plays once the end credits roll. It's a perfect piece of score that compliments the movie/feels like it would've played throughout the film if this were a 'typical' sort of monster movie.",Cloverfield
234,gabriel_sanchez,A crazy random event through the lens of the best videographer of the world,4,29 September 2021,"A group of friends are trying to get into safety after something attacks Manhattan. But they will try their best on saving their missing friend before that.I timed it: it takes 18 minutes before something really happens. Up until this point, the movie is trying to introduce us to what will be the driving subplot of this story. Rob and Beth are lovers, but Rob is leaving the US and Beth found a new boyfriend in the meantime. Jason and Lily are engaged. Hud is the dumb of them all and he has a crush on Marlena.In this movie, you see the footage of a camera recovered by the Military. The camera, as footage shows in most of the movie, is operated by one of the main characters, Hud.The found-footage genre is a hard genre to work with. The main problem I see with this genre is that it seems unrealistic. I don't think someone ordinary would go through the ordeal of trying to record everything in a threatening situation, unless this is their job, like detective reporters. And even when they are up to recording everything they can, getting good shots is hard if sh** is going down. Our buddy Hud here does not miss any action, even when he is either running or jumping through buildings.I guess movies like The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Digging Up the Marrow (2014) got the found-footage genre right because they made aware to the audience that the people filming were trying to get footage to support their case. In Diary of the Dead (2007), the idealists of the movie had the ""awesome"" idea of adding soundtrack and narration to the footage-- but, hey, definitely believable. However, in Cloverfield (2008), we are supposed to believe Hud, and one or another person, was able to film everything we see. What is up with the cuts we see too? Did the Military removed scenes to improve the ""footage's pacing""? Hard to swallow.I don't think the main characters are likeable enough. I guess this happens because the movie does not develop them enough for us to care. To me, it is like going to a party: you meet random people, you probably hang out and have fun with them during the night, but you don't really know them or care enough. You feel empathy, but that is probably as far as it goes for a strong feeling.The comedic relief is Hud. He is so innocent and pure that is laughable. He made me chuckle a couple of times. Also, I think he is the best actor portraying dispair. His screams are so believeable that, in the end, he is my favorite.Because the movie does not develop the characters enough, any other seemingly subplot is either quickly dismissed or dismissed entirely in the end. What we get is people trying to survive a random crazy event. Considering the ending, I would have thought it was obvious a sequel was bound to happen, but it took us another 8 years before we got another movie related to this franchise.A seemingly good plot is diminished by lack of character development, the choice of going for the found-footage genre without planning enough, and no answers to what happens in the movie whatsoever. As a standalone, I don't recommend this movie.",Cloverfield

236,CineCritic2517,"Fine idea, lame and annoying execution.",1,6 April 2008,"What could have been a great contribution to the film's genre, is frankly wasted almost right from the start. Once again (like in War of the Worlds) some ill conceived group of people, who are so unlikable, air-headed and preposterously good looking, you could swear you were watching them just 10 minutes earlier in that shïtty coke commercial, is thrown at the audience as if to say: 'Hi folks, these are your protagonists for this evening's entertainment, we apologize for the inconvenience.' What type of writer's-cramp-inflicted screenwriter or producers can not learn from previous errors in almost all of these sorts of movies. Why do we have to suffer once again through the most impressive collection of jawdroppingly dumb yuppies, whose existence somehow seems to revolve around spewing the most vapid conversation around like if it was a sport. You know, like, I'm so totally amazed at this awesome dialog dudeman! Cloverfield has some very impressive and convincing CGI, but when are we finally going to get treated to this art-form in a movie together with a good story and on par dialog? Transformers, another CGI wonder, was completely unwatchable for the exact same reason.I realize that it's a cliché when I say that this movie could and should have been SO much better. Not in gritty realism, it covers that bit quite well (although I would have preferred some sort of mix of steady-cam and not-steady-cam footage). But rather through a decent plot, a decent (and relevant) build-up and a feasible script.Hopefully the audiences will eventually grow exponentially tired of these sort of plot less caricatures of earlier, similar films, which really only give us an update on the progress of filming- , editing- and CGI-techniques.Cloverfield scores a 7.8 on IMDb as I write this, which in actuality is a near 6.5 compared to the ratings of movies before studio-companies and the masses began to flood this site. But at least it's not a 8.5 or so for if it did, they might as well have shut down IMDb altogether.4.5/10 Thanks for reading.",Cloverfield

The monster ,especially at the end, is heartstopping in size and appearance, Whoa! I normally hate shaky cam stuff for its uaually reserved for movies with lame acting ,no plotline and bad effects but here, this movie takes that concept and makes it work..the effects are top notch and terrifying as is the sound mastering..The roars of the monster, the buildings crashing, metal creaking, the thuds and explosions are superb!

238,pivic,Quite dumb with wafer-thin script despite promising start and special effects,2,26 May 2009,"Having failed to see this film at an Odeon theatre in London (my girlfriend became violently sea-sick), I thought the promising beginning of it could be a precursor to how the film would end up. A cool monster-flick, yeay! I was wrong. All in all, the film is almost worse than Spielberg's take on ""War Of The World"". A group of people form in New York, USA, to say good-bye to a friend who's going away to work in Tokyo, Japan. Everything that is seen is filmed by a participant of the party, who is quite uninteresting as a person, hence in my eyes numbing the film a little. Anyway, as a few of the characters squander to intrigue over who's hooking up with who, something detonates. People find something otherworldly is tearing up NY. Woo! Sadly, this was the promising bit. Hereafter all is running - with no suspense á la ""Alien"" whatsoever - or trying to avoid dying, which is boring. I felt little or no sympathy for the characters, and the script felt very thin. All in all, nice special effects but a very dumb film which feels bad, as I think it could have become good with a bit more thought and intelligence.",Cloverfield
239,Mr_Censored,A modern monster movie for a modern audience.,8,28 April 2009,"During a going away party, a group of young New Yorkers find themselves shook up by earthquakes, tumbling buildings, fire and ash and one big bad mean monster. Travelling across town during an evacuation proves to be a difficult task, as they attempt to save a friend while the military is busy pushing everyone off the island in an attempt to cut their losses and destroy a monster that is bound and determined to level the city. Thankfully the group has a video camera in hand, and what ""Cloverfield"" presents itself to be is exactly what the disaster looks like through the eyes of innocent bystanders. Nothing more, nothing less.Think ""Godzilla"" through the eyes of ""The Blair Witch Project."" What the makers of ""Cloverfield"" were going for was an American version of the infamous Japanese monster and to that end, they succeeded. Through the eye of a single camera, all the necessary tension and chaos is captured in a realistic manner. Forget the fact that the CGI on the monster is, well, unconvincing. In line with another like-minded movie – ""The Mist"" – the dodgy effects are redeemed by solid storytelling, tight pacing and shocking visuals. Lord knows, Hollywood loved destroying major cities on film in the past, and in a post 9/11 world, seeing buildings crumble and fire-balls raining down on the streets of New York City is all the more shocking. There's nothing overly glossy about ""Cloverfield,"" which is a testament to its genius. If you can believe that a creature can actually exist that is capable of causing as much damage as a tsunami, then you'll believe ""Cloverfield"" to be a certified Monster-Movie classic.",Cloverfield
240,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Didnt mind the shaky cam,7,29 August 2020,"I think it was a pretty solid movie. The found footage style did not bother me. And while, I dont think many people would opt to film the entire thing I can at least buy the reason why the character Hud gives. Though, maybe it would have been a simpler fix to make the character a journalist. That might have been more believable. But, overall I actually liked the aspect of the found footage. I felt like it gave you a unique experience. Yes, it can be shaky at times and yes sometimes the focus isnt always the best, but thats what it would be like in that situation. I think it captured how disorienting and out of body that would feel. And I think the movie really shines with how tense it is.The movie loses some points for me for the characters. They werent very likable. Not too mention some of the choices they made. Like, at one point (still somewhat early on) Rob decides he's going to rescue his friend (whom he's in love with) and his 3 other friends decide to go with him. Why? Its not like they dont know whats happening yet and think its safe. They know (and have seen) that its a giant monster (which personally would make me crap my pants) and one of their group members has already died. I get why Rob might think its a good idea, but why do the others think this a good idea (especially since the Monster is in the area they are headed towards). And especially Lizzy Caplan's character Marlena. As far as I know, she doesnt even know Rob that well and wasnt supposed to be at the party anyway. It would have made sense for her to join the evacuation team when she had the chance. I get movie has to movie but I think it would have made more sense if something had happened that caused them to be truly separated from other people. At least then I could understand why they would all follow him (safety in numbers).I don't know. It was good, certainly could have been improved upon. But a fun watch.",Cloverfield
241,Ziya90,"A lot of people say that they hated it, probably just to be opposite",10,9 January 2010,"This is not a movie which tries to get people's attention in order to do well at the box office. In other words, what people call, not pretentious. J. J. Abrahams is one of this movie's producers, but Cloerfield was not appreciated, even the half of it as Star Trek was appreciated. Instead, there are a lot of people who say that they hated it and there are a lot of people either who give it only 1! There is not even one flawed moment in the movie on all counts and acting that is criticized by the haters is not amateurish at all. I did not understand why it is criticized. All the actors and actresses are amateur, but the acting is not amateurish, very persuasive. Cloverfield is extremely realistic that makes it much more effective. It is because all the things seem extremely realistic, how is it called? Documentary style. The most unusual opening sequence for such a movie is in Cloverfield I guess. The mood, the atmosphere are very interesting and it is like someone records a party rather than the director introduces the characters of a monster movie to us. Therefore, it starts like a stylish drama. However, it is not like party, girls, drinks, chats and music, something different. I just can't describe it. Because of realism? or because of another reason? I don't know. As for the first attack, I haven't seen such an engaging and impressive one before. This is much more than panicked people run and scream and a monster attacks them, really it is too hard to describe how it is impressive, brilliant. Almost everyone compares the movie with other mockumentaries which is unnecessary, if you ask me. By this style, the movie does not become an imitation or pretentious, it makes it real effective. Then, why realism does not effect people? It seems that the haters do not care about whether it is extremely realistic or not. I put myself in the characters's place, panicked as if I am in there and I worried about each of them. By the way, there is an action scene which the forces clash with the monster and it was much more satisfying than even the whole War of the Worlds!! The subway scenes are one of the best parts of the movie, also one of the most realistic parts of the movie, it was like it could happen and also so sad. The movie, Gwoemul was very appreciated, people say that it was dramatic that generally other monster movies are lack of, believe me, it is nothing. And the final. Very exciting and at the same time dramatic. However not for everyone, especially if you don't like unconventional finals. Lastly, this is one of the most engaging movies ever.",Cloverfield

While it has gotten a lot of flak for the believability factor (hello, it's a monster movie) and for the shaky cam visual style ala Blair Witch Project, the audience anticipation has a great deal to do with the reception of the film (i.e. if you have no imagination, you will not enjoy Cloverfield).Just like Godzilla was successful having been released right after the war, as it was used as a symbol of helpless doom, Cloverfield resonates with audiences and becomes relevant in light of terrorism. I was just hoping they wouldn't show the monster so much because just glimpsing parts of it is more terrifying than seeing it for what it is because seeing it in its entirety wasn't as frightening for me as, say, the creatures in Alien.As for the camcorder cinematography, it does take getting used to.

Now on with the review.Cloverfield was a surreal experience told from the point of view of a movie camera. It is a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla. I found the movie very effective and did not once feel sick because I knew what to expect.A group of friends are throwing a going away party for their friend Rob who is going to Japan for a job. WHile enjoying the party a creature the size of Godzilla attacks New York City. During all this time and beyond one of the characters, his name is Hud Platt (TJ Miller) films everything from the beginning of the attack and on into the next day. During this time him and four friends go on a trek through a demolished New York to save a girl who is wounded. ALong the way they come up against several obstacles which include the giant creature, mini-monsters which are falling off of it, and all kinds of destruction which include the Brooklyn Bridge, two skyscrapers which have collapsed on each other, and of course the head of the Statue of Liberty which is the first scene of destruction in the movie.Some will wonder why these five people risk their lives to save one girl who will most likely be dead by the time they get there? I'm not going to say if she's dead or not, that will be up to you to see the movie. WHat I will say is that Rob (Michael Stahl David), who had an affair with the wounded girl, is in love with her and let her leave his party on a bad note and feels guilty. The others follow him because he is their friend and they don't want him to go off by himself on such a dangerous mission.From the point of view of the movie camera, the movie has a nice frantic pace that fits in perfectly with reality TV. The character filming everything also makes it more interesting because he has a sense of humor which helps us to get involved with their plight through the devastation. There are quite a few surprises along the way, and some that you won't be expecting when they happen.Cloverfield, like Blair Witch, is a memorable movie. Like Blair Witch, it makes you feel like you are a part of the action and right there with them as they struggle onward. There are questions that I have about the movie though? One in particular would have to do with injured characters who are able to continue moving forward after sustaining some devastating injuries that would make it impossible for them to even move a little without passing out. Also, there is no way the battery in that movie camera would've lasted seven hours. It is these moments that take away from the reality that the writer and director were going for, but I can forgive it somewhat.And for those of you wondering if you see the creature or not. Yes you do. There aren't a lot of scenes though, and even the scenes you do get are somewhat blurred. The director's approach of less being better holds true. This movie is also rated PG-13, proving once again that you don't need a whole lot of gore to make an effective horror film.",Cloverfield

249,springsunnywinter,Very Realistic,10,3 November 2008,"This is the first film I've seen that is made in handy cam style and I thought that it was a very well made movie and didn't have that many shaky camera effects so you can see what is happening. Cloverfield gives you the true real feeling of getting stuck in a city that is being attacked by a giant monster and you have a handy cam. Movies like Godzilla & King Kong shows that where the monster came from and what is it's end but if you are in the city that is being attacked by the monster you won't know anything about it which Cloverfield did by not showing us the beginning and the end of the monster and they did a fantastic job. When the head of the statue of liberty went flying across the street was so awesome and breathtaking.In the first 20 minutes before New York was being attacked there was just some friends being videotaped in a party which looked very natural then all of a sudden it got into action. The whole film was so lifelike and realistic that it seems you are actually watching a real life video. There were some shots of the monster throughout but there was a clear sharp image of it in the end and it looked like a giant bat. Cloverfield was about 70 minutes which was a good idea because it is made in handy cam style and should be shorter than the normal running length.

251,David_Frames,The geist in the machine.,6,2 March 2008,"Something is happening in escapist genre film-making, can you feel it? My zeitgeist gland started to vomit chemical nausea into my body twice recently and the reasons are obvious  like you my friend. It's this notion that escapist genre fare is starting to appropriate the language of cultural trauma in order to entertain us and a new kind of blockbuster is the by-product  a style in its infancy that is flirting with immorality. This is the kind of flirting that unchecked can lead to a violation of the audience and what it understands to be normal in terms of how it should get it rocks off. Be careful says I because like a dirty old uncle that whips out the little gentleman for his unsuspecting niece, the consequences are a potential warping of what we consider to be harmless fun  something David Director and Sidney Scribe must ultimately take responsibility for.Rambo was at it recently, hijacking Spielberg's D-Day realism approach from Saving Private Ryan to murder the Burmese Militia. In Spielberg's film the technique had been used to strip warfare of its Technicolor entertainment value and give the battle scenes an unsentimental air of reportage. Stallone reversed this idea by applying the same tools to sate the blood lust of his seen it all before ghoulish adolescent audience  a corruption of the original style. What used to be fun about genre movies with high death rates and judicious dollops of wanton destruction is that it was escapism  larger than life, utterly ridiculous and therefore completely safe to enjoy.Cloverfield may be a better film than Rambo but it uses the same methodology to get it jollies. Here its 9/11 that gets plundered to add an uncomfortable real world sensibility to the old monster on the rampage movie. Filmed from the perspective of a single camcorder, events unfold in fits and shaky hand held starts with the beast periodically glimpsed whenever the terrified documentarian gets the chance. The characters aren't up to much and are irrelevant in any event but their panic feels genuine enough and its in these scenes of fleeing, glancing upward to see a building topple and the like that déjà vu hits you in a very unpleasant way. One scene in particular  the collapse of a apartment block and the unfolding dust cloud is a direct lift from Al-Queda's greatest hits. This of course is a very effective device to make something absurd genuinely mortifying but when popular entertainment starts to play on its audience's real fears by appealing to direct experience rather than the base instincts that traditionally were its bread and butter (you didn't need to have seen real footage of a shark eat a man to buy into Jaws  the premise was primal in its efficacy) then arguably a line has been crossed. There's no doubting the filmmakers exploitative glee here or the skill in which the enveloping disaster is juxtaposed with the couple's day out recorded on the same tape and occasionally 'cut' to in the gaps in recording, to produce emotional punch but there's an air of cynicism about the execution. Fun doesn't seem well, fun any more.",Cloverfield
252,johnny-08,Shocking,4,8 February 2008,"I watched ""Cloverfield"" few days ago and I have mixed emotions. Good is only the shoots taken with camera. The whole set of attacked New York is very good and actually the whole movie starts good by filming a goodbye party for Rob Hawkins, who got job in Japan. Suddenly all the party guests are terrified by something that at first looks like earthquake. But it's not. It is big monster that attacked NY. The atmosphere reminded me of the crashing of Twins and it's director dedication to that sad day. But hey people, they survived a crash of a helicopter!!! Big monster is killing everyone but our main characters are filming it (I would see them in that situation; they would run for their lives)!!! Gigantic monster managed to sneak upon our cameraman!!! That camera is made of some unbreakable material!!! We don't know nothing about this monster!!! Monster looks idiotic!!! But I'll wait for ""Cloverfield 2"" to get my questions answered.

253,lotus_chief,A good concept that ultimately fails..a letdown,6,12 February 2008,"As like most people, I was intrigued to see 'Cloverfield', mainly because I wanted to see what was causing all the havoc in the preview. After finally watching the movie, unfortunately, I still can't tell you. What does that tell you? This is one of those movies where you just happen to drop in on an event of some kind and then decide to leave at some point. Things just happen, and then it's over. There's no explanation whatsoever as to what the monster is, where it came from, how it 'works' and what exactly happened in the end. We barely see it, which is inexcusable considering we've actually WATCHED (what we COULD watch anyway) the movie at this point. I could only guess that the military bombed the city but there's no indication as to whether or not the monster was actually killed. The shaky POV camera is a cool concept; it's creative.I could really appreciate the approach they were attempting. However, at some point it must be remembered that the audience is attempting to WATCH a movie, and it was damn near impossible to do so. There was just TOO MUCH movement with the camera that most of the time you couldn't tell what was going on.and after a while the whole shakiness of it all got pretty annoying. Again, I see where they were trying to go with this, but the audience has to make some sort of sense of what's going on, or else what's the point? I don't know if Marlena suffered from 'Alien fate' and a baby monster ripped through her, or if the soldiers actually put her out of her misery after realizing she was bitten.with only one viewing I thought it was the latter, but who knows? Speaking of the characters, they were all pretty annoying; especially the 'cameraman', Hud. His job, along with cameraman, was to provide comic relief throughout; but he's not funny at all and is just a stupid idiot. We're forced to listen to him say the most asinine things and repeat them 20 times. After a while I said to myself, 'enough already, shut up and run!' I really wasn't sorry for him in the end. We get a pretty cool close-up of the monster before he does away with one of the characters, but again, we're still left in the dark as to what it is exactly. Throughout the movie we get bits and pieces of it, never getting a definitive shot of it.Another thing, how in the hell did that camera make it through the film? It should have been destroyed either by being dropped as many times as it was or, and this is much more likely, the battery dying.HELLOOOO!!!! There is no way that camera would've lasted through all of these occurrences. Also, maybe I'm behind the times, but.since when did video cameras have night vision? Anyway, the audience is left with as many questions as it had when it first saw the teaser trailer with explosions and the head of the Statue of Liberty (poor woman) flying through the air; with no movie title or nothing. HUGE letdown if you ask me. I'll admit, it all came off as pretty realistic due to the shaky camera technique, but that only led to the huge downside of the audience essentially not being able to watch the movie. I was really into it.but I was waiting for some answers and didn't get any. 'Cloverfield' had GREAT potential, but fails in the end.6/10",Cloverfield

255,Gunn,Well Done! A Great Film!,9,6 January 2009,"I got tired of perusing the negative reviews so I guess I don't understand what most of these people expected of this movie. By the time I first saw it I knew, from previews and reviews, what to expect. My expectations weren't extremely high so I was really taken in by this excellent film. This is a director's film, and Matt Reeves really delivered. He created a sense of confusion, claustrophobia, panic and excitement in a clever, creative way. The cast created believable characters and a sense of reality. The comments that there was no character development are ridiculous as how do you develop character in a chaotic situation in an 80 minute, real-time film? I'd say the cast did a fine job of character development in a most limited time frame. What do you want, their entire lineage and biography? They showed they cared for each other. What a weak criticism. I should give a tip of the hat to the FX people for a job well done. I actually felt like New York was being destroyed by some strange other-worldly force and I think that was the film's goal. Well done!",Cloverfield
256,vailsy,"highly enjoyable, but could have been even better",8,18 January 2008,"the whole first person effect for this film really makes it a lot more adrenalin thumping. i also really liked how the monster is out of view most of the time as it really added to the suspense feel and gave me a better feel about how immense the monster was just a pity about the actual storyline parts. while it was believable that a single person would return for a loved one even under the most perilous of circumstances, the chances that a whole bunch of other people would overcome the instinct to preserve their own lives and tag along, for me stretched the believability somewhat. even a monster movie needs to be structured in a believable wayi also felt the edit at the end was not so good. a film like this needs to go out on a big bang rather than a soppy whimper. BIG SPOILER *and after our cameraman gets chomped* we have to then wonder if extra movie time is going to enhance the film or not. for me the end came at the wrong moment overall though, the monster was great (not sure about the mini ones though) and i enjoyed the film a lot. it was far better than 'the host' for example, a very similar Korean movie which surely must have influenced Cloverfieldthe sound and effects in the film are absolutely first rate. and somehow the space that the monster occupies/destroys seems very real. the sound system at the theatre where i watched it was poor but when the monster smashed things it still sounded very cool, and as well as the heavy thumps you could almost hear the dust grains settling afterwardsi wasn't aware of the various websites and blogs that support the movie until after, so i've been enjoying those. i recommend everyone takes a look as it really gives the movie a heightened level of believability and depth when you read about the Japanese corporation behind it all, Tagruato, Slusho and the hints that the monster was awoken and seemingly chased by the military before it made it to Manhattanoverall a really brilliant film that has stayed with me for some time after viewing it, but it could have been even better imo had the actions of some of the central characters been a little more believable, and if they'd left the smaller critters out of the picture!",Cloverfield
257,mirwais-orbit,An excellent low budget movie!,9,18 June 2008,"For the first time I saw the trailer I was horrified with the idea. Seeing the head of Statue Of Liberty falling in front of the camera really shocked me a lot, not for being the head of the main icon of the USA, but yes for its crude feeling.When The Blair Witch Project came out people realized that a lot of other ""projects"" using the same kind of narrative would pop everywhere from that on, but it never really happened, and Cloverfield is the first excellent movie to follow The Blair Witch by an own original way.J.J. Abrams is a great creator and producer, and Cloverfield is something to make him proud of his success because he used a very low budget (25mil) to produce something intense in a so high level that Spielberg should feel ashame.I don't have anything bad to talk about this movie. The action and all that suspense flows naturally, and the characters are really doing what people would surely do in real life (with exception of ""saving the camera above all of things""). J.J. Abrams together with the director created something really interesting that gives freedom for mistakes, continuity errors, plot holes... resulting in something intelligent and brilliant.",Cloverfield
258,bayardhiler,Something Has Definitely Found Us..........,10,7 October 2013,"And once the movie gets rolling, we really wish it hadn't! ""Cloverfield"" is one of the rare cases in which the movie lives up to the hype. I remember when this was being advertised and how little the movie makers revealed in the trailers. However, for whatever reason, I didn't get to see this brilliant film until now(pretty sad, I know). But luckily I was able to fix all of that just now and can honestly say I'm a better movie lover because of it. Everything starts out innocent and normal enough with a group of friends throwing a surprise going away party for their other friend when IT arrives and as soon as it does, all hell breaks lose. Feel the tension as our heroes try to find a messing a friend while battling the ever growing chaos caused by the destruction of the visitor and the breakdown of all law and order. What is this visitor? Well, let's just say that it isn't looking to make friends, that's for sure! What makes the film stand out above everything else is the chilling realism that the filmmakers are able to incorporate into the movie, from the realistic shaking of the camera to the excellent performances of all the actors involved. The more down to the wire things get, the faster and faster our hearts beat. I wish I could say more but this is really one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better (and more bone chilling) it will be.

Acting isn't the greatest, but it's convincing, and while the characters themselves weren't great, it's nothing I'd consider a huge detractor of the film.What I like the best about this movie is that it actually comes off as a convincing setup for what an actual alien attack would be like, if it were to happen. Our main characters are a bit reckless, but looking past that, I enjoyed this one. A worthy effort.",Cloverfield
260,daggersineyes,Don't be fooled by high rating,4,7 February 2014,"This is NOT a good movie. It has a terrible plot, awful characters that you couldn't give a toss about, wooden acting of the ""scream and run"" variety, takes an interminable 30 mins to get going (said 30 mins taken up with incredibly boring scenes from a farewell party for upwardly mobile brats - out of frustration I fast forwarded to the good bits) and has an annoying shaky cam for the entire duration. The camera wielder makes things worse by being whiny and yelling inanely throughout the movie. It was an enormous relief when he finally snuffed it. Nothing in the movie made sense especially not the gang of idiots charging around a city in the middle of an intergalactic war and not taking the many opportunities to get out. And last but not least, the ending. Seriously bad & totally predictable. There were so many plot holes in this thing it resembled swiss cheese. I wont go into them all, I notice some other reviewers have covered some. Suffice to say, there are dozens more of them. Nothing is explained about the sudden arrival of the monster either. No build up to it or context at all. This leaves the whole movie without much of a foundation. There was nothing here that was original, fresh, unexpected or interesting apart from.... THE SPECIAL EFFECTS which were reasonably good. All of my points are for that and that alone. If only this had been more about the monster and less about the use of terrible gimmicky camera and sappy half-baked love plots. Watch The Host instead, it has heart and soul as well as a brilliant story and awesome effects. Or even The Bay which, tho not as good as The Host, has a far superior plot, engaging characterisations and better acting than Cloverfield. The Bay is so tightly constructed you are pretty much convinced it actually happened. You'd be hard-pressed to find a plot hole & the back story is brilliantly conceived. But more importantly the directors etc had a MILLION TIMES better grasp on how to use the ""found footage"" concept to it's best advantage to draw the viewer into the ""reality"" instead of annoying the cr*p out of & alienating them.",Cloverfield

Going out onto the street, the head of The Statue Of Liberty crashes down and in the distance a glimpse of a creature is seen. Rob and some friends heads into the chaos to find Beth, who he's in love with, as she's trapped and hurt in the city. all the while recording everything on digital camera.....The actors are mainly unknown, which is a good thing as it keeps you wondering who will survive, and how many as the monster and the military battle it out on the streets. The script is okay, but most of the lines are of the 'OH MY GOD' variety or screaming at some points. The actors do enough to convince with their performances being scared and on occasion funny.The start of the movie, during the party is long enough to introduce the characters and how they relate to each other. This of course, means that when the destruction occurs you do care who is going to live or die.The director Matt Reeves does well not only in keeping the story moving, but also in the decision to only show glimpses of the monster. This makes it more frightening. There are a couple of moments from a story point of view where the director has obviously set up a scare to happen, but on the whole it's done wellThe appearance of the monster is never explained, which is good. Most movies of this nature, such as Godzilla tend to explain the origin on the monster, but here it simply shows up and chaos reigns! The effects are impressive. The scenes of devastation in New York are stunning, and the creature effects are pretty good, both the huge creature, and also it's 'offspring'.There are some good shocks through-out the movie, the stand-out scene being a tunnel attack from the 'offspring'.But.... there are flaws.The story is very similar (guy looking for girl in a city in chaos) to an 80's movie Miracle Mile, right down to the downbeat ending.The idea of the movie being showing from the point of view from video being recorded isn't new. Movies such as The Blair Witch Project and Diary Of The Dead have used the same point of view, but to be fair the footage shot is impressive.The movie is only around 90 minutes long. As a result, things are kept tight, and also believable with regard to the battery of the camera. A longer movie, might have had battery problems with the cameras!!As a monster movie it's great.

Cloverfield is a brilliant experiment and the lack of monster movies in this day and age only added to my interest in seeing this film. The end result is a mixed feeling, mind you. Poor Hud can't film worth squat and many scenes have you scratching your head, wondering what's going on. On top of that, the story is a little too flaky. After getting a single call from your lady friend, you decide to go to the main battleground of where the monster is to get her? She doesn't even send texts to keep in touch! Nevermind that a couple of the characters are mere acquaintances that don't have a heck of a lot in common with the main characters.But Cloverfield is an interesting movie. Seeing the perspective of the monster and the little bugs it shakes out that attack and bite people, is a truly terrifying experience which makes Cloverfield more closer in line with the horror genre than other giant monster movies like King Kong or Godzilla. In Cloverfield, no one really has a happy ending, which could include you if you're not prepared for shaky camcorder antics again, but the film holds its own well enough to enjoy the end of New York as we know it.",Cloverfield
265,arthera09,unlike anything i have seen before,9,31 January 2008,"I loved this movie. It was one of the most intense films I have ever seen in the theater. I loved the look. It was nice to see movie do something new (even if it has been done before). The fact that this was a monster movie and that the story line was nothing new and it still felt so fresh and unlike anything I have ever seen before made this movie so enjoyable. The only reason it does not get a 10 is because of a major flaw in writing. The fact that the little clips were spliced in only would have happened if Hud fast forward every once in a while, which does not make a lot sense. Maybe he was stopping and watching what he just recorded and on his way back he went to far, but it happened at too perfect of times and too often. Also the fact that he filmed things when no sane human being would have and turned off the camera at weird times made it seem a little inconsistent. I am not sure how they did it (maybe it was with the little clips of the past), but I really got to care about the characters. The most defining moment of the movie was when the mom called. I really felt it and it really made it feel like the hardest thing he had to do that night. The decision to go get Beth was easy, but answering that phone had to be the hardest thing to do. I like how we got little to no closure about what happened at the end of the movie and I almost wish that they decide to leave the movie as it is. I was excited by the hype and I was not let down at all. I might even go see this movie again in the theater.

TBWP is or was so over hyped and overrated, its pathetic.Okay, what really ticked me off was the preview looked great. I did not see it in the theater, which is a plus. I and my mother waited to watch the DVD, which was bad idea. Started all shaky, and we were like ""what the crap is this"". We continued to watch and still shaky camera. It never stopped once. Holy Mary F***** God and Christ. Could not tell what was going on. Monsters you can't see. Someone talking you can't see.Characters running from something you can't see. Can you say boring? Yes, I can. This reminded me how much The Blair Witch Project sucked. I am one of the people that thinks the sequel to The Blair Witch Project was better. At least normal camera is done right. This shaky camera crap can be done, just give the camera to an infant and strap them in front of an actor, and you got the same crap. It is stupid.This is just as annoying as the TV broadcasters putting reality shows on TV. Man nothing is getting done right anymore. No original movies or TV shows anymore.

I have to admit, once I got through the first 20 minutes of the film, it moved pretty well. The dialog was interesting and the actors played their parts well. Since the entire film is comprised of ""recovered classified footage"", the film is not of the quality you would expect from a big budget production. But the story is both plausible (except for the creature, which is never fully identified) and real. How would you react to that level of chaos and panic? This is an interesting character study which looks for the best in the participants, who are willing to sacrifice their lives to save another. While certainly not a huge collectible for the mainstream, I think this will be a favorite of lovers of the Blair Witch Project and Apollo 18. Rated PG-13 for terror, violence and disturbing images, I think this is one time you should heed the warning and watch this one after the little ones are asleep.",Cloverfield
269,Ozzy2000,A double jointed Godzilla with a camel head,1,17 January 2008,"This shockingly stupid horror cum science fiction movie begins from the point of view of a classified video tape found in Central park. The film begins with the video taping of a young couples day out that is over recording during a party in which the same couple confront problems in there relationship. As the party and the relationship saga drag on there is an almighty explosion in the centre of town that of course is mid Manhattan. From there the couple and there friends are caught up in mayhem that ensues as the USA military engage this giant double jointed beast with the face of a camel and bubblegum balloon ears and a large dinosaur tale. The couples become separated but join up again. In the mean time, the Big Monster is tearing down the city and spewing a little creatures probably its offspring that look like nasty one-meter high frenetic crabs. These crabs appear easy to kill but the fully-grown one is proving to be a match for the US military.The whole film is shot in hand held cinema Veritas style like a real home video account to give more realism. Unfortunately, an hour half of this shooting style is very jerky and will take you close to having a headache. It is very tedious but does have that highly dramatic effect. Some one mentioned that there was a similarity with Blair Witch project but they obviously meant the jerky cinematographic shooting style as there is no other similarity.The camel headed monster had a similar body of those creatures in ""Pitch Black"" but a hundred times bigger.A very silly film in which the hand held camera stuff was really over done even though some of the CGI scenes were stunning.Worth a watch but do not forget your favorite headache remedy pills.",Cloverfield

And what a monster, a really silly CG thing that would have, on its own, made me laugh, had I not been already angry plotting the destruction of every person responsible for this load of doo-doo. Nor, since we hate the characters so much can we possibly care what the monster does.The movie-maker said in a DVD interview that when something goes wrong in real life, as in if a real monster attacked, that this is the sort of record there would be of it, jerky, limited. This is of course correct. (We know that from raw home video of 9/11) But that's real life. In movies or fiction, we want a plot, coherence, a through-story, and heroes who are heroic and occasionally say a full grammatical sentence with actual content. We want filmmakers to buy a tripod and hire actual actors, write a script, y'know, little things like that. We don't want to pay actual real money to see a simulacrum of what panicked people who don't know how to even hold a camera might do. We actually expect professionals to make a movie, that's what the industry is about, and if this is the future of it, I'll stick to reading books, thank you very much.What movie the people who rated this highly saw, I cannot tell you.

That's pretty much all the movie has going for it plot wise. So not only have the writers gone on strike (if most of the dialogue in this film wasn't improvised, I'll eat my hat) but apparently the film crews have too because this is all from the pov of a hand-held camera used by either a Blair Witch fan or a monkey in a washing machine.I liked the trailer for this film because it was all so unexpected. I had hoped they wouldn't do the entirety of this film that way because it would've been nothing short of torture. But they did, and the second half of it was. If they were going to do it all from first person, it would have been better to have say, a news camera operator helm the audience's viewpoint. I was struggling to avoid illness by the end. Are we sure Michael Bay had no involvement in this movie? Boneheaded plots and cameras on steroids are his speciality. Even my friends were looking up at the ceiling or trying other tricks to avoid motion sickness. One scene involves a flashing light that seemed bound to invoke seizures.The film has a few scares up it's sleeve, and for the first time in forever I actually put my arms up to shield me from on screen terror. But the film as a whole, is a turd. The characters are mostly dumb or weak. There are a few cool and scary moments but when when the film's only original card to play is the very thing that also makes it a grueling process to watch, where's the fun? There's no resolution or questions or ideas explored, just a nauseatingly shot Godzilla movie. If you can tolerate it, and that's your thing, go ahead. I did not enjoy it. D",Cloverfield
272,Jonathon_Natsis,Accidental lovechild of Godzilla and the Blair Witch,8,2 February 2011,"On the back of one of the most intricate viral marketing campaigns of all-time, Matt Reeves directs the contemporary monster movie Cloverfield, one for the 'YouTube generation', as some have described it. Generating immense hype through the posting of ambiguous images on the film's own spin-off website (1-18-08.com), it almost felt as if Cloverfield had grabbed the entire internet population by the throat, and forced it to uncover the mystery of what exactly has caused so much unexplainable damage to Manhattan. Ultimately, however, the exploits of those who attempted to unravel this enigma seemed more entertaining and fulfilling than the film itself.The film pits a group of beautiful, rich New Yorkers we've never heard of against a giant beast bent on destruction, its motives unclear. In fact, the secrecy surrounding the monster itself was one of the few positives of the film. We never learn where the creature is from, what disturbed it, or even what it looks like in its entirety. Positively, this gets the viewer interested and constantly wanting more (a fantastic environment for a director to work in). Unfortunately, the 'more' never comes, and we are left dissatisfied in every other department.Not only does Cloverfield end far too abruptly, but it does so without really offering any sort of climax. Now, I'm all for innovation in storytelling, and sometimes that can be achieved to great effect with a non-linear plot, but not in this instance. A film built around suspense and senseless action needs to wrap itself up accordingly. That's not just my opinion; its common- sense filmmaking. Because of the final scene, many have criticised the way Cloverfield blatantly plagiarises The Blair Witch Project.I feel this to be a rash statement. Yes, the similarities are there, but one can, in fact, see the direction Reeves has taken in ending the film this way. He tried to create something unique and unexpected, and he succeeded, but for all the wrong reasons. And unlike Blair Witch, where we feel the same sense of terror as the characters (probably because it doesn't feel like a piece of fiction), there is no effort made by the protagonists in Cloverfield to incite audience emotion; the poor acting and lacklustre screenplay keeping us from suspending our disbelief.And of course, there is the camera-work. Once again, I can appreciate the effort made to give the film a point-of-sale, but if the hand-held camera (which acts as our only window in for the entire two-hour run time) dosen't give you motion sickness by film's end, it will definitely annoy you. I fell into the latter category upon first viewing, but it must be noted that I didn't watch it on the big screen. I can only imagine the effect it would have had on people watching on a screen fifty times the size of mine, with no surrounding lighting to minimise the nauseating movement on-screen.That is precisely the type of blunder that can damage a film's reputation even before release, in both a critical and commercial sense. No film can ever be considered a critical success if its falls below the expectations generated through an advertising campaign, and this is the case with Cloverfield. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

An extremely annoying one at that.The shaky camera thing... it's been done before (countless times), but never in such an annoying fashion. The camera is dropped/stepped on several times throughout the movie, but still functions perfectly well and never sustains any internal or external damage. Not to mention that it never runs out of battery life. Lame, but that's not the point. I could look past this kind of plot holes (what plot?) if there was something more to the movie, but there isn't. There's NOTHING entertaining, or suspenseful, or even remotely likable, about this piece of garbage. Nothing. It's an insult to human intelligence, not a movie.Basically, you're just following a bunch of completely unlikeable cardboard cut-outs (I wouldn't call them 'characters', since there was zero character development) running around and acting scared. Of what? It's not clear.I was hoping to see the monster (since it was the one I was rooting for), but... no monster. You never find out what was causing the terror. All you see is people running. I mean it; there's nothing else to this movie except people running.There was no plot. In the beginning you see some lamers at a party (it takes about 20 minutes, and you're already bored out of your mind), and then, for the rest of the movie, you see people running. That's all. Yes, really.I was glad when they all died. I couldn't even tell who was who in the group, because, like I said, there was no character development at all. Just a bunch of random people running around with a camera turned on -- you mostly see their feet anyway.It's laughably pathetic and a huge disappointment. When the movie ends, you just have this huge WTF expression on your face, and you think, ""erm... is that it?""

Though I gotta say this probably beats the B movies back then. This one doesn't show the monster as much, making the suspense all the more terrifying. Then when you do see the monster, you'll see that it's an amazingly creative design, and not a typical Godzilla design.Note: (the whole movie is shot in a first-person perspective). During a going away party, a group of friends encounter a giant monster attacking New York City, in which they evacuate the place, and try to get out of New York, doing what they can to stay alive.I say this is better than most B horror films because of the unique way it's shot. The film is filmed by a guy going with the party, and you feel warped into the environment with so much commotion going on, it's uncanny. The film's ending also isn't what you expect, (you'll see). The film doesn't get slow, as there's always something going on, and the main characters are always on their feet. It begins in suspense, and it slowly but surely shows more and more of the monster, getting more and more intense. It's scary because it's huge, so how can you miss it, yet not seeing all of it just makes the environment feel all that more real. Growing attached to the characters makes it more terrifying when they die one by one.This film gave the B movie genre some balls, and I appreciate it for that. Nothing is cheesy, nothing is bad, everything is thrilling to the bone. Very decent film",Cloverfield
276,sam_smithreview,One the most entertaining cam coder found footage films of all time,8,23 April 2016,"Yes, I really believe in my headline. This was and will be one of the best found footage films you will watch, why? because it very enjoyable. Maybe, i'm a little bias and don't like the whole point of Paranormal activities, etc... this film is enjoyable from start to finish, it has its feel of realism, but never sway's into the whole ""Could this have been real?' territory. Which is great. I think I saw this twice in the cinema and bought the Blu-ray too. When 'events proceed', the camcorder style filming instills a genuine realism to events, and the films definitely feeds off the mass concern and shock at global events/terrorist attacks/disasters, and the disjointed way news feeds through. What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over.",Cloverfield

278,highwaytourist,"The film has serious flaws, but it's best scenes are terrifying",7,10 January 2015,"This movie had me on the fence. This film is shown as hand-held footage of a camera-phone found after the fact, like with ""The Blair Witch Project."" The first 15 minutes of the film are so boring, I nearly gave up on the film. But when the action starts, it takes off. Unlike most monster films, this shows an on-the-ground view from beginning to end. The hand-held camera is a truly mixed bag. On the plus side, you get a convincing ground view of what it's like to be caught in a city being attacked by a giant monster from outer space. The truth is that most people caught in the middle would have no idea what's really going on, only that the city's being destroyed and they need to run for their lives. On the down side, the camera is so shaky, it's often hard to watch. While the monster itself is nothing great, it's filmed so effectively that it scares anyway. As the lead characters risk their lives to save a semi-girlfriend who's trapped in her apartment, the fear and chaos are very real. On the down side, some characters recover from injuries far too conveniently to be believable. Then, when the end comes, it's so abrupt and leaves so many unanswered questions, it almost ruined the film for me. But by then, I'd gotten enough thrills and suspense to satisfy me.",Cloverfield
279,robotbling,"Probably the best ""Giant Monster"" movie",8,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) Back when Cloverfield was about to hit theaters, there was so much hype surrounding its imminent release that I was taken aback. I find that if I jump onto the hype train, all too often the destination is underwhelming. Disappointments are things to avoid, so I generally stay away from movies that are touted as the next big thing. It's been awhile since Cloverfield arrived on DVD and I finally gave it a shot.By now the cat's out of the bag, so I don't feel like I'm spoiling anything by laying out the premise for the film. A giant monster of unknown origins begins attacking New York, and a group of friends manages to handycam their experiences during the event. Though the film is shot in the frenetic style of The Blair Witch Project, and theaters warned moviegoers of potential motion sickness (which I usually experience), I didn't find Cloverfield to be nauseating at all. The film is short – just long enough, really – and manages to catch its breath every now and then, which also helps.The genre has certainly had its ups and downs over the years. From classics like Jurassic Park to downers like Godzilla, monster movies are hit and miss, and more often misses – but Cloverfield is damn good. The script pays respect to the genre's Japanese heritage with the main character of the film soon leaving for a job opportunity in the land of the rising sun, but this trounces Japanese canon, and virtually every other giant monster movie ever made.The characters manage to draw you in, and you'll find yourself really rooting for them. The action set pieces are all fantastic despite being fairly stock, mostly due to the incredible visual effects. I can only imagine the horror of a visual effects artist trying to matchmove the jittery camera-work in every scene – or spending weeks creating buildings that get destroyed on screen for less than 5 seconds. The hand-to-hand combat that takes place in the film matches the human prey against their cg predators convincingly, too. Monster movies are about spectacle, and this one certainly makes good on its promise. And despite the insane premise, manages to suspend your disbelief by presenting the adventure in very realistic fashion.I can only imagine how well this film must have been received in Japan. Cloverfield is the ultimate monster movie, and I would definitely recommend you check it out if you haven't already.",Cloverfield
280,Craig_McPherson,The Beast from Facestomp.com,6,18 January 2008,"Early in J.J. Abrams/Matt Reeve's Cloverfield, long before the monster goes on its city destroying rampage, I found myself secretly hoping the beast would turn each and every one of the Emo/MySpace cast into an hors d'uvre, along with 90 percent of the seat-kicking, cell phone using mouth breathers that made up the viewing audience.Never before have I so enjoyed a movie that contained so many ingredients that I absolutely loathed. Presented as found video footage retrieved from a camcorder in New York's Central Park, Cloverfield ""documents"" a gigantic beast's blitzkrieg rampage through the city from the point of view of one of the many thousands of fleeing masses typically shown as an afterthought in so many of the Godzilla movies.I absolutely detest the shaky, jerky, hand-held style of camera work Hollywood wonks seem so enamored with these days, and Cloverfield ramps this up by a factor of 100, complete with out of focus, poorly framed and lit shots  exactly the sort of stuff one would expect to see recorded by some non-professional average Joe.The movie also suffers from a cast of characters that are as unlikeable as they are unbelievably stupid in their motivations.Moments before the attack begins, as our intrepid cameraman sets out to document a farewell party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), the movie's male lead who is about to embark on a new job in Japan, we are clued into a soap-opera sub-plot involving his unrequited love for a hottie named Beth with whom he shared a lone night of hot steamy passion mere weeks earlier. The way I see it, this babe must have rocked Rob's world far more than the number the monster pulls on NYC because throughout the film, Rob, accompanied by his faithful cameraman and two friends, set out to make their way across Manhattan, directly through the creature's path, to locate Beth who called him on his cell to tell him she was trapped in her apartment.Along the way they are set upon by some nasty critters that have hitched a ride on the big brute, and which may or may not be offspring or parasites - nasty, spidery buggers who emit an unforgettably creepy sound.Insofar as the main creature itself goes, it can best be described as a variation on that multi-legged mantis-like beast featured in the arena sequence of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and the decision to reveal it in glimpses, leading up to two final extended shots, is one of the best things about this movie. Throughout I was constantly leaning one way or another, craning my neck to look around buildings, or cursing the cameraman who elected to pan away to his buddies rather than at the creature ripping through the side of a skyscraper.As movies go, Cloverfield's flaws are numerous (how is it that Rob's phone battery could die out early in the night yet the camcorder seems to never run out of juice? And how long a tape does the damn thing hold?), however what it accurately captures is not so much the rampage of a mysterious beast, but the incessant self-absorption, to the exclusion even of an otherworldly onslaught, of the MySpace crowd.",Cloverfield
281,Panterken,Intense.,8,31 January 2008,"'Cloverfield' isn't a movie you can persuade people to love. There are no real arguments as to why it was so good for me. I guess it's just an experience, either you feel the movie or you don't at all.This comparison has been done a million times but I'm going to bring it up again...it's not (at all) like The Blair Witch Project or Godzilla. A movie is more than just the main plot outline or the camera technique used. For me, Cloverfield is simply a great movie-going experience, it's best seen in the theater and in the company of people who know how to keep their mouths shut during an intense movie.The use of (relatively) unknown actors was a brilliant move, it contributed a great deal to the reality factor and the high shock/scare factor that accompanies it. The use of a home-cam isn't 100% original of course and neither is the idea for the story outline itself but does it really matter for a movie as hypnotizing as this? Some scenes had me literally on the edge of my seat, biting my nails and pulling my hair. I'm a pretty easy empathizer but still...not a great deal of movies have this extreme effect on me. This is partly the cast's credit, who all did a good to even fantastic job. Of course, a role like this is a dream for an actor, you really can go all-out (explore the extreme emotional side of your persona) in movies filled with extreme crisis-situations like this. Especially the guy who played the lead-character came off very natural to me, both during the relaxed opening scenes and the unnerving ones.You might not agree with me, but even the haters have to realize what a great breath of fresh air this movie is compared to a lot of Hollywood movies coming out recently. There have been a lot of great ones this year, I'm not complaining, but I can only think of two movies that really where special (NCFOM and this one).Finally, the question that plays in everyone's head...did it live up to the hype? In my opinion...most definitely. You may not like it but I'd strongly advise everyone to check out the movie, you may end up loving it to death...7.6/10",Cloverfield
282,teh_mode,Rip-roaringly entertaining,7,19 February 2008,"In this rip-roaring, home-movie styled monster movie a group of teenager partying for the departure of one their closest friends find themselves amid a blaze of destruction when a giant 'thing' starts ripping the city to shreds. One of the unlucky scamps happens to be filming the entire thing, and thus we get a faux-documentary much in the style of a megabucks version of The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla. Although the shaky camera and choice of the 1st person view may put off some viewers who suffer from motion sickness, Cloverfield for the most part is barnstorming entertainment, fully exploiting the resources available to it. The idea to shoot entirely from some poor sap's camera is not entirely original, dating back to the Italian cannibal movies of the early 80s. But it does make for an interesting take on the monster movie.",Cloverfield
283,dtb,"Freshest, Scariest Horror Film in Years, Critics Be Damned!",10,20 January 2008,"Oh. MY. GOD!!! CLOVERFIELD has everything: terror, laughs, pathos, sympathetic characters, a kick-ass Giger-like giant monster covered with what turns out to be even more destructive parasites, and location filming in NYC (and L.A., I'm told) with jaw-dropping F/X and one of the most chillingly apocalyptic endings since Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. What's not to love, at least for us creature feature fans? CLOVERFIELD plays like GODZILLA MEETS THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT sprinkled with a pinch of MIRACLE MILE, except that I found CLOVERFIELD's twentysomething protagonists far more sympathetic than THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's self-centered overgrown brats. (The whole cast is likable, but Lizzy Caplan stands out as Marlena, who had the bad luck to be at the wrong party at the wrong time, waiting for friends to meet up with her.) The film cleverly presents its harrowing story as found footage taken from a camcorder discovered by the military in ""the area formerly known as Central Park."" The camcorder in question is wielded mostly by affable dimbulb Hud (T.J. Miller) at a farewell party thrown for his pal Rob (Michael Stahl-David) before he leaves to take a job in Japan (oh, the irony! :-)). The first 20 minutes or so play like one of those indie comedies about young adults getting their bearings. It's all fun and games until the Statue of Liberty's head crashes into midtown Manhattan. :-) Soon, Hud finds himself documenting Manhattan's destruction (""People are gonna want to know how it went down!"") as he, Rob and others make their way across what's left of the collapsing, chaotic city to try to rescue Beth (Odette Yustman), the girl Rob loves, after hearing her tearful cell phone message that she's trapped under debris in her family's posh Columbus Circle apartment building. I know, being trapped in a posh apartment doesn't sound so bad, but trust me, Beth's upscale address doesn't seem so inviting by the time our beleaguered heroes reach her.The found-footage gimmick is used especially well. Seeing the events through the eyes of Hud and his roving camcorder strips everything down to its barest, scariest essentials in the movie's fleet-footed 84-minute running time. No scientists step in to explain the origins of the vicious beasts; the closest we get to an explanation are a few terse words from military personnel and glimpses of TVs in stores (often while said stores are being looted) showing news updates, talking about tankers being capsized and such. Since Hud has accidentally been recording over a tape of Rob and Beth spending a day on Coney Island, the little bits we occasionally see of the couple in happier days sneak in some backstory, as well as providing CLOVERFIELD with one of the most ironic-in-context last lines since the late Ulrich Mühe's ""It's for me"" at the end of THE LIVES OF OTHERS.I must say I don't understand all these movie critics who've blasted CLOVERFIELD for its film-making style (though Richard Roeper and the Chicago Tribune critic filling in for Roger Ebert loved it, and rightly so) and for its alleged insensitivity and exploitation due to the plot's parallels to the horrific events of September 11th, 2001. My family and I, born and raised in New York, still lived and worked in NYC on 9/11. While we were lucky enough not to have lost any friends or loved ones in the terrorist attacks, I can tell you the makers of CLOVERFIELD did a splendid job of capturing the feel of a disaster-stricken city and its terrified but determined citizens. People need to get a little perspective, if you ask me. For heaven's sake, Japanese filmmakers have spent decades responding to the destruction their country endured during World War II by making Godzilla movies and related creature features. With nearly 7 years having passed since 9/11, why shouldn't American filmmakers like CLOVERFIELD producer J.J. Abrams, writer Drew Goddard, and director Matt Reeves make a horror movie in which New York City is decimated by a giant monster who makes Godzilla look like a sweetheart, with nightmarish, surreal destruction and loss of life that outdoes even the horror of the World Trade Center attacks? I mean, at least in real life, the entire borough of Manhattan and its people weren't destroyed. In the meantime, those of you reading this who haven't seen CLOVERFIELD yet should drop everything and go see it now, now, NOW!!! ...Migraine and Motion-Sickness Sufferer Alert... It's been said that for some sensitive moviegoers, the deliberately shaky camera-work in certain scenes caused queasiness. To be fair, I can understand why. For me personally, the combination of the Shaky-Cam and the strobe-like effect of the malfunctioning lights in Beth's ruined hallway during the Columbus Circle rescue scene kept threatening to trigger my migraines. However, I don't consider that to be a flaw in the movie so much as a flaw in my brain. :-) Nevertheless, the Shaky-Cam cinematography is appropriate for the film's premise, so hey, caveat emptor! ...End Migraine and Motion-Sickness Sufferer Alert...",Cloverfield
284,adrongardner,Wow. That one sucked.,3,21 January 2008,"Yeah it has been awhile since we've had a good monster movie. Going into this one, I wanted to be free of spoilers, early reviews, or theories on the marketing campaign. So I went in with some general interest and hope. I'm even a bona-fide JJ Abrahms fan, I love LOST, nonsense conspiracies and all. Well, with this in mind, I saw Cloverfield. And I'm quite certain, the movie was absolute trash. Here's why.Did I get scared? Nope. Not once. Not from the slim glimpses of the monster. Not from the little Starship Troopers creatures. Not from any of the sounds.Did I laugh? YES. There are some good one liners from our humble camera man.The shocks were few and weak. The part when the girl who was bit eventually spattered was good, but muted and did little to liven any tension. I just never felt any excitement or adrenaline. Was the movie well made? No. The monster was generic looking and I think the word Generic fits most of the descriptions of the film itself. Its all just ""meh."" Nothing more.The story was lame. Basically from what I remember, they cooked up some saved by the bell love story about some twenty-something trapped in a mega buck high-rise apartment overlooking central park. Who cares about these rich kids and their little parties? I'm sorry, but in a city like New York, there are a billion more harrowing stories to tell than a bunch of 90210 kids and their love triangle dramas.OK on this hand-held camcorder business, I'm going on record on writing how stupid it is. I don't think you can effectively tell a feature length story visually or otherwise with the frame bouncing around like crazy for most of the time. This just doesn't work. Instead of creating anticipation or mystery, all I do is get mad from motion sickness and the fact I have nothing to focus on as an audience member. There is no thread for me to latch on to. This is simple and it is by design, I understand that. The other side of this is the filmmakers are, in fact, providing little for the audience in the first place. Its a very cheap way to make a film, which this film clearly was.There just isn't much here to watch folks, both literally or figuratively. The 1 hour 20 minute or so running time is a good reflection of this though the movie felt like it was a 3 hour marathon of nonsense. I've never been a group mentality person, but it says something when the majority audience in the theater screams, ""SUCKED!"" when the credits hit. Cloverfield is a movie that should have stayed true to its roots on how it was made and gone direct to video. My advice to the writers? Kill off all the kids early, let the aliens film the rest. This one was a dud. And seeing the splash in the ocean at the end, I'm sure there will be sequels on the way. Perhaps the end is near, after all. God have mercy on us all.",Cloverfield
285,ilikeimdb,It's terrific FX but not compelling (no serious spoilers),7,19 April 2019,"So, I got to tell 'ya here: This is a monster movie. Does that qualify as a spoiler? I guess it must because the movie starts with a vacuous yuppie going away party with just about the least interesting (though still handsome / pretty) set of Millennials ever... And suddenly they're thrust into a run-for-your-life disaster movie staring huge robots that can transform themselves into cars and such and there's a very distracting babe...oh wait, wrong movie but nearly the same idea. There's random, needless, and apolitical destruction everywhere and the Millennials are on the run with only one slightly guilty (and enormously dumb) rescue operation underway. Hey: They're the only ones left running around, practically, in a city of zillions. Why the seven stars: I loved the FX. Wow. It's 2008 and it looks real, filmed in cinema verité. Impressive! You could easily imagine yourself right there (but, unfortunately, with a less pretty girl friend or less handsome bf, but who's counting). Other than moderately irrational behavior by the protagonist, the other actions are real in context (btw, there's no way this could have happened in LA because everyone would be giving the monster a shoulder shrug and a kumbaya and, besides, the monster would have been stuck on the 405 FOR HOURS ON END).

286,MetalGeek,Much Better Than Expected!,7,12 June 2008,"When ""Cloverfield"" was released earlier this year, much whoop-de-doo was made about the fact that in the film, the viewers are supposedly watching footage of a monster attack on New York City, shot with a hand-held video camera by one of the characters. This obviously brought about comparisons like ""It's Godzilla meets Blair Witch!"" Unfortunately, I absolutely HATED ""Blair Witch"" so that was not a major selling point for me. I do love me a good giant monster story though, so when the film became available thru my cable system's On Demand selection I decided to take the plunge and see what all the fuss was about, and ended up being pleasantly surprised. You know how in EVERY Godzilla-style ""giant monster"" film, there's always at least one scene of hundreds of citizens running panic stricken through the streets, pointing up at the creature and screaming? ""Cloverfield"" is basically a ""Godzilla"" story told from the viewpoint of a few of those people. As the film opens we find ourselves in the apartment of Rob Hawkins, a twentysomething who's about to depart to take a new job in Japan. His friends have gathered for a surprise farewell party and one of those friends, ""Hud,"" is given a video camera and asked to walk around gathering ""testimonials"" and farewell messages to Rob from everyone in the room. Even though he doesn't really want to, Hud begrudgingly begins his recording, and then a huge explosion suddenly rocks the building. From there it's ""on,"" as the characters rush outside just as New York City descends into chaos. Some sort of huge creature is rampaging through Manhattan and we follow Hud, Rob, and several of their friends as they try to make it out of the city for the rest of the film. Would it violate spoiler rules to say that some characters make it, most don't, and it's a white knuckle ride all the way? Though I expected the shaky, ""hand held"" camera work to be distracting, I honestly didn't even notice it anymore after the you-know-what hit the fan. There have been complaints on this very board about the relatively short run time (just under 90 minutes) of ""Cloverfield"" and that most viewers will still have un-answered questions at the end of the movie, (just where DID this critter come from anyway? Outer space? The Ocean? What happened to Rob and his girl after the camera went off?)but none of this mattered to me. I found it fast moving, occasionally heart breaking, and exciting, and it's something I would probably watch again.",Cloverfield
287,jaddison383,An Intense Experience...,7,20 January 2008,"Cloverfield is probably one of the greatest examples of a concept movie ever made. And by that I mean it is a great concept movie as well. It's the story of a giant monster attacking New York City seen through a hand-held camera. We follow a small group of 20-somethings as they try to escape from the horror that is unfolding around them, and we get pretty close to experiencing it with them.Frenetic, intense scenes is the name of the game here. The hand-held camera is a clever twist that makes this visually exhausting film unique. Even at it's very short length, the film almost runs too long- you feel very tired by the time the credits roll.JJ Abrams was clever in his use of little to unknown actors, and they all do a good job making it seem pretty natural. The best of these is Lizzy Caplan in a nice supporting turn. The special effects are all fantastic and extremely believable and SCARY, another plus to this film. Most of the plot works well, though a romantic side-plot for the lead character feels forced at times.

This film will can cause motion sickness similar to that of a roller coaster ride!"" I have to admit, I thought at first the theater must be kidding, but when I ended-up getting Sea Sick, the warning was a gross under statement!The acting was so bad that you end-up caring absolutely nothing for anyone in this pathetic film!

The beginning of the story reminded me of a dull soap opera until the monster strikes, then it reminded me of a campy, Made-in-Japan, 1950's style, monster movie!

These events are all captured on film as those who survive seek to remain alive.Cloverfield has obvious parallels to 'Godzilla'. However, what makes Cloverfield rather startling is its contemporary resonance with the terror attacks of this century. As one would of surmised, the whole film is through the lens of a camcorder, which is a clever device to really convey the fear of the unknown to the audience and indeed those actually their. This has an obvious implausibility in that it is unrealistic that any person would willingly hold a camcorder throughout the ordeal but if you can forget this, its rather thrilling. The special effects are of the highest quality and the acting is really well-delivered. The running time is perfect, and it never lags.

I thought, OK that sounds original.While you could compare it to something such as godzilla or other monster films, this is quite an intriguing film because the first twenty minutes or so everything seems so normal that you get drawn more into the narrative and then you get the unexpected shaking with an earthquake and a whole lot of other events that are never explained to us the reason for its cause, so the characters are just as confused as us.This is taken with the effect of the shaky cam corder capturing the events, much like the Blair Witch Project and it is highly effective in this case. It has the effect of not being too predictable, you don't know what is going to happen and the atmosphere feels fearful due to this.To explain the plot in the beginning is kind of irrelevant as it is simply just a celebration for a farewell party for a guy who is going to work in Japan. After that, you almost forget the beginning scenes once all the mayhem comes in.As for the monster, the good thing is that they only show bits of it now and then and it isn't until later that you see the full image of it. This is one of those movies where you work things out for yourself and nothing is really explained properly but this is an added bonus to the cam corder approach to film as it feels more authentic as though this could have been something that happened to you, and you simply documented it and have no idea what the hell is going on around you.I guess you can say this has been done before with the cam corder technique, and the characters are simply one dimensional, but this is a survival story so it really isn't necessary.I had a great time with this though it does make me think of something: if you were in these terrible situations, wouldn't you just be inclined to run and let go of your cam corder? I would be more concerned for my personal safety rather than trying to record everything. But I guess you would want to show someone one day what you went through, so I guess it makes sense.",Cloverfield
298,wisemantonofski,Redefining the Found-Footage Genre,7,13 September 2019,"Gritty, dirty and stylistic, it plays on very dark and painful imagery of real-world catastrophe through the lens of forced perspective to build a truly immersive and tense experience. Cleverly juxtaposing scenes of destruction against more hopeful and positive memories through the use of the camera's old recordings, Cloverfield is able to invest its audience into the lives and character of its cast in very short time which puts us firmly on their side, while the exceptional sound design and sparing use of effects make this feel more like a VR experience than a movie.",Cloverfield
299,jamhorner,Blows Godzilla Out of the Water,10,18 January 2008,"I just want to state before I review this movie, I am a huge Cloverhead and I followed the viral marketing for a little more than half a year and was constantly tormented by Matt Reeves and J.J., however, this movie, with all the hype and intensity that was raved about, delivered one heck of a blow to the ""monster"" genre. In fact, I was so stunned and shocked about the movie and how vastly different it was then what I originally thought it would be. One would to describe this movie would be: WHOA!!!! It was better than Godzilla, better than Them and better than Beast from 10,000 Fathoms and it really lived up to the hype from the Internet. Heck, we all know how incredible and amazing the viral marketing was, so I will bore you with those details.So lets get to it; first off is the acting, if it weren't for the performances and the emotions that where displayed in this movie, the film would have been really bad and just another cheap monster flick. The acting seemed so real and intense, there some times where you could feel for what the actors and actresses had to go through and there were points were you could cry and say ""Oh my god."" Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas and Michael Stahl-David were all amazing and they really did a fantastic job. Even Mike Vogal and T.J. Miller (Hud) all acted like real people. There were points were I thought I was watching a real account of real people struggling to survive. There performances gave me the chills, they were just really, really good acting.This is a two-part paragraph highlighting the scares and suspense. For a PG-13, the scares were awesome. I will admit there were points where I jumped out of my seat or I would fly back into my chair, especially in the subway tunnel. The scares were not only creature features or mini-monster attacks, but also the jets the fly by out of nowhere, or the distant rumbles and the roar, the little things. But what makes the scares to prime is also the suspense that is in this movie. Because it is from the POV of a camcorder, held by Hud, you are literally right there when the army attacks the monster or when the monster walks by, you ARE right there and you can practically hear and feel it coming. The explosions, the running, the gunfire, the jets and helicopters are all right in your face it feels like you part of the movie. It was really intense both in a frightening way and in a super suspense way. The way they created NY to look like all heck broke loose was outstanding, the rubble on the floor and the smoke everywhere, however, this movie might get dogged for some scenes that looked really close to the 9/11 aftermath. However, J.J. said that the monster was a metaphor for what our country has faced much like how Godzilla was a metaphor for that Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks.As for the little things in this movie, they were pretty great also. Hud adds great humor and personality to this film, just when things are starting to get bad and look horrid, he makes some great jokes and his personality is laughable. The whole ""handycam"" feel they went for worked, it was shaky, the iris did flux a bit, it opened up when pointed at a bright object, there were time and dates on some of the footage, there were random cut to the previous day and there were even some fuzziness to the picture. There was a great Spongebob reference in the movie that I loved, considering that the monster came from the ocean. It's little things like this that made the movie all worth watching too, I mean, the scares and the acting fill up the majority of this movie but the little things fill in the nook and crannies of the pie chart.I would strongly recommend that you see this in a theater because the noise, explosions and monster attacks just don't work on home entertainment, for those who are thinking about buying the DVD. Please, see it in the theater because it won't be disappointing, honest it won't. However, there are a few things that I want to add before you see it. STAY TILL THE VERY END OF THE MOVIE, when the credits are done rolling, you'll be amazed by what it heard and be prepared for a slight case of motion sickness. But this is one movie that will blow any other monster movie out of the water.",Cloverfield
300,fearfulofspiders,"Good Monster Flick, Depending on Expectations...",7,1 September 2008,"There's not much to comment on about the film, this is one that the majority of people will either like or hate, based on the expectations one has.The acting is all well done, though the cast is full of unknowns and some are too pretty.The directing is very well done, though the monster is rarely seen and the film could've been slightly longer with more plot devices utilized into it, instead of situations that are basically out of every other monster flick.The shaky-cam is beyond annoying after a while. I didn't get the usual motion sickness and puke all over the person sitting in front of me. Nope. Instead, my eyes just got incredibly screwed up for a couple days, and I suffered a little dizziness. There's moments when the camera settles down, but it's so brief that it made me want more. If there is a sequel and it is done with the same techniques, please learn that not everyone has nerves like a 10.5 earthquake is going through them, some actually know how to keep steady when action is in front of us.The music... there's hardly any music. Except for the nauseous background music our protagonists listen to, and the overture by Giacchino during the end credits.The writing here is pretty original considering the genre this film is in. The comedy works well, mainly with comments from the cameraman. There's not much blood -- though a girl does explode, people are slammed with tails, and some are lifted into the monster's own jaws.Overall, Cloverfield was a pretty good movie. It met all my expectations, and it was pretty satisfying -- it provided some nice chatting at school the next week.Worth a rent, and maybe a buy. Really is worth 3 1/2 stars.**Be sure to keep your eyes close to the screen to see the object that falls from the sky at the end of the film during the Coney Island footage.",Cloverfield
301,blackburnj-1,Top notch entertainment,8,15 May 2008,"There are event movies which are big by their nature and there are event movies that whip up hysteria and become big. Quite often, event movies don't live up to their hype. ""Cloverfield"" is one of the biggest examples of an event movie that only has itself to blame if it fails to live up to its expectations as it created its own hysteria. Fortunately, for the filmmakers as much as anyone else, this is magnificent, popcorn-entertainment which is cinema spectacle at its very best.Having whipped up a burden of expectation with one of the most intriguing, effective and inventive marketing campaigns for many years, ""Cloverfield"" then does more to build up the tension by starting off with some of the most annoying characters for many years. They are tedious, basically because they have perfectly normal, boring problems (all of which are encapsulated in an opening party sequence that sets up the camcorder gimmick as well) and they talk like so: ""Dude, he's, like, your main dude and, I love you man, but you blew her off, and man, you're going to Japan and she's crazy about you bro, like, right now"". So, after twenty minutes of this you're more than happy for the violence and gratuitous destruction to begin. And when it begins, it's clear: this was worth the wait.Like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"", this film destroys big landmarks like there's no tomorrow. From the destruction of the Statue of Liberty to the complete end of Manhattan, director Matt Reeves pulls no punches. There are explosions, violent deaths, all of your usual disaster movie bread and butter moments, but with a twist. For large portions of the film you see very little. This is the first use of ambiguity in a film that gorges on uncertainty and it works superbly. The near misses and the small glimpses grip you and terrify you. This is due to the camcorder style cinematography which, whilst it has apparently caused motion, is particularly well done. Not quite being able to see what you would normally be given freely is enticing. It is excellent and effective film-making, at once bombastic by nature of the plot but restrained by nature of the direction. Imagine how dull this would have been if it had been directed by Michael Bay.There is more than simple big wham-bam-thank-you-ma'm moments. There is a claustrophobic sequence in a tunnel, which provides thrills and chills. The characters' suffering makes them easy to follow and, whilst you don't love them, you do care for them. The demise of one character behind a screen is bleak and has devastating punch.But the major strength of this film is simple. It is its ambiguity. We never have a scientist (probably called P.L. O'Texplanation) turning up telling us what the monster is or where it came from or the answers to any of the film's many other questions. We do get the inevitable payoff, but it gives us precisely zero answers. We don't, on the other hand, ever really find out the fate of most of our characters. It all builds up a web of questions, and few, if any, answers.Which means you go away wanting more, wondering and with you imagination running wild. This is not a great film, just a terrific, thrilling and terrifying experience that will last long after you leave the cinema.",Cloverfield
302,robert-259-28954,Not your typical scifi movie.,8,10 June 2017,"A DIFFERENT kind of scifi/thriller, with a different kind of title (still haven't figured out that one, though). I can see why this film engendered so many negative reviews, but I can also understand why. This picture IS NOT your typical movie, in that it attempts to portray real time events with absolute realism, instead of following the time-honored script of a definitive beginning, middle, and end, with a well-defined purpose of meaning. It is also totally shot 100% HAND HELD, so it has the frantic, authentic feel of an actual homemade video movie, which certainly fulfilled that aspect. And the special effects are totally world class, on a par with the best CGI big budget films ever made. The utter realism of this picture is worthy of note. With many creature movies of this ilk, the acting often suffers, but these actors, mostly unknown, all delivered star quality performances all around, with no deviation from realism or drama. If you're expecting the same kind of Hollywood monster movie as say, ""Godzilla,' this might not be your cup of tea. Instead, it is a riveting, superbly-crafted action film, fully deserving of a second look.",Cloverfield
303,stumpmee77,I'll wait until it's slapped on the Sci-Fi channel or rent DVD,4,21 January 2008,"Saw the trailer all 4 times (TF2007), was intrigued but also a tad dizzy & sick to the stomach. Just ended watching film clips on a certain website where all sorts video stuff can be uploaded to. Was hedging going @ the theater impulse; hideous monster giving me nightmares &/or it'd be too gory. The trailer was delightfully intense; thought would lean towards gross. Had a dandy premise, too. I gave it the score I did was the approach to THE MONSTER in plot line.Now won't be viewing this in it's entirety in a theater as I'll be afraid I'll faint immediately standing up. It's biggest most implacable gripe I've got w/ Cloverfield; camera is continuously moving: slow, fast spinning, swaying boat all that and more-somebody make this stop!! Can any ""citizen"" snap still shots from their digi-cams? Given the naturally ensuing chaos, does Cloverfield's core group fall while running, hold the camera steady? Read reviewers mentioning BWP in describing it; 2 my mind ""Beast of Bray Road"" viewed that malarkey recently on the Sci-Fi Channel. I repeat what I said there, why can't focus be off these Ford Agency models for just 5 minutes? There ARE people in the Big Apple who never set foot in a health spa, above or underneath 20 something. ID4 had more variety in terms of human characters. The human character spoilers for this, girl/boy severed relationship, regrets it and gotta save the ex-beloved couple action crap seen in many a Sci-Fi""original"" flick. Instead of refugees from from a magazine, why not from the viewpoint of little ones, parents, monster's arrival interrupts the a get together of kids? How about putting it in a city OTHER than Mahanttan--how 'bout actually in a cloverfield, or the creature looking like a walking cloverfield for pity sakes? I've begun liking Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"".Will close by speaking only in terms of the monster's (Not that of his spider/crab buddies--only reason I wanna rent ""Clover"" on video.) rampage; less scary than Zok, the laser ray dragon, of the 1967-69 Herculoids TV series. Half an hr., Zok would've laid Manhattan waste. Now square-off between those two WOULD be interesting, also predictable, come think of it, I see who'd win a Cloverfield mile:Zok.",Cloverfield
304,mungflesh,A fun 90 mins,7,19 February 2008,"I was expecting this movie to be a bit more scary. That's my main gripe. Nothing really bad happens to the characters (on screen) so no real fear is conjured up. It's scary in the same way the movie 'Earthquake' was scary, ie. like a disaster movie, not a horror movie.This might be your bag but I needed more to make me feel the fear I would have, had I have been in NYC during the onslaught.The fx are great and I think future monster movies will use more of this first-person approach to drive home realism. The monster is killer.The acting's *ok* and doesn't really let the film down but is questionable in places of high emotion. Towards the end, I just yearned to watch people get eaten or something.To sum up: a fun 90 mins but didn't knock my socks off.",Cloverfield
305,butchfilms,A good popcorn movie,7,17 December 2008,"I really liked it. I had my doubts before watching it but I was surprised of how entertaining this movie was.I liked the characters, the special effects, and the plot of the movie, specially the meaning that anyone can make anything for love. I also liked the final that is not Hollywood's style.This movie is similar to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in that we see ""Cloverfield"" through what has been recorded by some of its characters by a hand-held video camera along the movie (with some small scenes of what has been recorded before the movie has began).The plot is about a group of people in their twenties who are in a leaving party in NY when suddenly an enormous monster appears killing people in the city forcing everybody to evacuate, but this group of friends will stay to rescue a love interest of one of them.",Cloverfield
306,robertallenandersonjr,The good and the bad,7,10 April 2008,"Cloverfield was a pretty good movie all and all. Besides the hundreds of point of view shots and the camera bouncing around every five seconds it was a pretty good movie. I thought that it was very clever and smart the way they made this movie. Despite me not being a fan of the camera shots and the way they did the camera work you might be a fan. I just thought that the beginning was boring and the ending was bad. The actors did a great job for the roles they had to play. I also thought that some of the messages and themes aimed toward this movie were great. I also loved what the characters did for each other in this movie. So in conclusion if you like bouncing cameras, and big monsters then i recommend this movie for you.",Cloverfield
307,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 86,9,5 April 2016,"Cloverfield came at a defining moment in viral culture. YouTube was really getting big, and smart phones hadn't even been around for 2 years yet. So give credit to the awareness of the filmmakers, including producer J.J. Abrams, to take a chance on something that spoke to a new generation--perhaps the first film to do so (based off memory so don't get mad if I'm wrong). It was modern and cool and what people actually wanted to see, but not like in a cheap way when some rich old guy says ""Ooo, I bet the kids'll really dig this."" But in a totally conscious way.It's a monster movie with a modern flair. Set in New York City (where else?), it features a group of friends trying to escape Manhattan away from this large unidentifiable creature.The acting isn't the best--save for Lizzy Caplan and T.J. Miller (the latter of the two having his career essentially launched by this movie alone)--but that may have to do with the completely exposed and unrealistic dialogue. It's obvious that the filmmakers chose to focus more on concept and narrative. And that's fine.During the movie's setup, before the monster attacks, a party is being held to bid farewell to Rob (Michael Stahl-David) before he leaves for a new career opportunity in Japan. Rob's best friend, Hud (Miller), is documenting the whole thing--including the rest of the movie--on video camera, which may be the best decision by the filmmakers in this whole film. Miller arguably carries the movie and provides great comic relief, proving why he deserves to be such a dominant figure in these types of roles these past few years.Director Matt Reeves does a good job moving the story along and not leaving behind much wasted space. It constantly feels like this is what might actually happen if there were some sort of monster attack.One allowance you'll have to make, however, is the corny love story amidst all the chaos. Rob convinces his friends to venture back into ground zero in order to save the one-that-got-away, Beth (Odette Yustman). But thankfully Cloverfield never takes itself too seriously. Or maybe it does, but it's so much so that we just laugh and enjoy it anyway.Twizard Rating: 86",Cloverfield
308,parameswaranrajendran,Different movie,7,6 February 2018,Cloverfield - Maybe I am late to watch this movie because it's already 10 years in 2018 but better late than never. I want to talk about their Cinematography which is seriously unique because fully in handy and rare footage mode. It is taken as Property of United States of America (confidential footage). MattReeves gave one of his fining first direction to kick start his career. There are still two more in this franchise. The third one only released today in Netflix.,Cloverfield
309,simonparker1990,Who gives a damn about Godzilla anymore?,9,2 February 2008,"Many months ago I sat at my computer screen and watched the very first trailer for Cloverfield, the trailer that showed a mysterious attack on New York and ended with a shot of the Statue of Liberty's head being thrown through the air and hitting the ground in front of the camera. I have to say, despite many people going absolutely mad about it, I didn't really know what to make of it. Sure I practically pencilled in the release date on my calendar just to see what the hell it was, but I genuinely wasn't sure about the whole thing. Then the second trailer and endless hype arrived, once again it guaranteed a seat in the cinema for me, but I still just didn't truly buy into the hype. I admit I half expected Cloverfield to suck, I really did. The hand-held camera thing looked like a five second wonder and the I just didn't think it'd live up to the astronomically high expectations. Well today I finally saw Cloverfield, and it is an absolute success! This is a re-invention I never thought possible, sure the good old fashioned monster flicks like Godzilla were fun, but after so many films where the generals shout orders and the President debates what to do about the creature, you get sick of it. Cloverfield takes a more risky and far more fulfilling approach by putting us head first into the situation. We see and hear everything from the average persons perspective, what makes this even more successful is the fact that the characters seem real. They're likable, they're believable and they are undoubtedly the best characters in a monster movie I have ever seen! This movie is just a non-stop thrill ride, the minute the attack starts you will be on the edge of your seat! Sure at first we barely see the monster, we get a couple of quick glimpses, but the movie works in terrifying because we don't see it. Once you see the monster it gets even better! Cloverfield only gets a 9/10 for one reason, I'm not sure if it will work as well second time. This is so close to getting a 10/10, and once I see it again next week I might even up the rating.Okay lets go onto the performances, let me start by saying there is nobody famous in this movie at all. And that's part of the beauty of the whole thing, you can relate to these people more because they aren't Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie running through the streets. The main characters, I suppose as its from his perspective, is Hudd played by T.J. Miller, however he is off-screen for the majority of the film. Still he is hilarious with some of his comments he makes during the film. Michael Stahl-David is the next biggest character and the one we see on-screen for the majority of the film. He plays Rob, and he is the most believable and brilliant character of the bunch. His story is superbly executed and oddly touching. Just watch the scene where he has a phone call in a subway station, its hard to watch it so sad. Jessica Lucas delivers a killer performance as Lily, a very great character who once again goes through a lot during the course of the movie. Lizzy Caplan as Marlena is great although a tad underused, however saying that she has one extremely memorable scene towards the final third, trust me you will know it when you see it. Mike Vogel, whose past credits include Poseidon, is great although once again underused.Well I suppose the big question everyone wants answered is how was the monster? Or more specifically what does it look like? I absolutely refuse to spoil what the monster looks like, I'll just say it doesn't look like Godzilla. The monster is just brilliant, when I first saw it I was a bit unsure, but when its seen up close the monster looks very cool. I also very much appreciated the fact that the monster is never explained, we know as much about it at the beginning as we do the end. And I loved that, its nice for a movie to have a of bit mystery surrounding it. The movie also succeeds with the way it is shot, after seeing the movie you will never again worry about hand-held camera movies. It works superbly and I cannot picture the movie in any other way. It puts you head first in the action, the scene where the army attacks is thrilling as a result of this! Also it makes you feel more sympathy for the characters as you actually do feel like you a apart of their little gang wandering round the streets. The movie is action packed, tense and just thrilling. Sure its not incredibly smart and sure there is the odd movie it feels a bit cheesy. But in general this is a short, sharp punch of a movie which is an incredible cinema experience.Cloverfield might not be perfect, but its sure as hell entertaining. Its one of the best monster movies ever made and very much worth paying the admission fee for. I cannot believe I am saying this but believe the hype, this is something that just has to be watched!",Cloverfield
310,mitchell5954,A Very Innovative Monster Movie,8,10 February 2019,"Cloverfield is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the film, but there are problems that I had and that others might have with the film. Cloverield is another attempt by America to do our own original monster movie. This time they used the found footage format to make it their own. Compared to other American monster movies or monster movies in general, I'd say that this is my second favorite. Though, as I said the film has problems.With Kong Skull Island being first, I'd say this is my second favorite American giant monster movie. I like this more than most Godzilla movies, and I like Godzilla. I even like it more than Pacific Rim. What makes it good for me is the different approach they took. Instead of focusing on the monster attacking and the military fighting it they focus only on a select group of average people trying to survive, get out of the city, and find out what's going on.They focus all of it on the civilian point of view of what they're going through and they show the immense destruction and casualties from that angle, which you rarely see in other movies like this. It's supposed to be more real in this is what it would really be like if a giant monster did attack a huge city. Plus it took place entirely at night which evoked a greater sense of despair and atmosphere in the film which added to the realistic angle they were going for.They also kept the monster mostly in the background or in quick clips until the end which evoked a sense of mystery of what it was or where it came from. The latest Godzilla movie tried something similar but it didn't work. It worked in this film and not that Godzilla movie in 2014 because we already knew what Godzilla was, so keeping him in the shadows the entire movie is pointless, other than to save on the budget. Here it works better because we know nothing of the monster so there's more mystery behind it. Also the character in Cloverfield, while not that great either, were still more interesting than the ones in Godzilla 2014.One complaint I have is the found footage format. I like that they tried a different approach to making a monster movie, but it did not always work for me. The point was to get a sense of realism and put the viewer right in the action like you're actually with these characters during this major attack. It was trying to be a more real experience.However, the camera was too shaky and it often did not focus on a shot long enough for the viewer to completely take in what was happening. Though I could buy it in the beginning, as the film went on, I found it hard to believe that they would not drop the camera. It would've been better if it had just been a regular movie revolving around these people trying to survive a monster attack.Another problem is the characters. I did not find them annoying, but I thought they were bland. I did not find one of them especially interesting. They weren't terrible characters. I got with them enough to be invested in the story and what happens to them, but there's nothing much to them either.The effects were good. I thought that the design of the monster was cool and looked very original. There was a ton of hype surrounding this film when the teaser first came out. People were wondering what this thing was that was destroying New York City. Some were probably let down by the fact that it was a monster. I did not get into the immense hype this film generated so I was okay with it. This film also had a great atmosphere to it as well.Overall, I did enjoy this film. However, it is not for everyone. If you can't stand the found footage style or you're not a fan of giant monster flicks, for both, than this isn't for you. If you got into the hype like so many did and wanted something more than just a monster than you'll be disappointed. However, if you just want a fun and slightly more realistic take on a monster movie then check this out. I admit I didn't like this film when I first saw it but it grew on me. Now I actually think it's fairly good despite its faults.",Cloverfield
311,thelastblogontheleft,A found footage gem,7,2 April 2017,"I first saw this movie maybe a couple years after it came out, so this was a re-watch for me and I had forgotten how TOTALLY AMAZING THIS MOVIE IS. Like shockingly good, really. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I am a huge fan of the ""found footage"" style of horror, but this might be the best example of it that I've personally seen. It's terrifying, it's chaotic, it leaves you breathless in some scenes it's just well done. It's the first in a series of three movies that are all part of the Cloverfield franchise. I think they did the series in an interesting way — it's not a movie plus two sequels, but rather three movies that all take place in the same alternate universe.The storyline is fairly basic, as I think a movie like this needs to be. A bunch of friends are at a going away party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who is moving to Japan. There's some typical drama at the party itself (and it's a bit slow and painful to muddle through) but it's later on when things start to get really crazy as the party-goers hear experience what feels and sounds like a brief earthquake followed by a city-wide power outage. They all head downstairs to the street to see what's going on and it's just pure chaos. They start to realize that some kind of monsters — some massive and some small — are attacking the city, and it's a rush to escape alive.** SPOILERS! **Like I said, this movie is just a thrill ride from beginning (well, almost beginning) to end. I really think the ""found footage"" style — the feeling that we're right along with them — adds significantly to how much anxiety and panic you feel as you're watching. When they first hear the ""earthquake"" and go downstairs to find a street full of people all wildly speculating (was it an earthquake? a terrorist attack? was that it, or will there be more?), you feel like you're among the crowd. It was very reminiscent of the videos I've seen from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in a way — just blind fear and trying to piece things together as you go, which is terrifying when you have no idea what you're running from or where is safe to go. And then DOWN COMES THE HEAD OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY and it's very Escape From New York and pretty cool.The scene where people are SPRINTING to get away from the massive debris cloud rolling their way is well, again, very 9/11, which I think just naturally strikes a nerve in all of us. It's this massive, inanimate object that is hurtling towards you and everyone tumbles into buildings and they're somewhat safe even though the sheer force of the cloud implodes the windows. Just insane.The combination of just sober disbelief, sirens wailing in the distance, seemingly everything (and everyone) covered in this layer of white snowy debris, military barking orders from helicopters, the sound of explosions echoing off the skyscrapers, the inhuman roar of some kind of monster shifting from building to building it's like you don't even know where to look or what to focus on, and on top of that you can hear the cries of fear and panic from the group you're following (which I think they did very authentically).I really preferred when they kept the monster(s) more vague just glimpses here and there. As is often the case with monster movies like this, looking too long at them can take the mystery away and make them less impactful. Just seeing a tail crashing into the Brooklyn Bridge is effective but when they stop in the store and watch the news cast and see the smaller monsters, it's still crazy but you can kind of see the seam in the special effects and it takes me out of the fantasy a little bit.One of my favorite scenes is when Rob is on his way to rescue Beth (the forgettable Odette Annable) and they get caught in the crossfire between monsters and military. It's just explosions and gunfire and a freaking TANK and I mean if you weren't glued to the TV for that there's somethin' wrong.Everyone talks about the tunnel scenes and they were okay but I dunno, I preferred them out on the streets, personally. But when they go inside the department store and the military guides them to the outpost and then Marlena (Lizzy Caplan, who bugs the crap out of me) starts bleeding from her eyes because she was previously wounded by one of the tiny monsters and it's just CHAOS as they rush her into quarantine that scared the HELL out of me. It definitely plays on one of my biggest fears in general — some kind of outbreak where there's CDC in hazmat suits all around — but imagining her utter panic and helplessness as they rush her away from her familiar group is intense. And it was brilliant how they got her riiiight behind the curtain and then ""pop!"" she explodes. Oh man. My jaw was on the floor.I also really liked when they finally saved Beth and had gotten into the chopper for rescue and then BOOM, monster's comin' atcha and the chopper is spinning out and it is C H A O S, just screaming and praying, as they are hurtling toward some uncertain future. That was really the last cool scene before the kind of cheesy monster slurping up the man behind the camera, Hud (T.J. Miller), or the definitely cheesy exchange of I love yous between Rob and Beth (gag).Overall, a really awesome, action-packed, genuinely scary ""found footage"" gem!",Cloverfield
312,gpeltz,Amazing,8,28 January 2008,"Well, It's been out now for a week. it's no secret what I thought of the film. I caught the premier of it in a Midnight showing. The theater was packed. It kept me up and interested. To see a monster attack a city, as a spectator, as it happens in real time, is a stroke of genius. The movie made something seemingly simple, look real. To see a hand held camera spin, to catch a building falling is an awesome feat. When The camera spins pointing down a side street, to pick up an image of army men, using crowd control tactics, with mobs of people, it adds a feeling of reality and urgency to the document.One of the most surprising moments for me, was the end credits! A list of production people, a mile and a half long, gaffers, electricians, set designers, wardrobe. How can that be? the film was shot with a hand held camera, by an amateur. The illusion is that good. Then there is the technique of storytelling. The camera is there at the dramatic personal moments, When the guy is talking to his girlfriend, the close up is on his face and conversation, but when it is done, the person holding the camera backs off, with a gesture that reminds us that it is a friend holding the camera.The conventions of film making are cleverly skirted. The Jump cut is achieved by turning the camera off momentarily. Thus running up thirty six flights is shortened in cinematic ways, yet in a natural style. Things like this make the movie an outstanding feature. The shortcomings however were with the Monster itself. I respond half jokingly that it should have been a Mega. (Check out my Mega Boy photoshoped pictures over at ""teen giants.com"")Seriously, the Monster lacked motivation. Was it evil, was it just big and clumsy? did it enjoy pushing down buildings? We don't get to find out. First of all, we don't get to see too much of it. And when we do see it, one feels an overview shot would be needed. The advantage of the old Monster giants, was that you would once in a while get a Monsters eye view of the tiny mobs by your feet. This movie precluded such a shot, except for the helicopter view towards the end. Yet this kind of shot was needed to give us the full perspective of the Beast. Also mentioned at my other sites, was the need to make the monster something recognizable. I still don't think I could draw this one. Worse yet, the movie lacked ""Big Feet"" honestly, how could they do a Giant monster, where no one gets stomped. Oh well. All this aside, I give the picture an eight out of ten stars.",Cloverfield
313,DrTuvok,Found footage is a plague,2,17 November 2020,"You know the drill: young people enjoy stupid parties until some disaster happens and the banality of their existence is turned into survival. The camera bounces and jostles in a vain attempt to evoke intensity, people wobbling across the screen gasp and make surprised faces as the gore flies everywhere, etc. It's very lazy.If you want to see intensity and danger done right, watch Alfred Hitchcock. At least in his era there was such a thing as blocking and staging shots. This is literally the same level of any loser with their camcorder. And, even worse, that's the point.",Cloverfield
314,alexpeychev,Overrated!,1,25 January 2021,"I went in expecting a scary monster movie.what i got was 15 minutes of bad TV dialog, and 45 minutes of shaky-cam running through the streets. the acting was OK but the characters were really unpleasant. not only did i not care if they died, by the end of the movie i was rooting for the monster.there were a lot of plot holes and the decisions everyone made were totally unrealistic. it was hard to stay in the movie because of the constant lapses of common sense and logical flaws. those kinds of things really annoy me when they could have been fixed with a line or two of dialog.finally at the end of the movie there were a couple minutes of cool special effects. the rest of the movie was a waste of time.",Cloverfield
315,Animus,Stinks on toast!,2,19 June 2008,"Yes, I was unimpressed by Blair Witch and I am equally unimpressed by Blair Witch 3: Cloverfield. The characters are shallow and frankly I hoped the monster would hurry up and kill them off so the camera could be picked up by someone INTERESTING who might actually know how to hold a camera, take a decent shot of the monster and most of all shut the hell up. Those army guys all seemed to have good quality helmet cams, why did we have to see the event through the eyes of these cretins? This might have made a good 15 minute web-film but it drags on and on as an almost normal length film. The rats in the subway tunnel had the right idea, run away (from this movie). Borrowing the worst from Blair Witch the film tries to make up for it for ripping off Godzilla and Alien while constantly recapping what we've just seen 5 seconds ago for posterity and asking questions to which the answer is blatantly obvious. Would have killed them to actually turn the camera towards the monster? Scenes where the monster could be seen if the camera was pointing at it, instead follow the lame character's we've been forced to watch the whole time, for someone claiming he wants to document the event, Hud seems to be allergic to actually doing so, we tend to get 1-2 seconds of monster followed by 30 seconds of whining reaction shots from the characters. The effects range from very nice to absolutely pathetic, the angled shots were worse than old batman episodes, if your actors are supposed to be walking at a harsh angle using walls for support, make sure the clothes and hair on them doesn't reveal that they are on a flat set with a tilted camera. My idea of a good exciting monster movie is not following a set of random victims who wouldn't have even rated names in the credits of a real film but one have been ""Yuppie victim #1"" etc. The good news is that the boys at Rifftrax did an alternate audio track you can download and run with the film to make it watchable. Hooray for MST3k!",Cloverfield
316,Adorable,In a field of its own: getting the story right and the art of wowing viewers,9,22 January 2008,"Since the dawn of humankind stories and narrative have been about perception. And good stories were the ones that managed to play tricks with their audience's perceptions. This doesn't have to be overly meaningful or oh-golly mind bending and life changing. It's enough to get much more than what you were expecting to get upon sitting down to hear the tale.And this Cloverfield (CF) does so, so well. In fact, it's one of the best, most memorable movies of the decade so far. I was literally and physically gripped with emotion when it ended, a situation amplified by my prejudiced, indoctrinated psyche mumbling ""but it's a monster movie, for Pete's sake!"" That's like saying the Grand Canyon is a gap in the ground. It's true, but somewhat underwhelming and unappreciative. Put plainly, CF is a masterpiece of storytelling because it's potent and powerful, not to mention well managed: the thing is just over 80 minutes long and succeeds in narrating more than most would require three times as long for. It becomes omnipotent thanks to its short run, which means we only get fleeting glimpses of everything, from the beautiful to the terrifying.CF is also a superb vehicle for some new and exciting talent. All actors herein rise to the challenge and perform marvelously, so here's hoping we'll be watching more from Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman, T.J Miller, Jessica Lucas and Mike Vogel sometime soon.The film has been the subject of much speculation, with producer JJ Abrams of Alias and Lost fame and director Matt Reeves (Felicity) playing it hush hush. The wait was worth it, and indeed the team used CF as a neat way of acknowledging many of the other gorgeous stories we've all enjoyed in the past: War of the Worlds, Stephen King's The Mist, maybe even TV series Jericho. Of course Godzilla  perhaps more 1998's US Godzilla than the original movies, but that was a fun version no matter how you look at it.CF, on the other hand, isn't about fun. It's about sheer emotional and contextual impact. It starts with a going away party for one Rob Hawkins (Stahl-David), who's bout to leave for Japan. This is where we learn the characters aren't all perfect and have some issues. Then the attack comes, and a group of friends finds itself on the run, with only a hand-held camera to document events as a mysterious monster rampages around Manhattan.At first we get next to no information on what's going on, it's all a big tease that keeps you guessing and thus makes the inevitable twists and angles all that more gratifying. Likewise, the destruction wrought upon NYC is excellently depicted via capable but never overwhelming or cheesy CGI. This also holds true for the monster when we get to see more of the character  everything looks perfect, unlike that other New York disaster flick of recent times, I Am Legend. Maybe this is why CF has been catching flack vis a vis the events of September 11, it's just so vivid and moving, there's nothing cinema-detached about it.The roller coaster that this motion picture amounts to doesn't last long, but features everything in the storyteller's guidebook: love, romance, fear, hate, loss, hope, despair and quite a few more. And you'll feel all of them right along with the story, down to the sobering closing moments of this wonderful ride.I therefore salute Cloverfield and all those who had a part in making it a silver screen reality. It's a great movie, I love it, it caught me completely off guard and came out on top with that elusive magical quantity called emotion, a thread so woefully missing in many other narratives and, sadly, from life as we know it in general.Well done people, well done: I'll be thinking of this one for some time to come, and am waiting with bated breath for the special edition release. Just let me at those deleted scenes.",Cloverfield

I don't suffer from motion sickness but watching this movie made me feel like I was on a boat in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle for Christ's sake. If you suffer from motion sickness this movie is not for you check out REC 1 and 2 for found footage films that won't give you a seizure. The media campaign for this film began when I was still a kid so obviously I wasn't there to see it but it was a nice act that I did research on after viewing the film. This movie is definitely one that is worth buying on Blu Ray because of the monster aspect and the tiny monsters coming out of the monster (this is not a spoiler). The deaths are gory, the plot makes sense and the ending was brutal. I don't have a problem with this film. It is definitely a top horror/thriller film. I have to give credit to TJ Miller as Hud who was behind the camera he was incredibly funny the action and parkour scenes were cool because of him and his friend Micheal Stahl-David as Rob was less cool but still entertaining with a three person mission to retrieve his girlfriend Beth (played by Odette Yustman).

321,commandercool88,"Very intense, very disturbing.",8,8 July 2008,"After months of anticipation, speculation, and internet hype... 'Cloverfield' has landed. The big question is: does it live up to the hype? The answer may surprise you, as it definitely surprised me. But the answer is yes, yes it does. It chills like few films of its kind, and puts nearly every other monster flick to absolute shame. A morbidly and disturbingly realistic portrait of a city - and its people - under attack, it stirs up many powerful and gut-wrenching emotions that haven't been felt since that one fateful day in September. It's truly haunting. Truly unforgettable. And I don't know if I could ever watch it again.The hand-held camera approach only allows one point of view, from the eyes of the victims themselves. There's no backstory, no explanation, and we only get a good look at the monster at the very end. We're along for the thrilling and haunting adventure, knowing nothing more or less than the characters whose shoes we inhabit. It's a difficult movie, because it feels so damn real. If you go to the movies for entertainment and escapism, you may want to look elsewhere. 'Cloverfield' is raw, unadulterated terror that will chill you to the bone. The explosive suspense is at times nail-biting as you wait for the next strike to level more of the Big Apple, or more importantly, your spirits. It's when 'Cloverfield' is most effective, simply because we have no comprehension of what this creature is. By the film's end, we have a much clearer idea of this terrifying monster. It's understandable to put a face to the destruction, but the film is at its best when the mystery and anticipation is still high.You won't find any manufactured thrills here, and the film understands there is no easy way out. Everything is as realistic as you could hope for, and at times, it's a little too much. The initial strike launches us into the same confusion, desperation, and disorientation that 9/11 did to us, and it's a film like this that proves how fresh those terrible memories still are. That's why I find it difficult to say that I enjoyed this movie, because it brought me back to a place and time that I'd rather forget. But 'Cloverfield' all too effectively creates the same dark atmosphere, and it's difficult to resist the chills during the experience. The head of the Statue of Liberty landing on the streets, the daunting escape through the Subway tunnels, the complete and utter destruction. It's important not to give much away, but you must experience 'Cloverfield' for yourself.Casting unknowns in the lead roles was a pitch-perfect move, as the film highlights the unpredictability of the world we live in. At any given moment, everything we've come to know can be turned upside down completely, and it can affect you or me or everyone we know. 'Cloverfield' runs off of raw human emotion, and there's no way to escape the horror. It hits hard, and it packs a lasting and ferocious punch. If you want to cut straight to the point, 'Cloverfield' is an effective movie. No question about it. It's a gripping, emotional, and disturbing ride that quickly becomes so much more than your typical monster flick. It's what 'Godzilla' failed so miserably at nearly ten years ago on the big screen, but who could have predicted the devastating true-life events that would unfold only a few short years later. And if you thought for a moment September 11th wouldn't affect your viewing of 'Cloverfield', think again. This is all too real, and you won't soon forget it.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Cloverfield

323,moviemaniac008,"Did not make me nauseous, but still a f***ing good movie!",10,8 November 2008,"All right, shaky cameras do not make me nauseous. That's okay with me. And if there are some people out there who are just like me, then I tell them that Cloverfield is an extremely good movie. I went earlier this year, when it was still in theaters, with a friend who hates horror movies (I had to drag him with me) and even though he didn't want to go, he did come out with a smile on his face and told me for the next 20 minutes how he thought the movie was awesome. So much for not wanting to go. Seeing it on TV yesterday reminded me that I hadn't reviewed this movie yet. However, if you do not like shaky cameras, then you might want to stay away from this one. Like many people said, it resembles Blair Witch Project in many ways, so if BWP made you scared for the next couple of days after you saw it, then do not pick up this movie because it's almost as worst.Story: The first 20 minutes were pretty calm, and that's okay with me because it introduced us to fun characters and new actors. They're setting up a surprise party for their friend Rob who is leaving for Japan to go work over there (for two years, if I remember). So people are enjoying themselves and all until all the lights shut down. The people get out, only to find the head of the Statue of Liberty being thrown in their direction. Something has found us (like the poster says) and it's clear that he/she doesn't like us at all.I enjoyed the way the movie was filmed, as if you were a part of the movie, however what I didn't like was the fact that the movie focuses almost only on the adventure itself and not really into character development. Even though the actors were pretty good, I'm not sure any of them will get an Oscar nomination because we barely see any of them clearly. Oh, and compared to a lot of people, I enjoyed the apocalyptic ending with everyone dying. Unless you hate BWP or shaky cameras, then don't forget to pick this intense movie up.",Cloverfield
324,jacklmauro,"Go, Monster, Go!",1,13 December 2011,"Oh, my. My, my. Here I was, expecting an interestingly modern monster movie. What I got was...I don't quite know. I only know I kept leaving the sofa to do something else, saying out loud, ""Oh, come ON, already."" And I have to say, after the first 5 minutes of the opening party scene, I was already cheering for whatever monster was coming. I was rather hoping he'd hurry, too. To be fair, people truly are that tiresome and annoying. They do act like their romances are life-and-death. But this does not especially make me want to see if they can survive hell. What else? Little things. Like, the band of 'heroes' apparently walks from Spring St. to 59th Street through the tunnels? Three miles, one subway tunnel, and the critters, too? Hot damn. Or that no one is insistent that the girl literally ripped apart by the bug get medical attention when they astoundingly walk into a makeshift hospital, because the hero has to explain about his trapped GF first? Or that, traumatized or not, the surviving hero and GF seem to forget that the city's about to be nuked? Or that Hud, the cameraman, is the most severely irritating idiot ever? Or that, as noted elsewhere, the U.S, military is on the scene in full force minutes after the first attack, which ties into why lots of people would think it smart to traverse a bridge when buildings are flying? Ultimately, though, it all comes down to: you just care nothing at all for these people, and the pitiful rescue-the-beloved angle only makes it worse. PS Manhattan, nuked? I'm OK with that.",Cloverfield
325,das417,"A twist on an old genre, Cloverfield shows that even an old concept can still sell",8,30 January 2008,"My first reaction to seeing the ""mysterious"" movie trailer in which one is treated to the scene of large section of New York exploding, followed of course by the head of the State of Liberty bouncing down a street, was one of awe. Not only was this film being produced by JJ Abrams, better known in my opinion for the series Lost, but it was filmed in such a way that seemed unique. A hand held camera telling the story from the view point of one or at least a few other characters? Yes, we saw this before with the dreadfully silly Blair Witch Project. However, this was taking the concept to a whole new level even though no one had a clue to what actually was happening.Now that the plot is known to everyone, the idea behind it is still unique. A monster movie based upon the limited view points of only four major characters? In movies such as Godzilla and King Kong the audience knew more than the characters so it was easy to dismiss their actions and thoughts if one disliked them. However, with Cloverfield the situation is different. Now the audience is forced to only know and experience what the characters themselves are facing. Frustrating to some, but I found it drawing me in further because I was so desperate to also know what was going on.Rob (Michael Stahl-David) has been promoted and will now work overseas in Japan which of course will take him far from his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and best friend Hud (T.J. Miller). To honor the occasion, Jason's fiancée Lily (Jessica Lucas) decides to set up a surprise party with all of Rob's close friends so they could all see him off together. Of course Rob would want to remember this so Lily convinces Jason to record the party on an hand held camera which Jason then dumps upon Hud who finds himself enjoying the new responsibility as well as the opportunity to draw close to Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).The party is a success until the appearance of Beth (Odette Yustman) and her new boyfriend. I should back up and explain that Cloverfield starts with images from the camera of Rob and Beth together. Images that are slowly being erased as Hud continues to film but since Jason and Beth now seem to be far apart due to some strange twist in their relationship, Rob claims to have little interest in them.As if life couldn't get more stressful for Rob, the city is suddenly rocked by a strange earthquake. What is the obvious thing to do? Well, run up to the roof to get a better view of the city which of course everyone at the party decides to do. While Hud pans over New York's night line, it is then that an explosion literally tears apart a large section of the city. Everyone screams and begins running from the roof and only stop when they reach the city street where they are joined by other New Yorkers who stare with horror as buildings seemingly fall on their own.What happens next is captured solely by Hud who runs, trips, falls, screams, and cries as much as everyone else around him. The idea sounds silly but it actually works and also gives the characters a deeper sense of depth in that the only camera, so to speak, they are acting in front of is the small one before them. The sudden motions, fuzzy images, and dusty shots gives one the impression that for the most part something like this actually happened. Some complained of sickness because of this however I was not one of them. Cloverfield's strength is in the way it is filmed and if you didn't like that then you have no reason to like the movie at all.The movie follows the basic idea behind an escape movie in that Rob, Jason, Lily, Hud, Beth and Marlena, must escape the city at all costs. The deaths of Jason and Marlena, as well as the rescue attempt to save Beth, drive the rest of the drama of Cloverfield. It is easy to argue that there isn't much substance behind Cloverfield but one really misses the point if that is one's feelings about Cloverfield. Once more Cloverfield is a movie not just about the monster attack itself but in how the story is told. That is where the real strengths of the movie are found.Cloverfield isn't a perfect movie and one can argue that the idea of someone really wanting to hold onto the same camera during a monster attack is simply unrealistic. Okay, so what? How realistic is a monster attack to begin with? One shouldn't be too critical of Cloverfied but instead should simply agree with everyone that takes place and enjoy the ride. Cloverfield shows that an old genre such as monster attacks can still work even today.8/10",Cloverfield

There should be a crossover movie between the Cloverfield monster and Godzilla.

Also I know that when my brother watches this movie it sometimes gets him a little dizzy cause of all the movements with that guy and his camera.

327,boe_dye,boe_dye sez... actually secret agent j sez.... it's blair witch goes to N.Y,5,22 January 2008,"So here's the deal; had i walked into this film not know that it was going to be documentary style, running around with lots of weird and wacky camera angles, sporadic monsters, and lots of hight pitched screaming, i probably would have been somewhat upset.However, i did walk into knowing all of this to boot, so there it is.I think the best way to describe this, and the most fairest observation about this, is that people who love it, are going to love the exact same things that the people who hated it, hated.Personally, i will never spend money to see another pseudo-documentary style film like this, because i don't care for the open ended story telling. i thought that it was far too annoying to enjoyable. although what was done, was done extremely well, what was done was done in a style that i just don't like.The scenes were very well played, and the footage was pretty good for what it was. my biggest complaint however was the character ""hud"" who acted more like a 15 year old with a camera. too many stupid comments, too much idiotic chatter, and not enough substance. sure, he was supposed to be the stereotypical doofus who was given the camera because it amused his simple character, but i think that it was over played after the whole ""he and she slept together"" bit.The monsters were done well, and i liked how the kept the cloverfield monster a mystery so to speak towards the end, but at the same time, i felt that they could have used just a smidgen more intelligence when it came to evading the monster as they escaped in the choppa.And yes, they do most certainly have to ""get to a choppa""...The ending was a bit of a disappointment for me, as i felt it was unnecessary, and really made the film pointless. They go to all this trouble avoiding the blasted thing, only to make a very predictable escape that parallels the monster path of destruction.Why they thought that a monster that could toss the statue of liberty's head half way across manhattan would not be able to jump a couple of hundred feet in the air from a standstill is beyond me, but hey, there it is...In the end, i and my wife, were both somewhat nauseous. she liked it, but then again she also likes me too, which goes to show where her tastes are at. my best friend, the man known as secret agent j liked it, but then again still lovingly referred to it as blair witch goes to N.Y.Those who say that it is nothing like blair witch really need to get a clue, cause it was almost exactly like blair witch, only with more running, screaming, and eye candy...... and no stupid man standing in the basement of a cabin looking all... stupid...I had to be fair and give it five stars. 5 cause, and again, what it did, it did really well, but i just didn't like what it did...... although the star trek teaser gave me chills... >8^P",Cloverfield
328,rlange-3,Really Great and Scary Entertainment,9,8 May 2008,"Not Alien but it is a very scary movie, very well done. It's surprising to me that so many reviewers panned it. If you really can't stand the Blair Witchy hand held camera stuff, perhaps this isn't your movie.The first 20 minutes are slow and marginally entertaining at best, but they lay the groundwork for the nonstop action for the rest of the film. There are several simply spectacular events and a handful of very spooky ones. The characters are not necessarily ones you like as individuals, but they are well acted and seem very real. By the end of the movie I thought they had all showed some unexpected sterling qualities. The only thing that annoyed me slightly was the lead female running around in heels or at times barefoot with broken glass everywhere -- I think she would have swapped them for something more functional. But that's a minor point.The dialog was not a high point of the movie, but it added some significant depth to the main characters. What some are complaining about as bad lines are pretty much what you would expect from a guy like ""Hud"" in my opinion. In fact it was nice to see ordinary people facing an extraordinary situation without superheroics.Both monster types were genuinely scary, and I am rarely scared even though I want to be. Marletta's wound was especially well done, as were the final scenes of her agony.It was also great to see a movie in which the military was portrayed as the military, with no evil plotting general or totally incompetent or uncaring individuals. And while there is an overlay of a defense project gone amiss, this is not a movie in which we are lectured by the antimilitary crowd -- a major improvement.If you liked the movie (I saw it on DVD), check out the special features, especially the documentary on the CGI work. Very well done.In summary, unless you strongly dislike hand held cams, this is great entertainment. Highly recommended.",Cloverfield
329,legendaryunderdog,When I said all movies are crap these days I spoke too soon......,9,1 May 2008,"Yes I did say it 'All movies these days are crap!' and I'm sure some of you would agree and some of you would disagree. Well after I watched Cloverfield I was obsessed with the thought that maybe there are some specks of intense originality still left in Hollywoodland. The director obviously was inspired by the 'shaky camera' of the Blair Witch Project, the director must have seen its effect on the audience (which I will confess was very creepy at times in Blair Witch) The problem with Blair Witch is that it wasn't directed too intelligently, that is where the director of Cloverfield came into play and asked himself 'Hmmmm...how do I incorporate the shaky camera and still keep the viewer interested and not vomiting due to 'shaky camera syndrome?' Well he did it beautifully, the shaky camera was there (which I admit I was a little hesitant about dealing with for an hour and a half) but I actually found myself really into the movie and albeit the acting wasn't swell, but I can understand how the director wanted to bring a 'realistic' approach to the movie. All in All I was really really impressed with the film, so maybe there are still some specks of originality still left in the stratosphere of the movie world! Nine out of Ten Stars should suffice.

330,Macleanie,Ultimate monster experience,9,18 June 2019,"This is a superb monster movie. It's scary, mysterious, menacing and looks amazing. The fact it's all filmed in a video camera style is not going to be to everyone's taste but I think it adds an extra edge to the movie and makes it a more authentic experience. Whilst the characters aren't totally interesting, and a little stereo typical you feel their terror and desperation to get to friends and to safety. I love how the creature was kept a secret before release, how it teases your imagination for its existence and is completely forced upon them out of the blue.

331,wrightiswright,A short but sweet thrill ride,6,4 August 2015,"Steadicam. The action LIVE, as it happens. A mysterious giant beast on the loose, also shedding smaller versions of itself,. Hoards of running, screaming people. An entire city under threat. And a small band of survivors, trying to rescue one of their friends, then escape the chaos...Congratulations... You have successfully blended The Blair Witch Project with Godzilla. And, in the process, created a winter blockbuster, made on a paltry budget of 25 million dollars. The Hollywood money crunchers WILL be happy.Anyway, it's all good fun, as our motley crew of racially diverse nincompoops foolishly traverse the overrun metropolis, escaping the nasty creatures, while also trying to avoid the bullets and missiles of good ol' Uncle Sam. Your tax dollars at work, right there. I hope you remember that the next time you moan about inflation.It would have been nice to see MORE of those invading mini-monsters, rather than all the touchy-feely ickiness Cloverfield sometimes revels in. Plus, some of the victims are so darn stoopid that they deserve their botties handed to them on a plate, so no tears there.Generally though, there's more than enough moments to make you jump, scream and possibly even relieve yourself (Go to the the bathroom before you watch, or at LEAST wear appropriate attire). The bleak ending made a nice change, too.And doesn't the Statue Of Liberty look quite fetching, without a head? What a bold new look... 6/10",Cloverfield

The movement of the camera bothered me when trying to keep focus. I did enjoy the aspect of the monster of this movie. Very apocalyptic that point. I would like it better if the point of view was not first person feel. I would rather this film was more shot from a third person or multiple angles. Not good for me. Ok movie.",Cloverfield

Suffice it to say, I enjoyed it, and would watch it again.The special effects are decent, as is the acting of the wholly unknown talent on display.The film is short enough not to become boring - it keeps your attention, whilst at the same time thrilling and scaring you. The editing is very different, as it appears to have been filmed on a camcorder, giving the whole film a tint of realism, allowing the audience to suspend its disbelief just that little bit more.Overall, if you hate shaky cameras, don't watch it. Out of all the monster movies that have ever been created though, this one is pretty good.",Cloverfield

335,Gambitt,Like totally SWEEET! 12 stars out of 10!!,4,21 November 2008,"I gotta admit, man, when I saw those ads, I was all like dude this is gonna RAAWK! And my bro Fiz was like ""its all whacked!"" and I was like ""No fool! this is for real!"" And then their were these leaked clips on the Net and I was like: man, they didn't want us to see these leaked clips but now i seen them and I gotta see this movie cuz it's gonna BLOW my mind and Totally RAWWK!! Anyway, the movie was all about ROb and his bro and New York and the monster. Like Rob starts out with Beth, but at dis party Beth is with Ben, who doesn't like ROb and Rob doesn't like him, but Rob is going to Japan and Rob still likes Beth but so, I felt so like I could relate to Rob and Beth. And Hud and Rob's bro's girl. I so cared for them. They were SUCH great characters. Really profund people. Like me.And then the MONSTER attacks and man is it WICKED!! He smashes everything and the ARMY comes to in to waste him and they can't cuz he RAWKS! And ROb is like, we gotta save Beth and the others are like no we can't. And Rob is like YES we IS.And then the chick Marlena who Hud likes (Hud is the one with the camera(and he is like serious friends with Rob (Hud is like so funny, man, because he's like slow and dumb!))) Anyway, Marlena is attacked by a monster spider and is bitten by the spider monster and she totally completely EXPLODES! When I saw that, I stood up and was all like ""AW YEA!"" until the peeps behind told me to sit down and shut up.Anyway, the movie is filmed with a hand-held cam, just like I have for Youtube and the Internet! It's SOO real and new and I feel like I can relate because I am part of the Youtube generation, and I'm all like, yea that could be me in the movie-- they are just like ME. The WHOLE TIME we're all like, what is going' on?--this is SO COOL! It was just plain hands down AWESOME!! And for those of you all sayin that this is just like Blair Witch movie, you're DEAD WRONG, man!! Blair Witch was Completely different. Blair Witch was about a witch. Cloverfield is about a MONSTER! Blair witch was in the woods, which is not New York city, except for the part where they are in Central Park which is sorta like the woods except fewer trees.My only downfall was like how it was only 85 minutes long. They could of got like at least 3 hours more of this. An I have no idea what the monster really was.So anyway, here's the deal: THIS movie RAWKS and I would definitely recommend it. If yur a cool dude like me (YEA!) and you dig EXTREME flicks, then you'll Definitely love Cloverfield. 12 stars out of 10 stars, man!",Cloverfield
336,Anyanwu,"Monsters Return, Yes!",8,19 January 2008,"Let's start out with this. This is an 8 out of 10 film. And yes, I will see it again. It's really great to see the standard monster come back to horror. Outside of The Host we have missed the creation of a really good monster movie and this is it. Like The Host, somewhat, the concentration of the film is from ordinary people, who are a few in millions being attacked. It does not take the stance of ""the authorities"" and follow where the monster came from and how it can be killed. See Godzilla. But the key to the film is the camera. As has been talked about much about Cloverfield, the Blair Witch perspective does much to lend a sense of claustrophobia and hence extreme tenseness to watch the film. Blair Witch & Cloverfield really concentrate your attention to the fact that you do not have peripheral vision. The camera acts as your eyes. Your normal eye sight allows you to have peripheral vision. Now the camera, in Blair Witch & Cloverfield, having replaced your eyes allows you to see like your real eyes but with the peripheral sight taken away. Your overall vision reduced, makes you very tense and uncertain of even what's right next to you. That's what you feel in Cloverfield. Get some horse blinders and walk around for a day and see how uncertain you feel. That's the visceral response that you get. The camera is greatly used also in the reveal of the monster. You never really get a good look, much like the first Alien film. That also heightens the tension. The dialogue is just enough to keep the pace going. Without the dialogue, the urgency in the voice, the pace of the film would be slower. Just the action alone would make it more difficult to maintain the frantic pace needed. Of course my only knocks on the film are the traditional. Women crying and emotional. Do all women cry and get emotional in the face of danger? Naw. See 28 Days. The sappy parts do slow down the film even if it's just a little bit. Looking into your lover's eyes can wait. Death is near and it could be a painful, ugly one. Get out! Why don't people run like hell when they can obviously see that what is coming is bigger and badder than they could ever comprehend? People run!! This is something terrible. Go See Cloverfield!",Cloverfield

Think some reviewers don't like it as it's a found-footage movie, but that doesn't detract from it, it makes it all the more better. Hud is so funny during the movie and you really get the feeling that there's a serious disaster that has went on and you're witnessing it first hand. Bravo, guys",Cloverfield
338,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,Behold the Revolutionary Movie,8,17 September 2008,"This film felt like a nice little adventure. Although not a very long film, it sparked many surprises throughout. In the time of Zombies, Vampires, and King Kong/Godzilla remakes, This is a monster movie of it's own genre. That part with the Statue of Liberty head flying through the street and landing on cars was awesome. It gave me a sense of vulnerability watching the movie seeing how we could really be affected by a 500 foot monster. There wasn't a Ripley-type-hero around to gun this nemesis down, and that was the thrill of this science fiction/pseudo horror film. That first person camera view point was very ingenious. Cloverfield is centered on normal human beings who are bewildered and are struggling to survive and evacuate New York City by real world means. The props were realistic and the ""reality camera concept"" really pulled this movie off. The only thing disappointing about Cloverfield is the ending. I guess J.J. Abrams wanted to keep us guessing and maybe hint the audience of a possible sequel. But I really wish I knew what happened to the survivors.While it might not make the Oscars. I anticipated its greatness and it delivered as promised. This is definitely an inspirational setup for future movies to come. I recommend it for all audiences.",Cloverfield
339,antony-1,A shot in the arm of cinema; an amazing achievement,9,2 February 2008,"Wow. That's largely how I can sum up this movie. Wow.I was worried about spoilers and, whipped up into the viral marketing frenzy, trotted off to see this movie as soon as was out. Funnily enough there's not a lot be spoilt about. The trailer showed you the Statue of Liberty's head being smashed off as something attacks New York, and that is pretty much it. What it at excels at though, and what could not really be spoiled by spoilers, is the way the film is executed.The story is slightly slow in the setup because you sit there thinking ""get exploding!"" but then it grabs hold of your hand and yanks you from scene to scene. Never letting up. I have not been that on the edge of my seat in ages. Goose bumps were on my arms as the film progressed, and as it brought you into the characters' lives so expertly that you start to forget that it's a film.Well maybe that's a bit of hyperbole, to forget that it's a film, but it's so nice to have such a raw film that doesn't have the trappings of normal big movies. No music, no familiar faces... it really did allow one to be swept up in. And it's only when I watch this that I realise how much stuff is added to the average movie that breaks the suspension of disbelief. It's as if Cloverfield stripped away all the tricks of a normal film, and took you to the raw story. It almost makes me annoyed at all the other false, packaged movies out there! Even (I realise this is a weird example, but I feel it sums it up well) they walk through some doors and they are covered in fingerprints. In any movie they'd be polished to the hilt, to ensure they look perfect on screen and to ensure everything looks 'right'. But this is about realism, that someone truly has just grabbed a camera, and it adds to that feeling of reality. It's so nice to have none of the normal trappings of star names, orchestral scores and poncy director camera work.Sadly not everyone gets this. I notice some reviewers criticising the movie for not saying where the monster came from etc. That's a typical response created by movies as they are. They must be flawless, and structured, and answer things. People want them to lead them from A to B to C and tell them that Mr Bad did it, and Mr Bad dies when Mr Good kills him. Films must be able to do what we can't do as humans... go to places quickly in the next frame, invade people's lives like a fly on the wall. Whereas Cloverfield does away with all that. It treats you as if you were there, and you will get NO special treatment because you're watching a movie. It's what makes the movie.Being swept into caring about the characters is quite gradual too. I didn't realise it was even happening, but as it goes on you do increasingly care for them. Their shock and horror is felt by you. And by the other audience members too, I could hear gasps and shouts in the audience as they like me got swept along.It continues this great pace and involvement right up to the end. I was worried about how it would end, but much like the rest of the movie it was done superbly. The ending was sublime, so well done, and a great end to a great cinema experience.My final comment is to watch this in the cinema. If you watch it at home, in your comfortable home, with lights on, and you pause it to get a drink etc. you'll ruin the atmosphere. Watching it at the cinema thrusts you in it. The pace is set, and you can't stop it. And there was something about the tone of the film that really suited watching it with strangers all around me. So please, watch it in the cinema and be prepared for one of the most thrilling films to grace our screens.",Cloverfield
340,jake-179,Great monster movie,7,19 January 2008,"Cloverfield is a good monster movie. That is what it is, and that is all it is. I loved the ""monster movie"" music over the end titles. That was great. Really good track. Obviously, this movie was done in the ""Blair Witch"" style, but with awesome 3D effects. I will mention that at the end of the movie, as the credits began to roll, the audience was definitely disappointed. But that does not reflect my assessment of the movie. I liked it, and it was strange for me to hear the groans of the other patrons. They seemed really angry. So I will say that if you are not a fan of the genre, or if you don't ""get"" what the movie is trying to do, then you will not like it.But the movie is genuinely entertaining. It has a particularly scary part inside the subway tunnel with the night vision feature of the hand held camcorder. It reminded me of the terrifying sequence in a subway tunnel in ""28 Weeks Later."" I loved it, and I felt that the director did a great job with suspense and action.The movie is scary, it has great effects, good acting, and a good story line. I think that most people are not going to appreciate the thrill ride like I did. I recommend the movie, but I recommend going into it with an open mind.",Cloverfield
341,badgrrlkane,Great Monster Movie!,9,26 January 2008,Very cool monster movie w/hout the hokey bs you see in many monster films today.This one is a step above.Featuring mainly no name actors except for Mike Vogel & to most he is a no name actor this was acted very well & was downright frightening at times especially for being a PG-13 rated film. The monster was way huge & destructive & it's spider like symbiotes were equally as disturbing. Would've been better had it been R rated but was very well written.Drew Goddard of Buffy The Vampire Slayer fame wrote the screenplay & it was probably the first thrilling film I've seen this year. I was apprehensive about seeing it at first but was persuaded & am very glad I 've now seen it. I also like the fact you never knew if the monster was from space or the ocean's depths. Is left open for a sequel.**** out of *****,Cloverfield
342,daddysarm,Enjoyable but with 3 caveats,5,14 October 2017,"3. The opening strongly implies that most or all of the main characters will die before the film ends. That kills a lot of the suspense. I know some people feel more strongly about it, because those people think they need to ""care about"" the characters to enjoy a film. I don't need that. As long as the characters aren't vicious or completely stupid or annoying, I can still enjoy the film. 2. Speaking of ANNOYING characters, the guy who ended up ""narrating"" much of the film, Hud, is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen. Hud may be the MOST ANNOYING character ever, who was above the age of 14 & not constantly screaming. 1. The level of idiocy of the guy going up to ?Central Park South? to rescue his ""girlfriend"" is hard to comprehend. His odds? Zilch. His payoff. Nada. Listen, by the time he made that decision, it was obvious NYC was history. Go to Tokyo. Find yourself a nice Japanese girl. Seriously. Get the heck out of there.

344,pazu7,"Big, fun, loud, adrenaline rush with 3 minor problems (spoilers)",6,19 January 2008,"When I first saw the TV spots for this film I knew I was going to see it. I got the premise: Blair Witch meets Godzilla... or whatever the heck that was. Cool. It was worth staying up for the midnight showing and I had a good time. But I really had to work to get past a few strategic faults. Since this film requires the viewer engage their own imagination to be truly effective, any break in suspension of disbelief sort of kills the moment. I know this is Monday morning quarterbacking, but:Problem 1. Character Context. Why not make the protags a news crew on assignment or some kids doing an amateur shoot in the street when they get caught up in the attack. It would have made more sense than the going away party scenario and the camera handlers dedication to catching the action would have been more logical. It would have also provided an excuse for more concise narration. They could have still kept the romantic back story, just put it in the context of a film crew. And speaking of back story:Problem 2. Cumbersome Back Story. Like in Blair Witch this film requires the viewer to participate in the illusion and it can be much more engaging because of that. But when they have to keep developing the romantic back story it strains credulity. Their method was clever, the bits of erased tape etc... and in the conclusion of the film it provided an emotional note. But it was a bit overplayed, gave the protag a frantic Ahab tone, and some of the tension and illusion gets strained during their rescue mission and in it's IMO overplayed conclusion.Problem 3 The Pay Off Shot. One of the big complaints about Blair Witch is that there was no pay off shot, you never saw whatever was killing everybody. I understand the appeal of the final visual, but IMO that is the mistake here. The monster in your imagination is always worse than the one you see. So the initial chaotic shots we saw of the monster and it's creepy off spring.... or whatever they were... were perfect. Established it's horrific majesty and maintained the illusion that this was actually happening. But then they give the pay off shot right at the end. Bad move IMO. It diminished the beast in my eye and ruined the illusion of reality.But all that not withstanding, it was still a lot of fun. Major adrenaline. 8 for concept. 6 for execution. Make sure the theater has ample sub woofers for full effect.",Cloverfield
345,Mihnea_aka_Pitbull,A masterful piece of work,9,23 January 2008,"It's not surprising that the below average viewers can't grasp the subtleties and professional finesse of ""Cloverfield"". The movie recourses deliberately to a tacky cliché (the invincible crocosaurus attacking Manhattan) and, by combining it with the minimalistic view pushed to the extreme (the 100% adoption of an amateur video-cam perspective, ""Blair Witch Project""-like), creates a very interesting, dramatic and significant aesthetic formula. The deconstructivist recipe works artfully and skillfully in this case. The suspense is extremely well built up, the thrills abound, and let me tell you: no matter I'm a 48 years old movie professional who watched and coldly analyzed most of the best thrillers, SF, horror and action movies of all times, ""Cloverfield"" REALLY gave me the creeps! One final piece of advice: Are you ready for a breath-taking experiment? Go see ""Cloverfield"". Are you the sub-mediocre viewer, looking for cheap thrills? ""Alien vs. Predator: Requiem"" will bring you the much desired visual orgasm.",Cloverfield
346,tomb_92,Interesting and thrilling. Really worth it,8,15 April 2010,"I was really surprised by how much I actually liked this film. The ""mockumentary"" style was really well done. As a result of course characterisation suffers and there is a lack of plot, but I don't care, because that's the point. You're not supposed to get bogged-down with all the whys and wherefores, because you're seeing it through the eyes of one of the characters and as a consequence there is no need for any of that. I really did enjoy it. There was a good atmoshpere surrounding it. I just felt uneasy all the way through like there was never anything quite right even when all seemed well and good. I've heard I lot of complaints about the ending, but I don't mind. If you think about it it's kind of obvious what was going to happen anyway- you're seeing through the camera held by one of the characters, so how did you get the camera? Really well made, I really enjoyed it. It's something different.",Cloverfield
347,aeo,Terrible movie!,1,6 February 2008,"Wow! I thought Blair Witch Project sucked but this movie brings suckiness to a whole new level. First, I am not a fan of the 'Blair Witch' movie where you see the movie from the point of view of the person who is holding the camcorder. As you might expect, the movie shakes A lot. Now I heard from people and on the news that some people vomited and even fainted in the movie theaters because the erratic movie shots made them dizzy. I was not one of them. However, 'Blair Witch' type movies do annoy me. This movie feels like an indie movie but it's not because millions of dollars have been poured into this piece of dirt.The story is about a group of twenty somethings in New York City and one of them is going to Japan because he got a promotion. They throw a going away party where one of their friends shoots the event on his camcorder. During this party, there is an explosion many blocks away. They all go out and the head of Statue of Liberty falls onto their street. Then they see some sort of giant alien but don't know what it is since the movie only shows couple of seconds of it. Then there is more explosion. The power goes off. They see the military fighting it. The people try to escape on the Brooklyn Bridge but it collapse and some of the friends don't make it. Then they try to go and rescue a girl/friend who is in the alien attack area. They find her alive and try to escape on a military helicopter but the aliens attack it and they fall back on to the ground. They survive but the one who is carrying camcorder gets attacked. I think he is killed. I'm not sure because I was about throw my popcorn at this crappy movie along with what was left of my soda drink. The friends take the camcorder and take off to who knows where. The End.The only good thing about this movie was that the aliens looked cool.",Cloverfield
348,starlit-sky,Blairwitch Meets Godzilla Meets War of the Worlds,6,22 August 2010,"Most simply put, this movie is a combination of Blair Witch, War of the Worlds and Godzilla. It begins with the familiar concept (which is starting to become cliché) that the following events actually happened and video tapes were discovered. Then the audience start to watch the video tapes which are shot in the hand-held camera style (again, Blair Witch style). New York city is under attack but we don't get to see the attackers, this unknown element does bring some suspense to the story. Then we discover *spoiler* that it is a gigantic creature (kind of like Godzilla) from outer space that is attacking the city. That, in a nutshell, sums up the movie. Even though I didn't get bored and watched until the end, I don't think the movie offers anything original other than bringing good ideas from the past movies into one plot. Special effects look more impressive on film shot with hand-held camera style. This is the best part of the movie. Story is very basic and like I said nothing new about it. The movie deserves a rating between 6-6.5 .",Cloverfield

Written by Drew Goddard.Directed by Matt Reeves.This is a movie that I've heard about but never got round to watching.I wouldn't say it was a truly scary movie, I didn't find it too scary, I didn't even get creeped out even though I watched it alone with the lights out.But it is really good. It gripped me from the beginning and it's real edge of your seat stuff. It's more exciting and entertaining than it is scary and it's a great twist on the old monster movies. It's like King Kong or Godzilla but an up to date and darker version. You just get to know the main characters enough to keep the whole thing going without getting bogged down with back story. You don't always know what is going on or which character is which but I guess that was intended because of the chaos that develops in the plot.The whole thing is allegorical of 9/11 just like Godzilla was apparently allegorical of the Hiroshima attacks and even some of the outside shots were based on TV footage from the tragedy. For me this movie worked although it's probably not everybody's cup of tea. The monster was well designed and the cinematography was terrific.A fun movie.9/10",Cloverfield
350,tyranid_slayer,2008 of to GR8 start,9,9 February 2008,"Hi it's the 14 year old film fanatic again and this is my review on cloverfield.To review this film i'm going to have to go back to july 2007: Me and a friend went to t go see the first showing of transformers, and me being film fanatic i could name every film trailer that was showing. But. This random trailer came on. I knew nothing about it and i'm sure other people were wondering what this was as well. The trailer showed a party then rumbling then explosions and a familiar head rolling down the street. After that it said 1-18-08 from producer j.j. Abrams. And then from the short space of silence between that trailer all anyone could hear was whispers of confusion ""Godzilla, Blair witch knock off, Lost spin off, Cthulu."" I had made the assumption that it was Godzilla but much more deep. But i would love the idea of Cthulu as i love lovecraftian. After that it was an internet frenzy, viral website, tie-ins, fake sites and crazy rumours that the story was gods versus aliens.But then the new trailer came out and finally after 6 months Cloverfield is here and i've just come back from seeing it.In case you haven't already guessed the film is about a giant monster attacking the city of new york. It's shot in the same hand-held camera style as the Blair witch and it documents a small group of people trying to save a friend and escape Manhattan.First of all there are loves and hates about the style of shooting. The loves is that the fact that it's shot through a hand-held digi-cam adds that sense of true depth rather than seeming really hollywoodised. Also there are no opening credits, just bunch of numbers and strange TV symbols explaining the film is a document in an event designated cloverfield. That one thing makes it seem like it's true and adds to it's expanded universe. But the one major problem is flashing strobe lights but mostly the shaky camera which at certain points makes you stop eating popcorn 'cause your feeling travel sick.The effects. Well for a film made in entire secrecy it's a massive surprise. By looking at it you would think you would know someone was making a film on a massive scale. It was relatively low budget but it was made great. Great tense moments like the Brooklyn bridge snapping in half etc. almost seemed epic and mega expensive. The monster. I'm not going to go into details of what the monster looks like. But i thought it would follow the tradition of ""Less is more"" But it didn't and you got to see the monster up close and it looks amazing.The acting truly is deep and you have a feeling for the characters. Even though you can understand their situation you understand they're misfortune.Once the film came to it's rather dull ending. (True love conquers all) You can't help but stand up and clap, i applauded at this film it was amazingly made, deep, and it wasn't clichéd or exaggerated and was a new gust of fresh air.The allegations of the 9/11 allusions are almost annoying. And i don't mean to offend anyone who is connected to 9/11 i sympathise but comparing mass murdering suicide bombers to a fictional CGI monster is ludicrous.The ending of the film did eventually put me off that the two remaining characters, who are each others love interest die in each others arms screaming i love you. But if you have the patience to sit through the credits like i did then you will get an extra surprise.Definitely worth your time and has been my favourite film of 2008 so far.",Cloverfield

Basically the style of the film was fascinatingly cool, the innovation created is a piece of eye-catching flick from the moment you start to watch the film. Although I believe some where vexed with the fashion of the movie, but they sure do doesn't know how to appreciate an impressively imaginative film. Primarily I have no complete idea of what would be the central cause of the stories major conflict, it was indeed exciting and makes you sit still on your couch and expect the unexpected. But to be honest, I thought of it as a frequent bunch of maturely adult friendship story that focuses on their self issues and try to narrowly solve a relationship coma, and then suddenly an outbreak of unexplainable war-like-fare boomed out of the blue causing awe and panic all over Manhattan. Later, however we come to understand the causes and main point of the story, thus I sparingly conceive what the tag line says ""something has found us"", then a huge monster appear in a blur from devastated store's tvs stormed by petty thieves out for their own egotistical interests.Then the impact from our faces? Trepidation and astonishment, as is. Then the story goes on, its not boring and I would admit I appreciated so much the film from its skin and core. Deserves a ten.",Cloverfield
352,Red_Flag,This beastie could teach Godzilla a thing or two.,8,8 June 2008,"The trailer was amazing, the buzz was huge, the end result is admirable. Cloverfield isn't without its flaws however and there are some massive plot holes but such cant dull down the sheer voracity of the film. Blaring with sound and visuals make Cloverfield an utterly surreal experience. It's more like a roller-coaster than movie. Taking you on a momentous journey that differs from the underground to towering skyscrapers. The truth is that Cloverfield is always enjoyable. There is not one moment throughout that you won't be balancing on the edge of your seat.The realism displayed throughout the film mainly comes from the was its been shot. The shaky camera technique last seen in The Blair Witch Project allows full exploration of New York after An alien attack with no exceptions. This is free form film making at its very best. A few questions do come up during the movie. For example the perplexing condition known as the virus that pops up for a brief moment but is never fully explained and I'm sure it will make for an interesting premise for the inescapable sequel. Still when the thing that should be festering in your mind is the high octane and brilliantly relentless action, you'll find that the unexplained infection keeps on coming back to you. It's also a shame that the trailer for Cloverfield is substantially scarier than the final result. Those who were expecting an adrenalin filled experience will be pleased those expecting a sophisticated horror won't.There's also the small matter of a rather unsatisfying third act. Sure the film does need to calm down eventually but the ending is worryingly abrupt. I hear critics complain about the wafer thin plot, sure I'm not denying that but clearly those very critics have never seen a B-movie before. The wafer thin plot simply allows for more action sequences, a good thing if you ask me. And you're reading my review so ill assume you are.Producer J.J. Abrams teams with writer Drew Goddard and director Matt Reeves for this frenetic tale of a powerful destructive force that descends upon New York City, and the four desperate survivors who put their lives on the line to embark on a perilous rescue mission.As for our beastie, no signs of CGI suffocation that the far inferior I am Legend suffered from, and what makes it even better is our monster is truly frightening. The very symbolism of 21st Century apocalyptic nature. Don't be fooled by the overlong and often boring opening in. It will start soon enough. And with a rather short 87 minutes you'll wonder how it packed so much action into such a short space of time.A surreal, tense but most of all relentless cinematic experience. Following in the footsteps of The Blair Witch Project allowing far more freedom to explore the sheer devastation of New York after an alien invasion. Some questions are left unanswered but noting too major witch means you can get on and enjoy the film",Cloverfield
353,FilmFanatic03,Surprisingly brilliant!,8,17 October 2010,"I understand why people may be sceptical of this film as it is shot entirely in hand held camera format. But i think it is this style of filmmaking that made this film special. ""Cloverfield"" is full of suspense, action, emotion and cool CGI effects. I think the hand held camera format was very unique to the film as it made the characters more authentic and real. When they cried, or laughed, or ran for their lives you could connect to them as the format made it feel like it was a documentation of a real life event and not fictionalised by the conventional shots used for an action film. It felt like watching a home movie of something that happened so you could connect with the characters. That's what i love about this film. You go on a journey with the characters as they try to save their friend back in the city. I loved the ending as well as it really fitted with the format of the film. You see rubble fall on the surviving characters and the screen to blacked out by the rubble but then the film then cuts to the footage of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date before the disaster saying they are having a great day, this is a great sense of irony. Unfortunely there were few uses of blasphemy and bad language which tainted the film for me. Overall a very different and interesting film.",Cloverfield
354,tonyjackie,Unoriginal and annoying as hell,2,17 June 2008,"Rarely have I been so bemused by comments on IMDb about a film as I have with this one.'Jaw dropping','Awesome' are just a couple of the reviews that I read.I have just watched this film and feel compelled to give it the lowest mark I have ever given.Why?Because it is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen and extremely unoriginal.Hand held camera?'Blair Witch'.Monster attacking New York?'King Kong','Godzilla'.Some of the scenes are even lifted straight from the 9/11 attacks.I got the impression that a lot of the dialogue was off the cuff and unscripted.This really didn't work at all and became irritating and poorly acted.Yes,the effects are OK but if ever a film needed more that just nice effects it was this one.It lasts less than 90 minutes but still felt way too long.It really didn't work for me on any level and don't even get me started on the first 20 minutes!Boy,what a crowd.My brother used to mess around with tapes when he was younger and try to tell spooky stories using incredibly basic sound effects.He was about thirteen at the time and this film constantly reminded me of those tapes.My brother's efforts were more original and had much better story lines.'Cloverfield' made pots of money but it is a very poor relation to many much better earth under attack movies of the past.It even rates a 7.5 on IMDbs overall score.Like I said earlier,I am completely bemused.",Cloverfield
355,Lele,I was there with those people...,10,18 October 2014,"I missed this movie when it was released six years ago. Now I've just finished watching it on DVD and my hands are still trembling as I type these notes, really! And I am 56 and I watched tons of movies like this, from ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" (1953) to the last ""Godzilla"" (2014) But this beats them all. This is definitely the best Gojira-like movie I've ever seen.I watched it on DVD with my laptop and headphones, to not disturb my wife and daughter who were sleeping.Friends, I was there with those poor guys! I was out of breath as they were; and my heart was pounding like their; and I was disgusted as they were... and crying when they did (a bit in the ending, actually :)The best way to watch this movie: your laptop on your stomach, headphones on and watch the DVD!Hello everyone :)10/10",Cloverfield
356,Mike Astill,A fantastic monster movie!,8,18 July 2008,"Let's get this out of the way right now. If you don't like monster movies, you're probably better off not bothering with this.If you ARE a fan of monster movies, this is probably what you've been waiting for - a genuine attempt to reinvigorate a genre that's considered something of a bad joke (by movie snobs at least). Emmerich tried it with Godzilla a few years back and, while that was a good monster movie, it fell victim to pompous reviewers who clearly didn't have a clue what they were supposed to be enjoying. Similar comments seem to be getting fired at this movie, by people who unfortunately are not prepared to suspend their disbelief for a mere 80 minutes.Their loss.Cloverfield tries a different tack than your standard monster movie. With perhaps a nod towards Korean flick 'The Host', the movie focuses on the humans rather than the beast. It's all shot from the point of view of one of a group of (rather tedious) party guests, who tasks himself with capturing events as they occur on a camcorder. What we're witness to is everything that you usually get in a monster flick, but from this unique aspect - the merest glimpses of the creature to start with, followed by mass panic and, eventually, the wholesale destruction of a famous city and its national monuments.The nature of the film being played back from camcorder footage allows for a couple of neat tricks, and an ending that raises a smile while at the same time being quite poignant.The film - at a brisk 80 minutes - offers little backstory or exposition, which is something of a relief. While dry explanations and dubious scientific mumbo-jumbo are a monster movie staple, I can live without them, and they had no place in this particular movie. If you need to know more, there are a number of websites you can have fun with, and apparently a manga, that chart the lead up to the attack.It's a brave movie that destroys New York in such a fashion these days, but I for one heaved a sigh of relief. Filmmakers should never be afraid to trash a national monument or even a whole city for fear of being insensitive, and in this genre it's nothing less than essential. I personally believe the film's choice of location is a bullish 'F you' to the idea of post-attack skittishness affecting media, rather than some kind of tasteless metaphor.Bottom line, I had a lot of fun with this, and I'll be watching it again real soon.Keep watching the credits to hear a fantastic, if slightly cheeky, monster movie theme.",Cloverfield
357,azeemnavarro,A fun ride through NY,6,24 August 2019,"Yes, this is a fun found footage-monster invasion film. Unfortunately, is just that, fun.
While I totally understand why people we're so hyped about this movie back in 2008 and why they ended it loving it (myself included but years after it's release), now that I rewatched it, I have to say that it has a lot of problems.
The main complaint that everyone has while watching a found footage is ""why the hell this guy keeps filming this? Drop the camera and run dude!"", and yes it applies for Cloverfield too. The character behind the camera has no real reason to keep filming, in some instances it's extremely ridiculous that the guy is still recording. And talking about that guy...the writter couldn't write him to be even more hateful? The guy is annoying at the point that you ask yourself if he has mental problems or something, even his so called bests friends can't stand him.
Now that I mention his friends, they're not that great either. The motivation of our main character is as thin as a piece of paper, even if I was in that situation I would not risk my life or the life of my brother and friends just to try to save my ex, I mean he really loved her because even when his brother dies he shows zero emotion. I blame that the characters are not so likable more on the part of the scrip that on the acting (except for you camera guy).
But if we ignore those aspects a little bit while watching the movie you have a very enjoyable monster feature. The design of the creature is very original and creative, they did an amazing job at giving America a monster that is not King Kong. The action scenes keep you interesting on what's going on, and cosidering that the movie is so short, you find yourself glued at the scream until the movie finishes.
So yeah, don't think too much about it or the magic will be loss in the way. A high 6/10 for this one.",Cloverfield
358,charliep14,Cool Rewrite of Godzilla,6,10 July 2016,"When you see this in 2016, the first thing that jumps at you is the found film footage: this concept has simply aged badly. The camera work is voluntary choppy etc. but we've seen it so many times by now that it's old and stale. By 2008 it wasn't exactly revolutionary either - that's really the main issue with Cloverfield. It's a shame because it is a cool rewrite of the classic Godzilla concept: the monster is cool, the FX are cool, the cast is cool... lots of things to like really. It does follow the tropes: idiot characters going upstream to find a girlfriend, lots of carnage... but it works. To be honest, I think I prefer the sequel: it's cleverer but this is still a cool way to spend a Sunday afternoon.",Cloverfield
359,pninson,It Almost Works,4,20 July 2008,"The first 17 minutes of this movie are excruciatingly dull. After the first three minutes I was leafing through a magazine (I rented this, of course). There's a long party scene, but this is no GODFATHER or DEER HUNTER. A group of 20-somethings are holding a going-away party for a friend, and there's interminable footage of people gossiping and behaving normally. This is as interesting as watching your coat hang on the wall.Finally, there's a big boom, and the action starts. The gimmick is that the guy videotaping the party keeps the video going, even when he's running for his life. Not only is this hard to swallow, but the camera zooms all over the place, or sits tilted to one side. The idea is obviously a gonzo monster movie, a you-are-there cross between GODZILLA and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.There are moments when this comes off, or almost comes off. You don't get a very good luck at the monster, or the little monsters that it generates. Nothing is explained, which I consider a plus; since none of the characters know what's happening, the audience doesn't need to know either. We're supposed to share in the characters' confusion and panic.The reason it doesn't really work is that the characters are bland and vapid, the cinema verité effect of the wildly gyrating camera is more annoying than anything else, and there's nothing original in the script or the plot. It's routine fare.It's OK for killing 90 minutes on a slow afternoon, but I have a lot of sympathy for anyone who managed to sit through this in a theater. This is definitely rental fodder.",Cloverfield
360,23skidoo-4,"A well done film, but slow to start",8,23 April 2008,"Although I never bought into the whole Blair Witch phenomena, I still enjoy unusual ""point of view"" films, whether they be simulated newscasts like Special Bulletin and Without Warning, or films like Cloverfield that let you make-believe that you're in some awful alternate universe watching actual documentary footage of an apocalypse.I never saw Cloverfield in the theatre, just on DVD, but I get the feeling the film plays a lot better on the small screen. After all, it is built around home-video footage and that's not the type of stuff really intended for the big screen. As such, it's quite an absorbing ride. I've heard people complain about plot holes, and things being unexplained, etc. I just read one professional review that says the film should have broken away from the first-person occasionally. These types of complaints obviously miss the entire point of the film. The characters never got any answers, so why should we? (At least, not until the sequel!)I do have to complain a little about the first 15 minutes or so. I really dislike the ""character building"" prologues that seem to be obligatory in so many disaster films. I've seen some movies (Towering Inferno comes to mind) that go damn near an hour before the actual main event happens. So often these scene-setters are pretty dull, and Cloverfield's is no exception, save for a couple of funny moments and the introduction of Marlena. Especially with a movie like this, I think a quicker ""cut to the chase"" would have been a better idea, and any character building could have been handled either by the characters as they progressed through the crisis (a good example of one such moment in the film is Marlena joking with Hud about Superman and Garfield), or by simply expanding on the plot point that once in awhile we see an earlier section of tape recorded about a month earlier. The cast do the best they can with what is, by its very nature, very limiting material. Lizzy Caplan's Marlena is a standout character who I wish was given more to do (the actress reminds me very much if Moira Kelly in a few scenes, too), and Michael Stahl-David does a great job as Rob Hawkins (I wonder if it's intentional or a coincidence that the character has the same name as Rob Hawkins in another end-of-the-world production, Jericho?). And TJ Miller as Hud, despite spending most of the time behind the camera, manages to be both ""documenter"" and comic relief in some pretty dire circumstances.Incidentally they missed a bet with the DVD; instead of keeping the film in its theatrical ""filmized"" look, I was hoping it would revert back to the original video look, which would have made things look even more realistic. Oh well.According to the DVD, JJ Abrams was inspired by Gojira. He was also obviously inspired by 9/11 (the scene where the heroes take refuge in a store from an advancing wall of collapsed- building dust is almost beat-for-neat identical to footage I remember of a similar take-cover situation on 9/11. Will Cloverfield be remembered as a document responding to a traumatic event, the way Gojira/Godzilla was a direct response to Hiroshima and Nagasaki? There's no way to tell right now. It will be remembered as one heck of a monster movie, and a noble (if not always 100% successful) experiment in film-making.",Cloverfield
361,xxxxxdarkmoon,It feels like being right there,7,5 May 2021,"I just watched Cloverfield for the 2nd time after a few years, and I got to say: wow - this is great entertainment in the first place. A science-fiction-horror found footage that doesn't scare the viewers to death, that doesn't use gruesomeness and gore in order to create tension. There isn't a single boring minute in the movie after 15 minutes of introduction of the characters. Suddenly there is non-stop action and excitement. It feels like being right there, witnessing the chaos and panic. And there are really good visual effects.One critique point: the guy who was picked for the job of filming the party, must have been the worst choice of all persons in the party. Apparently, the worst choice in the whole city of New York. He never holds the camera still when it's needed. Never. Not for even 2 seconds. Even for a found footage, it is too shaky.The characters are half-drunken annoying people, but that's just their roles. I like the look of Lizzy Caplan. She looks gorgeous - so sweet - wow.Cloverfield deserves 7 stars at minimum.",Cloverfield

363,pmdawn,An Intense Ride.,9,4 April 2008,"Wow. I just saw this movie and I'm pleasantly surprised. Cloverfield is like a roller-coaster ride, but a damn fun one.This is not a specially original movie, because it borrows ideas from ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""War Of The Worlds"", ""The Host"", ""Children of Men"" and others. But it does so in a way that creates an incredibly entertaining and intense experience.There's a bit of a plot, but you really shouldn't be reading about this movie before you see it. The less you know, the better. But I'll say that the ending was pretty fitting, specially for a movie like this.This movie has chaos all written over it, but we get so involved with the characters that we feel that we're with them in that situation, and you can't help but understand the character's actions, even if they seem irrational at times.I really loved Cloverfield. And although my head still hurts, the experience was definitely worth it. For something similar in style and quality, try to watch the Spanish movie ""REC"".",Cloverfield
364,jcallows,"Pretty good, despite the gimmicky camera work.",7,26 November 2008,"In this day and age of reality TV and reality TV style shaky camera work, here's another film that just says ""me too"" all over it. A cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla pretty much sums up this film. Now I'm not a big fan of this style of camera work but I've been able to put up with it in many of today's films because it's been used sparingly. But this film not only uses it, it takes it to the extreme. I understand this film tries to add realism by using this technique but aren't there other ways to to this? Ways that don't cause migraines?Anyway, despite the occasional headaches, this film is pretty good. I'm especially impressed by the visual effects. The monster and destruction of Manhattan all look very real. I'm especially impressed by the relatively small budget on which this was made. The effects is comparable or even better than those made on a much larger budget. So, the interesting story and characters and kick-ass special effects make this film worth watching.",Cloverfield

367,MVictorPjinsiste,It Worked For Me,8,21 March 2009,"Cloverfield is the most memorable movie I saw lately. There are many comments here about the hand-held camera, so I will lay that aspect to rest, if only to underline that no regular hand-held camera can have such audio pickups. The movie is a treat on the ears, as one can hear the monster blundering around and trumpeting eerily all over the town.So this is not your everyday rampaging-giant-monster-attacking-the-town. In these types of movies, you always see the thing from above, after being lectured about the ""folly of man"". You feel omniscient, and safe. Well not here. Here, and up to the movie's very end, the spectator knows nothing about the thing, the harbinger of the End. Another interesting twist in the recording that was on the tape used to make the movie (and that we get to see when the new recording stops), images of unmarred happiness that contrast sharply with the apocalypse going on on the new recording. These moment are not only emotional and nostalgic, but it might also inadvertly reveal some clues. ""Clover"" itself is a freakish work of art, and it takes some time before the spectator can figure it out; A cross between a bat, a squid and a dinosaur, it also sheds deadly, fearsome parasites that can take on the characters on a more personal basis. This is a great idea. The new coming actors were great, and performing just in the right tone, no more, no less. The women in particular are insanely beautiful, but I believed them all the same. There were quite tough, too, and I seriously doubt that people could walk like that after a helicopter crash, for one, but it wasn't too distracting. The party scene at the start was a bit long, thought, but it did make for an almost unexpected attacks as I finally lend an interest to the little personal story that was developed there. I am pretty sure it isn't the last time we see ""Clover"" or its ilk; Clearly, the plot is a lot larger than what this microscopic outlook presented. There is a lot of the story we still haven't see. The musical score, which only takes place during the credits, is more fitting for a classical Japanese movie of this genre, but in its own right, it is also a classic. In conclusion, here is a movie worth talking about.",Cloverfield
368,Mustang92,Worst Movie of the Decade,1,20 October 2009,"Hey, I got an idea for a movie!!!1) Let's remake Godzilla! Even though monsters invading a city used to be popular like 40-50 years ago, it's a new generation!2) The monster in ""Alien"" was so cool and original, let's just copy that! We'll change it a little so we don't get labeled as ripping off that movie's creature. 3) Okay, well maybe the monster and it's spawn will have the same vocal sounds as the Aliens from ""Alien,"" but it's a new generation, the teenagers won't notice!4) Realism? What's realism? Even though the monster gets bazooka'd, and missile'd, and bombed, it won't die. Hey, if it's dies, there's no more story. Even though the monster isn't a titanium-skinned machine, it will be durable like one and nothing can hurt it. Not even direct hits by 500 pound bombs.5) To keep the suspense up, it will seem to follow our heroes around. Or at least it's spawn will. Spawn that can be defeated by hitting them with pipes. Or one direct hit with an ax. Hey, they're small, so an ax will kill one. Once grown, direct hits with 500 pound bombs can't even break the skin. Realism? What's realism?6) Hey, I got an idea! Let's have lots of encounters by our heroes with the monster and its spawn. Huh? Oh, okay, already said that in my idea above.7) Let's put our heroes in serious jeopardy: One will get bitten badly, and bleed a lot, but she'll have the presence of mind to ask her uninjured friend how she feels, having lost her boyfriend on the bridge to the monster a while back. Hmmm. That scene doesn't work? Not real, huh? Okay, let's cut it, we'll put it on the deleted scenes in the bonus material.At least we'll have Beth impaled by a steel building rod, that goes through her chest impaling her to the floor of her apartment. Very cool! Then we have her friends rescue her and un-impale her. Woohoo! Now she can join them. What? No, she won't bleed to death. Yeah, the steel rod may be 1/2"" thick, but if she bleeds to death, we can't kill her at the end. Right, no, she'll be able to run and physically keep up with the rest of her friends, as though nothing happened. It'll work, I promise!8) Hey, wouldn't it be cool to destroy Manhattan? Yeah! Okay, we'll have the monster do a lot of it, then we'll have missiles and bombs do more. I can't wait to see the CGI on this!!9) Oh, I got a another cool idea. Let's have most of our heroes die by the end. That's cutting edge, I tell ya. Very now and hip!10) What problems? I created ""Alias,"" a smart show that didn't last, so then I created ""Lost,"" a primetime soap opera with suspense and a monster, and people ate it up!!! People looove crap programming, so this monster movie of mine will be a hit!! I'm tellin' ya!11) Oh, I know what we'll do! To make sure this will sell, we'll shoot this ""Blair Witch"" style! Heroes shoot all their own footage and die at end, then camera & footage is found, and it'll be like we're watching history. Yeah!12) Oh, I got one more idea! We'll keep this all very secret, the whole story and shooting of this movie, and this will heighten suspense and anticipation from the public. There will be mystery surrounding this movie. Just like ""Blair Witch""! Hey, it worked for them, we can make it work here!13) What? Is there anything original about or in our movie? No, but so what!? This is popcorn, baby! ----------This is the worst movie I've seen in 10 years. Awful dialogue, no story, just a monster, and entirely derivative. Brilliant. Movie is so bad, it only runs 1 hour, 10 minutes. But 70 minute movies can be a problem for sales, so...

369,cyberknight,Eastern Movie Remake mixed with Blair Witch,1,14 February 2010,"This movie is a kind of remake of ""Gwoemul"" (a.k.a. ""The Host"", 2006 Korean movie), mixed with the ""shaky camera"" from ""Blair Witch"". The main difference is the size of the monster. Gwoemul's monster is about the size of a cargo van, so it ""interacts"" with humans directly. Cloverfield's monster is Godzilla sized, but don't worry, the plot brings up an excuse to force an interaction with the human victims.The second greatest difference is on camera direction. ""Gwoemul"" uses a conventional camera style, while ""Cloverfield"" uses the ""field documentary"" kind of filming, as seen on movies like ""Blair Witch"", ""(REC)"" and the remake of ""Battlestar Galactica"" TV series. The obvious problem on this approach is that the director needs an excuse to keep filming, even when it's very unlikely that the character with the camera would do so (or have the means to keep recording or to get the best angles). On ""Blair Witch"", the characters wanted to keep a record for whomever would find their corpses, in case they didn't survive. ""(REC)"" had probably the best excuse of all, the character was a professional cameraman, working for a news channel, so he had all reasons to keep filming, even when his life was at stake (as seen in actual war documentaries, for example). ""Battlestar Galactica"" had no reason at all to use ""shaky camera"", they did so to mask the poor acting/action and bad visual effects, mainly on the first seasons. ""Cloverfield"" solved that by putting the camera on the hands of the kind of person that make you wonder if he's on drugs or suffered a brain damaging accident. Because of such lame excuse, about half of the scenes on this movie make absolutely no sense. I mean, someone running for its life, don't matter how idiot it is, wouldn't keep a camcorder at eye level to record its friends' escape from death (much less point the camera backward to record the monster coming after them!) Other plot details from ""Gwoemul"" were adapted to ""Cloverfield"", like the ""problem"" that happens when someone is bitten or scratched by a monster (and exactly like on the former, it is completely left undeveloped, such a waste!) The endings are also very similar, although with different technological approaches.Finally, similarly to ""Gwoemul"", ""Cloverfield"" doesn't bother to explain its title. Of course, there are lots of out-of-the-movie explanations, but no one coming from the movie itself.I managed to watch this once, but never again. Another Western remake of an Eastern movie, with an irritating camera style and underdeveloped plot (not that the former had much of a development, to begin with...)The (few) visual effects are well done, but it is a dark night scenario, I'm not sure it would look so good at daylight (as it does on ""Gwoemul""). It almost makes me want to raise my rating on ""Gwoemul""...",Cloverfield

Every person out there could make a film like this, maybe not the special effects but with a good Mac/Pc and some knowledge in graphics you could.I seriously doubt it's worth paying the cinema price to see this. If you really want to see it wait until it comes on rental. This film encourages piracy... it really does.I couldn't agree more about the ""friend"" with the camera... ""what time is the evacuation?"" ""0600 hours"" ""huh what time is that?"" ""6 o'clock"" ""huh I knew that"" DOH!!!!! hello... how stupid can you be, any need to even put that in... was that meant to be funny? That is one example, as there are countless ones...I really love films where the characters behave like a normal person would in a situation, seeing some be sooooo stuuuupid makes me have no feelings for them whatsoever, only wish that they got what was coming for them much much sooner... and sorry to say but if my mate fancies a girl and there were 5 of us and he wanted to drag everyone back in a really really dangerous area just to be with her not even knowing if she was alive... well no offence mate but go ahead, why kill 5 people for the sake of 1?? Considering what kind of people they were... they would have been the first ones to run out in all directions trying to survive. People that have no intelligence usually have to rely on instinct and in that situation your instinct would tell you ""get the hell out of here""It's like them films where the military does a rescues mission and send 20 people to rescue 1 person and 18 die... yet that 1 person is safe, makes no sense to me... Also how that monster managed to jump up... right for that helicopter which didn't even fire one shot at it, why was a rescue helicopter being flown so close to the action, no idea...No story line... no background on monster, monster was invincible, took 100's of bombs and bullets and it kept on going yet his little ""terrible things"" were hurt by a kick from a person. Pointless film, monster invincible which means it probably destroyed everyone on Earth... and that's it The End... or considering someone found their camera the monster died... how?? no idea, Atomic Bomb?? but then the camera wouldn't work or it would have been destroyed, specially by EMP effect... so their film would have never been seen, OH I am soo stupid, I forgot the camera was also invincible and had it's own nuclear battery (note to self, find out what camera that was and get one).

371,rbsjrx,"I liked it, but can only rate it an 8",8,23 January 2008,"First of all, this comment does contain MAJOR SPOILERS, so turn back now if you don't want to know what happens!While you're deciding whether to read further, what can I say that won't spoil it? ""Cloverfield"" has been summarized as ""Godzilla"" meets ""The Blair Witch Project"", and that's a fair description. The hand-held camera documentary effect does hark back to TBWP. That may be something fairly new to much of the film's target audience, but it's really not. Whether it's innovative or simply annoying is a judgment call, although it does help set the tone of the film. I saw the film with my adult granddaughter who is subject to motion sickness and although she liked it, she doesn't particularly want to see it again. That doesn't bode well for its box office ""legs"". I'd also like to add that I'm past 60, so ignore what others may say about this not being for folks over 30-35.*** Spoiler Pause ***Still here? OK, here goes... I should qualify my first comment with the fact that I don't necessarily consider the spoilers all that major. The opening titles set up the biggest spoiler, so it wasn't really that unexpected.So what is new and/or fresh about it? The answer is point of view (POV). Most traditional monster films have central characters who are scientists or military people engaged in battling and/or understanding the monster. The monster's victims are traditionally part of the background. ""Cloverfield"" turns this around... There are no scientists in sight and the military personnel are all secondary characters. The protagonists are some of the same people you see simply running and screaming in a traditional monster film. The scant plot is simply their trying to survive and save friends and loved ones. The hand held video is simply a plot gimmick to facilitate this unique POV.Some have criticized the characters as being vapid, self-absorbed twenty-somethings, which I don't think is entirely fair. It's largely true of the party group at the beginning, but then once we shift the focus from scientists and high-ranking military types to everyday people, you can't really expect everyone to be all that interesting. The audience doesn't need to admire them, only to identify with them and/or like them at some level. The core group at the focus of the film may not be heroic or deep thinkers, but they are types we all know and are mostly likable enough.So, what's not to like? Again, just as with TBWP, many people won't like the jerky hand held camera work. So that much is a matter of taste - I find it mildly annoying, but that's just me. What's more troubling (here come the spoilers) is that almost everyone dies! OK, that's not too surprising in a modern horror film. And again, this is foreshadowed in the opening credits. As they rolled, I was prepared that some or most of the characters would die, but not all of the most sympathetic ones! Doing it this way is arguably more realistic. But, since the whole premise of any monster film is unrealistic, my gut reaction is that if I wanted to see a show with a really depressing ending, I'd watch a documentary and learn something in the process. Once I've spent the whole time investing some feelings for the characters, having them killed off seemingly at random may be realistic, but it doesn't leave me with a good feeling as I leave the theater. This may also affect the film's box office ""legs"".I also have to add that this is one of the most intense films I've ever seen. It's only about an hour long yet leaves you wrung out, feeling that it was a much longer film. In addition to being nauseous from the camera work, my granddaughter was sore from tensing her muscles and generally felt like she'd been through a real workout by the time the final credits rolled.Conditionally recommended with significant caveats... (However, my all-time favorite giant monster movies are ""Gojira"" (the original Japanese version), ""Godzilla vs. Destroyer"", ""Godzilla: Final Wars"", ""Gorgo"", ""Mighty Joe Young"" (the original version), and both the original and Peter Jackson versions of ""King Kong"").",Cloverfield
372,machrf,"Poor videography, poor development of plot",1,6 May 2012,"I think the movie has a great concept and good premise. It blows it with the character selection of who makes it and who does not. It would be an OK movie if it were not for the videographics. You will get dizzy with in the first 10 minutes of the movie and it only gets worse.The video is supposed to be as if it was really happening (great concept) but my 5 year old brother could do a better job. Where the screen should have a wide angle shot he zooms into nothing. When he is running he has the video camera any where but where someone would normally have it. Even if it is to express the madness and mayhem at the moment he has wits enough to be video graphing and does not have wits enough to put it on the subject? He never gets a good shot of what is going on at the time because the camera is always going in this direction and that and then your puking from being dizzy. I had to give it a one, for my having to sit through this awful thing trying to imagine how much better it would be if my 5 year old brother was taping it.",Cloverfield
373,pressboard,This was extraordinary - the comments even more so,10,25 January 2008,"I thought the reviews for I Am Legend were split - but the comments on Cloverfield are even farther apart - and reading the Hated It posts I cannot comprehend. This movie was fairly simple in concept - Monster attacks Manhattan. It was similar to Blair Witch Project - they both use a Hand Held Camera(s). But the similarities to Blair Witch and Godzilla end there. To begin with - most stories/plots have been done before in other movies. What makes most movies unique is the WAY the movie is done - not the storyline. The Hand Held camera may not be a new technique, but it is used to incredible effect in Cloverfield. You get to know the characters at a party in the beginning of the film and so you care what happens to them (or not). An atmosphere of tension and suspense is effectively created and makes this a Horror movie more than an Action movie - and an extremely good Horror movie. You catch glimpses of the creature until the entire creature is exposed - which usually defuses tension, but not in this case - if anything it ramps up the suspense. As some reviews have indicated - as many people laughed in the theater as gasped. There are visual surprises and shocks, all of which, are effective. I give Kudos to JJ - this is definitely a masterpiece. Heads-UP! - do not go drunk, the Hand Held Camera will make you throw up - as one guy did - profusely. Highly recommended - Enjoy!",Cloverfield

The handy cam work thing is so off putting it made me want to walk out ( and several people did )I mean check on the AVP - requiem threads because one of the main complaints was that the movie was dark dark you couldn't see anything.Well guess what the camera work in this jumps about so much i couldn't see anything !!!!! I can get past the bad acting, storyline etc 'cos its a monster movie so what do you expect but this film is just really bad home movie remake of Godzilla.

375,theycallmemrglass,"Knockout Cocktail mix of Blair Witch, Signs, The Descent",8,7 April 2008,"I went to the cinema to watch this on a cold winter day rather bemused with the admittedly very clever and effective marketing hype. What I didn't expect was to be blown away by what turns out be a giant blockbuster roller-coaster ride of a movie. This is a unique cocktail of Blair witch Project, Shyamalan's Signs and The Descent. Sound takes centre stage here. That is not to say that the protagonists are redundant, no, far from it. But no other film has had my heart thumping with chills and excitement largely from sound effects as this. So be sure to watch this with at least decent surround because that is half the fun of this movie. The gimmicky tool of Blair Witch hand-held is cranked up to full effect giving us a sense of first person perspective of the horrors unfolding around a small confused group of friends/colleagues. The tension and spectacle is breathtaking but there also some much needed humour provided mostly by the dorky cameraman. But what elevates the film is that we care for the main characters and there is even a subtle love story that cleverly encapsulates the chaos. The movie maybe ridden with horror/SF clichés but they are all given a fresh and unique spin. A terrific monster hit",Cloverfield
376,Roger_Sterling,Simply doesn't live up to the hype.,7,19 January 2008,"Since the untitled teaser trailer was released with Transformers in July, hype and mystery have been on this movie like flies on crap. Sad to say, Cloverfield doesn't live up to it.The biggest hook this movie has is ""What does the monster look like?"" I won't spoil it, so don't worry. You DO get one clear shot of the monster near the end of the movie; the rest of the time it's bits and pieces. For the first 10-15 minutes of the movie or so there is no attack. It is a going away party for Rob, the main character.Which brings me to the camera. I was expecting it to be used for the party, not for the ENTIRE movie. When the camera isn't focused on the monster, I felt sick looking at the screen. It feels a little too realistic most of the time. However, the special effects and sound are spectacular.I would've given this a higher rating, but the camera, overall forgettable characters and terrible ending bring this to a somewhat generous 7/10.",Cloverfield
377,angelynx-2,Top-notch 21st century monster flick,9,20 January 2008,"I was really looking forward to this movie, and it didn't disappoint me a bit. It's got everything I hoped for: an original monster, a breathtaking pace, genuine shocks and scares, some poignancy, some mystery, and absolutely no snarky condescension or cheesiness. This is a stripped-down, kick-ass dynamo of a movie experience unlike any giant creature flick I've ever seen, and I've been watching them since the 70s. It takes a little time to set up and get rolling, but once it's out of the gate it doesn't let up for a moment. The use of the hand-held camera gives it terrific immediacy and believability, since we see only as much of the creature and its rampage as the characters underfoot do. They're a pretty typical batch of well-heeled kids, used to getting immediate information on everything, and when they're suddenly plunged into violent chaos they react with terror and confusion. Yet despite that, they attempt a heroic rescue, acting with the kind of courage ordinary people show in the face of disaster every day. (Yes, some sequences do evoke the imagery of 9-11, but I wish people would quit sounding so indignant about that; surely it's off the sacred list and into the pool of legitimate film topics by now. The Cloverfield/9-11 = Godzilla/Hiroshima analogy ought to be enough to settle the point.) I liked them a lot more than I expected to (in fact I completely choked up when one character had to give his mom some very bad news) and felt completely pulled into the headlong rush of the story. It's as convincing a portrait of an event like this as I can imagine, and will leave you gasping for breath. I only have two credibility quibbles, in fact: the overly-helpful soldier and the apparent army of available helicopters. But those are minor. [[--I'm not going to say anything about the monster, except that it's none of the things people have been speculating it was, it's 100% cool, and I can't wait for the action figure.]] --I can't imagine anyone who really loves daikaiju cinema being disappointed with this: it's a fine, scary piece of work. Too nihilistic? Could be, but these are dark times, and we already know this film was intended to mirror the right-now dread and tension of our War on Terror landscape. There's no reassurance from those in power, the military doesn't know any more than the characters do, and all you get in return for facing the worst is the close-up rush of the adventure. Which, after all, may be all you ever get.",Cloverfield
378,bobbyelliott,Very derivative,3,3 February 2008,"This movie is a mix of several other films, including Blair Witch Project, Godzilla, and Alien. In fact, I found nothing original about it. In spite of it being short (90 minutes), because it's so formulaic, I found it a drag and I was looking at my watch after 45 minutes.And it's a very old formula. Good-looking twenty-somethings run around a city being chased by something evil, make very bad decisions that imperil their safety, escape said peril through ludicrous good fortune... repeat for 60 minutes until end.But the biggest disappointment is the complete lack of plot (beyond the trite: ""I must save my girlfriend from this monster""). Seriously, there is no story here.On the positive side, it is short. And I thought the monster was quite well done. And, I guess, 14 year-old boys will enjoy it.Don't under-estimate the first advantage (the movie's brevity). You'll be very grateful. Believe me.",Cloverfield

380,IamtheRegalTreatment,"I liked it... believe it or not, I did.",9,17 January 2008,"There was so much hype for this movie that you didn't need to know what it was about to see it. I'm sure many viewers this weekend are going to not know anything about the movie, just know that it's called Cloverfield and it was produced by JJ Abrams. I would think the movie wouldn't be as enthralling for someone who doesn't know much about it compared to someone who has been following message board posts for months, but I don't think it should matter.So, let's begin. Cloverfield. The general plot of the movie is a home-made movie about a mans going away party that turns into a first person action thriller about a ""monster"" terrorizing the city. Well, I'm intrigued. I have been waiting for this movie for awhile since nothing exciting has come out recently. Everyone talking about the movie only made it more anticipated, so going into it I had high expectations. To be completely honest, I am satisfied. Shocked? Cloverfield is a movie like nothing I've seen before. I am sure this movie is based upon a few other films, but I haven't seen them. First of all, no it is not Godzilla. Second, I didn't get a chance to see Blair Witch Project so the first person thing was new to me. I know, I know. This however is what Made this movie what it is. It made you feel like you were in the action, on the streets running in fear alongside the citizens. It was freakin' sweet.The action was intense, I expected nothing less from JJ. Once the movie got into motion with the city ""earthquake"" everything from then on was thrilling. I sat in the seat shaking in anticipation like I was sitting outside in the 20 degree weather; butterflies in my stomach for more than half the film. Awesome. The other part that was great was the sound and sights. It really felt like you were standing next to the soldiers shooting at the monster. And last but not least, the comedy... no seriously. There were many funny parts thanks to the cameraman. ""Oh My God, you know Superman too? Geez I'm feeling a connection... have you heard of Garfield?"". Classic.Overall a solid, solid 9. Maybe a little high, but I thought the movie was amazing whether or not the ending was satisfying. No, I'm not telling you how it ends! To me, it was good though because it ended the film on a good note... yet kept the suspense and questions flowing. Also, no monster tips from me... I want you to be awaiting ""its"" face. Very good work, except on the title... what does Cloverfield have to do with it?90 minute flick, so why not. Action/Thriller fans will love it; so go see it!",Cloverfield
381,kirksworks,Interesting Experiment in VFX and Giant Monsters,7,2 August 2009,"Although I liked this film it wasn't as successful a variation on the giant monster genre I was hoping it would be. The VFX were integrated into the film flawlessly, and by my mind, were some of the most impressive I've seen in a film. More impressive than the Cloverfield monster itself was the completely convincing creation of Manhattan under siege. The fact that the film was shot on sound stages in Los Angeles is mind-blowing. Some have complained that the script was thin and the plot not much to write home about, and I would concur, however, a more polished and scripted affair would have reduced the sense of realism. And that is what this film has going for it, its sense of capturing a rampaging monster ""by the seat of your pants"" so to speak, via the clever use of seeing the whole story from the viewpoint of a single video camera lens.The 9/11 video cam realism manufactured by this technique was extremely effective indeed, but I have to add that it also had the effect of distancing me from the on screen violence. I was never scared, even during the film's most harrowing sequence where the characters are attacked in the subway tunnel by fierce crab-like creatures. I guess the hand-held camera only catching glimpses of the action and moving all over the place toned it down for me. It felt like another proscenium arch that made the whole thing once more removed. This is strange because I'm sure the filmmakers intended just the opposite reaction from an audience. I found myself much more involved in the Korean film ""The Host"" than I did in ""Cloverfield."" And of course, ""The Host"" is more conventionally told, showing the monster clearly and creating a more melodramatic product by its obviously scripted dialog. Yet, ""The Host"" had characters I got deeply involved with, even though they were people from a culture I know very little about. With ""Cloverfield,"" even though the main characters were American and relatively believable in their reaction to events and each other, the nature of the idea of keeping everything close to reality (with an unscripted feeling and unpolished camera work) lessened the melodramatics, making me want more from the characters. And finally, most everyone dying in the end, though clearly an attempt to maintain the ""Blair Witch Project"" found footage idea, was very unsatisfying. People do survive horrendous things, even in real life. Yet, as someone who grew up on films like ""Godzilla"" and ""Gorgo,"" ""Cloverfield"" has a lot going for it. I was often impressed with how harrowing the whole thing was, even if I did feel somewhat removed. And Michael Giancchino's ""Roar"" overture that plays over the 9.5 minute end credits is killer. If giant monsters on the rampage is your thing, ""Cloverfield"" is worth a look.",Cloverfield
382,dcoydcoy,Boring!,5,22 January 2008,"Normally when a film has 4000+ good reviews it will be a good picture. If I don't find the film good, I usually watch it again to see what I missed, or I feel that I wasn't in the right mood for it when I watched it. As for ""Cloverfield""...I'm drawing a complete blank! I heard that the amateur camera work gave it an authentic feel and helped define the characters. It didn't do that at all! The behavior of the characters throughout the so-called terror was not realistic at all. This includes the military personal as well as the main characters. Just totally unbelievable. This film was not only boring, but very predictable throughout. Cmon...time to run the other way when we see rats running? Give me a break! I've given this film a new title...""Creed""!

383,khemass,I like it and I have my reasons,7,21 April 2009,"I watched this film on DVD, so I didn't get motion sickness and was able to enjoy it.But I could understand that people who watch it on a large screen may feel very dizzy. I was prepared that this movie may suck after reading some comments here at IMDb.com, but it was better than I had expected.The film already told us that the guy who holds this camera is not very smart so I didn't expect anything documentary-like or any good cinematography, just some home video that happens to record a monster-attack event in Manhattan. I think that all the characters and their stories are convincing enough. Rob loves Beth so he tried to go back and save her. (I would feel guilty for the rest of my life if I were him and didn't go back to save her.) Hut, the camera holder, was somewhat a stupid and annoying guy but he really does care about Malena. I can feel that in the way he talked to her after the attack happened. So, I did care for these characters, not very deeply, but I did. At least they seem like real people to me.Next, this film makes me feel like I'm really watching a footage. I think that's one of its best success. The picture blurred and broken at times. Sometimes it was such a big mess and you almost couldn't see anything but chaos. Sometimes you only gets to see unimportant things like people's feet,and you have to use your imagination about what is happening at that moment.But that's what makes the movie feels very real as a footage. I also think the atmosphere look and sound very real (people screaming, crying).However, there are some points that the film should have done better.The ending wasn't very good. It was too similar to Blair Witch Project. And I wish they could have a bit more explanation about where these monsters or aliens come from and why they attack.In conclusion, after all the bad comments on IMDb., I just want to say give this film a chance. I wasn't disappointed. My father, 53 years old, who doesn't usually like movie that used hand-held camera, enjoyed this movie and even said that this is a work of art.Just don't watch it on the big screen, rent a DVD. Be prepared that you're gonna watch something a bit dizzying, and try to use a lot of imagination.",Cloverfield
384,soger,A really absorbing movie,9,19 April 2008,"People keep comparing this movie to Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project. I saw neither of those but after seeing this movie I felt compelled to watch them so I did. THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE GODZILLA. The only thing in common with Godzilla is the big ass monster and the running people. It is similar to the Blair Witch Project in style, tension and uncertainness but Godzilla (1998) is more similar to Jurassic Park with the dinosaurs and a final conclusion. Cloverfield is something else.People either love or hate this movie. To tell you the truth I'm one of the people who love it but read other comments too, both sides are telling the truth. The reason I love it is because I saw no movie like this one before. The whole science-fiction story is presented from the perspective of a hand held camera. The camera itself is a super-advanced prototype that is unbreakable and has almost unlimited power and nightvision and everything but that's not the point. The point is that it creates a unique and absorbing tone. You don't really notice the special effects they are just part of the story like if they were filmed in reality and that is what makes it genius like in the show called ""Heroes"".So love it or hate it... doesn't really matter. What matters is that you will not be bored during this movie, not for one second. And it will stuck in your head for a while.",Cloverfield
385,Medacakathareal,Solid Monster Movie,7,4 July 2008,"I waited until several months after the release of the DVD to see the film mainly because I wanted every last bit of the hype/complaints to wash off so I could see this movie unhindered. And here's what I saw: The movie starts off slow and fairly boring, main characters are introduced and its basically a home movie documenting Rob's going away party. The movie takes a turn for the awesome when the attack begins, at first as an Earthquake and then the monster begins blowing stuff up... The main issue I have is that too much of the monster is revealed too early in the film, for a movie able to keep the monster fairly under-wraps before its release it sure does give stuff away quickly...The monster's originality, however, makes up for it, it doesn't resemble any monster I've seen, it looks like a mix between a bat, spider, and a squid to my eyes, especially since (and this is also very cool) it drops smaller creatures off its back like a mother spider... The smaller creatures, at least to me, seemed reminiscent of the Ant-Lions from Half-Life 2 but they were original, don't get me wrong...The dialog is a bit obnoxious at times but it fits the characters through whose eyes we've seen, since they're kids in their mid-twenties they spend a lot of time going ""Oh sh*t! Did you see that!"" which is what you would do in the event of a monster attack anyway... The hand-held view can get annoying because there isn't always something to look at on screen, we see lots of the floor and our camera-man's feet but for those crucial moments where we see the monsters the camera is still enough to get a good look at them...Another plus is that this is a short movie, it doesn't waste your time and it leaves you wondering where the monster came from, they never tell you! You're left to come up with your own theories, but I'm hoping for a non-hand-held sequel where the origins of the monster are explained at least in part... There is a bit too much time spent on the characters, who we really don't care much about at first but by the end I found myself rooting for Rob because, after all, he's just like us no matter how successful he becomes...It leaves you hanging, its a solid movie, not without its issues but at the same time its an exciting adrenaline filled romp through the monster movie genre...",Cloverfield
386,Redcitykev,"Not a bad film, but...",6,28 February 2008,"Whilst this film is not exactly bad, I can not say it is particularly good either. The main reason for this I thought that it was full of plot holes and obvious events, as well as making me feel decidedly sea-sick! Part of the film's problem is the fact that it took so long to get going. For a film as short as this the opening party scene seemed to go on for hours, and was the kind of party that I would personally have avoided like the plague! In fact by the time the action actually got going I was already wishing for most of the party goers to 'bite the dust'! When eventually the film did get into its stride the comparisons with 9/11 were so blindly obvious to be quite painful. The falling building, the rubble and dust rolling down the street etc could not have existed before that dreadful day and the subsequent TV coverage. Following on from this the film really became not much more than a chase movie, with a lot of running - and I mean A LOT OF RUNNING! - about, plenty of screams and some really dumb actions by the characters.The most puzzling part of the film for myself was when the surviving lead characters went into the subway system. Now surely, with New York being attacked in the manor it was, this system would have been heaving with like-minded souls attempting to escape from the happenings on the surface? Yet when they got down there they were the only ones. As for what happens down there, well I would spoil it for those who have not viewed the film yet, but to say they were obvious is like saying Manchester United play in red at home! The few things that save this film from being a complete duffer is the special effects. The monster, which is only slowly revealed, is really quite scary, and the destruction is well done. The action, when it gets going, is fast and furious, and the acting, whilst never being Oscar worthy!, is not bad for a film of this type.Of course I am sure that there is a whole essay to be written about this film - and others like the recent 'Invasion', 'I am Legend' etc - and the whole post 9/11 scenario, but I will leave that to much more learned minds than my own! Surfice to say that if you are willing to leave your brain at the box office, and can cope with the opening party scene full of horrid little people, then this film offers up a reasonable amount of entertainment.",Cloverfield
387,javi-y-se-acabo,What A Thrilling Ride!,8,19 May 2017,"This movie surpassed all my expectations. I knew that this movie was about a monster attack in New York and that it was filmed in a first- person way. That means a lot of shaky camera scenes and many moments you don't know what is going on screen. And for that, this isn't a movie for everyone. I'm petty sure that many people who gives bad critics to this is because of this. Well I think it really worked and made you get into the story in a real awesome way. Just amazing!It tells the story of a group of people who are preparing a goodbye party to one of them, who's leaving to Japan. But suddenly something like an earthquake interrupts them and from here (about the minute 20 or so) he action and the tension starts as they try to cross New York to find one of their friends who is trapped in her own apartment. The story may not be the best but it truly gets you into the action quickly and makes you feel scared, tense, happy or sad, as the characters are. The actors made a really great job, because they feel like they're really in danger. Lizzy Caplan, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David & Jessica Lucas as the main characters they are all amazing.And the other thing I have to mention is the amazing visuals and all of the cinematography. It feels very real and the camera work gets you into this monster attack. The music here is missing because the movie wants to make you feel it like a real record of this, but in the end credits you get to hear the Cloverfield Overture by Michael Giacchino and it could have really fit well in the movie.This movie isn't for everyone, but that's not necessary a bad thing, because I loved it. just watch it and then you will discover an amazing movie made in a very original way, or maybe you will discover an awful movie that will bring you headaches, but I'm pretty sure you won't regret watching it.",Cloverfield
388,goodellaa,Skillful up-date on weird phenomena disaster-fantasy.,8,18 January 2008,"This movie was, I suspect, a labor of love for it's creators. I had the pleasure of seeing it at 12:01 AM this morning with an enthusiastic audience of 20-somethings not unlike the main characters. The UCLA crowd, if I'm not mistaken, in one of the best theaters in LA. I rarely feel so good about giving up 12 bucks, and felt well served by the ads that preceded the opening, as it is fun sometimes to go in knowing little or nothing. In the closing credits there is a credit for stills from other movies: King Kong, Them, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. This latter picture is the one Cloverfield most reminded me of and of which it could even be considered a re-make. Because of it's style and story it also put me in mind of The Birds, The Blair Witch Project and Night of the Living Dead. It is a good movie for those of us who like this sort of thing. The whole thing is from the point of view of a single hi-def camera in the hands of some guy who is participating in a wedding party in a big building somewhere in southern Manhattan Island. I'm in LA so they all look pretty big to me and I can tell you that one of the first chills for the west coast audience is the suspicion that the weird phenomenon is some freak earthquake. No such luck, though, and the picture is loaded with scary thrills, a real roller-coaster. Once in a while there is a little typical blockbuster silliness, but in general they are going for realism, without trying to present anything but outlandish fantasy. Plenty of badly needed humor throughout, so people can more easily sit through seven hours (dramatically condensed) of really awful devastation. By giving us a little time with the doomed wedding party of newly-minted adults, then following the survivors as they are whittled down by ill luck and loyalty, the human factor that gives this weird phenomenon's visit interest is never lost. As the situation gets rapidly worse we get a bigger picture of events without leaving the intimacy of the camera. Well crafted and technically sophisticated. Good fun, and like it's beloved cousin Godzilla, asks questions of us. How on earth would you handle this dire situation, and is it (at least emotionally) really so unlike your actual situation?",Cloverfield
389,jonconnormustlive-46298,Excellent found-footage monster movie,10,7 February 2018,"Cloverfield follows a group of friends having a going-away party when a monster begins to rampage through Manhattan, they dare to journey through the wreckage to save one of their own.Watching this movie again 10 years later it doesn't appear to be aging at all. The effects are top notch. The monsters are intense and frightening.
This film was made before found-footage was so horribly overdone. At the time it still felt fairly new.
In all honesty this might be the scariest monster movie I've ever seen.
The cast is believable. Everyone works together well and has believable chemistry.This film just manages to feel so realistic, it's amazing.
I definitely recommend. Personally it's my favorite found-footage film.",Cloverfield
390,matt_hew,Don't Believe The Hype!,6,14 February 2008,"The build-up for this release has been immense, from the secretive non-title to the intense trailer released last year; so anyone wanting to go see it was expecting a movie to match the hype.So does it!? - Sadly No.The premise is good, using the lead characters Leaving Party to set up characters, relationships and most importantly the use of the camcorder before the chaos begins. The use of some of the camera angles are interesting too, helping to create the confusion of the situation and allowing the viewer snippets of the Monster (a leg here, a tail there) allowing you to try and piece together what is this creature destroying the City.However this is where the interest wains. The camera work is too clean (like it's shot in HD), so you do not get the feeling of any realism of the situation, with the character 'Hud' (who after a while starts to sound like Will Ferrell) opting to keep filming rather than dealing with the perillous situations the group are in because he was told to be the 'camera operator' at the beginning of the movie!The movie tries to create a narrative (& purpose) from within the chaos for the lead characters but unfortunately the characters are wooden, boring and uninspired (with Lily & Beth seemingly interchangeable) so you don't really care what happens to them and simply want them to run into the Monster to see what is happening to the City!As the movie starts to run out of ideas & places to go, they conclude with a predictable ambiguous conclusion and throw in a few clear shots of the Monster so not to upset anyone who came to see a Monster Movie (although this is poorly executed making it seem as though the Monster has changed size - which the director has tried to defend).The movie was interesting in idea and attempt but ultimately (partly due to the mass hype) fails to deliver what the audience was hoping for...",Cloverfield
391,iNickR,Only 2200 Reviews Ahead Of Me! But I'll Still Write Something,7,6 February 2018,"Cloverfield, in short, is shot like a ""found footage"" documentary and follows a group of friends around Manhattan during a monster invasion.Still interested? Read on. It's New York City, the site of many disasters (both imagined and real, unfortunately). One can assume that the events we are about to witness happened at some point in the past, because we're watching a video seized by the Department of Defense. The footage, recovered from an ""area formerly known as Central Park"", is clearly taken from a camera once owned by a young couple. We know this because we see them, on video, before and during the day of the invasion.The couple attend a going away party for a mutual friend who is moving to Japan. It's at the party where we meet the cast of characters who later become the video journalists when the real fun begins. The building shakes, there's a power-outage lasting a few seconds, and there's a report on TV about a possible earthquake. Seems harmless, right? Like some giddy school children, the cameraman and his buddies head up to the roof to get a better look at a foundering ship spilling oil into the Hudson River. That's when all hell breaks loose. Luckily, they bring the camera along for the wild ride.And so begins director Matt Reeves's ode to big scary monsters. Think of the videos you've seen on the news of war photographers running for their lives, all the while continuing to record. That's what Cloverfield is like except no one is dodging enemy fire; here it's giant bug-things they're running from. The ""found-footage"" genre of filmmaking isn't new, not even when Cloverfield was made 10-years ago. It's actually kind of lame, too. However, when I first saw this movie in 2008 I enjoyed it. Who doesn't appreciate seeing an apocalyptic monster invasion? They are magnificent!Cloverfield is a good action, sci-fi, horror film that's fun to watch, even if the camera work is a little too jarring at times. I like how the movie uses very little CGI (but when CGI is used, it's excellent) and relies mostly on creative, budget-friendly filmmaking. Loud monster noises, blood-curdling screams, and one's own imagination fuel the fright. Think Jaws (1975): you knew there was something scary out there, but you couldn't see it. Everyone fears what they can't see.Check out 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) and Netflix's The Cloverfield Paradox (2018). All three movies are related.",Cloverfield
392,tylerrosin,Not As Bad As People Say,9,8 June 2008,"I just watched Cloverfield and i must say, it left me in shock. the whole feel of dread and fear was so apparent that it felt like you were in the middle of hell. yes the camera can get annoying at times but that makes the movie feel that much more real. and from the all the things i heard people complain about, i personally felt the camera was not as shaky as people said, yes it was when they were running like hell from the monster but that kind of makes sense. the special effects were spectacular and the actors did feel really believable and real. the only thing that i will agree with is that it was a very short movie not even a full 90 mins but thats OK because you are probably not even watching the time because it flies by so quickly. and the only thing that bothered me is that the movie really does not answer any questions but i guess that was what the directors were going for, and the whole fact that the video camera survived a nuclear bomb did not make any sense but thats OK because if it didn't we would never of had this movie. and i went into this movie with a completely open mind and it did not let me down, check this movie out.",Cloverfield

Obviously the one bad thing is the camera but you'll get over it.,Cloverfield
395,Merklin,"Watchable, but not as scary or immersive as it could be.",5,23 February 2008,"On paper, cloverfield is a great idea: A giant monster invasion movie shown entirely from the perspective of hand held camera has potential for all sorts of coolness. However, while cloverfeild has some good things going for it, it doesn't quite live up to that potential.The problem with cloverfield is that it feels a little too Hollywood- its supposed to show the action in a documentary style, but thanks to some teen soap style drama and unnecessary character development, that sense of realism and immersion that horror mockumentaries need to evoke to draw you in, isn't always there. Thats not to say that the film is bad- the film is definitely scary in places. There is a serious sense of dread and panic in scenes when the crowds are fleeing from the monster and news footage of monster attacks are chilling and shocking to watch.Cloverfeilds biggest problem is the very thing thats most integral to the movie: the camera. I understand that the bad, sickness inducing, extremely shaky camera work is supposed to add to the realism but it makes the film difficult and at times, frustrating to watch. Even the micro budget Blair witch project had better and more realistic camera work and that film didn't have a CG monster to show off.Cloverfield is a unique take on the 'monster attacks new york' theme that the American remake of godzilla tried to do 10 years ago and its good for a few scares, but its not as as effective as it should be.",Cloverfield
396,yourfavoritecritic,The Movie That Could Have Been,6,19 February 2018,"Cloverfield, is the first feature length debut for Matt Reeves that was released in 2008 and was a film shrouded in mystery. The very little detail released beforehand, left audiences stubbled and intrigued to check the obscure movie out. Upon its release the film was met with mixed, but mostly positive, reviews; and almost a decade later I finally got the chance to watch Cloverfield for the first time. Overall my experience with the film was mostly good, it didn't do anything to blow me away, nor was it offensively bad.
 Cloverfield tells the story of a group of friends trying to survive a monster attack in New York City. The film stars actors who were, at the time, mainly unknown, like a very young Lizzy Caplan and T.J. Miller; the acting itself was serviceable, save for a couple weak performances, everybody at least felt convincing, like they were going through some shit.
 Now the main spectacle of the film, is the setting and monster. Although we never get too many good glimpses of the creature, it is a neat design and felt threatening. Despite actually taking place on a sound stage, I felt the filmmakers did a great a job at faithfully recreating New York, as I was totally immersed in the world. Also the use of very little CGI was great, it never took me out of the movie when I saw something that wasn't practical, the FX were used when it needed to be and that was great. 
 Now the biggest issue in the movie, is its story and character motivation. The story centres around three friends travelling across the city to save their friend, despite numerous people telling them that part of the city is lost and if they hope to survive they're better off following the hundreds of people in the military advised rescue plan. The motivation to save this one character is extremely weak, and out of the three friends who tagged along, really only one of them should have gone to rescue this other individual. Along their trek these characters also make really poor decisions, that left me shaking my head on multiple occasions. I felt that many of the deaths that occurred in this movie could have been avoided if the character's the audience is supposed to ""root"" for weren't so dense. With a couple decisions made early on, the events in this film could have totally avoided. It makes me wonder why there weren't revisions to the script to make it tighter, so that every action in the movie feels plausible, rather than the result of bad character writing.
 So although the film has many issues in many respects, I did find enjoyment in it, despite the overall forgetfulness of the film. I do see myself rewatching the film sometime again as I enjoyed the setting, and the lore behind the Cloverfield universe is quite intriguing. If you have not seen this film before, I do recommend it, it's an enjoyable monster movie which I'm sure you'll get a few kicks out of. As for me this was somewhat disappointing, as many of the films flaws could have been avoided, so with that being saying said, Cloverfield gets a 6/10.",Cloverfield

398,user-543-975655,Awesome!,8,28 July 2013,"I watched this movie for the first time with no expectations going into the movie. But I have to say, it has quality! I was blown away by how realistic this movie was. At times, though, it looked like a green screen, but if you don't pay attention, you won't notice it. The beginning was pretty slow, but it's like that with a lot of movies. However, it makes up for it in the last hour. J.J Abrams and Matt Reeves took a risk with this movie, but it ended up going well for them. I'll start reviewing the movie. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: They were awesome considering recent monster movies from 2005-. Especially when you compare them to Syfy original movies, which could have been made up by a six year old boy. They used practical and CG effects, and used the different ones at the right time. The crab-spider creatures were totally unexpected, and very real. The monster was seen little, but it was a good movie nonetheless. THE ACTING: Very good all the way through. It was cheesy at some parts, but only if you pay close attention to it. Hud (T.J Miller) did a good job to his role of a typical New York nerd who has trouble talking to girls sometimes. He also takes his job ""documenting"", as he says he's doing numerous times throughout the movie. Lizzy Caplan does a good job acting as an unpleasant at times, sarcastic, drink-loving New Yorker named Marlena Diamond. Odette Annable (old fashioned name, huh?) does an OK job as a scared and injured innocent civilian named Beth McIntyre. Jessica Lucas does a good job as a kind-hearted lady named Lily Ford. Michael Stahl- David does a great job as a courageous guy who will stop at nothing to save his girlfriend, Beth McIntyre. That's enough for the acting. THE STORY: A little bit cliché'd, but good anyway. Original in some aspects, like how spider parasite crabs drop off the monster and kill people. It is an unpleasant movie, no doubt, but still one of the best found footage movies I've ever seen. 8/10",Cloverfield
399,Jinn,Clover F%@#ed,1,27 July 2008,"Oh My God! (By this way this was probably the only line repeated over and over and *over* in the entire movie  The scriptwriters obviously don't know very many expressive words)An insult to intelligent movie goers everywhere. A disappointing, complete no brainer... I've seen better acting in butter commercials. Hell, *I've* done better acting in the TV commercial I starred in  and I can write better too ... Just look at the pretty young woman who gets hacked by the monster's offspring - hardly shows any pain with such deep lacerations - all the way down her back and shoulders... Either she has no pain receptors or the creature had something in its saliva which dulled her nerves (neither was said in the movie) and the victim later winced when another character was dabbing these bleeding rips in her skin ... Ow. I've been slashed open by a monster. Better get me a band-aid. No, Really? And the girl that they went back to the apartment for? Umm One would think she would have let's see like - **Left Already!!!** Oh my God! There's a huge, mean monster attacking! Slashing, crushing, as it goes, ripping buildings apart. Oh My God!! It's and heading this way! I think I'll stay right here in this apartment block, which is doing its best impression of the leaning tower of Pisa. *Puhleeeeze.*I felt nothing for any of these flat, stupid, pathetic, characters. And reading other reviews, I see I'm definitely not the only one who feels ripped off and my intelligence bashed by this sketchy piece of slush. Glad I didn't bother watching it on the big screen. That would have been worse. See a lot of people liked it though... 'intense thriller ... action packed...' Haven't seen many real action movies, then, huh? Oh My God, I've seen more action (and better acting) in a David Attenborough documentary. Needless to say I'm beyond disappointed that it turned out to be nothing more than a typical, mind-numbingly predictable, utterly boring monster thrash & bash. The only interesting take being the student camera thing ... Maybe they should have called it 'The Blair Monster Project' ... (Though it was in parts, sketchy and annoying. Just like Blair Witch - another boring no-brainer) It takes ages to get to the action, the party scene a complete snoozer ,,, And when something *finally* does happen, you're wondering if it's aliens, terrorists or monsters (I was hoping for something more original). Oh my God. It's devoid of intelligent plot, script, or anything intelligent, period. Where was the monster from exactly - the ocean, but where? Was it originally from another world? I was assuming it was female as it was breeding, (well dropping its offspring like poop), everywhere it stomped. Was it acting on instinct or malicious (could just've as well been some primordial beast without a clue)  though you hardly saw the damned thing, but even then it was probably the best actor in the whole movie. Will say it had good special effects, with Clarice (well somebody has to give the monster a name :)  the explosions and the Statue of Liberty head ... That was probably the only thing in the entire movie that brought any feeling whatsoever. (However not so special-effects to write home or best friend about.) The fact that it was short usually counts as a negative, but with this I was glad when this overrated slag pile came to an end. THANK God! Though I heard they're planning a sequel *Oh My God!!!* Haven't insulted our intelligence enough, I see. (The more intelligent reviewers will understand this as sarcasm.)And then I find out this waste-of-time & money effing hogus sorry a$$ excuse for a movie insultingly ... won the 2007 Saturn Award for best Sci-fi movie  against **Transformers?!?!?** *Jinn shakes her head in disgust and dismay and utter shock ... and barfs.* I'll give *them* a monstrous thrash & bash! ;)Don't waste your money or time on this uber-moronic, un-intelligent piece of over-hyped crud. Want to see *real* thrash and bash?  Watch Transformers. Actually *has* an intelligent plot (and more than just thrash & bash ) and with decent acting (from the humans as well)  And one that has you actually feeling for the characters (Transformers and humans alike), has feel good scenes and *Actually H A S an ending* then save your Energon chips and watch Transformers.",Cloverfield
400,walkingwithprimeval,The Blair Witch Project for the kaiju community,9,3 July 2020,"I'm pretty sure once Cloverfield was released, everyone who saw it thought that it would be the ""monster movie to end all monster movies"", what with it being so far-removed from the cliched-but-familiar norm of the traditional giant monster movie formula by having the unique distinction of it being a survival horror thriller shot entirely in a found-footage documentary style (a novelty which really got overused and outstayed its welcome, over the course of the 2010s decade). When I watched it for the first time on home video, I didn't really like it all that much (probably because the idea of a ""found-footage"" format was still a relatively new concept to me, at the time). But as the years have gone by, I now see it as revolutionary masterpiece that actually made the kaiju genre feel genuinely scary again, after having numerous child-friendly, entertaining Godzilla and Gamera movies.I think the film perfectly captures that same chaotic sensibility of a tragic 9/11-type disaster, in which your irrational paranoia gets the better of you and you feel totally disoriented standing in a large crowd of panicking bystanders running for their lives (it really does put the audience's mind into that perspective, to see firsthand how the destruction events occurred from the point-of-view of the petrified onlookers). I'm only assuming that director Matt Reeves drew upon some inspiration for this from the real-life 9/11 terrorists attacks, kind of like how Ishiro Honda was inspired to make the original Godzilla after the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.The filmmaker's made the smart decision to shoot the movie from a human's viewpoint with a handheld digital camera, as it makes the towering behemoth that's terrorising New York City seem more real and creates a foreboding mood (they use it to their maximum advantage). The most effective scenes where the film's ""shaky-cam"" cinematography looks best are when you're at ground-level looking up at the monstrous destruction or seeing it take place from a distance away, shrouded between the semi-demolished buildings. They also keep you in constant suspense by only giving brief glimpses of the creature's body (like an elbow here or a knee there), but they never relentlessly tease in the same way Gareth Edwards did with his murky Godzilla movie. And by the end of it all, there'll be a payoff that's been well worth the wait (""all good things come to those who wait"", as they say). Even the titular monster itself has an otherworldly design, making it totally alien in appearance.Without spoiling anything, I want to address a couple of complaints that people bring up when discussing this film, with the first one being ""why do they still keep recording when a normal person would stop and put the camera down"". I think it's just imbedded in our human behaviour to be naturally curious about any and all strange stuff we come across and instinctively want to document it down by recording the shockingly catastrophic events we bear witness to. Then there's the central young adult characters who honestly, I thought were passably serviceable to the film's plot and I didn't find them to be anymore annoying than any other mindless partygoer characters you'd normally see in most horror flicks out there (besides, the camera guy did give us a good dose of some much-needed levity, which I found to be a tad funny at times).Another pet peeve of mine is when dumb people complain that ""they didn't explain what the monster is or where it came from"" (I'm getting so sick of hearing people say that). This should in no way be the slightest bit of an issue, because we don't need to know! The more knowledgeable you are about something, results drastically in you becoming less and less scared of the thing in question because then, at that point, you'll understand the creature too well and it'll start to take the essence of fear away from it being a creepy spine-chilling, unexplained mystery (it's the simple, age-old ""fear of the unknown"", which in-turn leaves it up to your own wicked imagination to fill in the blanks as what you don't see is often more scarier than what's right in front of your eyes).Without ruining what happens, this rollercoaster thrill ride of an immersive cinematic experience (let's face facts, the movie was always best seen on the big-screen in a cinema with a quality sound system) ends on an exceedingly haunting high note, with the only piece of musical score heard in the whole film played over the credits. Composer Michael Giacchino's eerily classical operatic soundtrack truly evokes an immensely strong sense of dreadful hopelessness (it helps amplify the grim tone).Rather than putting a permanent end to this worn-out, tired genre for good and let it rest in the past, Cloverfield was so popular that it singlehandedly managed to revitalise the interest in giant monster movies for a new generation of younger fans (once again, history has repeated itself because this situation is exactly like what happened with Wes Craven's Scream and how that brought about a rejuvenation of sorts to the stale, monotonous slasher sub-genre of horror films during the late-1990s and early-2000, as they made a big come back after the first one's release in 1996).",Cloverfield
401,The_Defiant1,"Love it or Despise it, This Movie is Different",8,16 January 2008,"Cloverfield is essentially a love story. The city is being attacked by a monster and Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) must try and rescue Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) who didn't even know she was loved. His friends Lily Ford (Jesssica Lucas) and Hud (T.J. Miller) tag along to help. Hud films the movie so you rarely see his face.There are so many reasons to dislike this movie, but I didn't. For those who have seen the trailer, there might be concerns that the camera action is too jerky. It is. It definitely is. The movie goes for realism so you have to suffer through some scenes that strained my ability to follow what was going on.Regardless of the jerky camera action, I was leaning forward in my seat soaking in the action be it good or bad.A great deal of mystery has been surrounding the monster. It doesn't stop while you are watching. Like the original Alien movie, the monster is a tease. You want to see more, but they keep showing portions of it and just tidbits. Thankfully the viewer is not robbed and some really good perspectives do get shown.Although I did not laugh, many people did because Hud the cameraman isn't the brightest and some of the things he says or films does warrant laughter. It got a smile from me.The monster attacking the city is accompanied by some smaller ones. If you've seen Starship Troopers, that's the best way to imagine them. Some of the CGI wire frames looked like it might have been borrowed from Starship Troopers.The ending evoked mixed emotions for me. I really liked the way it was done. There were so many wrong ways it could have ended, but the movie shows a little respect for the characters and the ending is proof.",Cloverfield

Well, I love Marmite and I loved this movie.Let's get the Blair Witch comparisons out of the way. I haven't actually seen Blair Witch, I got annoyed with all the hype claiming it was a genuine piece of film when it obviously wasn't. This has never and obviously can't claim to be genuine, that it is happening for real. For me it was a good old fashioned monster flick with a modern twist.I actually had no expectations when I sat down to watch it and for the first 15 minutes it was entertaining enough in an odd sort of soap opera way (relationships being discussed and so on) but, when the action hits it's one great big roller-coaster ride with lots of OMG moments. It never drags from that point on until the very end.Great performances from unknown actors and extremely convincing. Very clever and highly recommended.",Cloverfield

Unsympathetic characters (if that's what they were).The first half hour or so is setting up the characters at a party. Unfortunately this sets the characters up as unsympathetic, and the film never recovers. That's when I realised I was in for camcorder footage all the way through. It was exactly what you might expect, so if you really want to see this film choose a big cinema where you can sit at the back and not be too nauseated by the random movements.The rest of the film is not very entertaining and consists of the camcorder being carried around New York as the action takes place off screen.I really don't recommend this film.",Cloverfield
404,Neenee-b,Running scared - right to the top of the box office,10,17 February 2008,"I love it when you go to the movies to see a film that you know very little about - The Sixth Sense was one and look how that turned out. With Cloverfield there was so much mystery and so many rumours I avoided everything but the trailer until I went to see it.The movie starts off with Robs farewell party which is shown quite a bit in the trailer. It is there we meet our cast - Rob, his true love (which unfortunately for everyone he only realises this after the first attack) Beth, his brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily, Hud who acts as the cameraman and sarcastic commentator, a character which you will either love or hate and the girl that he loves Marlena. The characters are all pretty much one dimensional but it doesn't matter - there is no time to delve into their back story and get to know then - we know all we need to know from the party.After a very quick introduction to everyone the attack on New York begins and the head of the Statue of Liberty is one of the first casualties in the attack. It was one of the most memorable moments of the trailer yet it was still shocking to see it happen so early in the movie.Following the first attack Rob receives a voice mail message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment across town and Rob sets of to rescue her along with his friends. Not since Lord of The Rings have a small group of people out walking suffered so much drama, heartache and action - and it was great fun to watch.Once you get used to the hand held, unsteady movements of the camera it really added to the panic and chaos. We saw the explosions, monsters (the big one and the small ones) and action from the point of the characters, who were usually running in the opposite direction. This added to the tension and excitement as you were only really seeing snippets of what was really happening in the city - we pass by ambulance crews working on the injured and a mass army operation complete with tanks and loud explosions, but these are only in the background as the main focus remains on our small group of characters reaching Beth's apartment What makes the action work is the fact that the characters are just normal everyday people - they do not produce shotguns or start quipping witty one liners at the danger. They are running for their lives in terror and again this works so well with the unsteady camera - there are no slow-mo Michael Bay money shots in this film!! There are some very memorable scenes such as turning on the night vision in the underground tunnels - even though you knew what was obviously going to happen it was still scary, the death scene in the tent in the army base - I am still not sure what actually happened but I know that it was gross and the helicopter evacuation.I am not intelligent enough to think of a clever and thought provoking metaphor for the monster attacking New York as that is it not why I go to the movies - I go to be entertained and I left the cinema feeling buzzed, excited and thoroughly entertained by Cloverfield and because of this I would give it 10/10.My only grip would be asking why the characters walked everywhere - I would've stolen one of the many cars that were abandoned about the streets of NYC - but then again I suppose that it is easy to be critical when you are sitting in the safety of a cinema screen and not running for your life",Cloverfield
405,laymonite-2,Much better than I expected!,8,1 May 2008,"I had heard various things about this, but not much. That it ghoulishly used the NYC terrorist attacks to it's advantage. That it was pointless because it didn't explain anything.Imagine if someone told you there was a film where a giant monster levelled NYC and it was really scary. You'd laugh right? Imagine those old Godzilla films with a man in a rubber suit and it all caused by radiation.Now imagine watching the film and actually finding it a serious and scary horror film. Told from the point of view of the people being stomped on by Godzilla in an ultra realistic style. With friends and family and real fears. Imagine there IS no explanation for this. It's not a big rubber T-Rex - it's something slimily organic and alien. You are facing death at every turn, no-one knows what it is, nothing is working, society is effectively destroyed as far as you can see and people are dying all around you -it's real. This is what this film achieves.I found the film personally all the more satisfying for not explaining anything. Moving from this or explaining the monster would have distanced viewers from the realism the film had established, to the extent of the whole film supposedly being filmed on a single camcorder by people living through the event.This is from the makers of Lost, and of course a huge amount of speculation has appeared about almost everything in the film, including fake websites and violent fan arguments.Just see the film Godzilla shouold have been or may have seemed to audiences 50 years ago, vastly improved..",Cloverfield

To me it seems a little fast considering its downtown Manhattan.To me it seems like Manhattan got empty of people rather quickly.The headache I got from watching this movie.Things I like about this movie.I like the concept of this movie. I always think it's a tad predictable that the experts in charge are always the ones in the movies with an alien attack. With Cloverfield its just some yuppies walking around not knowing what to do. So you can relate, well sort of.The sets and filming locations were amazing. It did look like a trashed New York city.The skyscraper leaning on another building. This is capable of happening when two buildings are very close together.The camcorder used for this film is shot in real time. I've read others complain that its unlikely the battery would last for this long, however a battery on a camcorder does in fact last longer then say an hour and a half.Overall it's a pretty good sci-fi movie. Its realistic enough and it has a good concept for an idea, the idea being an Alien attack being filmed by people who have no idea what is going on. It is worth a watch and its pretty entertaining. This is why I give it a 6 out of 10.",Cloverfield
407,MidnightWarrior,The monster gets the star,1,19 January 2008,"Let me begin by saying this film had some seriously tremendous potential. The premise is fantastic and very interesting: a strange monster invades NYC and the entire footage is captured by a group of young people. This idea is rock solid. Unfortunately, it's the execution of the premise and the poor choices made by the director that make this film, once promising, now literally vomit inducing.For starters, shooting the entire film on hand-held camera is an INCREDIBLE mistake. Yes, there are instances where this approach works well, but for the majority of the film where the characters are running or moving quickly, it just doesn't work. Anytime there's some kind of action, all we see is nothing but blur.Films are supposed to entertain. What is entertaining about blurs and streaks of blurs in motion on the big screen? Nothing. It's vomit inducing. It's okay for characters to run, so why didn't the crew switch to a production camera during those moments where the cast is scurrying away? We needed to see them running away, but from a third person perspective, not a first person (hand held camera) perspective. It's not like the crew couldn't afford it - especially since they did a spectacular job on all the other aspects of the film (the CGI monster). Failure of the director to recognize this exemplifies his poor integrity skills.Any kind of sequel to this film is going to be lame. I was glad the characters died or were attacked. Because when they were, that awful camera was stationary and it didn't hurt to look at the screen.Lots of people on here claim that Cloverfield shakes less than the Blair Witch Project. Utter nonsense. As you get into the middle and end of the film, the shaking is SO bad that the film becomes one for your ears and not your eyes. Roughly 20 people (young and old) left the theater and did not return. The man sitting behind me vomited.Another reason why I dislike this film is because there's nothing invested in the story. We want answers to what is this monster, where did it come from, what does it want and how do we get rid of it? These questions are NEVER answered.Again, another instance in which the director is to blame for failure to do his job properly. The shaky camera and unfinished script RUINED the film. At the end of the day, after all is said and done, this film might make gobs of money. But at what price? At the price of the audience HATING the director as well as the studio? Is all that money worth it to be blacklisted by those you seek to entertain? Do yourself a favor, skip this film. In fact, if you want, you can grab your own hand-held camera, record yourself shaking it vigorously while you and your friends scream in the background about a monster. Then put it in your DVD player and watch it. If you do, you'll pretty much get the gist of watching Cloverfield, but I'd bet yours is even better than Cloverfield. Why? Because you are an amateur whereas these guys (are supposed to be) professionals. But to me, the quality of work is the same.And it cost you practically nothing.",Cloverfield
408,stewiefan201,Cloverfield's flaws never subtract from its strengths.,8,21 January 2008,"Many excited filmgoers have been waiting for it and here it finally is, in all its glory. Cloverfield in the beginning was a simple trailer that showed an explosion, panic, and the Statue of Liberty's decapitated head lying in the streets of New York. This lone trailer invoked so much mystery into the movie since all it showed at the end was the name J.J. Abrams (TV series Lost) and the release date 1-18-08, which will now go down in monster-movie fan history as a famous date. After all the mystery, guesses, clues, photos, and intrigue, finally a second trailer was released. People were now even more excited claiming they saw the monster run in between two buildings in one shot, or they saw the monster's face as a bridge collapsed. But nobody was sure of what they saw in the trailers and press, which was a result of the brilliant viral marketing scheme of the film. Nobody had any idea what to expect, or what the monster looked like until they saw the film. All answers were answered and mysteries de-mystified on the infamous opening day of Cloverfield 1-18-08.Cloverfield is filmed completely home-movie like with main character named Hud holding the camcorder the whole entire time. The movie begins with a going-away party for a young guy named Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who is leaving for Japan for a job as vice president at a company. As Hud (T.J. Miller) walks around interviewing people, a sudden earthquake-like interruption occurs. Everyone goes out onto the roof and sees a gigantic explosion occur. Everyone wanders out onto the street only to learn that some kind of giant monstrous entity is attacking New York. Total mayhem ensues in the city as Rob, Hud, and a few other friends such as Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), try to escape from the city. (Of course they bring the camcorder along for a home movie like none other.)At 84 minutes Cloverfield is a short movie, but runs with frenetic and tense energy the whole time. Once the monster plot kicked in, I never felt any boredom for one moment and was constantly excited to see what was going to happen next. The character development felt shoddy but to me that only adds to the realism of what's going on. This is not like a normal film where everything is shot sequentially and time is added to developing the characters. The audience does not know these characters any more than whoever (Probably the Army) found the camcorder. Did you really expect Hud to go up and ask everyone their life story before the attack, I guess that's a no.Many have complained that the home movie style of the film induced motion sickness, or caused them to throw up. I personally didn't get sick or feel sick at all, and neither did the two friends I saw it with. The camera angles in the movie at certain points are still and firm, and at other points shaking all over the place, and dipping up and down and every which way and that. This camera style is one of the key ingredients added for the realistic residue of the movie. But I guess I agree, Cloverfield should be labeled ""WARNING: This Film May Cause One to Puke.""Now to the big excitement of Cloverfield that is the monster. We never really gain a good view of the monster in its full detailed form. There is pretty much always a building or smoke blocking part of it, or maybe the camera angle dips which happens a lot during this film. But that nevers detracts from my fascination with the unknown creature. One fact that angered some audiences was that we are never get an explanation of what the monster is, where it came from, why it's so destructive and mean, or what its goal is if it has one. To me that is the beauty of Cloverfield. I have had enough of horror-thriller flicks like Cloverfield that always spoonfeed to filmgoers all the dirty details of what everything means. The imagination can think up far more brilliant theories and details than the film itself can. Once the mystery is explained, there goes the mystery. The monster in Cloverfield was enormous, vicious, destructive, and intriguing. I'm also very glad that it's something original and not Godzilla.The flaws are there of course, so here's what I and others found. The camera seems to be very high tech, I've never heard of a camera that's battery can last vast hours, and also survive a few huge drops without even a cracked lense. Another problem I found is that there aren't more buildings that were knocked down by the creature. We see the statue of Liberty's head thrown down a street, and also a huge skyscraper fall to the ground, but not many others are torn down. Another issue is why are there no dead bodies littering the streets? With all that's going on there should have been a few bodies scattered about. Also why is everyone on foot, did they forget their car keys? I think the instinct would be get in a car to get away from a monster attacking a city, but I guess a nice pair of Cross-Trainers solves that problem. One last issue is that the lady characters are running very fast in high heels, now I'm a guy but I don't think that'd be happening.Cloverfield has flaws just like any other movie. But the suspense and heart-pounding excitement, and unexpected scares, are what got me. I give Cloverfield a 3 out of 4. It is the prescription to cure any fanboy's fever.",Cloverfield
409,wingthwong,Cloverfield? More like Overhyped.,1,9 November 2018,"After ignoring this when it first came out, it now appeared on Netflix. Well, as Netflix is bloated with their own ego and horrible production value these days, very little good content appears anymore. This was no exception. It's midnight, scrolling through and even passed it a few times. Came back to it. It is PG-13. I let it auto play. Figured I could at least fall asleep if it made even good background noise. Nope. This found footage schlockfest is absolutely the worst Kaiju ever created. The storyline, the cinematography, the forced acting, T.J. Miller, all make for one long headache inducing annoyance. This is not sci-fi, but something more on the lines of what Asylum would put out on a big budget. J.J. Abrams is taking in money for sure destroying big sci-fi franchises, and he surely did that to a whole genre with this. What was Lizzy Caplan doing when she signed up for this. Should have stuck to my instincts and passed it up again. And what's sad is there is a chain of movies tied to this and it has a cult following. What is the cult called? ""We watch mindless Abrams films and say thank you, may I have another?""",Cloverfield
410,adam-may-bower,Smart,8,2 June 2018,"'Cloverfield' is a smart and engaging found-footage monster horror that will keep its viewers on edge.
The team of director Matt Reeves, producer J.J. Abrams and writer Drew Goddard create a great horror flick that is surprisingly unpredictable and one of the tensest films I have seen in a while. The well-thought out pacing enables it's viewers to know just enough about the main characters to care about them, so when the action starts you're actually hoping that the characters will make it. Character establishment is an important aspect of any film, particular horrors because the audience needs to have some sort of attachment to it's characters in order for them to actually enjoy the movie because you have people you want to root for. From the very moment that the terror begins, it essentially doesn't stop, resulting in that edge-of-your-seat feeling that we all love. The fact that the entire film is done in an amateur manner, through a shaky camcorder, helps the viewer immerse into the film and it adds a sense of reality. Therefore, when the scares come, they are nothing short of frightening. However, this film did have a few flaws as some scenes seemed rather far-fetched, particularly at the end, which broke the sense of realism. There was also some predictability, but it was balanced with a few moments that were surprising.",Cloverfield
411,maatmouse-1,nice premise for a horror movie spoiled by home video style,5,20 April 2008,"What an incredibly original idea for a film! Make a horror/disaster movie in the style of a home video, complete with rotten, shaky camera work and the camera operator speaking as he is recording the 'video'.Unfortunately, this has been done before and no better. The Blair Witch Project got there first and, although, this film uses CGI effects to enhance the disaster movie experience, the premise is the same; horror movie in a home video style.I have to say, I was watching this on a DVD, not the cinema. I probably couldn't have coped with it on the cinema with its big screen, which would have made the home video feel absolutely horrific. I can imagine leaving the cinema to be ill or suffering from motion sickness. As it was, every time the camera/operator did one of his 'spins' to push the camera around to talk to someone else, I had to look away. This is not really something you want to do in a film like this.I have to say, but Sam Raimi did this so much better in Evil Dead. However, he didn't use a video camera and his shots were far better done. The acting was basic at best, but then you weren't watching this for the acting nor the dialogue. The disaster aspect was nicely done, but only if you could tolerate the camera work long enough to appreciate it.This film also took a long time to really get started. There was a lot of completely pointless 'background' setup which could have been cut so easily and the plot brought more swiftly to conclusion.My advice to the filmmakers for a sequel is: ditch the home video feel and shoot it properly without home video, but maybe use the home video sparsely, and you'll make a better film.",Cloverfield
412,michaeljharvey,"Much, much better than expected",6,11 June 2008,"After seeing the trailer and hearing the initial wave of so-so reviews, this movie seemed sure to be a disappointment. Also, one had to wonder if the ""top secret"" promotion of the film prior to its release was just the studio's marketing department trying to disguise a poor film as long as possible.Gladly, none of my fears were realized. Cloverfield lived up to the hype. The plot involves the documentation of a Godzilla-like attack on NYC, shown with realism through a hand-held video camera. Many have said it's Blair Witch meets Godzilla. That seems a bit of an over-simplification, but works as a good basic description. The challenge of depicting a large-scale action/disaster/sci-fi movie through the tiny lens of a video camera is daunting, but executed quite well here. Many will question plot elements and say, ""Well, a hand-held camera can't... Why wouldn't you drop the camera when... The camera would break if..."". Yes, a certain suspension of disbelief is necessary for the home-video concept to work. That's why it's a film and not reality.Ultimately, Cloverfield doesn't bring much original to the monster-movie genre in terms of special effects, plot or character development. Despite this, the hand-held camera realism is enough to make it unique and well worth watching.",Cloverfield
413,Deathstryke,Not the mess I thought it would be,7,12 February 2008,"By that I mean I didn't puke from motion sickness, although I did get a bit of a headache during one or two scenes. The hand held camera can be disorientating but it adds a gripping immediacy to the terrifying events and totally immerses you in the thick of it. That is of course if you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept that the camera man manages to keep filming while monsters, missiles and fiery debris rain down around him like lottery balls in a shuffling machine.We are plonked into an apartment to share in the humorous, occasionally annoying banter of a few likable Manhattan yuppies who rudely have their clambake interrupted by a giant squid/crab/turtle like creature who takes considerable offense to tall buildings and men in green uniforms firing rockets into his face. The explosions, the dust clouds, the wounded civilians, all captured on what looks like grainy news footage create a distinctly 9/11 feel and it's an interesting memory or emotion to play on.We are told absolutely nothing about...well, anything. There is no explanation as to why the monster is there at all, but the threat, the danger is emphatically realized. Clueless as the characters in the movie, we are left to fathom things at the rate at which they happen, and this mystery makes for a largely unpredictable and stimulating experience.The acting is credible and I appreciate the director's decision not to use big name actors. This for the most part really does feel like a documentation that was found in a ruin, if not for a few contrived incidences, most notably at the end where we finally get to view the monster in all it's grumpy faced, tentacle lashing glory. The SFX are terrific but some moments have a distinct CGI shininess to them. Dialoge contains a lot of improv as you would expect, it's supposed to be real life, and it goes around in circles a bit. The phrase ""OH MY GOD!!!"" is repeated frequently, yet one would expect less of a PG-13 response to a giant mutant vapourising Central Park! There is also humour scripted in the least likely of places, which is appreciated yet detracts from the effect of a real life documentation.All in all Cloverfield was a fresh, exciting, slightly nauseating way to watch New York get pulverized all over again.",Cloverfield
414,Gezzerboy,A Pile Of Poo,4,18 January 2008,Just got back from seeing this on the opening night.I found the camera technique very annoying and it gave me a headache throughout. Not knowing what the thing is and not know what happened atthe end really spoiled it. There were some good moments but all in all i have to say a film like this just doesn't work when filmed as it was.IT could have been superb as it was like Godzilla but with attitude.Nobody cheered or clapped at the end which is rare for a new opening action movie in the states. I wouldn't bother going to see it to be honest.Some good things though. Beth is hot in the film and I like he little creature things that chasedthem but all in all not impressed and the hype wasn't lived up to,Cloverfield
415,HandsomeBen,terrible,7,20 September 2011,"I hated this movie,it's way overrated. Don't get me wrong the acting was pretty good, and it didn't take to long for the action pack scenes to start either. The story plot was pretty good too. Giant monster bug takes over Manhattan and no one knows where it came from. Not bad at all! It also wasn't the fact that the movie was taken at a 'POV' hand held camera angle, since I'm used to those types of movies.I actually love those types of movies, Quarintine and Blair Witch Project being good examples. The problem with this movie is that it's BORING. Even though there are a lot of action/attacks scenes it was still boring. It did hold my attention for the first 40-50 minutes, but then I realized how boring this was. The characters themselves were bland with no personalities, they weren't likable, nor interesting. So that itself made me instantly hate this movie. If I don't care about the characters then the movie will be a waste. To make things worse the characters are stupid. For example Rob Hawkins(whose name I had to look up since he was so boring I forgot), makes it his mission to find some girl whose his girlfriend or sister (I really don't know), whose in trouble at her house. Even though there is a giant 100-200 foot monster attacking the city along with thousands of baby monsters running around, he goes out of his way to try and rescue her. His friends don't want to leave him alone so they decide to go as a group through the DARK subway tunnels. You may think he is brave and a so called hero but in my eyes he's dense, and so are the other characters even thought they tried to talk him out of it. The smart thing would have been to tell a trained soldier about his sister or girlfriend about her being in trouble! They would have got to her sooner and no one would have been killed or hurt. Oh did I mention that there were hundreds of soldiers in the streets trying to guide everyone to safety? But no that wasn't good enough, the group had to recuse the girl themselves. Silly me, of course we can't have a movie without dumb characters! The characters aren't the only thing that got on my nerves, it was also the cheap cgi effects. Not only did the monster look fake but it looked like something out of a video game. For a movie that had a pretty high budget you'd think you get decent effects. And if you can't get decent effects then don't show the monster so much! Leave it to the audience's' imagination, it's scarier that way. I'm sorry but I just couldn't take this 'film' seriously. Please leave the filming to the pros.",Cloverfield
416,chimera-4,Cutting Edge Cinema,9,17 January 2008,"Cloverfield is a mish mash of several ideas, none completely original but everything seems to gel together nicely giving the viewer what feels like a fresh experience.What we have here is the good old classic monster movie of old, you know, big man in monster suit (though the monster FX are awesome)up from the depths (although it could have been outer space, we never do find out for sure) because of some nuclear tests gone west. Monster proceeds to chew it's way through (insert major city here although this time round it happens to be Manhattan, big enough to give the creature ample stomping ground but small enough that if they have to nuke it there's plenty more America left to go around) and laughs off all manner of firepower in the meantime leaving the viewer wondering how the hell humankind's going to get out of this one (in other words which of the standard monster movie/invasion endings are going to save our butts, you know, micro-germs, superior firepower, monster gets bored and goes home etc). We've all seen this movie in one of a thousand iterations before.What makes Cloverfield unique though is the perspective through which we see the events unfold. The whole thing is presented as thought it were a leaked (although they couldn't really hush up events of this scale)clump of handycam footage taken by a small group of people affected by these happenings. There's no credits till the end, instead at the beginning we get a Department of Defence watermark along with some official blurb stating what this ""found"" footage is. The movie then is this ""raw"" footage in it's entirety from the testimonials at a surprise party through the events of the evening to it's conclusion (?!?!) which may or may not be the end of the story. Now because of this, there are bits which feel a bit disjointed. I mean we get everything throughout the evening of the main characters and these things sometimes cross over with the whole monster stomping scenario but there are times you want to see more of what's going on but instead our limited viewpoint denies us these things. This isn't as big a problem as it was with Speilbergs War of the Worlds though. Here you get to see lots of things you wanted to see in that movie but didn't. Massive military might up against this thing, I mean up close and personal (which you did see in WotW but it wasn't as satisfying as it is here)as well lots of convenient and circumstantial encounters with the creature which give you either some ""Did I just see that"" moments or some real in your face OMG moments.The parts without the main plot (monster) are still interesting enough though that most of the time you don't mind not seeing what's going on elsewhere though and the film does a good job in the first 10 minutes portraying normal people in a real world situation that when stuff starts going down you think ""oh yeah, the monster stuff"".It's also testament that when the main event isn't on screen the story still continues off screen thanks to excellent sound design. One scene where our troupe are down in an underground station talking and stuff, you can still here stuff happening above. Explosions, gunfire, creatures roaring etc. You really feel like you're in the midst of this thing. Some of the jerky handycam footage might make some people a bit sick if you're sitting close to the screen but all up it really helped add to the ""in your face and personal"" nature of the format.The look of the creature has been a closely guarded secret which was either because they wanted it be a total surprise or because it looked really pants. Well I'm happy to report that all monsters/creatures and things appearing in this movie looked really cool if a little bit derivative. You rarely see the big picture but you do see up close and detailed bits of the little picture. You're frantically trying to build a picture in your head of what the thing looks like, it's like trying to mentally piece together a jigsaw puzzle.My only gripe (and it's pretty small) is that due to the way the action is framed around the smaller more personal story of our small group of friends there's little room for exposition and when it does come it's a bit obvious and set up but I really don't know any other way they could have done it. Also there's little real plot or character development but since the movie takes place mostly over the course of one night and again due to the way it's presented I didn't really find it that much of a problem.J.J.Abrams and team did an admirable job giving the retro Monster Movie a solid reboot here. Some people might find the abrupt ending (which is realistic in light of how it's presented) a turn off but personally I think it's a good opportunity to load up the DVD with extras to fill in some of the blanks (like the Blair Witch Project did)...There's some real iconic moments in Cloverfield and while this movie is being hyped up to the high heavens so can't possibly live up to all it's expectations, there's definitely a top flight experience offered here that most will surely enjoy.",Cloverfield
417,masonmorgan-92917,Above average monster movie,7,16 May 2017,"Matt Reeves' Cloverfield remains popular for all the wrong reasons. Many know it as ""the monster movie that causes motion sickness"", and as many don't give the film a chance because of this, they are missing out on a chillingly effective monster movie.The concept of a found footage monster movie is quite ambitious. How can the sheer scale of a monster movie be properly showcased without the use of cinematic camera-work? In many ways, Cloverfield is brilliant, becoming on of the most intense monster movies I've ever seen, without the use of these grandiose cinematics and overblown action. Nearly all of the film remains on ground level, which adds copious amounts of tension and works at making the viewer feel utterly helpless. The scenes in which the monster towers almost directly over the camera are heart-pounding as we can't help but marvel at the technical scope this movie achieves. And while many complain that the monster remains hidden for the majority of the film, that only makes these surprise appearances all the more terrifying. The special effects are nothing short of spectacular, despite what the direction gimmick may lead some to believe. Cloverfield features a cast of characters that are surprisingly likable, even if they are walking clichés and remain underdeveloped by the credits, but in a film like this, I would be lying if I said it wasn't fitting. The only real issues I had with Cloverfield was the incompetent story and, at times, the camera-work. The story of Cloverfield is reasonably simple, as it should be, but even as our characters set themselves a definitive goal, we keep getting pulled into tiring side stories that don't seem to have much affect on the film whatsoever. The sequence in which our characters are rescuing a friend from an almost horizontal skyscraper, drags on and isn't particularly engaging. While it does serve as a breather from the rest of the film's intensity, it does effect the pacing of the film as a whole. While I do believe that the infamously shaky camera-work benefits the film more than hinder it, it does at times go too far. The scenes become almost incoherently shaky at times, not really adding much to the viewer's experience other than a migraine.While the young adult drama and jittery camera work suggests a quality no less than amateurish, the masterful use of scale and sparing utilization of the nerve-racking creature sightings makes Cloverfield anything but.",Cloverfield

419,Cube_TX,"Not very original, but much better than I thought I it would be",7,21 January 2008,"I saw this film yesterday with my wife and oldest son, mostly because my son wanted to see it so badly. My wife and I both expected a total fanboy blood & gore monster/disaster flick with a bunch of characters only there to die in a loud and gory manner. Granted, for the most part it WAS a fanboy monster/disaster flick but it did manage to impress all three of us and somehow live up to the hype. I hadn't seen or read any websites or message boards so I was able to see the film without knowing any outside theories or leaked information.Yes, this film borrowed heavily from other films of its kind. I was reminded often of Aliens, The Blair Witch Project (itself an idea copied from Cannibal Holocaust) and the original War of the Worlds. I even saw some parallels from 9/11 video clips. It also had the generic disaster film elements of the troubled relationship that was being saved in the midst of disaster (just like Independence Day and Twister) and the heroic protagonist who disregards safety for the woman he loves. I think everyone knew that the end (spoiler alert!) would show the two troubled lovers one last time to remind us that they were happy not too long before. Despite all of this, I was still impressed with how the film was put together. They did manage to keep it all entertaining and I was never bored. I legitimately cared about these characters and the viewer felt like part of the disaster. I wanted them to escape even though the very beginning of the film had already suggested that they wouldn't make it.I've seen better films of this genre, but I still recommend Cloverfield to anyone who likes these kinds of movies. Not exactly family-friendly (our 1-year-old didn't come with us) but an entertaining way to spend an evening. I'd probably buy it on DVD. The only complaint I'd have would be the fanboy audience made up of skinny wannabe punkers who wore jeans so low they looked like they'd pooped their pants and identical-looking underage goths talking and answering cell phones during the movie.",Cloverfield
420,piksplanet,Just loved it!!,10,11 April 2008,"I'm yet to get out of the dizzy feeling I got after seeing Cloverfield. Basically for two reasons. The first being that its been shot on a hand-held camera. Secondly, what a movie! To say that J.J.Abrams and Matt Reeves make an awesome movie-making couple just doesn't say it. I loved the movie they had made a couple of years ago, The Pallbearer. This is contrast at it highest point. It's like Laurel and Hardy decided to make movies, and it was oh so good.Yes, Cloverfield is a monster movie. But, unlike the monster movies which have been made more recently, this one works. It's from the point of view a a few 20-something's living in New York on the night of a farewell party. It's Blair Witch style. But better. It's Godzilla, but more terrifying. It's fear, its pain, its horror, its loud, its everything. All packaged into an hour and fifteen minutes of a roller coaster ride.It is a look into the monster attack on Manhattan on 22nd-23rd May, 2007 recorded on a hand-held camera found in Central Park. The name of the movie is basically the name of the sighting. Read : Multiple sightings of case designated Cloverfield.What I enjoyed most was the hype created before its release. No one had a clue what it would be like. Whether the monster was Godzilla, some dragon, etc etc. I recognized no one in the cast except Jessica Lucas, whom I had seen on Life As We Know It and The L word. So, it was even more of a surprise for me. The casting is perfect, mind you. I haven't seen a bunch of 20-something's running for their lives more horrifically in my life. You can feel the terror. It's like its sitting there right beside you.There is no background music. Its real time sound. Man, is it loud. Man, is it freaky. There's just something about the fact that there's a 400 foot monster roaming around somewhere near you that freaks anyone out. And that ain't all. Wait till you find out that its dropping little many-legged thingies making sounds like 'ayayayayaya' which could tear you limb from limb. Not just that. If you happen to get bitten by those little thingies, guess what happens.. You explode!! (Sorry for letting that go. I just could not help it) Behind all the horror and all the havoc of this 'monster', their lies a very well pronounced story. Something that most films lack these days. A bunch of people trying to save a loved one. It ain't no tear-jerker, but its bound to make you care for the characters. That, added with ""Dude, I really think we shouldn't be here"", and stuff that happens so fast that you'll go,'What the Hell was that!?""makes Cloverfield one of the best creature feature's you'll ever watch. Just listen to the havoc when the severed head of the Statue of Liberty falls to the streets. You'll know what fear is.Cloverfield is short, exhilarating, sad, scary, all at the same time. It leaves certain questions unanswered. Even the closing credits were scary. I hear they're making a sequel. Eat your heart out King Kong and Godzilla. I was hooked on to this, from the time the thump hit and I saw that red robot running around the bushes. Then came the writing, Bad Robot Pictures. And the movie began..9/10 for acting. 9/10 for story. 9/10 for direction. Straight 10 for the music. And I cannot get enough of the dizzy camera!",Cloverfield
421,potipiroon,One of the best movies of all time!,10,29 April 2021,"To me, this is one of my most favorite movies of all time. Why? First, I mean the CG was really terrific, despite the fact that the film was made before 2008. Everything felt super real and it felt almost like I was actually there in the movie. Second, the monster was really scary and credible. Third, the characters were well-developed; I can feel the terrors that each character was going through. ID4 is still my most favorite and this one come as a very close second.A lot of people dislike this because the camera is all shaky. But hey that is exactly the point.",Cloverfield
422,jmillerjr-00983,Ok... Would have been better if...,6,13 December 2019,I really wanted this film to tie into Lost. That was the main reason it had my interest.

423,ghettodogaudio06,Definitely Different!,6,21 April 2008,"I have been waiting to see this film because of all the hype. This film was done very well with a digital hand-held camera. Now this was a big production from the same producer that does Lost. So I wouldn't be surprised if there was Steady Cam and some fancier camera tricks. This film had a full blown crew and actors so it had the potential to be filmed Hollywood style but instead the film makers went with a newer and different style from the medium. There was absolutely no plot to this movie. I mean yes and no but mainly this is a monster movie. I found myself laughing almost the whole movie. And it's not that I thought this film was bad. I liked it because I am open-minded and have a film background. But I can already see customers at Blockbuster bring this film back and want there money back. Customers did that with Sweeny Todd because it's a musical. That's so lame. If you don't like a film because of your close-minded attitude don't watch that film. So check this movie out, it's definitely different.",Cloverfield
424,monsterhunt-94296,Holds your attention but not much substance,5,8 July 2020,"I've heard about Cloverfield before so I decided to give it a watch, and I'm just now posting this review on IMDb. The movie is really short (1 hr 24 min including credits), and it passes by pretty quick. I didn't find myself getting bored throughout the movie, so I'll give it that, but honestly there's not much substance here. If you don't know, Cloverfield is about this group of people having a going away party in Manhattan for this guy moving to Japan, and then these massive monsters attack. The premise is interesting, and all the monster stuff is done pretty well I guess. The movie is all from a handheld perspective, which was kind of annoying but it was done really well at some parts. This movie actually gave me a headache, which actually brought me into the story more because I'm sure all the characters had a headache by that point (still not really a good thing though). The characters are pretty flat, and they are the most stupid characters you will ever see, and the plot is totally unrealistic. I felt like this was the definition of style over substance. The movie really has nothing to say other than ""look how cool we can make a destroyed city look"". Some people call this one of the worst movies of all time, and I really can't agree with that just because this was really entertaining. Some give it a 9/10, and I can't agree with that because there just wasn't much here. Overall, this movie was really entertaining while I watched it, but I'll probably never think about it again, and I guess I might rewatch it if I need to kill some time without having to think too much. I'd give Cloverfield a 5/10 just because of the entertainment value, objectively you're looking at a 4/10 or a 3/10.",Cloverfield

Yeah there is camera wobble here and there. Honestly the whole thing was a great ride and had me literally on top of my seat jumping up and down with excitement! I really liked the kid working the video camera, he was hilarious! The drama felt real, after a while I kept forgetting it was a monster movie until the camera would look up at one. The statue of liberty from both the trailer (so its not a spoiler) and the movie was great. I too was disappointed it was not in Escape from New York but yet was on their poster.I would go into a few spoiler details but just go see it for yourself, don't listen to us reviewers.

It was a clever novelty once - even arty - but it really infuriates when it prevents you from appreciating what is happening.It was bad enough that Robert Rodriguez made Planet Terror look like it was filmed in the 50's, but Cloverfield just S.U.C.K.S sucks!Whilst the film is a REALLY great idea, I just don't feel that it delivered enough answers for all the build up, nor enough decent views of the creatures to satisfy sci fi or monster fans.

428,mjjusa-1,Life Interrupted,8,22 January 2008,"This may be the first post postmodern film. A MTV inspired style of self-conscious life narrated in real time with a herky-jerky style that becomes a topsy turvy big screen reality. A real time reality not found in traditional movies. Sure, the Blair Witch Project pioneered the style, but Cloverfield, a big movie, a big budget movie, a big story movie, that takes The Real World and makes it an epic movie. Sort of a combination of The Real World's young adult swirling lives, The Amazing Race's group dynamics, and non-professional documentaries found on Youtube. But, in Cloverfield, the ultimate prize isn't money or fame, but survival.With a story that is universal: love and loss. A behind the camera Falstaffian figure telling the story, and the story told entirely in the moment. Despite the shakiness of the camera and the rules of the reality game, a movie with a delicate suppleness showing time suspended through the replay of the discovered disk containing a preexisting real-time love story caught in calmer more innocent times. The camera captures the sensibility of a younger generation in its use of language, raw feelings of young love, and a realism that engages viewers of any age. The shaky camera does become a bit much at times, but a glance or two away from the screen at a static theater chair, or the empty box of popcorn on the theater floor restores the movie viewer's center and eases the stomach.The story is simple enough: a going away party of twenty-something's at a Manhattan apartment have their lives interrupted by an unimagined evil and violence. Told with in a self-indulgent egocentric style of narrative familiar to us all from television. A style that has leapt from the small screen to the big and creates a new effective form of movie making. Off putting at first, the various narratives spoken to the camera keep us up front and close to the action and up to date with their stories, viscerally involved, with the fantastical growing disaster that has torn their comfortable lives and New York to pieces.Interesting movie making, done with incredible art direction, control of crowd scenes, special effects, believable nightmarish monsters, and style. Done in a way that brought all of 9/11 back to me. What it might have been like if a camera had been found in the rubble of the Twin Towers detailing the lives of real people the same age as the characters in Cloverfield with the same hopes and dreams and desire to live long lives as they confront a fate they could not have imagined as they woke up and got ready for the day on that beautiful morning.I am still a bit sea sick and oppressed by what I saw on the screen. I am also incredibly impressed by this post postmodern movie. I remember the story about the long time New York Times movie reviewer panning Bonnie and Clyde. He did not appreciate the new style and stylized violence of the movie. He just didn't get it, and by not getting admitted to the NYT's readers that the times had passed him. He retired shortly after the movie became a hit, his artistic point of view too rigid to admit the brilliance of Arthur Penn's vision.In 2008, after a decade of radically changing media and media content delivery systems, it's idiotic to hold to a rigid view of what constitutes movie art. Digital, high speed downloads, cell phone movies, blogs, iPods, iPhones, electronic books bang bang boom and poof... something new was probably invented whilst I write this. I watch a downloaded mini movie by Martin Scorsese late one night, a take off on Hitchcock for a Spanish champagne, and it is so good I smile in bed like an idiot. I email it to a friend in London and ten minutes later he emails me a video taken with his phone that day of a walk in a park with leaves so golden and red that the video seems hand painted.Cloverfield, a movie as metaphor on many levels: a going away party for a young executive leaving for Japan, the land of Godzilla and Mothra, dependent as metaphor on what your definition of 'going away' is. Cloverfield, first person self conscious narratives with more Oh My Gods than a Catholic mass, a life boat in a stormy sea mounted camera, focus and film quality that would not have been allowed in the Golden Age of Hollywood, and the lives and fates of a group of generation Xers (or is it Yers?) whose lives are suddenly in the grip of a mindless evil, made for this movie lover a new kind of movie, a movie that I would recommend highly.",Cloverfield
429,a-little-squeek,Heads Up !,2,18 May 2008,"If you enjoy ""found footage"" movies and liked 'Blair Witch Project' you will probably enjoy this too. Unfortunately, both films left me wanting.Cloverfield starts out VERY slowly and kills about the first half hour on feeble development of plot and characters. As the story unfolds, interest begins to mount, but I found myself already getting antsy by then. Farther along, the few glimpses of the threat are pretty cool and there is attempt to heighten the scary factor throughout by keeping the threat pretty much out of sight, kind of like what Spielberg did in 'Jaws', except this film fails at it. The camera work is jittery and amateurish, as it is intended to be. It is, supposedly, recorded with a hand held camera by, variably, different people in a circle of acquaintances who started out the evening attending a party when all heck broke loose. The ending is predictable and abrupt.I'm glad I got to see it for free, but sad that I wasted the time on it. If I had it to do over again......I'd pass.............",Cloverfield
430,blackasp98,What a good idea,9,23 January 2008,"This one of the films i thought original,using a Blair witch approach to govern peoples fears and nightmares. J,j Abrams gave this film a unique perspective of how we could view horror in its most raw forms. What ever the creature is,did not come from our world. It looks to conglomerated to visualize a creature toxified by the mans wastes. But some people believed that this creature was a result of cruel waste dumping and hid until it was time to surface. Others say it was something leaping in the DNA pool too fast or other...etc etc. But besides theories of what it is or was,the creature had no compassion or remorse of its own actions,seeing as it was nearly 300 feet tall with smaller drones to clean up the mess for its walk in the park. I have to say that this film was enjoyable,using blended arts of remote cameras with special effects not seen before and also not using once any type of music or music background to give impact for each scene. To keep the realism dancing in our brains no music was used. Whoever heard of a camera recording or hand-held harnessing music?. To J,j Abrams i hope his next film will be something to see,i thought this film was a bit short but made up for the effects and to have each actor relate with terror and their character reflecting the terror. To show that anything out of the ordinary can happen in a......",Cloverfield
431,bill_b4,Ingenious Storytelling,10,19 January 2008,"I have to say...this movie is good on many levels. First of all, the plot is fascinating. Having borrowed a page from the best video games, the monster and the havoc it wrecks on New York City is ""edge-of-your-seat"" captivating. Fans of Half-Life II might relate. This screen gem brings back the thrill of the MONSTER MOVIE. As a kid, I LOVED the old Godzilla & Gamera movies, but as an adult, those movies became corny and outdated. This movie brings back that thrill in a fresh, contemporary setting with all the anticipation and chills I experienced with those classics as a child. I couldn't really enjoy the Godzilla remake because that's all it was...a remake.Godzilla represented the fears of Atomic war, but I think this monster does a great job representing the next generational challenge: terrorism. Faceless, a humongous threat that can knock down buildings and ruin cities, but also affect everyone on a more personal level. I don't think it was mere coincidence the monster in this movie and it's assault on New York City was portrayed similar in nature to the fear, horror and devastation experienced during 911.The next piece of praise I have for this movie are the special effects. Absolutely amazing is all I have to say. And as spectacular as the visual effects are, the SOUND effects must receive special mention. To it's benefit, this movie does not have a soundtrack that tells you how to feel...rather you feel this movie through the numbing bass tones you would expect to experience in an earth moving event such as an earthquake. The monster's earth shattering footsteps and distinct roar brought back the fear experienced in the unique, terrifying sensation heard with the death ray of the original ""War Of The Worlds"". It's easy to overlook the challenge movie makers undertake to recreate a memorable audible experience, until you consider less-successful attempts. For example, Steven Spielberg's attempt to recreate the terrifying sound of the Martian machines in his remake fell far short of the original, but in this movie, the sounds that originate from the monster are haunting to say the least, both in it's roar and in it's attack on the city.I reserve my greatest praise for last. J.J. Abrams & Co. have cracked the code. In my opinion, the most entertaining experiences in the past 10-15 years have come from the video game world, especially first-person shooters (ie Doom & Half-Life). But Hollywood has had a less-than stellar track record in trying to reproduce those experiences on the big screen. Their solution to that problem was so simple and yet so ingenious, I'm surprised no one had previously thought of it...depict the movie from the point of view of a character stuck with holding the camera through the whole experience. Now don't get me wrong...the first-person portrayal has been done...most infamously with The Blair Witch Project. I did enjoy The Blair Witch, but that movie was supernatural and small in scope, whereas Cloverfield is large and earth-threatening...a truly grandiose cinematic experience. I took my family of five and two friends of my children...and paid a pretty penny...but felt it was worth it.Just a word of advice. Because of the unique perspective the story is told through, one or two sequences are dizzying. If you grab a seat toward the back of the theater, you'll minimize the potential for ""motion-sickness"".To summarize, if you are up for a unique cinematic experience, a thought-provoking, captivating plot, with earth-shattering visual and audio effects that go a long way toward effectively portraying the story from a first-person shooter perspective...you'll enjoy this movie. If you like movies that tell you how to think and feel, if you enjoy brainless mind-pap, reserve your copy of ""House Of The Dead"" today, and leave enough seats in the theater for me and my family.",Cloverfield
432,hedin_88,a good idea and good concept,7,30 April 2008,"The trailer freaked me out and so it did to most of the people, i spent days surfing trying to find out how the creature looks like and i must give them the credit for holding a darn great secret about it. And so i ended up buying it. The real reason is that i like when new things are tried out, so whatever the story was, id buy it if its filmed this way. Now, for the movie, itself, its a good one. Its suspense, and has moments that grip you. The camera movement (which the movie is all about) is believable and works good with the characters which are also pretty good. The acting was also pretty darn good. Now, the things that i did not like. But this is just because i manage to find a flaw in every movie i ever see. And these two mi gonna mention are those that worked for me and most people wont even notice it. So here goes, the monster is a bit to skinny, and funny looking. It doesn't seem fearful or whatever... than there are a few times when one or the other character tries to be funny and damn, it doesn't work if you're being chased through a big city bu i freaky alien monster. but as i said, you'll get past these thing without noticing them... its just me. Oh, and another thing. i don't think this movie will be a memorable one, but just one of those pretty good ones that you see once, and the second time they just don't work any more.

433,DaveDiggler,"Unintelligent, Unimpressive, and Unoriginal",2,20 January 2008,"I usually write reviews for films that I really liked, but my friends demanded that I see this instead of ""No Country for Old Men"" so I went into this film quite p!ssed off and mildly drunk. It started with a bunch of talking at a party about God knows what and about God knows who. The entire film is told through a camcorder. ""Cloverfield"" is a camera that was found in what was known as ""Central Park"". The movie is what was found. This video takes us from a party scene at the beginning to the death of every person on the camera. That's not really a spoiler because it's quite obvious what it is and what will happen before you even see it.After the military drops all kinds of bombs on this animal and there are no affects as the big monster just shakes them off, it's pretty clear that this thing is never going to die. We watch this air attack from the camera of one of the people in a rescue chopper as the big monster falls down. Everyone in the chopper says, ""We killed him! We killed him! Hooray!!!"" as the monster falls into a pile of his own dust. Right then and there, not only does every audience member know this thing ain't dead, but we know that this chopper is coming down and everyone in it is going to die. And sure as the person reading this was born, that does happens. Only the crash doesn't kill the people in the chopper right away, just the pilot and co-pilot, you know the unimportant people, but the main characters stay alive just long enough to wake up the next mourning so we can get a good look at the monster. Then we get our first good look at it and I must say it's pretty damn cool looking, but I was so mad after and 1 hour and 10 minutes of garbage that I didn't even care. Then they die. And, I must say, this camera has some kind of battery since its running all night long and all day long. The energizer bunny couldn't keep this running for as long as it did.It is incredibly unrealistic. There are so many questions I was asking during this piece of garbage. I'm asking, why isn't this guy dropping his camera while a bunch of little critters, much like ""Alien"" that are falling off the big monster, chasing him and trying to kill him? Drop the camera! They're trying to kill you and you're running backwards so you can catch it on video. Does that make any sense? No, it doesn't, but nothing else did so why would that? For one reason or another, the thought of dropping the camera never came into one of these characters heads and I wish they did since the movie would just end. How did this ""thing"" start? Where did ""it"" come from? How long has ""it"" been in New York? This is the first attack? The thing is pretty big and you would think someone would have seen it prior to this and since it's so hostile, you would also think there would be attacks left and right, but no, this is the first attack and this thing goes straight for the city. Killing everything in its way just like in the movies!!!! Basically, it's filled with non stop, predictable, been there done that action after crappy conversation in the beginning. The best part was when all these people stopped talking since they made my head spin with their stupidity and dumb jokes. If we actually got to know these people, maybe I would have cared, but their purpose was to hold the camera and die. Plus the actors all sucked so it wouldn't have made any difference. It's a little shaky and by a little I mean the entire thing. Every second of every shot is pure shaking. Think ""Blair Which Project"". You really can't find one redeeming quality about this video. Everything in it has been done one thousand times before. They copied ""Godzilla,"" ""Aliens,"" and ""The Blair Which Project"".Everyone around me seemed to have the same amount of hatred for this film while a bunch of dorks clapped for it at the end and my sections rained down boos and chants of ""rip-off"" and ""Godzilla."" One of my friends liked it. Since he made me miss ""No Country for Old Men"" and for the fact that he liked it; I can now say he was a friend.One of the worst movies I have ever seen.This deserves ZERO stars.",Cloverfield
434,paq5528,Root canal could be more entertaining,2,26 January 2008,"Even if you can tolerate the shaky hand syndrome of an entire movie shot handy-cam, the poor dialog and weak, uninteresting plot will make you just as nauseous.Once again, with NYC as the target, aliens invade. Not right away, first you have to bear the brunt of mindless early 20's drunken banter and the scandal that one of them slept with another. You also have to believe one of these guys is wise enough to actually be promoted to an international vice-president's position, but to the film's credit, it never did say that daddy didn't own the company.Cue to the attack and as everyone is sanely leaving the city, the golden boy jeopardizes his group of friends, who stalwartly refuse to leave him, in order to rescue his scorned princess. Along their way they get plenty of reminders that they should turn around and run, but press on. Including a wildly unrealistic encounter with the military in which golden boy argues that despite countless thousands already dead, they should help him go get his girlfriend, but if they won't help him, then he must save his girlfriend and they can shoot him if they want to but he's going. Personally I wanted the military to knock him out, with drugs or by force, just so I didn't have to watch the movie any more, and perhaps the focus would change to something more interesting. The military, being the sweet, understanding people that they are known to be when under hostile fire from aliens, point him in the right direction and wish him much success.The only thing amazing about the film is the battery life on the video camera. And if the battery power had to continue, I was cheering the invaders on, to find this group and devour them just so I didn't have to listen to them anymore.",Cloverfield
435,shariqq,Strong Stomach? Be ready for a fun ride!,8,8 February 2008,"Cloverfield is to monster movies what Blair Witch Project is to horror movies. But while the latter was a gimicky low-budget fiasco (forget Box Office, it is no measure of quality), Cloverfield is a decently budgeted polished piece of film-making.Shot entirely from the POV of a hand-held digicam initially being used to make a home-video, the movie takes us through the disaster that NY faces through the experiences of a small group of youths. So while the camera focuses on the bunch of three-four friends, the backdrop shows us what we would have seen in full-focus in a Godzilla or Independence Day - Buildings collapsing, destruction all-around, the monster in attack-mode, the army retaliating, etc.What really impressed me was the way the movie uses most of its budget (physical/visual effects) only for the background. The production has done a wonderful job in recreating an extraordinary event as it would look, and have a few regular people to react to it. Soon after the first disruption, immediate thoughts go to survivors of 9/11 and their experience to the actuality of the disaster.Mixed reactions to the movie are mostly because hand-held video for the entirety of the movie can induce motion-sickness though. There were a few walk-outs mid-way, and I know of people running to the toilets due to the shaking effect throughout. As long as you are prepared for and have the stomach for it, be ready for an experiment of a movie that actually works as an experience.",Cloverfield

437,eyecandyforu,A Masterpiece of Monster Movie Magic,10,26 November 2008,"Make no mistake, Cloverfield is an animated film. The majority of what we see is CGI, a gimmick that has in recent years dominated a medium rather than enhance it. Instead of the smooth almost creamy give away aspect of computer generated images, Cloverfield uses the technology brilliantly and the special effects it's artists create are mind boggling. Explosions look totally real. Cityscapes are dizzying in their accuracy. J.J. Abrams and director Matt Reeves set out to make a distinctly American monster movie and where else to do that but New York City? Our minds are still fresh from the memories of 9/11 and Abrams taps into this without insulting or exploiting the tragedy. The fact that the thing comes from the South of Manhattan is not a coincidence. The beginning of the film is a party of exuberant youth, a MTV reality show of 20 somethings bidding farewell to a friend who is (again, not coincidentally) relocating to Japan, home of that ""other"" monster who's never mentioned. Why mention ""him""? We have a big ol' baddie of our own now. Once the crisis begins, complete with an iconic symbol of collective America being destroyed and literally thrown in our faces, it's everyone for themselves. Strangely, the city empties out too quickly, the evacuation immediate. This was one of the issues that nagged at me through most of the film. At one point our tiny little band of survivors venture into the subway. The vast series of tunnels and stations are totally abandoned when logistics would tell you thousands of people would have taken refuge there. There aren't even trains to hamper their approximately 60 block progress. Above ground there are no traffic jams, no throngs of panicked citizens screaming from the windows of buildings. There's also some iffy geography going on. Big Ugly seems to have a fondness for Midtown, hanging around it for hours. Placing it in convenient places for action makes the viewer wonder if there are more than one. Our band of heroes travel very long distances in a very short period of time and you almost get the feeling the monster is after THEM. The military could use a little target practice in this, buildings get hit more than the target. But I forgave all this, despite the problems, this is thrilling stuff. As if a big gray ugly thing wasn't bad enough, it sheds some of the creepiest nastiest little critters we've ever seen like ticks off of a dog. This was a brilliant idea, it would be pretty easy to get away from a big lumbering slow monster, but these things, they're right there, they move fast and they BITE. The biggest shock of the film happens suddenly and pretty much off screen. I guess that explains where so many people have gone, but you would expect streets awash with gore (which, by the way, there's amazingly little of). I'm always fascinated by actors who's performance depends on their ability to react to nothing. Here it's realistic and terrifying. The military aspect, usually depicted as willing to coldly sacrifice anyone and anything is given a nice humanity. This military cares and tries it's best. It has very little choice and we understand. The creators of the monster have stated that they chose to think of ""it"" as a baby, scared and threatened. This is the irony, no military is going to try to soothe and calm such a thing. The shaky camera, used to death lately is acceptable because it's the way it would be although the batteries must be state of the art. The film leaves very few questions answered. What is this creature? Why is it here? It doesn't really matter. This thing could be any number of threats. The filmmakers have chosen to spin our paranoia as a huge, unstoppable monster and it works. Japan's got nothing on us, in your face Godzilla. Usually there would be a huge marketing blitz for a monster movie, but kids aren't going to be playing with this ugly thing as toys hidden in McDonald's meals, no model moving crabby parrot monstrosities. The harsh aspects of these creatures prevents this. This is not a happy film, but what could be happy about it? Nonetheless, it's entertainment at it's best. I will never pooh pooh CGI again.",Cloverfield
438,sterlinrivera-2000,My Favorite Monster & Found Footage Film,10,6 October 2019,"I love Cloverfield. Ever since I first watched it when it came out, I became a fan of it. 11 years later, it has aged VERY well and I find it to be my favorite found footage film ever.Cloverfield takes place in Manhattan, where there is a going away party for a guy named Rob (Michael Stahl-David). He is going to be a vice president in Japan, and the party then gets interrupted by a rupture outside, and they find out that the city is being under attack by some unknown creature. Rob's girlfriend, Beth (Odette Annable) is trapped in her apartment, so Rob and his friends must try everything they can to rescue Beth and escape before they get killed.What I love about Cloverfield the most is how it is a creature feature inside of a found footage film. Most creature features and be cheesy and lame, but this one was done right. The plot may seem cliche, but it had really good moments and elements to it that made it very well done.The acting is very good. The character I like the most is Hud, who is played by the hilarious, T. J Miller. His character is idiotic in parts, but in a very humorous way and brings out the funny side of the film.The CGI for the monster is pretty unique, and the design for the monster seems original. He's not a dinosaur or some prehistoric creature of sorts, and that made the film very more original.In conclusion, Cloverfield is one of my favorite films ever made that has aged well over the years, and is a very well made monster movie.",Cloverfield
439,lacatusalexandru,"I finally found a movie worst than ""The Room""",1,8 January 2021,"If I could gave this film a 0/10 I would have do it because it's really horrible and also painful to watch it to the end.
Fun story of how I got to see this garbage masterpiece,the clock was 22:34 and I was kinda bored so I search almost all the chanels for something entertaining(mostly a fun movie) and then I've stopped at HBO and seen the title of the movie CLOVERFIELD,and I've said: wow,this movie could be interesting.
So after struggling to watch it until the end,I came to realise that I just lost 1 hour and 30 min. of my life for nothing.
The only positive thing that I can say about ""Cloverfield"" is the fact that the CGI is almost good(mostly decent but it works) but the rest of the things like the story,the acting as well as stupid choice of being a first person perspective movie are horrible and it sucks a lot cuz it could had been a great movie,it only lacks the guidance/strenght to do it.
If I was an 11 years old kid who had seen his first SF movie with aliens,than things would have been different I would probably gave this film 7/10 but thanks God I didn't see this movie in 2008.
If you really want to see a great SF movie that is kinda like this one,than watch its sequel: Cloverfield Lane.That movie is more of a thriller/horror film but it has some sience fiction elements in it.
Overall,if you are an amateur of the SF genre or betwell 11-13 years old ,than Cloverfield is probably one of your favorite SF movies and if not,than you just lost 1 hour and 30 minutes of your precious life for nothing and that's sadder even than the ending of the movie where(shockingly) everyone dies and the half bat-half alien invaders won.",Cloverfield
440,rabrenner,GODZILLA For Twenty-Somethings,7,6 February 2008,"A giant monster attacks New York City: the idea is at least as old as THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953). What distinguishes CLOVERFIELD is its perspective. Stealing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's gimmick, it tells the story exclusively from the point of view of five twenty-somethings armed only with a video camera. Instead of the usual panning shots of thousands of anonymous screaming extras fleeing in panic, which has the effect of distancing the audience from the action, we are right down there in the carnage, underfoot as it were, in danger of getting trampled like the rest.Unfortunately, this verisimilitude has landed CLOVERFIELD in political hot water. Some people claim it offensively exploits the memory of 9/11 (like a certain former mayor of New York/ex-Presidential candidate). Just to put things in historical perspective, GODZILLA was made in 1954, just nine years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. (In an early scene, CLOVERFIELD acknowledges its kaiju roots when it is revealed one of the characters is moving to Tokyo to pursue a career.) CLOVERFIELD isn't a classic like GODZILLA, or even as good as THE HOST, another recent giant monster movie that focuses on people. The characters--the heroic guy, the heroic girl, the nerdy guy, the stuck-up girl, the heroic guy's heroic brother--are far too generic to be memorable. On the other hand, it towers over the disappointing 1998 remake of GODZILLA, also set in New York City. CLOVERFIELD is efficient scary entertainment that will hold your attention for its scant 84-minute running time.",Cloverfield
441,erikgloor,Nauseating for all the wrong reasons,1,25 January 2008,"The little puddle of vomit in the hallway leading from the auditorium back out into the cineplex when the credits rolled about said it all for 'Cloverfield,' the latest effects-driven thriller from Bad Robot and Paramount.I remember it well: It was 1985 and my high school chum and I were talking about the latest Pepsi ads which featured the very first ""shaky-cam"" shots meant to imbue scenes with authenticity. As if anyone with sense enough to bring a tripod for their video camera was almost certainly setting you up. We knew even then that this was the worst kind of artifice and we both concluded that anyone who had tripods available but didn't use them for said purpose was DEFINITELY setting you up.And setting us up huge was what the makers of 'Cloverfield,' have done with this picture about a giant monster that decides to take a bite out of the Big Apple and totally ruin the evening for a bunch of no-name 20-something hockey-pucks. Shot entirely point-of-view with the world's sturdiest pretend home-movie camera, we watch said hockey-pucks variously fleeing said monster or questing for the rescue of some hottie impaled on rebarb somewhere.I think I would have suggested lending the film a little authenticity by hiring some F-ing AC-TORS!Along the way, and with admittedly eerie and downright compelling realism, we are treated to a 21st century version of Godzilla with really nice images of army guys blasting away at the creature and dropping ordnance on it from Stealth bombers. Fun stuff and definitely a recipe for a good time at the movies. Technically, the film misses not a single note.Unfortunately, rather like the technically savvy but depth-free characters in this film, the story-tellers got lost on their way to a decent theme and decided to substitute the always asinine, ""Dude, what if this were real,"" approach. See if it's kinda real, then you don't really need a theme, dude. No, for real! Otherwise these filmmakers would have to face the fact that the default theme for this picture is as follows: ""My girlfriend is so totally hot, I would totally fight a giant iguana to sleep with her again."" And naturally, as if this were ""Survivor New York,"" each character dies, one by one, in hideous fashion, in order of significance, as if voted off by the audience after each scene. Once again, only the extremely cute and cuddly survive.Good monster movies are good because the monster becomes a metaphor for something. Screen writing 101, guys. Come on.And lastly but not leastly, all of the above criticism will only matter to you if you somehow survive the colossally stupid and ceaseless jiggle-cam cinematography. See, someone forgot to tell the pea-brains who made this film that even though the jiggling didn't bother THEM watching it on a 19-inch video monitor in some editing suite somewhere where idiots edit movies, when the film is done, it is packed off to be shown in these places called ""theatres."" At these ""theatres,"" a person's entire field of vision will be filled with your stupid footage and when the camera doesn't stay still for a single instant, it can make the average audience-member a little NAUSEATED.So thank you, Matt Reeves, director of 'Cloverfield,' for making a movie so bad it made one of your audience members puke. I've got you to thank for the dizzying headache I suffer still, nearly 24 hours after watching it. Thank you SO much.Go back to directing episodes of Felicity.",Cloverfield
442,asim34522-1,This disappointed me,3,7 July 2009,"Since I took a GCSE Media course, we get to watch loads of films. Unfortunately we had to watch this. Rubbish ending, hardly get to see the monster until somewhere at the end where it eats that man up then spits him out. Also the camera was annoying. There were SOME decent parts in but overall...it was rubbish. I expected it to be good but after 45 mins of watching it...I knew it was a failure. Most of the people in my class thought it was rubbish and so did I. The girls were fit in the film...we agreed to that but overall...not as good as expected. I was fairly disappointed at the ending. It was rubbish. Overall I personally think this film deserves a 3/10.",Cloverfield

The story was good and the characters were good.Liked its handy cam skills. very good from what usual disaster films or most films do.Setting it in New York was like ""Uhhhhh"" Set it somewhere else like LA or Washington. Why new york city all the time. It gets boring after a while. I think the disaster genre should pick a new location.This film was also nothing like Godzilla. I mean yes in NYC but still it was very different but still i like Godzilla.Overall Cloverfield was very good and i hope they make a sequel that can equal what Cloverfield set up.",Cloverfield
444,jeffpk,"One trick pony, and the trick is both good and bad",5,12 November 2009,"As others have said, this is basically a by the numbers giant monster invasion movie.Its one trick is the pseudo-amateur documentary filing style ala ""The Blair Witch Project. In fact if they had named this movie ""The Blair Witch Godzilla"" you wouldn't have even had to go to the film to get 90% of it.The BWP technique applied to this subject material IS interesting. My experience was that it added to the sense of realism. I stopped thinking about the CG (which was thankfully used sparingly, someone understood that what you can't see is a lot scarier then what you can) and just accepted the action, which is unusual in my experiences of modern effects film.Unfortunately, the shaky hand held camera work really made me ill. I had to do deep breathing exercises just to make it through without vomiting.So... its an interesting little film IF you literally have the stomach for it. But if you are prone to any kind of simulator or motion sickness, I wouldn't try this movie.",Cloverfield
445,jctundis,Cloverfield delivers the thrills - but haters of the Blair Witch style should be wary!,8,18 January 2008,"So, I went to a 5PM showing of Cloverfield today. It was pretty good. I found the characters to be very human and developed quite nicely over the course of the story. The special effects were excellent, with quite a few ""oh $#!@"" moments.Be warned: If Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, then I don't recommend Cloverfield. The *entire* movie is filmed in the ""handy-cam"" style of the trailer - but in my opinion, it works better here than in Blair Witch. It helped draw you into the movie and make you feel like you were in it, and it made the CGI more convincing.Very intense film.",Cloverfield
446,tomntempe,"If you've ever seen any other movie you know how this starts, proceeds, and ends",2,30 March 2013,"ALL of this review is spoilers..... I saw this in the TV listings with 3 stars so thought it must be worth watching. What a mistake. There is 20 minutes of tedium at the start that makes you wonder if you are watching the right movie. Twenty minutes of talking about, setting up, going to the going away party for some guy who's just been promoted to VP of some Japanese company. We don't, and never will, have any idea of what he does and there is nothing about his demeanor or personality that suggests he's VP material. He and his friends appear to be only one step removed from their frat house vibe/bar every night vibe. Then the ""monster"" appears, sort of. It's never clear where the monster comes from or why, not that it matters to this film. The rest of the film is people doing stupid things like all rushing to the Brooklyn bridge, presumably so they can all be smashed together in one place unable to escape. Apparently the idea that it's better to stay spread out never occurs to anyone. Certainly one wonders why, after the monster has already smashed his way thru your area without killing you, you would then want to go to some other area and give him another chance to stomp you. And of course our ""hero's"" have to go into the subway - again, why stay where you can run when you can pre-trap yourself. Then, out of nowhere, little baby monsters show up to attack them in the tunnels. The connection between the big monster and the little ones?? not at all clear. Our hero's trudge on to rescue their friend, who the VP belatedly realized he loved now that he's about to leave for the airport and fly to his new VP job overseas. After rescuing her (from her nearly destroyed building that still manages to have electric) they wind up running into the military who are ready to load them onto helicopters. The rest is a silly blur, most likely several of them died, I really didn't care who did or didn't, there was never any connection to any of the characters established. I can't believe so many people liked this movie. I must be out of step. The only thing making it better then plan 9 from Outer Space was that it's in color and the actors/actresses are prettier.",Cloverfield

It's always hard for me to suspend my disbelief for some reason. I almost gave it 7 stars, especially when the alien got it's ""DeMille"" moment towards the end. But I guess they paid too much for the footage (not sure if it was physical or CGI), to not use it.I really enjoyed seeing the Statue of Liberty head bit. Anyway, if you like Godzilla style destruction, alien creatures and don't need a Hollywood ending, check it out.",Cloverfield
448,JamieClay,You may be surprised at how much this film doesn't suck.,10,16 January 2008,"Most of us know that 99% of the films released between January to mid April pretty much suck, it's been Hollywood's dumping ground for years. This film may just change that and may lead the way to better films being released this time of year. (yah right) If you like the horror genre and of course Godzilla monster movies then you should have a blast with this one. The unique angle to this film is how the story unfolds, through the lens of one very lucky camcorder (because obviously it survived). The first 25 minutes of the movie unfold slowly but help us get to know the characters through small snippets of reality recorded (and over recorded) onto the camera - in a fashion pretty much how we all use camcorders - candidly, sporadically, erroneously and spontaneously . This may try your patience but look at it as the ride to the top of a roller coaster, enjoy the pretty people and get to know them. This will help to make what comes next even more entertaining and suspenseful.The script does a good job of escalating the horror and for the most part it feels real, as much as one might expect given the circumstances.Three suggestions for seeing this film, - see it in the theater (don't wait for it to come out on DVD) - see it in as big an audience as you can for the group reaction - avoid seeing any spoilers that show you the actual monster. I say this NOT because the monster is surprisingly original, it's just that the less you know what to expect the better the suspense. During the film you get caught up in the discovery of 'it' and in the small doses one might in real life.Bonus extra suggestion, sit as far back in the theater as you can - at least that helps me to deal with all the hand held footage.##2ND VIEWING UPDATE: After the first viewing I had the oddest experience in that I kept expecting to turn on the news to get an update on how things were in NYC, very much like post 9/11, 'it' had left that much of a resonance in my head.So, I went to see it again with a bunch of friends and found the movie to be even better. I was able to pick up on many of the little details that I missed the first time. For me, this is a film that improves the more you see it.3rd Viewing notes:(yes I've seen it 3 times now) In the previous two viewings I didn't stay for the credits. The music is AWESOME, and there is a geek tease at the very end. The very last bit of audio, but you have to record it and reverse it to hear what is said. (and that's all I'll say about that).*********************************** Technical Spoiler section *********************************** The Monster  Not a great design (my opinion) and kind of a cliché style - I can see why it was kept a secret. At times it reminded me of Violator, other times like the Rancor Monster from Star Wars. (ewww what if Violator and Rancor mated???) I'm sure it's real hard to come up with genuinely original looking monster these days. Frankly a large crab would have been as effective. :)The smaller Monsters  looked pretty much like the bug monsters from Star Ship Troopers, again not original but still fun to have attacking people.The star of the film, the Camera (and this comment is VERY petty): The film was shot on a tape based camera (the film presents itself as a single tape recording) 80 minutes is too long as most camcorders by default are set in SP mode giving you 60 minutes tops. It could have been set to LP mode (about 95 minutes) but it's not likely.Oh and for you American Godzilla fans there is one shot in this that should come across as sort of an homage.##2ND VIEWING UPDATE: The film opening said it was found on an SD card / camera. SD video is recorded in individual files with each start and stop of the camera, plus the actors refer to the tape a number of times. This is another petty technical over site, BTW.##3rd viewing note: At the end, you find yourself looking out at the ocean, keep a close watch just to the left of the boat near the shoreline. Something falls from the sky and splashes into the water. No smoke trail.Also - the reversed audio at the end of the credits sounds like Rob saying ""It's still alive"".",Cloverfield
449,psychogoatee,A failed experiment.,2,19 January 2008,"Cloverfield was an experiment... a failed experiment. The ""monster attack"" survival movie, through the eyes of a shaky hand-held camera.

That's the experience we get via our cameraman/narrator in Cloverfield.""Holy ****, they're shooting at the monster, ****!"" Yikes.If you want a good survival horror/action film in the monster genre, check out The Host. Or hell, check out a film that did it better than Cloverfield back in 1954, Godzilla (Gojira).If you want a camera shaking and pointing in random directions, and whiny young people on the run, as narrated by their comedic friend with a ridiculous sense of levity, check out Cloverfield.But please don't.",Cloverfield

451,misterembryo,Cloverfield: Midnight Showing,8,18 January 2008,"At one point in the movie, one character echoes the famous words from the original home-video horror flick The Blair Witch Project: ""I'm so scared."" Only in Cloverfield what they encounter is much more scary and life-threatening than a crazy lady running through the woods. Cloverfield is a 90 minute roller-coaster ride that will increase your adrenaline as much as it will increase your dire need for a vomit bag.Rob is leaving for Japan for his career and a surprise party is thrown on his behalf. Hud takes up the responsibility of cameraman, whose purpose is to document the farewell testimonies. This provided an interesting way to introduce the characters and gave insight into their personalities and relationships. Telling a story through this style of filming could be pretty difficult, but Cloverfield actually pulls it off. You even grow fond of some of the characters in the process, which is especially important for a movie that depends on the survival of the characters. It also helps that the actors gave likable and pretty convincing performances.The party is interrupted by a series of tremors, a short blackout, and a flurry of fireballs flying through the air. New York is under attack. From then on you are sucked into a crazy trip through the panic of the dismantled city as Hud decides to continue videotaping the events, knowing that the world will want to see what exactly happened that night in New York City.Although the movie offers a great story of bravery and camaraderie, that's not what anyone cares about right? Everyone wants to know what ""It"" is. Trust me. ""It"" is something far more ugly and terrifying than a giant cuddly ape.Going into the movie, you of course need to suspend a little disbelief. Aside from the monster itself, you also have to accept their ability to somehow escape certain situations; otherwise it would be a much shorter movie. If I were documenting the whole thing the video would probably last five minutes. To make up for it, little details are thrown in to maintain the atmosphere of authenticity, taking pictures of the head of a decapitated Statue of Liberty with a cell phone camera for example, or the looters who horde the electronics store amidst all the chaos.The special effects are completely mind-blowing. The Toyota Tacoma and ""Ratchet and Clank"" commercials really did something special when they combined special effects with the home video feel. Cloverfield takes this concept to the maximum extreme and does an excellent job making the surreal as real as it can get.The suspense will get to you. There are times that make you jump and times that make you cringe. The end will either leave you wanting more or begging for it to be over. No matter what the case, Cloverfield is an experience you will never forget. (Word of advice: DO NOT sit in the first five rows, especially in IMAX. Big mistake.)",Cloverfield
452,teodorodontosaurus,"Shaky, Shaky, Shaky!",7,25 April 2018,"A first-person-type movie... familiar? Yeah, let's not talk about the fact that this idea has already been done by other movies, as long as it's done good.
So, what we got here is a giant monster and its origins are unknown. Initially I presumed it is an aquatic creature - I noticed the tentacles and at some point in the movie, even some kind of external gills near its head; but then, I saw its incredibly non-hydrodynamic body... maybe from outer space? It actually doesn't matter; it matters that it's huge... and it's on the rampage!
The characters in this movie are pretty well-contoured and credible. In a giant monster/disaster movie, its greatest challenge is to aim at the reaction of masses during any form of cataclysm. Where ""2012"" failed, this one succeeded. Well, I'm talking about loosing sanity, the well-known self-preservation behavior etc (See ""The mist"", a movie which relies more on that than the creatures themselves).
Oh, I forgot to mention the subliminal messages scattered throughout this movie; all I'm gonna say is ""Them!"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", ""King Kong"", and also something crucial that happens at the end of the movie. Do the research yourself!",Cloverfield

I almost left the movie myself and other theatre patrons did leave. If I was going to watch this again I'd have a few stiff drinks first. But the plot and characters here work to create a story line that will awe you if you stay with the action until the end.At the start the filmmakers use the best of cinéma-vérité, very similar to what was good about 'David Holzman's Diary' to create a very voyeuristic view of a party in New York and establish the characters. Why they chose to make the camera work as shaky as it is, I don't know. I do think that they'd have many more fans for this movie if they just had whoever was holding the camera hold it a bit steadier. In fact, the camera changes hands not long after the beginning and improves, but still there's more bouncing and head-ache inducing shots then needed.Oddly enough, having seen the movie and loved it, I have to share the point at which I almost left. Near the beginning of the movie, when the action gets started, the monster is batting stuff around, and this is a spoiler of sorts, our characters are in the street and when the head of the statute of liberty lands near them. Now I have been inside the head of the statue of liberty, and this head which fills part of the street is just to small to be the head of the statue of liberty. And this disappointed me so I almost left the theatre as the shaky camera work started up again.Still, I stayed and got into the story again and the story did not disappoint, in fact it intrigued and if you can get past the over shakiness, past the too little Statue of Liberty head, and into the movie, you'll not be disappointed.",Cloverfield
454,garretsr,Horrendous. Don't waste your money!,2,19 January 2008,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Since Cloverfield's ""plot"" has been kept vague, I am omitting any plot details herein, but there is really nothing much to ""spoil."" J.J. Abrams apparently never got the concept that you have to 1. begin the story, 2. tell the story, then 3. end the story; all while keeping the viewer interested.We never find out how the story begins. Rather, we are treated to 20 minutes of banal party where 95% of the characters have no role in the rest of the movie. Once we're into the movie we are treated to watching the 5 dumbest people in New York City ignore everything around them to go on a pointless quest. The other two million residents of New York figure out how to get at, but not these folks. The ""story"" never concludes but does mercifully end along with the movie resolving nothing about how we got here, what happened, what will happen next, or why we would care. The only thing we know is that some unnamed ""company"" just got a reprieve from the worst personnel promotion decision ever made.We never see the coolest thing in the movie, which is the camera. Although allegedly shot on a hand-held digital camera, one has to wonder where to get this fantastic camera. It has resolution well beyond modern HD quality, records in surround sound, has unlimited batteries, a 50k candle power light, night vision to die for, and the ability to constantly shoot the ""right"" spot, even when the operator is supposedly running or not paying attention. The one feature it has is anti-stabilization which causes the camera to constantly jiggle, even if the character holding the camera is stopped, but stops jiggling for really ""important"" scenes or to let the audience ""catch"" something that is ""cool.""

In his imagination, the Earth used to be inhabited by giants called The Ancients (Les Anciens) who lived in the bottom of the Atlantic, mainly in the vicinity of the imaginary city of Arkham (or Providence). They may have also inhabited the Atlantide, the sunkcontinent.Sometimes, these creatures land on the coast, in person or impersonated, and do a lot of damage. They have strange names, such as Cthulhu or Shub-Niggurath, divinities such as Azatoth, or historic figures like Abdul Alhazred, the mad Arab who wrote the cursed book of Necronomicon. The unknown giant character that beheads the statue of Liberty, or shake off the bridges of New York in CLOVERFIELD will probably be identified in the sequel presently under filming.

458,em89072002,Ooh --- a lizard and little bugs terrorize NYC,3,21 January 2008,"Most of the negative comments others have written are correct, but they're a bit harsh and possibly done to counter the over-the-top praise this flick is getting.On the positive side there are a few decent action sequences involving explosions, attacks and chases. But, they come too late and are too short to counter all the bad that fills the rest of this movie.The beginning is such a bore it is difficult to sit through the first 20 minutes; it's here the main characters are presented, but not really developed so you just don't care what happens to them.Everyone seems to be using the shaky camera method of filming these days; it's not new and it's not that effective here. It actually makes fiction seem even more fake. Case in point: instead of helping his friends fight for their lives against a creature attack, shaky the cameraman just sits backs and video tapes them. Not realistic.Amid all of the destruction and on-going panic it's amazing how empty NYC appears --- these main characters seem to wander for long periods of time without encountering another soul. Again, not realistic.In the midst of running for their lives, one of the main characters decides he wants to visit a girl he once knew to see how she's doing. So the entire gang of goofballs trek across town and ascend several stories of a high-rise while other nearby tall buildings are being toppled just to rescue the damsel. How brave, how stupid! When the main characters encounter some soldiers, they're given VIP treatment and airlifted out of the city via helicopter (I doubt Joe Schmoe from the Bowery or the million other people in the city are given this treatment --- if so you'd have grid-lock in the air).Once aboard they speak gleefully as if it's their first helicopter ride over NYC. As to why the soldiers aren't more concerned with fighting the monsters than giving joy rides over NYC --- it's because this is what's needed to put the dumb in a dumb movie.After their joy ride these goofs land/crash back in NYC. So, after more than seven hours since the attacks began these goofs still can't find a way to get off the island of Manhattan. It's the opposite of SURVIVOR; here, the clever people leave and the idiots remain.Oh, and as for a monster flick --- we learn nothing of this monster: not it's origin, not it's name, not it's favorite color --- Nothing.One Last Note: I've looked at some of the 10 star reviewers' other movie reviews and there aren't any. Sure ---maybe this could be their first review. Or, maybe it could just be some paid hacks abusing the IMDb system to hype this flick.",Cloverfield

I found myself relieved whenever the camera fell to the ground and gave the same view for a few seconds. It felt like I had on the wrong glasses - I was constantly trying to bring the scenes into focus and the continual motion, coupled with the random focus and quick glimpses of things I wanted to see clearly, made me feel stressed, strained and then annoyed.Add to that the ending, which leaves so many issues dangling, and, overall, I found it very unsatisfactory.Despite that I still gave it a 6. If you can handle triple rides on a roller-coaster then you'll probably really enjoy this film. If you get motion sickness easily then you may want to pause it every 10 minutes and focus on the wall!",Cloverfield
461,sackjigler,Very Good and Thankfully not too Long.,7,18 January 2008,"The reason I say thankfully not too long is that the hand-held cam is so headache inducing that it almost isn't worth having. But, without it the movie would lose what makes it so cool. Looking at the visuals like this really made it seem like it all was being destroyed. The best scenes are seen in the previews but they really are amazing to behold. It makes it all the more terrifying that it's happening in New York and it seems like another terrorist attack at first. The chaos is very cool when it is about, the running around, while necessary, very hard to keep watching. The monster is what it is. It's pretty cool I guess, but you really never get a great enough look to tell. To me it looked kinda like a oceanic praying mantis. There are some really well done intense scenes and pretty serious shocks. I really enjoyed the film and do recommend it. However, if the shaky hand-held cam makes you sick, you might want to avoid this one.",Cloverfield
462,ven2s,Intense!,9,18 January 2008,"I thought that this movie would have its best scenes in the trailers, so when I went in I did not expect too much. But I did expect that it would be different given JJ Abram's influence on Alias. Well, if you're not much for jumpy cameras and are prone to motion sickness, you probably will not stay too long in the theater. But if you can focus wide and not get caught up too much in the details, you are in for an intense and unique take on the monster hits a major city (New York) genre. Where does it come from? What is it? One can speculate, but the movie is really dealing with the trauma of a small group of party goers and their encounter with the extraordinary! The effects are amazing, the acting by relative unknowns, hits on all marks; making the movie all the more convincing to the very end. Not for the faint of heart or the under-aged; under 17s might be up nights with the shakes, definitely don't take preteens!

463,tomq5p,Decent but nothing to write home about,7,18 January 2008,"I had extremely high expectations for this movie (as I'm sure many other fans did). They were not met, but that doesn't mean that the movie was a complete flop. I jumped in my seat many times and I appreciated the unique way the movie was filmed. The movie succeeded at creating a realistic feel. The acting was better than the average movie and the CGI wasn't too bad either. Without spoiling anything, the monster looks kind of weird. Some people will like it, others will not. I am on the fence. It was unlike anything I've seen before, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. One thing I am sure of is the fact that I wish I saw more of it (as well as the destruction that it left behind). I think, in this case, a bigger budget would have yielded a more satisfying result. I am also not too sure that the hand-held camera approach added a whole lot. The way the wide angle shots were set up was pretty clever though. One thing that really bothered me was the product placement. There is one shot in particular when the camera hovers over some candy for no reason whatsoever. There were embedded ads for Nokia, Dunkin' Donuts, Juicy Fruit, Mountain Dew, and others. Call me old-school, but, like David Lynch, I don't think that product placement has any place in true cinema. I expected better from Cloverfield. Overall, I think this movie was on par with Godzilla. Godzilla had better CGI and way cooler shots of the monster but a weak plot and pretty bad acting. It just depends what you value. Since I am a sucker for cool action sequences and good special effects, I would probably prefer watching Godzilla. At least I wouldn't have a headache when it was over. Speaking of the ending, I liked it. I have heard a lot of complaints, but I think it was appropriate and well done.7 out of 10",Cloverfield
464,yoncenator,Keep swallowing (lots of spoilers),6,6 April 2008,"Visually stunning, overall a great monster movie.I found the acting to be atrocious. I understand that some suspense of disbelief is required to swallow that 4 people would run into destruction to save one of their possibly already dead friends, but how many times do I have to swallow? OK, go get the girl. OK, a girl is better defending you against LARGE alien spiders than your guy friend. OK, no one gives a crap about your injuries wipe them down yourself. OK, the military would let you film their ops headquarters. OK said military will befriend you and let you proceed alone. OK a toppled building is accessible. OK an impaled frail girl can run, jump, and not bleed or go into shock. OK, everyone (including hot impaled girl but not the pilot or co-pilot) can survive a helicopter crash from above NY skyline building level. ALRIGHT ALREADY, said impaled (though quite HOT) girl can rescue all survivors from crashed helicopter.That's a lot of swallowing.I still liked the movie, even though none of the people acted like real people would. I'd rather watch Independence Day or Starship Troopers. In fact I think I will. Not bad JJ I'm still looking forward to Star Trek!",Cloverfield
465,vhs1999,I was blown away................,10,25 January 2008,Cloverfield is one of the coolest films ever made. When i first found out about this film my thoughts of it were no were near what i saw today. I thought it was great that we saw some original monster instead of a t-trex or Godzilla and have being a creature that no one ever expected (sorry for those who haven't seen the film its for your benefit that i do reveal the creature) The film was also great due to the unknown cast and i would also like to add made the film very scary and very realistic. The camcorder idea was original which was great to see. I did find the ending irritating as it was like the end of a sentence with no full stop. I will say this to anyone who is thinking of seeing this film that if you like original material you will definitely love this film.,Cloverfield
466,billpeter,A Big Disappointment,2,12 April 2008,"Given that this was produced by JJ Abrams, I was expected a high level of production values. However, I found it like a 1950s B-movie. A very poor script, which seemed to be ""Oh My God, Oh My God"" ad nauseum, or, at least ad boredom. The acting abilities of the cast were amateurish, at best, and the cast will probably be like a group of characters in an X-Files episode. They'll never be seen again, apart from the pretty younger females who'll probably be seen in a few teen TV programs, or straight-to-video movies, probably with less and less clothes as the films get poorer, with lower and lower budgets. Every expense seemed to have been spared on the special effects to stop viewers getting a good view of the monster. This is a bad thing in a monster movie, JJ. Why 2 stars?

468,Fredolow,About as bad as it gets,1,27 January 2008,"The 'Blair Witch' effect may have been popular about 10 years ago, but I really thought Hollywood had grown out of it and realised that if people wanted to see the camera moving around as if held by a drunken idiot one would only have to look as far as Uncle Jimmy's Christmas video, which would undoubtedly have been more entertaining than this sack of crap. The plot - non existent, the story - a linear traipse through a New York battered by some creature that has materialised from God knows where... and I doubt you'll really care anyway. The main characters are a bunch of drunken party kids who you care even less about, one of whom seems to think that keeping the video camera going and waving it around as much as possible is more than his life's worth, literally. Half way through I was praying for him to die if only so that someone else could pick up the camera, and hopefully do a better job. But no, they were all equally bad - a three year old could have done better.The one saving grace in this whole sewer of a film was the remarkable technology brought by Sony's camera division. They've managed to create the most indestructible camera I've ever seen! From helicopter crashes to the military mass-flattening New York, this little baby just shrugs it all off. Congrats Sony, I think you have a winner there!",Cloverfield
469,TheXeroXone,This movie was such a waste of time,4,28 January 2008,"I hope this isn't the new standard of movie genre. If it is, its worse than torture porn.. and I know they're working on a hand-held zombie film using this same technique. *shudder* The reality is in order for movies like this to work, the characters have to be borderline, intellectually retarded in order to validate why they would even consider getting close enough to the monsters, or whatever enemy, to make for a good film. This makes the hand-held film maker's inevitable and formulaic demise so much more anticlimactic because anyone with any common sense would not be running in the direction of a giant unknown creature dropping monster lice all over the city. This tends to ruin any sense of empathy for the character.The guy shooting the majority of the film is, of course, a grand idiot. This is established very early on and it is the only character development in the entire film. His death is arguably the worst part of the movie because the guy has been saying the stupidest things throughout the entire movie, but right when his demise is looking him square in the face (for *far* too long, mind you), he picks this time to shut up. It was a waste of an already ridiculous set-up.The only really good thing about this movie is that they thought about why don't the survivors just wait for the creature to pass by. The answer they came up with is man-sized, monster lice that drop off the creature and attack people. However, that doesn't stop them from making these things ridiculous because these things will make you blow up if you're bitten once. Apparently an army of aggressive, man-sized bugs with giant mandibles just isn't enough of a threat.Its fairly obvious the people who made this film only wanted to use the technique to make a giant monster film and actually show the monster this time, instead of merely hinting at it like the Blair Witch Project did. The result is shoddy, predictable and obviously not well thought out.Final Grade: D+",Cloverfield
470,RikerDonegal,A giant monster attacks New York and a group of friends must cross the city to rescue one of their own.,10,20 March 2008,"A giant monster attacks New York and a group of friends must cross the city to rescue one of their own.Had it been filmed the way I just described then it might have been a good movie and it might have been well worth watching. Depending on who directed it, what the special effects were like and who the cast was. I can hazard a guess like that because we've all seen movies that loosely fit that description. You know the ones I mean where a group of friends band together to escape something. They survive a few close calls and - inevitably - one of them dies and the levels of tension are ramped up before the all-action finale, after which the hero gets the girl.So, Cloverfield could have been another one of those movies.But it's not. Because instead of showing us everything that is happening, the film only shows us what is seen by a camcorder being carried by the group on their trek. This means, of course, that there is a lot the filmmakers can't show us. But that doesn't matter. Partly because this is the sort of stuff we get to see in other similar movies anyway and partly because their choice of storytelling technique allows them to show us stuff we normally don't get to see. And that's the stuff that makes this a film worth seeing.Some of the decisions are inspired (for instance the tape used to record this was also used to record something else, and sometimes we get to see that as well) and the movie is a thrill ride from star to finish.I'm giving this an ""A+"" because I can't give higher/more.http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/",Cloverfield
471,gallae,Clever reworking of Godzilla Theme,8,21 January 2008,"First up, it's pretty clear from the trailer that this is a MONSTER flick. It's also clear from that trailer that part of the ""gimmick"" for this film is in not seeing that monster (or monsters) clearly. That being the case, I'm not going to reveal (even if I could) what it is here. Rather, I want to explain why I like the film.First up, probably like everybody else, I've watched heaps of ""monster destroys lots of stuff and kills many people and is then put down"" films, like Godzilla, Gamera, Aliens vs Predator: Requiem and so on. I also have a history of playing games about this, like The Creature that ate Sheyboygan, Crush Crumble and Chomp!, and Crush! I get into the scenario.Trouble is that most of these films are now largely clichés, repeating variations on set pieces from previous films. In fact that was one of problems with Aliens vs Predator - you could predict mostly who was going to survive (male lead, brother and good girl), and who was going to be a victim (flirty girl, bullies, etc). The director of that film followed pre established methods of establishing a scene and then dropping a monster in it - you could tell something was going to happen by the music alone.You tend not to get either in this film. Who survives and who doesn't is unpredictable, just as who the main characters are shifts during the film. The fiction behind this is that the whole film is an amateur video recording done by someone who was originally going to document a wedding. That means several things:(1) no background music other than what's playing in the scene (radio/tv), so no audio cues to oncoming events; (2) constant camera movements, refocus, and deliberate bad exposure, which looks very realistic (as do any special effects); (3) cuts from one scene to another come from switching that camera off and on, which means that scene change comes about because the camera person thought it'd be interesting; (4) the ""cameraman"" (who changes from time to time) is also a character in the film, and narration tends to be their comments on events (and the the responses from their companions), thus we start to fully identify with the characters in the situation - they are all flawed, all human.Even though I knew this was all technique, it was very compelling and felt immersed in the situation. This is not a film like the 1998 Godzilla remake - where the audience sees multiple viewpoints - in this we see a single viewpoint - that of the camera, and everything seems much more personal because of that.So, I liked the film. It scared me a lot, though I suspect that unlike Alien, I would find this a hard film to watch twice.Also, and this was an odd thing - for most of the film I was intrigued about whether or not the character Lily Ford was played by Charisma Carpenter. In fact she was played by Jessica Lucas, but the resemblance (especially the voice) is uncanny.",Cloverfield
472,savethecloudsfoundation,Best Sci fi Franchise of Our Time,9,11 January 2021,The three films are so mysterious they leave you with more questions than answers and thus leaving you wanting more. I can't get enough of Cloverfield. It's a world full of huge monsters but each story focuses in on a specific part of what's going on and after watching all three films I'm still not totally sure what caused all of this. None of the films give you the full picture. You only know as much as the characters know and all the characters know is that they are alive and the whole world is in total chaos. None of the characters know what's going on and neither will you. To me this makes it feel very real because in a situation like this you wouldn't have any idea what's going on. All in all it's my favorite sci fi series and I hope it continues but that is looking doubtful right now because certain business decisions have left the future of this series in jeopardy.,Cloverfield
473,jason-210,Entertaining post-modern horror movie.,8,25 January 2009,"This film is made using the hand-held amateur camera technique, a bit like the Blair Witch Project, but it's much easier to watch because instead of the incessant shouting and camera fumbling of the Blair Witch, this is calmer with more control. During first 15 minutes we are allowed to get to know the characters, and the world they live in. Occasionally, when camcorder stops, we see glimpses of another film made earlier, which the cameraman is recording over, which gives us an insight into the happy twenty-something lives of the main characters. The horror, when it comes, is unknown. A bang, like an earthquake, a momentary power blackout, a confused newsflash. The cameraman and his friends react with a mixture of shock, curiosity and finally panic and fear, and you really feel like you are there with them. They wonder if it's a terrorist attack. In the next ten minutes, there are explosions, and a skyscraper collapses sending a cloud of dust billowing down the street between the apartments. It's a clearly a direct reference to images of 9/11. After the initial sequences, the film moves at a very quick pace, with plenty of action and some very suspenseful moments. Along the way the film has just the right level of humour to add to its entertainment value, delivered to us in the form of comments from ""Hud"" the nerdy cameraman.A central idea of the film – a big monster smashing up the city – is an obvious reference to Ishiro Honda's 1954 Japanese Godzilla movie, which featured a prehistoric creature that has been awakened from the sea by hydrogen bomb testing. If Godzilla was an allegory about nuclear war, and effects of nuclear war, then I think we can say that Cloverfield is an allegory of terrorist attack on cities. It certainly touches something in us when we see the scene with skyscraper collapsing and dazed people covered in dust looking for their families. In one part of the film a body on a stretcher is wheeled passed the camera with its stomach blown open – it made me think of suicide bombers, although it was at the same time a reference to the first Alien movie.In this allegoric sense, the monster is a symbolic manifestation of our fear of terrorism, and the destruction terrorism can wreak in a city with a high population and so many buildings so close together. The inability of the US army to contain, to successfully stop the monster is also metaphorical, as are the ""bits"" that fall off it – there is no hiding place. This is an enemy that is largely created in the mind, and thus cannot be destroyed, rather like the monster in the 1950s sci-fi film ""The Forbidden Planet"". I call the film post-modern because, on a deeper level, it has references to many earlier sources, such as Godzilla, to 9/11, Alien (when Marela's stomach explodes), Lovecraft (Dagon), and Forbidden Planet. If you look hard enough, you will also see that throughout the movie there are a wealth of small details that give clues about what will happen later, or that help us figure out what has happened, or just make us wonder. This suggests that the script and continuity in the movie are watertight.I wish I'd seen it at the cinema.",Cloverfield
474,filmbuff20,"Not worth the hype, but entertaining all the same.",7,24 February 2008,"It's obvious that Cloverfield had a bout of over-hyping, mainly due to the innovative ad campaign which basically equates to the idea that anything hinted at in a trailer sends internet fanboys in a flurry of excitement and speculation. The downside is that all the anticipation can result in a resounding thud (Star Wars, but hopefully not the upcoming Indy flick). Thankfully, this film geek chose to acknowledge yet ignore all the internet madness and wait for the flick to be released. That means none of the meticulous freeze framing of the trailer to get a gander at the antagonistic 'thing' that decapitated the statue of liberty and the like.So, was Cloverfield worth all the brouhaha? Well, yes and no. The fact is, the premise is not revolutionary and nor is the style, it's most obvious comparison being The Blair Witch Project which debuted 9 years ago to a similar fanfare (we had the poster in our common room before we even knew what it was). The main pull here is the use of character and perspective as we follow a group of New Yorkers desperately trying to survive in the wake of a monster attack. Despite reviews to the contrary, these characters are pretty well realised compared to conventional fare such as Godzilla in which we are given a linear and straightforward introduction to them, whereas here, we are treated to fragmented pieces of overlapping footage to tell the story so far.The way the film has been shot, as if on DV camcorder, feels authentically like a home movie, which at the beginning is to the film's detriment, but it becomes obvious why the first act needed to be as it was once disaster hits. It may take a little getting used to, but it's worth it. The CG is integrated almost perfectly, glimpses here and there and feels more real than any of the robots or web slingers of last year that Hollywood offered us. In fact, the weakest point of the film is seeing the creature in full, whereas the aforementioned flicks would have thrived on that very thing.So the point is not inherently in the idea, but the execution which is pretty effective. At one point I found myself holding my breath when dust engulfed the characters and gripping the seat when several memorable shocks presented themselves, the most notable instances involving a tunnel and later a helicopter. At the end of the day, whether you care about the characters or not is irrelevant because director Matt Reeves and exec producer JJ Abrams don't care whether you do or not. Each is expendable, however painstakingly they are established and it's this anti-Hollywood, anti-cliché attitude towards a very Hollywood idea that gives Cloverfield it's uniqueness and entertainment value. If all this seems like tosh to you, that's all very well, we can't agree on everything, but you can't deny that Cloverfield, if nothing else, is a fun night at the movies and isn't that what we missed in the summer of threequels?",Cloverfield
475,klesker,Fresh,9,4 February 2008,"Well the hype and rumours have stopped now as Clovefield is officially out everywhere. It had an impressive advertising campaign to say the least, creating media speculation as to what the hell it was, (with it's teaser trailer being released before Transformers in the US, giving away very little of the movie, not even a title). Was it about HP Lovecraft's Cthullu? Or Voltron, or another Godzilla movie, a spin off of Lost. Well it's funny that after all this, after all this teasing and hype and everything else surrounding the buzz of this movie, it turns out that all it is, is a monster movie. Good thing it's a bloody good one then.The big question is has this daring and frankly brilliant advertising campaign worked? Does the movie live up to the hype (let's remember that hype is the number 1 killer of any big movie)? The answer is a resounding yes! It's bizarre in the fact that it takes the already used premise of the ""found footage"" (used most famously with the Blair Witch Project) yet manages to make it seem fresh and clever all over again.The film opens with a black screen with the words ""Property of the US Government"" slapped on it. We are then told, that what we are watching is footage that has been found from ""Area site 447"" (Or something) ""Formally known as central park"" and regards the ""Multiple sighting of case designated Cloverfield"". What we then watch for the next hour and twenty (also like Blair Witch, this film is very brief) is camcorder footage intended as a document of a going away party for our protagonist Rob. The party is rudely (and shocking) interrupted by a monster the size of a skyscraper. From then on in, all hell breaks loose as Rob and his friends attempt to survive whilst the party's camera man (Hud) documents the ensuing events.It's quite a ride! The last time I felt to tense watching a movie was when I saw United 93 at the cinema! The reason this film works is because we know very little about what's going on. Any bits of valuable information (of which there is hardly any) is found out as the characters do. We are just being taken along with them, experience the frenetic horror as they try to survive and when some of the group die (as the inevitably do in these movies) we really feel for them. These are human characters, not action archetypes. The best move this film made, along with Blair witch and united 93 was to use unknowns. We empathise with them more than a star coz, well, they could be you and me.The monster itself is odd to describe as we only see it in small bits with the only full body shot being saved for the final moments of the film. It ain't pretty and it's nasty. There's always some element in big monster movies where the creature has a sympathetic streak. Not in this movie. This creature is spooked and is taking it's anger out on the city. We see footage of the thing taking down helicopters, pushing over buildings, little parasite like beasties jumping off it and attacking people. It's quite disturbing sometimes too as the group watch their best friends die (one particularly nasty moment sees one of them exploding).This is just a great, visceral experience and not for those who suffer easily from motion sickness. The beauty of this film is that we know very little and I find the idea that there's a sequel in the works a bit depressing. It should be left as a stand alone film and go down in history as landmark in film. If you don't feel physically and emotionally drained by the end of the film (trust me, emotions run high all through this) then you are a cold person. This is a brilliant film and, whilst it has it's minor flaws (as do all great films) it needs to be remembered as one of the best monster movies of all time. Original, fresh, heartbreaking and relentless are just a few words to describe this film but only one need be used: Brilliant! .5/5",Cloverfield
476,amalank,A supposedly clichéd movie taken to a whole new level,10,13 August 2008,Let's face it. The idea of a movie about a monster attack in New York City seems like an idea that has been used over and over again that people don't want to see this sort of thing ever again. But Cloverfield manages to overcome this. How? Well it uses the hand held camera technique. Then it places you right in the centre of the action by having the camera being held by one of the characters. Plus the camera being used is a typical everyday-use hand held camcorder. These factors really make this movie exciting and intense. I remember seeing this movie in the cinema and I was really on the edge of my seat while watching it. The tension really is maintained throughout.The final result is absolutely pleasing.,Cloverfield
477,PennyForMyThoughts,Not a Good Film,2,24 December 2008,"This film was not good. Why? The cinematography, while I'm sure was carefully planned and executed, came off as sloppy and distracting. The shaking, hand held camera did little to enhance the ""realism"" of the story, probably because the dialog was so contrived and repetitive. I'd go on to say that the acting could only be called sub-par at best, however I don't feel it's fair to blame the actors in this situation, due to how little they had to work with.Also, implausibility is a boring argument, but if you're the kind of spectator that is bothered by a filmmaker's disregard for the actual physical rules presupposed by a film's internal structure, this movie will annoy you as much as it did me.I watched this movie from 12:30 AM on a Wednesday night until about 2:00 AM on that same night, and believe it or not, I probably could have found something better to do with the time.

Xavier, Esq.After its shocking release 10 years prior, a repeat viewing of Cloverfield still manages to disgust and terrify. Unfortunately, many viewers do not recognize its genius. Imagine going to a famously hip New York nightclub on a Saturday evening and being shocked that there are heavy, 808-styled drumbeats interspersed throughout the catchy-but-vacuous lyrics as half-drunk people madly carouse about the parquet dance floor. A reasonable person would argue that you should have known what to expect. An open-minded person might even say, ""... heck, that was different!"" But only a 'hater' would exclaim: ""That sucked!""Cloverfield, directed by Matt Reeves, written by Drew Goddard and produced by J.J. Abrams, is a shaky-camera, found footage horror film which begs the question: What would happen if a gigantic, intelligent, malevolent alien monster attacked New York City? In order to properly frame this fantastical event, the director filmed the movie using a hand-held camera to establish a sense of timely realism and cast relative unknowns as protagonists to force the audience to focus on what was happening within the camera frame. The result is partly unique, partly hilarious, very unexpected and 100% terrifying... But only if you, the viewer, allow a willing suspension of disbelief.Cloverfield works well because the field of view is grounded by normal twenty-somethings attending a going away party for a friend, brother and paramour, as viewed behind the lens of a handicam. When this banal celebration is interrupted by the surreal experience of unnatural disasters in a population-dense New York City, the fear is amplified and very real as the audience is taken along for a very bumpy ride.Some of the more original OMG-worthy moments include: 1) The head of the Statue Of Liberty flying through the air to land at the fleeing feet of pedestrians; 2) The giant, rampaging monster disgorging smaller babies from its body that fall to the ground and immediately begin attacking people; 3) The giant, rampaging monster carefully considering the cameraman before ruthlessly biting him in half.You don't have to like roller-coasters, haunted houses or Santa Claus to enjoy a good horror flick - but you are probably in the minority of the human population if you don't. Escapism only works if you give it permission - or else, you'll always be that person wondering why everyone but you is having such a great time.",Cloverfield
479,rockproductions,A Terrifying Allegory!,9,20 November 2012,"OK, I know, people are getting tired of the mockumentry hand shaken, but not stirred films, but I can't resist a giant monster movie, especially one as good as this! A giant monster with deadly offspring attacks New York City. We don't know where it came from, what it is, other than it can topple over 50 story buildings & is multiplying quickly with fast moving/growing offspring whose bites bring on a deadly infection to whomever is bitten. It is impervious to non-nuclear military attacks, & is wreaking havoc on to the city.Sounds like your typical Japanese giant monster film, right? Yes, if that was what all this film was about, but it isn't. That's where the hand-held POV camera comes in & tells the story of mass hysteria, & the horror of an unknown terror. Of how a group of young New Yorkers try to survive the onslaught of not just the monster, but the military trying to destroy the monster, & a city collapsing around them. It delves into these characters psyches as they confront certain death, time & time again. How they band together for the good of all & the good of one. There is no fairy tale endings here to make the audience feel better. There is no sparing of heart rendering scenes. This is mayhem, wicked, brutal, & heart breaking. This is what it would be like if this scenario was to ever happen. Real people with deep emotions & attachments losing their loved ones & their lives.""Cloverfield"" is a clever heart pulsing thrill ride. It smartly never lets you get to many good glimpses of the monster. Most of the time a shot of the head, the body, the extremities, which make the beast all the more threatening.""Cloverfield"" knows how to get your attention! A particularly great scene is one of the head of the Statue of Liberty flying of it's shoulders & landing blocks into the city, rolling to a stop in the middle of a street. A great parable to 9/11. A great parable of pure unadulterated horror of something so incomprehensible happening, that it overwhelms the logical mind. A true demonstration of just how naked & vulnerable we truly are as a species, whether it be against our own kind, or nature.Yes, ""Cloverfield"" is an allegory to a path that many fear the most & expect the least. A path that has been traveled down time & time again in the real world, but we never would think it would happen to us, until it does.",Cloverfield
480,Winds_of_Destination,Awesome...well kind of,8,21 January 2008,"I would love to say that this movie is awesome...but I can't. It's without a doubt very good but the film still has some killer downfalls.Seen through a hand-held camera from start to finish, a group of teenagers are throwing a going-away party for their buddy Rob. But the party is crashed after a monster devastates Manhattan and gives it one rude awakening.Many people had problems with the camera, but I have to say, I think most of the people are wimps. The camera can do a good deal of shaking, especially when the characters are running, but the fact that a whole bunch of people have thrown up is completely ridiculous and just means that they are sensitive to even the slightest movement. I liked the camera work a lot; it gave a great sense of realism and had me interested the whole way through, even in the boring 15 minutes that the movie opens with. My only complaint with the camera is that it occasionally cuts a couple of minutes ahead at times where Hudson is forced to put the camera down, so you may miss some of the action.The horror element is pulled off really well; the camera work makes it really scary because it seems very real. Some of the images are very shocking, but not the monster. You never really see the monster up close and personal until the end, in which its not very intimidating. But it does a great deal of damage to the city and its most terrifying when you can't see it entirely.The characters are done almost entire realistically. Their mission through out the movie isn't entirely convincing when you think about it, but their behavior, facial expressions, reactions, and emotions all seem entirely human, which a lot of movies cannot convey for the story's sake. But with this movie it's done really well.So far I've given my props as to why I think its awesome, and I make it sound awesome, but it isn't. The first fifteen minutes are technically boring, but the camera immerses you. The ending is also very disappointing; its extremely abrupt and there is no resolution at all. This leaves you wanting more, wanting closure, wanting to know how the story ends. I'm really hoping for a sequel because there is so much more to know in the movie, and without resolution, the whole movie itself seems kind of pointless.One last positive note: I really liked the humor in this movie. The movie doesn't try to be funny, the humor is just like real-life humor, and it can provide good laughs.While there is much to give praise to in this movie, there is no ending to it and the fact that the camera makes you miss some of the action and suspense really hurts the movie. It had all the potential to be great if there were some kind of resolution, but it just doesn't happen. I do recommend it, although most folks won't like the ending of the movie. 7.5/10",Cloverfield
481,The_Matrix_Rocks,"Noisy, Shaky and Incoherent",3,24 November 2008,"Noisy, shaky and incoherent - and no, I'm not talking about a cantankerous geriatric.""Cloverfield"" unashamedly rips off 1999's truly terrifying ""The Blair Witch Project"", but ironically both misses and is missing a plot.Good looking twenty-somethings jog around Manhattan in improbable footwear while trying to rescue a friend, who is most likely already dead. One of them videos everything in a desperate attempt to ""document"" the attack of a monster from the deep. And that's the movie, folks! Mercifully this movie is over in about 75 minutes. This, at least, is a saving grace which again calls to mind the equally compact ""The Blair Witch Project"". I remain puzzled though at how battery life technology seems to have remained static for almost 10 years, but I suppose it's nothing partial recharging can't explain.While I discussed and analysed ""The Blair Witch Project"" for weeks after the movie, I'm amazed I remembered ""Cloverfield"" long enough to write this review.",Cloverfield
482,SnobbyDude,Cloverfield Lost Connection? That's really what is driving the hype.,1,20 January 2008,"I believe the hype of this movie is being driven by some of the LOST mania. In an interview with JJ Abrams, before the premiere of the movie, he said there are a few LOST connections in there. That's all you really need to do to make anything a success - just say there is a lost connection. You don't even need to have a good product.""Eyes Wide Shut"" was a movie produced by the late, great Stanley Kubrick. Like Abrams, he had a cult following and everyone went to see his movies based on the reputation he had in Hollywood of being a genius. Stanley Kubrick's last movie was terrible and if it was put out there by anyone else it would have been a huge flop. Because of the Kubrick name and the hype associated with it, EWS was much more of a success than it should have been.Similarly, Cloverfield isn't a good movie. There is really no plot, no character development, no ground breaking cinematography, no fine acting moments. The special effects were decent, but not really any better or worse than any other Hollywood flick out there. It's the first movie I've ever reviewed where I don't have to worry about spoilers because there is no plot to spoil. Everyone knows it's a film where you see a monster destroying a city and not much else.Another thing that adds to the frustration of watching Cloverfield is that the camera is so shaky it will make you physically ill. Everyone I was with got sick in the theater. I can recall at least three times where the motion sickness got so intense I had to close my eyes until the nausea passed. Then I would open my eyes and the nausea would set in again and I'd have to close my eyes again. Even though my eyes were closed for what seemed like a large portion of the movie, it didn't really make any difference because nothing happened to advance the plot because there wasn't one.If you really need a lost fix this badly, just spend the night re-watching a season of lost. You'll find some hints and clues you haven't seen before and you won't make yourself physically ill from motion sickness in the process.",Cloverfield
483,Tim851,Fun,8,1 May 2008,"I liked this! Cloverfield is basically Godzilla for the 21st century. There is no plot except for: Alien monster destroys New York and people freak out.The movie lives of the way it's shot. The hand-held camera IS the movie. We've seen the carnage before, the monsters, the battles, the turmoil ... just never from this perspective. It works great! (Although it's not the reinvention of the wheel that J.J.Abrams wants us to believe - Blair Witch Project ... hello?) There is nothing much to judge ""objectively"". The camera-work inherently belittles any acting performance, since there's rarely a steady shot of any actor. The same goes for the special effects or the directing of crowd sequences, etc. But at the end of it all, experienced through the shaky first person perspective, the movie feels sufficiently realistic.The only thing that I didn't like was the voice of the camera man Hud. He annoyed me. His comments were off and people mostly ignored him (rightfully so).I'm giving it 8/10.",Cloverfield
484,mr_facehead,Excellent!,4,8 February 2008,"Cloverfield is a brilliant film. I was expecting it to be reasonably good, but it really was excellent.The only thing that forced me to lower the rating, was the fact that it almost killed me. For about half of the film, I had to look at the ground, walls or close my eyes, due to the extreme and prolonged motion of the hand-held camera. If I didn't do so, i probably would have been carried out. This seemed to have no effect on a lot of people, but I recommend watching it with some water or nourishment in the anticipation that you'll be sick. Despite making me severely ill, I wouldn't say the hand-held camera was a bad part of the film. If the experience of a film is ruined by something such as this, then it would be bad, but in most cases it wasn't a problem.Watching this was incredible. It was really like watching an actual camera tape. Even little things like camcorder focusing and features were incorporated. So much thought has been put into this film, it's really great.There's even a little secret bit at the end that you'll probably miss if you blink, but it's really amazing.",Cloverfield
485,secretagent_007,Monstrous Shakycam,9,20 January 2008,"As far as pushing the boundaries of convention goes, I've still got to give it to Blair Witch Project for a simple reason: its hand-held camera-work does not inspire me to scream ""Hold the heck still!"" at the screen. Hud, the cameraman in Cloverfield, has got to be addicted to caffeine for all the shakiness and inability to keep the camera on something for more than 1.6 seconds. Or else it's ADD. I'm not one of those weaklings who got dizzy from The Bourne Ultimatum, but I appreciate being able to see what I'm looking at if the whole point of shooting a movie on video is to make it feel like you're actually there. But then the producer, J.J. Abrams, is famous for never making anything too clear (as evidenced by his TV shows ""Lost"" and ""Alias"").This is a monster movie, along the lines of Godzilla or The Host, but with a twist. Everything we see is purported to be a videotape found after the monster eats Manhattan. The video starts as a collection of farewell messages to Rob, a 20-something who has a million 20-something friends and who is moving to Japan for work. His best friend Hud is running the camera, interviewing Rob's pals, and hitting on Marlena, who ain't hitting back. Then the entire city shakes and the lights go out, rudely awakening all the characters out of an awkward situation involving Rob and his friend (and more) Beth. Everybody's probably seen what happens next - explosions in the distance, panic in the streets, and the head of the Statue of Liberty crashes in front of Rob's building. Aside from this very sentence, I'll not make any comparisons to 9/11 - scared people in a city running away from something bad does not inherently carry political or social meaning. This is a monster movie and like any monster movie, people have to run away from the monster en masse.What makes this one different, though, is not just that it's shot with a camcorder. This is a special monster movie because we rarely see the monster and therefore are stuck with the characters and we learn only what they learn. This story is about the human tragedy that is glossed over in all the old Godzilla flicks where someone screams, ""GOJIRA!"" and takes off. What about that man's family? Is his home destroyed by the creature? Those other movies are usually about scientists and military people scheming to kill whatever beast is plaguing Tokyo now. From Mothra to Independence Day, that's the formula. Formula is turned on its head when we stop caring if the General will drop an A-bomb on the thing and we start seeing the battle in the streets between average people and the boar-sized insects that live on the huge thing's back. One scene in a dark subway tunnel is one of the best of its kind, where the stalking creatures aren't there and then, suddenly, they are. See The Descent for more night vision camcorder scariness...Special credit must go to the special effects artists on this movie. With maybe a couple exceptions, everything that would be fantastical and impossible in another movie looks perfectly real here. The bugs in the subway don't look like a special effect that we are meant to admire, they look like vicious, man-eating creatures from another dimension or something and they really are terrifying, the same way a rabid dog staring you down is terrifying. The effects tricked my brain into thinking everything was real and I can't remember the last time that happened. Cloverfield has a really simple story at its core, about a small group of survivors looking for an injured friend, and it has some rather annoying camera-work (which is absolutely worse than just motion sickness-inducing camera-work), but it is effective as an intense adventure movie and the totally natural-looking effects prop up the characters who are basically operating without a plot most of the time. This isn't a perfect movie, but it is a ride; that cannot be denied. I only hope Paramount doesn't sequel-ize it and make themselves a franchise not unlike the Godzilla movies that inspired it.http://www.movieswithmark.com",Cloverfield
486,cjfort,The Review: Cloverfield,10,23 January 2008,"Cloverfield could probably best be summed up as a breath of fresh air.Walking into Cloverfield, I had known about some of the hype, and had know about it for awhile (A relative was heavily into it), and I am happy to say it is as good, if not better than hoped.I do believe the hype has helped how good it is. If you followed everything, the film is much more real to you than someone knowing there was an explosion in the commercial. But if you didn't follow the hype, you can be sure it will still be a good movie.I would like to mention, though before I get into the hardcore part of my review, that A). I will not spoil the monster many have wandered about and B). Be weary of negative reviews, because after asking people, I've noticed, quite ironically, that the people who don't like it the most, are all in school, aka the people who are most hardcore about YouTube.Now, this movie has been most popularly called a mix between The Blaire Witch Project and Godzilla. Though there are heavy elements between Cloverfield and these films, that comparison isn't quite right.This movie is not a rip-off. It is more like an original movie made out of Unoriginal parts. The film does do the hand-held, first person point of view like Blaire Witch (which was the reason for many negative reviews, and for me warning you that if you have motion sickness, don't watch the film), but this movie doesn't screw up the premise. It uses it very well, and doesn't over do it, and puts our very funny comic relief behind the camera.The film is very intense throughout, and doesn't disappoint on it's monster. The monster is used like Jaws is used, only with a little more seeing, and this ends my talk of the monster.Another warning, is that you must know that this isn't played like a movie, or a documentary. It's played like a tape found after the incident nicknamed ""Cloverfield"".This movie won't have a formulaic (for the most part) story, so don't expect Hollywood endings or development, but more like real people in real situations. That is the main reason overall why people didn't like it, because they expected a Hollywood picture or '98 Godzilla. DON'T. THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF FILM.Overall, the film was very exciting, realistic, and the characters aren't character's, but real people (to creep you out more, go to their Myspaces).I highly enjoyed this film, and protect it from haters. See it with a fresh mind.Rating: *** (of 4) Entertainment: PERFECT 5 (of 5)",Cloverfield
487,whosyourdrummer1,"Something that could have been so good, ended so badly",5,19 January 2008,"Wow, was I so disappointed or what? This was honestly the most disappointed I have ever been in my entire life. Cloverfeild really kept me hanging on from the minute it started till about 3 minutes before it ended. Man, it was so intense the whole time, the whole time you're wanting them to survive wanting them run, something! But at the end when he is talking into the camera even for the fact that they didn't survive, they should have made it to where someone found the tape like years later..and found out what it was or something! I mean the huge spider looking monsters..what happened to them? Did they die? What exactly were they? Where did they come from? Why were they in Manhattan? Something! But at the end you are left with so many questions that should have been answered but didn't because the main characters die. And then it shows an old video-clip of them then BAM! your done! I waited like 10 extra minutes to see if maybe after the previews they would show something but they didn't. I'm so mad at this movie. What a great idea that didn't end properly at all.

After much procrastinating I finally decided to rent it.Well personally I should of never rented it or watched it, I'm sorry but the movement of the camera and the person was was asked to film was totally unbelievable and truly irritating. I can't believe the guy can be that stupid also why would someone who has somewhat of intelligence befriend someone who is a nut job. That it self makes the film even worse! The whole film could of been made much more realistic, I don't know about you... but if an alien is destroying an entire city why would you risk your life to save someone who might not be alive anymore?

My summary above says it all.The problem with this film is the over used, bad gimmick of the cam-corder gag to try and make things ""more suspenseful"". The only place this gag worked was the only good part in ""Signs"". That scene was chilling and looked so real, but it was just a glimpse, not the whole running time of the film.Maybe the film would have been better if the main characters all didn't make such dumb decisions, and the intent of the people to ""document"" this happening...just dumb, drop the camera and run.It may have worked better if the movie had started out this way, then went into traditional film...I just got sick of it. Sorry I didn't buy into the hype, much like Blair Witch I was just left feeling cheated, and like I waisted my time.",Cloverfield
490,newguy85,Very enjoyable,8,6 April 2010,"I thought the entire concept of the movie was very well done: A guy is going away so his friends decide to document his surprise party, and by accident they capture extraordinary events on film.The movie was very believable, meaning the characters respond to a catastrophic event in a very believable way.Through the taped over bits we can see that Rob is very much attached to Beth, which explains his guilt to shooing her away from the ""safe-zone"" that was his complex.They begin a trek to safety only to walk right into the middle of everything happening. Through tragedy we see Rob's future sister in law loses the survivor instincts she had in the beginning, and decides to help Rob, who's also overcome with grief and regret, find Beth.The cameraman is there because he has to support his best bud.The special effects were incredible, you feel like you're on the front lines of this spic battle.The script bounces from digression to situational, which is realistic for a group of friends scared, tired, and overcome with grief.Overall the movie is very much Godzilla in its nature. But where Godzilla follows scientists trying to find answers, and being scripted to know everything about the creature, Cloverfield takes the approach of the collateral damage of a supernatural event; it follows characters who have no idea what the hell is going on, and don't want to know. They just want to find their friend and get the hell out of NYC.",Cloverfield
491,atliel,Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob!,7,27 January 2008,"Oh Rob, how romantic of you to drag your closest friends across a horrifying and incredible monster battlefield all for a girl you had a one night stand with. Never mind that they all die, what's important is that you got the girl in the end, actually you got the girl killed in the end. She might have survived had you left her in the apartment but we may never know that. At least we as the audience get to see glimpses of the monster, a cross between Godzilla and a crustacean and it's little parasitic shrimp spiders as you and your friends travel through the ruins of what was Manhattan. We would have never seen the destruction, the looting, the monster, what the smaller monsters are capable of, what the military were doing about it and what the final move on the part of the military would be had the search for Beth never come about.If you have not figured it out the love interest in the story line is a narrative device. Even now I ponder on whether or not I sympathized with the characters. That being said I still enjoyed the film because it hits the mark on issues that modern horror films especially monster films sometimes lack; this film gets straight to the point. Who cares why the monster appears? It just does and it destroys and everybody dies and that's what I want. My summary comes off a bit sarcastic but really...how many times do I have to hear Rob's name shouted before I notice I'm watching a movie?!

Thank god it was as short as it was, it will be easier to forget that way.It is an interesting idea gone horribly wrong, carried out by those who just didn't have any real grasp of how to pull it off. It's great to have an different idea of how a movie should be presented, but that doesn't mean that you will be the one capable of carrying it out. They should have looked for people that could make the idea fly, instead it crashed and burned and burned and burned until nothing was left.I guess you will have to see it to believe me, since it has been so deviously promoted.

493,worldpieceprod,Great experience!,10,20 January 2008,"Lately I've been waiting for something different to crawl out of Hollywood for a change. Cloverfield did it. I have to admit that I went into this film rather skeptical, mostly because of its overblown media blitz. That's usually a sure sign of a stinker. It's much easier to make a good PR campaign than it is to make a good movie. This monster film has some notable similarities to The Blair Witch in its approach, but far surpasses that film in intensity and execution. What I liked about this movie is that it used all the usual Hollywood Blockbuster tricks such as CGI and explosive sound, but it remembered to be intense for the viewer and not just 90 minutes of eye candy. Too often these days films are so focused on the special effects that they seem to forget that people are trying to watch a story unfold instead of a series of CGI effects promos strung together like a bunch of Super Bowl commercials . The effects in Cloverfield take a back seat to the reactions of the characters in an apocalyptic scenario. The unknown actors were perfectly cast as over-privileged twenty-somethings, who've had the world handed to them, suddenly faced with a real survival situation. There is a large amount shaky-cam on screen, probably the most I've ever seen. I don't know how this film could have maintained the realism without it though. It was a necessary evil. Most Hollywood action films use the shaky-cam to make up for poor direction. Here it is forgivable because it adds to the atmosphere and realism. People don't typically run for their lives wearing steady cam rigs. Some have complained about the lack of an explanation for what happens in the plot. These monkeys have completely missed the point. Having your imagination fill in the many blanks is what makes this film work so well. For all of those people void of any imagination, I would suggest watching a turd like Gozlilla(1998). There you will have every little detail in the plot spoon fed to you like a 2nd grade geography class. Overall Cloverfield feels more like a terrifying nightmare than an actual movie. It was an incredibly engrossing and engaging experience for me from the opening shot to the final credits. When the last shot played out I realized that I forgot I was in a movie. I can't remember the last time that happened.",Cloverfield
494,HalGuentert,Over-hyped Trash,1,28 October 2008,"I have been a big fan of the TV series ""LOST"" and expected much more from this movie due to the hype and J.J. Abrams connection to it.I am not sure what the producing geniuses were thinking, but one or more important elements were missing from this project, one probably being the special effects people from ""LOST"". I was not paying attention to the ending, so cannot spoil it for you. If you can pay attention that long, you have no problems with attention deficit.I was so bored, I could not even pay attention to the DVD after the first minutes it was so lame. The only thing that even interested me was the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing on the street, after that it seemed to be one cliché piled on top of another. It reminded me of a ""Blair Witch Project"" combined with 9/11 footage and no innovation, or how to produce a really cheap movie and hopefully sucker enough people into paying to see it. I felt like there ought to be a law against hyping these movies to the point of creating a fraud on the public, or it should be a case study in how not to make a movie.Being a movie fan, I take no pleasure in placing this loser in the bottom 10 of all movies I have seen.",Cloverfield
495,hindsiteman,Camera kept filming...,8,12 April 2010,"I've seen Cloverfield, and the film makes you panic. You get in touch with actors just as if you've been there experiencing the thrills that go along the ride. The thrills are unique. I see some people are comparing it to a Blair Witch project, but my thoughts are that they only concur in the fact that there is no sound story line in any of them. Just mass panic, couple of kiss kiss frames, then more panic! Also, the actors are just portraying the fact that they have been isolated and distanced in this huge commotion, having to find each other. Maybe there is some hidden meaning with this movie, like that we are all in the same city but so far from each other at the same time, running away from dangers, trying to keep ourselves alive while people who we love the most suffer from within.All in all a nice little thriller.",Cloverfield
496,rsa5387,Better Than Expected,8,17 August 2008,"Best monster movie ever? This was quite different from the norm as it had the shaky cam perspective...but it was actually done well for once. This view not only made you feel like you were part of the movie, but heightened the suspense quite a bit. I...(read more) loved how they hid the monster for the majority of the movie. Anyhow, after the first excruciatingly boring 20 minutes of drama between some rich kids, this film really takes off and never lets go. The effects are first rate (the crowd shots are amazing...especially the bridge scene...the monster is terrifying). The acting was believable, but the characters could've been written more plausibly...a lot of the decisions they made were totally illogical...but they grow on you and aren't as dumb as most horror movie characters. Overall, this film gets high marks for its no nonsense attempt at the monster genre within a context that felt chillingly real. A must watch!",Cloverfield
497,Dream_seeker,Possibly the closest original Monster movie that's actually good!!!,8,25 January 2008,"Before I get into being the critic i have to say this, when walking into this movie you have to remember 1 thing; that this movie is being done by hand held camera so unless you haven't seen a movie that was dealt in this type of aspect (Aka. Blair witch) then you might find this difficult to watch but it depends on the viewer. Now i will get into the criticism.I have to give it to J.J. Abrams for amping the people up with the secret type of trailers and websites that gives prelude to this anticipated movie and finally when going to see this movie i was expecting the hand held shaky camera feel so i wasn't surprised at the outcome cause it just adds more depth as well as realism to the ride. The story....well...there's not much of a story; technically, its more so a documentation that was left via SD card during the aftermath of what happened and picked up by the military to be viewed and that's where the fun begins. What makes this movie even more realistic is the fact that they don't know much about the monster than we do when watching it; so when they know as much we do too (in a sense of the word); thus adding a scary reality to the threat this movie provides and gives that much originality to the focus of the movie.The actors are a close to real as they can get and even though there were some that would be confused by the time jumping during the camera scenes when you put 2 and 2 together you get to understand what is going on between the characters of Beth and Rob and their somewhat shaky relationship before, during, and after the horrific events so in a way one would or could make it out to be a love story in the middle of an apocalyptic event; But this movie didn't need a soundtrack cause it added just as much tension without it, you feel for these characters as well as dread the monsters that seem to come out of the woodwork during the battle scenes and that's where the awesome special effects comes in. I can't compare this movie to Blair witch cause as much as there is an identical feel there is a significant difference, Blair witch is more on a psychological aspect. Whereas for Cloverfield this is drowned in awesome special effect that seems to mesh very well with the real hand-camera the action picks up strong in certain parts of the movie giving it a deeper tone as well as fear for the people portrayed in this movie.This is a love or hate movie, some will love the direction that this movie puts on the audience as well as how it was well written and directed as well as the not-knowing until they know aspect which i felt was greatly on point cause even the military didn't know what they were facing so this movie won't hold your hand in anything cause our guess is as good as theirs. Some will hate this movie cause of that same approach i've mention...you see some people want to know ahead of time what is going to happen or who they are going to face but when you have something like that...you don't get that sense of dread and surprise but most want that; also the camera isn't the best and these guys run...and run, and run so you have to deal with that from time to time if not all the time...i'm sure there are other, ""Love, hate"" reasons but i think i said too much.I give this movie an 8 simply cause its even though it has lack of story it holds a deeper, original, realistic feel for danger as well as a typical love story which gets you into their world. Also, the shear not knowing until the characters know made this movie just as real as if this was caught by surprise as the next person and you get more hints as they know which. Along with damn good special effects this movie did a good job making people anticipate and it didn't let me down which some movies would do sometimes when faced with that type of hype.Plus, I thought the woman playing lily was HOT!!",Cloverfield
498,TomCruiseFan99,Worth the wait!!!,9,10 February 2008,"This just opened in South Africa this past weekend. After all the teasers I've seen concerning this movie, I was definitely curious about whether it would be worth all the hype. After reading the reviews once it opened in America, I got the feeling the critics were divided 50-50. Going into it, I knew already that the whole movie was basically like watching a home movie recording. Was I really in the mood for such an experiment? So, with some trepidation I went ahead and watched it...Verdict? Yikes!!! It was awesome. Something totally different and original. Amazing special effects, simple yet effective plot line, no well-known actors (making it seem more realistic), and a director who knows how to ratchet up the tension. By now, you know the plot: While throwing a surprise farewell bash for a friend, a group of New York 20-somethings witness their city being overrun by a huge monster. And all the while, one of them is walking around with a hand-held video camera recording everything. Doesn't seem like much to work with, but the most effective stories are usually the simplest. One definitely gets the feeling of being there in the thick of the action. With quite a few effective scare moments, this movie definitely takes a well-worn idea and makes it its own. The jerkiness and continual unsteadiness of what you see on screen won't be for everyone though. It worked for me, against all my expectations.This movie of course most resembles Godzilla, but with quite a bit of James Cameron's Aliens thrown into the mix. Definitely one to see on the big screen, DVD just won't do it justice.",Cloverfield
499,mimosveta,Tip: Use shaky camera if you can't choreograph action sequences,2,25 August 2008,"The idea once was original, have your actors shoot the film. How cool is that? Than, they started to use it ever so often. If they can't figure out how action sequence should be made, they just shake camera bit more, so you can't see anything all the same. On the other hand, they did have those spare CGI monsters lying around, so you will have to see those beastly things despite the fact that CGI is never scary, looks fake and irritating anyway, and there is absolutely no need for it.There was only one good thing about this movie, and that was gorgeous Lizzy Caplan.",Cloverfield
500,msmchug,Really enjoyable,8,11 June 2016,"There's a lot of found footage and similar films out there but cloverfield has to be one of the better ones. The story is told through the camcorder of a young couple who attend a house party in New York and end up filming all of the action and horror as it unfolds. I liked the pace of the film, it got going very quickly and keeps you entertained. The last thing i was expecting to see was a big alien/ monster in the film. Most of the main characters do die and or get eaten etc. This movie reminded me of I am legend mixed with war of the worlds! Overall I liked it. The effects are good and realistic without being too over the top.",Cloverfield
501,Magellan Grey,Highly Unusual Film!!!,9,21 January 2008,"Back in the fall of 2007 when I first saw the trailer for CLOVERFIELD I was very intrigued. The trailer was high tension. I was itching to see this movie.I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! I truly love this movie. Seen it three times!!! It was made to look like a video retrieved from what was once Central Park here in NYC. The movie starts with the U.S. Government blurb and logo. Its apparent that the footage was being viewed secretly by top military brass and members of our government. This the video begins. Its lighthearted and in many places funny before the attack. Its about one of the main character's Bon Voyage party and some of the insanity that takes place during the party. The there is the great explosion and insuring ""attack"" upon Manhattan. This is not a monster I've seen before which makes this extremely satisfying. Monster is NOT a reptile.I understand the original title of the film was going to be PARASITE. I see why. WOW!!! But the military designation is even better.Congratulations to Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams for bring us a highly original film.",Cloverfield
502,mhtyler,"big monster, shaky camera, stupid characters",2,20 August 2012,"Said most of this in the summary... There is a big monster loose in the city. Our protagonists are determined to learn nothing about what is going on, put themselves into harms way, and film their last adventure with a video camera that only points to where the action isn't.The characters are trying to die, they richly deserve to die, and its only a shame that they don't do it more quickly and make this a film short.I wish we could at least have had one military character to tell us what is going on, like that general in ""War of the Worlds"" who says, ""guns, bombs, tanks, they're like toys against those things!"" But no, the military must trudge on with no more direction than this film has.",Cloverfield
503,jonjonat,this movie is just not a movie at all!,4,25 January 2008,What the hell? after i read all the comments and reviews from other people i couldn't believe most people actually liked this film (which is not even a film at all)! I in the the other this movie was just a load of crap and I'm not saying it wasn't just a movie it's just a guy filming with a stupid unstable video camera. I thought the monsters and giant mutant grasshopper monsters were kind of just a little cool but in the other hand pretty fake and stupid. And the worst thing about this movie is most of the acting is pretty not very good at all apart from the guy filming the camera and the friends with him but I really hated that the statue of liberty's head crushing through all the buildings and landing in front of a whole crowd of people. I mean that is just terrible that for some reason they had to that. And the ending was stupid that everyone died but I didn't get why they had to film this movie with a stupid unstable video camera! I mean half the time how do you know what the hell's going on and you can't see much but a stupid special effects of explosions. and that's about it. I never want to watch a movie like this again as long as I live. It was the worst movie of the year so far! 1/10 (0/10),Cloverfield
504,cheshire551225800,Very Good and Actually Shocking,8,25 February 2009,"I rented this on DVD, but I wish I had seen it on the big screen. I thought that the ruse of seeing it as if it had been filmed by people actually in the situation was effective, although there are those who decry it as a ""Blair Witch"" rip-off technique.In our Youtube & reality show obsessed world, I don't find it strange at all that someone would want to try to document events so strange. I think it would be a natural impulse to a 20 or 30 something individual and a natural way to try to feel like they had some kind of control over an out of control situation. Or maybe just for the $$$ or fame from being the one who got such footage. This movie isn't supposed to be analyzed, it is supposed to be experienced as if you were there. That is why the dialogue is as banal at times as it is. How thought-out and snappy do you think conversation is during a natural disaster/terrorist attack etc.????? People do things that seem strange, hmmmm ever heard of victims of large scale events being in a kind of state of shock? If you need everything spelled out for you, you won't like this movie. They tell why it is named Cloverfield in the opening scenes. If you missed it, you need to try more movies that aren't so formulaic.Some of the reasons people are posting for not liking this movie are soooo funny. Like someone said it wasn't ""realistic"" because the character of Lily would never wear those shoes. Um, okay, hello? It was supposed to be an unforeseen disaster situation, was she supposed to know that ahead of time? Do you think anybody caught in 9-11 wore shoes not conducive to fleeing the scene??????I cared about the characters and I was glad that they didn't go to the easy ending of letting everybody live. I was disappointed that they did go for the ""money shot"" of clover at the end. It would have been more effective to have only seen parts of clover and try to put it together in your head.I found the wry comments of Hud throughout to be pretty funny in such a dire situation. I definitely recommend the move, but not if you have a queasy stomach in general, need meds to ride in a boat, or are easily frustrated by a movie where you don't have someone to tell you what is going on every second.",Cloverfield
505,FattyBoomBatty,"A little slow to start, but...",9,5 February 2008,"Once it gets going the pacing is maintained with relentless intensity. The slowish intro is absolutely necessary in order to establish the context for the rest of the film.To begin with, the soundtrack is exceptional, creating an involving atmosphere that draws you into every scene, and where appropriate, offering plenty of monster sized impact. It's really one of the stars of the film.The characters are well played by a bunch of unknowns, who have all the attributes of real people, sometimes frustrating, at other times making the viewer feel truly sympathetic to their situation. (Thank god it wasn't Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise - or any of the other bunch of 'celebrity' actors that put you off going to the movies). Its well scripted too.It is not obviously CGI heavy, though where it is used it is done very well. The general feel of the film is, well, imagine Blair Witch crossed with Alien crossed with a much darker version of Godzilla and set to a backdrop of 9-11 New York. Don't go expecting a light weight Emmerich movie, this is something much darker, and IMHO, better.It does have a few failings, like a magic camcorder that is able to run the duration of the film on a single battery, and and at the same time provide a stellar surround soundtrack. You do need to suspend some belief, as to resolve it would probably require a move away from the first person perspective, which would change the whole feel of the film for the worse. There is also the obvious omission during the film of any references to 9-11, though I guess one must be sensitive to such things.",Cloverfield
506,afdiazr,This is not the way it was meant to be,4,1 February 2008,"Cloverfield goes for the found-civilian-documentary approach, and then violates it's own rules by adding lame acting and stupid out-of-a-video game situations. The Blair Witch Project stuck with it's documentary style all the way up to the end. That's not the case with Cloverfield, and all those stupid decisions (keep the camera taping while on desperate situations, for example) just destroy the concept of 'reality' it's trying to imply. We end up with a boring story and some glimpses of what could really be a devastating attack on New York City. Lets face it: this thing wants you to feel it did happen. The problem is that it sticks so many regular narrative vehicles it doesn't feel real. Then the pace and ideas start to repeat over and over, until everything feels exahusted. There's one point where you stop getting amazed and just begin to wonder when the hell it's going to end. It's no better than Emmerich's Godzilla.",Cloverfield
507,BruddanChrist,A hell of a movie,7,26 January 2008,"Cloverfield is a different kind of movie. Like The Blair Witch Project, it presents itself as a first-hand account of a fictional event, attempting to make it more realistic. Instead of progressing like a conventional story, it unfolds as a series of events in a several-hour-long span of time.Unlike the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield succeeds in putting the viewer in the middle of the chaos. At times, I was so invested in the characters and their conflict that I found myself panicking with them.This movie is brilliantly executed. The camera work was filmed in an amateur fashion, but never lingers on a shot or idles at the storyteller's feet for too long. The pace is good, too, giving the audience time to breathe after major events.Cloverfield isn't for everybody. The guy I saw it with hated it for the reasons I loved it. I think it has a lot to do with expectations. If you expect a conventional movie when seeing this movie, you will be disappointed. Just know going into it that it will surprise you.",Cloverfield

Why did they have to spoil it completely? Man, my room is still spinning and I feel sick. I couldn't bare to watch the screen. Sorry, sometimes I like the funfair but NOT for 84 minutes on a row thank you. The story is OK, I guess; and the sound is normal too (that is, it's stereo and strangely enough doesn't rotate around like the camera constantly does; apparently this portable cam was equipped with two hifi stereo microphones with gyroscopes or something to keep them in the same position). Unless you really, really enjoyed watching the Blair witch project, no NOT go to see this movie. And if you go, you'd be insane to accept any other seat that one in the far back.",Cloverfield
511,Westcoastal,Almost unparalleled in the genre,10,10 April 2008,"I first reviewed this film back in 2008 and decided to update my review nearly a decade later because I STILL watch this film regularly. It is without a doubt my favourite monster movie of all time.I am a bit of a monster movie fanatic and will watch just about anything in the genre. I'm an especially huge fan of Godzilla (with the exception of the awful 1998 version) and I wince a bit to say I enjoy Cloverfield more than Godzilla, but I have no choice but to acknowledge that it is superior in its ability to completely suck you in and keep you invested in what's happening on screen.The storyline the film is built around is a bit cliché but it works well as a backdrop to the disaster that is unfolding. It creates some decently believable motivations for the characters and while I wouldn't be very moved by it as a romantic story in any other context, I think it serves its purpose well here.I think the reason this film works so well is that it focuses on the experience of being inside a monster attack, rather than focusing on all the logistics and militaristic drama of battling one from the outside. This makes the film much more gripping and psychologically tense than other films of the genre.I tend toward motion sickness and the shaky camera thing bothered me a bit when I first watched it in the theatre but viewing it at home I've not had any ill effects.I have seen this film a minimum of 25 times, and I know I'll watch it many times more. If you haven't seen it before I recommend checking it out.",Cloverfield
512,Awakening124,I haven't been this tense in a movie theater in sooooo long,10,26 January 2008,"With all of the crazy viral marketing (that started way too early) some people were worried if it could live up to the hype. It COMPLETELY surpassed my expectations, and I went in expecting it to be good in the first place. Once things pick up and start rolling about 15 minutes in, I didn't relax until the credits started rolling. Yes, they give you a few brief moments to catch your breath, but even then you're still on edge, waiting for the next attack. I can't imagine this movie being executed in any way other than the hand held approach. They somehow managed to pull off SEVERAL absolutely beautiful shots/camera angles while still fitting into the hand held setting. The acting and dialog is so natural that it doesn't feel like they're acting a script...at ALL. It's incredibly intense, you're really pulled into the character's corners, and it's filmed wondrously. If you get motion sickness easily, you'll probably want to wait 'till this is out on DVD. Other than that...GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's one of the greatest monster movies of all time. Actually...scratch that...it's THE greatest monster movie of all time.",Cloverfield
513,rumbleinthejungle,Breathes new life into the monster movie,9,13 February 2009,"I can't understand people disliking this film?! This is what needed to happen to the monster movie - 'Cloverfield' has shown the way. The film has characters that we care about, humour, and one of the most awesome monsters to ever stomp all over the silver-screen. There are several little touches that just make this film better than great - the scene in the electronics store where Hud is filming the TV broadcast, the part where they are caught in the crossfire between the monster and the military, and the attack on the Brooklyn Bridge. Also, the parasite creatures are very creepy and add another dimension of terror to the proceedings.Why would you go to see a monster movie in the first place? Because you want to be entertained, right?If you put this film on a good sized TV and crank up the sound in stereo, then there's no way that you couldn't have a blast watching this flick. People that fault this film on the basis of shallow characters or lack of plot are missing out. When one compares it to similar films such as Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' or Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' then I truly believe that this film comes up trumps.People who expect a nice tidy resolve and all the exposition that usually sucks the life out of these kind of films should steer clear. The film's writers have, perhaps inspired by the events of 9/11, posed the question 'What if this huge, terrible creature showed up and started tearing the city apart and no-one could stop it? What would people do?' Brilliant.",Cloverfield

516,alexscg,"Overall good, but something's missing",6,29 March 2021,"This can best be compared to Godzilla, because of the monster, and The Blair Witch Project, because of the way it was filmed (like someone was actually taking an amateur recording of the events that we know were not real, so why bother making a movie like this to make them seem real?)... I do not like movies filmed like that, it's too shaky and it does not make it any less real (or not real) compared to making a normal movie. Thankfully, we do not see too many movies filmed like this one. I hope that will not become a trend in the movie industry.Overall, the movie was well done, with plenty of suspense and on-the-edge-of-the-seat moments, the monster looks big and scary. What I did not like is that the viewers did not get some kind of answer - how the big creature appeared, and the smaller ones as well? Were they the babies of the big creature or a separate species? Where did they come from? What caused them? I think the audience was waiting for a resolution. In the end, what happens to the main characters? Has the monster been defeated?While it was a an overall good movie, certainly not a waste of time, it could have been better, had it been brought to a conclusion and resolution. I hate unfinished movies.",Cloverfield

This movie made us feel totally gonzo. I got a headache trying to stay focused on the screen. The whip pans and cuts were so extreme and messy that we couldn't take more than 30 minutes of it. We tried fast forwarding to ""the good parts"" and couldn't find any really. I've heard that lots of people were disappointed in the fact that the monster/alien whatever it was, was never explained. I could have dealt with that if there would have been something worth seeing. We never found that something - but then, like I said, we didn't get past 30 minutes or so before we both reached for the off button on the remote and then our favorite pain relievers.",Cloverfield
518,bubbathom,Awesome.,10,7 March 2010,"Most people will tell you Cloverfield is about a monster that attacks Manhattan. However, it's so much more than that. I would describe Cloverfield as a drama rather than a monster movie, but it really combines all these elements: Drama, romance, action, mystery, horror, and sci-fi.When first hearing that Cloverfield is about a monster that attacks Manhattan, it would be likely to think of the movie as unoriginal, but it is the exact opposite of that. Cloverfield is directed using the hand-held(shaky camera) technique, which is a gutsy move, as not everyone likes the technique. The film is portrayed as if it's raw footage of the monster attacking Manhattan, found by the US government after the attack. Many people complain about the filming, and say that it's like an amateur filmed it, but I personally loved the cinematography. The hand-held technique also gives the movie a really mysterious vibe, because you only know as much as an average person would. There's no scientist there to explain the monsters origins and how to destroy it, which is really annoying to me in most monster movies.Another original thing about Cloverfield is the viral marketing. Viral marketing is advertising a product through some form of media(in Cloverfield's case, the internet) indirectly and relies on word of mouth. Some of the Cloverfield viral websites: Slusho, Tagruato, 1-18- 08, and many others. Following the viral campaign was lots of fun, and added a lot to the experience of the movie.People complain about the camera technique, the mystery, the plot, basically everything I like about the movie. I guess it's just a difference in opinion, and it can't be proved one way or another.Overall, I thought Cloverfield was great. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. 10/10.",Cloverfield
519,supramaxx,Cloverfield.....awesome monster movie,9,22 January 2008,"This movie has been hyped up for quite a while, I remember seeing the teaser trailer during Transformers and everybody in the crowd questioning the trailer. The trailer depicted this movie as quite mysterious, but still very intriguing. I actually had no idea it was being filmed in a first person perspective (through a hand held camera) throughout the whole movie until I actually saw the movie. To some people it might be a huge turn-off, I actually felt like I was in the movie, as intense as it was, feeling every whim and emotion of the character, there is no third person here, you feel what the character are feeling, you see what the character see, you feel the terror that they feel and surprises at every corner. Basically it is a giant monster attacking New York City type movie (Godzilla and King Kong comes to mind) but much better filmed and one billion times more intense. I related to the character Hud, the most, as he was talking nervously and comically throughout the whole movie, thats just like me in real life, always trying to make light out of a serious situation.The Good: I haven't felt an emotional rush in the movies since I can remember. You feel like you are one of the characters, going through the same confusion and mass panic that they are enduring. The guy who is filming Hud, is my type of guy, one who always makes light and talks excessively in tight situations. How the movie starts out is very light and I got to know the four main characters very well, at least for my tastes. Some will say there is a huge lack of character development and that detracts from enjoying the movie, I related with the characters very well (maybe because I am a young urban professional) and the trendy party atmosphere is something that I have seen in my own life. The back ""love"" story is also something that is welcomed between the two main characters (some may not like it). When the monster hits, you feel the same sense of confusion and what happened? that the characters do, to some (especially New Yorkers) it evokes images of amateur 9/11 videos. The first person adaptation then takes you through an hour and a half thrill ride throughout New York City as the four main characters try to survive, all while making a daring and romantic attempt at saving a damsel in distress. The sense of destruction, violence, disbelief, and fear is as real as it can get, as normal life gets disrupted by something enormous. The acting is perfect. The setting and images of a New York under devastation is also very well done.The Bad: I guess this is one of those you either love or hate movies, one of my friends hated it, most others loved it. The shaking camera might be a turn-off for some, I loved it, it added such an intense sense of realism. The Monster itself was CG, but thats OK. Some might think also its tries too hard to be hip and the guy holding the film gets annoying, I liked everything. Also the movie might be too random for some.The Ugly: Giant Subway Rats, and the Spider Creatures, plus the gruesome death of one of the main characters, and the monster itself was preety ugly resembling a cross of Godzilla, King Kong, and a giant Scorpion, Fly creature.Overall, a breath of fresh air for film making, maybe they will make more of these type of movies, I think it only really works well in intense horror or monster movies probably. I also like the romanticized saving damsel in distress story line from the protagonist. But the strongest quality of this film is the sense of fear and panic the viewer gets, its like you are in the movie suffering and questioning with the characters. No other film has made me feel that way.Supra Score - 8.5/10",Cloverfield
520,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Cloverfield,8,29 January 2013,"Cloverfield is a 2008 POV horror film. Cloverfield starts out by introducing us to some pretty annoying twenty somethings having a going away party for one of their friends. That is when this movie really kicks off as something unknown is attacking the city. The friends then embark on a dangerous trek across the city to save one of their friends. The creature design is truly original and fantastic.The film has some truly tense moments and takes the found footage effect to great lengths.If I had a problem with the film it would be that the characters are a little generic, but that is just a small problem. See this film if you like POV films done right. Skip this if you get sick from the shaky cam. 3.5/4",Cloverfield
521,WizardOfGore,Go See For Yourself - It's Worth It!,8,21 January 2008,"****Possible spoilers in this review**** You know, I honestly do not know what people are looking for in a movie anymore. I also think that some people come on this site and post negative reviews just for some odd sense of self-satisfaction. How can someone say that ""This was the worst movie I ever saw?"" Have they never seen ""Ernest Scared Stupid""? I think that a lot of people say they didn't like it because they didn't like the style it was filmed in. It's not traditional film-making and the story does not unfold with a traditional beginning, middle and end. I also think that today's audiences are expecting Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger to swoop in at the end and take care of the monster.Yes, the camera is shaky, but that is precisely the point!!! Also, as far as the character development is concerned, THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A BUNCH OF VAPID, SELF-ABSORBED TWENTY SOMETHINGS!!! It's very clear to me that most of the people who gave the movie a negative review simply did not get that.I think this is an excellent monster movie with a few flaws, and that everyone should just go see it, as it's definitely worth it. It's just not a ""traditional"" action movie.",Cloverfield
522,Deveousdevil,"A very good movie, portrays disaster very well",10,23 April 2008,"I thought this movie was really good for a number of reasons. First off, the main point of this movie was really to redeem the '90's debacle, ""Godzilla..."", which may very well have been the worst movie in history. Cloverfield does that well. It's the same story, a giant monster terrorizes Manhattan, destroying everything in its path. It is a little different of course. Instead of laying eggs, this monster is covered with venomous fleas, that if bite you, cause you to explode; and the monster itself is a lot cooler and designed better and that adds to the intensity and fear. The entire movie is from the perspective of a few people through a video camera. So there is no music or traditional cinematography. However, that is the best part about the movie. It adds a lot of intensity and makes everything more personal and realistic. So if the mood of the characters changes, so will yours, in a more appealing way without the addition of sad or happy music, or descriptive montages. It really makes you feel like your in the same situation as the people.This movie has some very clear references to the 9/11 attacks. If you've seen as many 9/11 documentaries or video clips as I have, you will easily notice some scenes that were taken directly from those clips, and adapted to the movie. For example, a very well known scene form 9/11, when a bunch of people were hiding in a store while the streets filled with smoke, or the smoke billowing between the buildings and ""chasing"" the people as they try to outrun it.The acting in the movie is very good. The people act just as you would expect them to in a life threatening situation. You never get the feeling that they have rehearsed anything they said. It is played all very naturally and very casually. As if it isn't a movie at all, but as if it is actually happening. A lot of the dialogue seems improvised , which is very good in a movie such as this because you want it to feel as if the characters are actually experiencing what you see on the screen for the first time. This again adds intensity to the movie when you personalize more with the characters and what and how they feel.Although I am sure the writers' and directors' main goal was to make a really good scfi movie filled with cool creepy action, which they succeeded in doing, and making a few symbolic and literal references to 9/11, they were able to achieve a lot more thanks to the acting and cinematography.This is a really good and cool movie, and should be watched at least once.",Cloverfield
523,darlybrito,Blow me away,9,22 January 2008,"Cloverfield was beyond my expectations. I expected it this film to be good, but not really good.The most common thing that fans didn't like is the shaky camera. The camera move quite a bit, but that really didn't bother me. If you have ""motion sickness"" or whatever they call it, DON'T see the movie.What bother me was that the movie was kind of short. Other than that, it was all good.One of the best things that the movie has, is the monster. It's huge, ugly, creepy, and original. I think this monster is totally cooler than Godzilla. The offspring of the monster were cool too. The sound that they make was kind of creepy and suspenseful. *Watch out the tunnel scene*.Now, the story was very controversial. A lot of people thought the movie wasn't really a monster flick. Here is what I think. The movie is about party-goers giving a surprise party to Rob(Michael Stahl-David), who is leaving New York the next day for a vice-president job in Japan. But then, a monster comes out of nowhere and ends up screwing their party. Then the flick focus more on Rob and his friends reaching Beth(Rob's girl), who is trapped in her apartment when the monster hit. But I still thought the monster got good screen time in the movie.Overall, Cloverfield is an entertaining intense thriller that will blow you away.",Cloverfield
524,p_jones92,Pointless and poor,4,16 November 2008,"Wow, talk about a movie not living up to the hype, or even it's own trailer.I can't begin to tell you how disappointed (and sick, more of which later) this whole movie made me feel. Who's fault is that? The studio for all the great hype, the reviewers and critics for falling for it and calling this great? Or for the clear references and rip offs of the 9/11 tragedy that are seen throughout this film? First off, I will mention that I watched this on DVD, and had to watch it in 2 installments. Not because it was bad, but because the whole camera constantly moving around made me feel sick and I had to take a break half way through for fear of throwing up. If you suffer from any form of motion sickness be warned, this will bring it out in you. Making your audience vomit through scares and gross out scenes is good, making them sick because of the way you shoot the movie, NOT good.The idea itself I like, following a group of random people enjoying a party and then suddenly tragedy strikes and we watch it all unfold, as confused as they are, not too sure what it is that is attacking - great idea. Shoot it from a POV - great idea too. However, it's the execution of the idea that this film is poor.The whole guy meets girl, guy loses girl, girl & guy get separated by monster attack, guy try's to save girl from monster attack thing is fine, but the story elements within it are quite cliché.The problem also lies in the POV itself. The point of it is that is supposed to be in the style of a video you might see on YouTube or something, but it doesn't actually look like one, because it's shot in Hi-Def for a start, not a proper everyday camcorder, but also it's directed in a very specific way. Although the camera is POV, it's panning and looking in a very specific way, to show very specific things (be they close ups of hands holding or people faces, or quick look at a monsters leg or something crashing into something). And it's so obvious that it doesn't feel on the fly, or amateurish, as it's actually supposed to be. You're very aware that you're deliberately being shown certain things, which goes against the point of shooting it this way, and stops it being the last video of an amateur camcorder user trying to capture events on camera that the premise of the movie sets it out to be.My biggest gripe though is that, having seen the 9/11 tragedy unfold on TV, as many of us have done, you can clearly tell someone looked at the events of that day, and the many amateur clips seen on TV during that day capturing the attack, and thought they'd do that for this movie. People in NY being caught up in a sudden unexpected attack - check. Amateur footage of the unexpected attack taking place - check. Famous NY land mark being destroyed - check. Clouds of dust chasing stunned NY'ers down the streets as buildings collapse - check. It's so obvious that it's offensive. The producers, writer and director have taken a national tragedy, turned it into a monster movie and used it to make themselves money. I'm disgusted by the clear 9/11 references in this movie.Add in the lack of character depth allowed by the story the way it's told in this instance, it means you quite frankly couldn't give a rats ass about them either. I understand the need for picking a bunch of unknown actors to help tell this story, as we need them to be everyday people, but the acting is very poor, with Hud (the guy holding the camera and from whose POV we view the entire movie) particularly cheesing you off, with his light relief/comedy role within the movie just not working at all.I think this movie was made for 15 year olds, anyone older than that or who actually has a brain will see right through the ""creative"" execution of POV story telling for the bad, rip off, story that this actually is.",Cloverfield
525,conmech,A First of its Kind  Believe it or Not,9,11 July 2008,"I had always thought about a movie where they use Blair Witch handy-cam style shooting combined with high quality CGI. I dreamed of it, they made it. First of all, I love the idea that it was shot over a tape which was shot previously, so we can see from time to time what was in the tape previously. Secondly, it's a great way of shooting a Godzilla-type movie, cause you can see the panic and the chaos from every angle. From the normal people having party, all the way to seeing it above from the helicopter. It really made me feel I'm in that chaotic place and gave me the terror from the first hand. I still can't figure out how they managed to add CGI effects to a moving, zooming and auto-focusing camera. It must have been so hard for them. The only strange part was we never got to see the camera and it was shooting in standard movie quality without a filter. But that must be for the visual quality's sake. It would look so crappy if they used a real camcorder or something. I also like the movies like this one where they set up the place and act in it in a single long shoot, like the masterpiece ""Children of Men"".Something else I wanna say about this movie is, it's a radical one. So you either love it or hate it. Of course some people are going to hate it cause they don't like the style. But they don't have the right to say it's a bad movie just because they don't understand it. It's like someone who doesn't like rap saying Eminem sucks.",Cloverfield
526,thesandfly77,Naysayers Completely Miss The Point,8,1 February 2008,"A couple of things which will help you chart my review:1) I hated the Blair Witch Project2) Did I mention the above?Now, to get the motion sickness issue dealt with: Put yourself in a time of trauma, some disastrous 911-style event and imagine the camera-work you are capable of.Yes, it's all over the place, yes it's frequently difficult to have exact clarity as to what's going on. . . And yes, if it weren't for the above two points this movie would not work at all.As it is, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly.Intense is a word that's used in many reviews here and that fits the bill perfectly. The immersion and sense of place is perfect.Indeed, I suspect - quite strongly - that Cloverfield's style owes a little to the video-gaming FPS (First Person Shooter) genre, BUT do not let that drift your mind towards cheesy cannon-fodder shoot-'em ups, instead think of the much more sophisticated and adult 'Half-Life 2' PC series.This, for those unfamiliar, is a tremendous compliment in that never before has a PC game managed to create such a sense of immersion and suspension of disbelief, and nor has a movie before mirrored that interactive sense of involvement. Half-Life 2 sets the player in an alternative near-future where government dealings with extra-dimensional beings has resulted in the collapse of society and the imposition of a totalitarian regime whilst the cities are infested with all sorts of nasties - and in Cloverfield the smaller parasitical creatures which drop off the monster and scuttle around the streets and subways are a direct lift of Half-life 2's 'antlions'.Indeed, the bleakness of the movie continually drew me to the HL2 gaming experience - there is no saccharine salvation here, just the plain horror of the attack and the ever-perilous dilemma of the characters, into which the viewer is also thrust through the first-person perspective with excitement cranked up after an initial domestic scene that lulls you into a false soap-opera storyline which is cut abruptly and amusingly short with a - literal - bang.Too many complainers are hung up on the camera style. But there's no Cloverfield if there's no shaky cam. It's realism come to town, beautifully executed and completely understandable. In fact, as the film wears on I found myself looking for compromise in the shots, scene to scene, awaiting the inevitable third-person palliative for the groaning masses, the shot out of synch with what's gone before. It never comes, thank god. Honesty and conviction survive and triumph.And the trembling smile of being immersed into this bitterly tense, sci-fi survival horror along with the amiable characters stays on your lips. You UNDERSTAND why you don't see this and that clearly - because if it were you wielding the camera its exactly what you'd shoot, too, no more, no less. A different, brave, and joyful, nail-biting experience that I'm thoroughly glad I indulged in. You'll need a couple of beers to relax after the experience but it's well worth it if you throw yourself into it the way you might not have done since you were a child. It deserves its 8 out of 10. In time, if anyone else is competent and ballsy enough to execute similar styles of storytelling and we develop a genre with a canon of work, you might just look back on this as a 10, a defining moment where all the endless familiarity of the 21st Century's obsession with reality TV, and youTube, and eyewitness documentaries, and warzone reportage and the video gaming subculture came together in a sharp-as-a-tack embodiment of our times and our fascination with apocalyptic self-destruction.My opinion of the Blair Witch Project didn't alter as a result of Cloverfield - they're different enough; BWP a bit gimmicky, with overkill on the camera motion (blah,blah,blah to the 'small-budget' apologists - they still forced it far too much with little respite). But here, the balance is struck beautifully between disorientation and comprehension.Don't miss Cloverfield. You'll be pleased you didn't. FOOTNOTE: As for the motion-sickness fluster - a tip which worked for me: when the camera is in extremis, focus on then CENTRE of the screen - you're not missing anything anyway and as the movement stops you'll find your eyes in direct focus with the camera. Think of yourself running - you don't whip your head side to side; there's always a focus for your brain, a direction to which you aspire. Same here, forget the whipping camera - natural if you were carrying it - and instead keep focused as if you were running INTO the screen. In fact, don't treat this as just a movie; think of it as a bit of a theme-park ride thrown in and treat it accordingly.",Cloverfield
527,abdelgulabkhan,BORING blair witch meets ufos,1,11 January 2009,"The worst film i have seen this year. It takes half an hour to get going. The film starts with a friend with a hand cam and he annoys everyone with it then they are having a party coz a friend is going to japan. Then you get explosions in New York and the head of the statue of liberty flies off. At this point turn the movie off thats the best bit and it just gets boring for the rest of the movie. The friends flee to find another friend in the city and there are lots of explosions and panic. But you see no aliens and no space ships its just all blairwitch style nonsense which was original when it first happened 10 years ago but is now so boring. The acting is poor and the film could be done in 20 minutes, id rather watch paint dry its that rubbish.",Cloverfield
528,jackstarr777,Brilliant,10,2 July 2012,"I'll start off by saying my expectations for this film weren't entirely high. Normally, I hate POV-camera movies. 'The Blair Witch Project' was really disappointing, and 'Paranormal Activity' was just boring. But 'Cloverfield' did what these films didn't. You will honestly stop thinking that professionals made this; after not long you start to honestly think you are there with the characters, seeing what they see. The photography captures everything; the camera-work feels deep, and in one scene, even, in which our heroes are atop a very high ledge, we could swear we are scared of the height too. The film is alive.The writing is very clever and the characterisation is very rich. Every time we lose a hero, we feel it hit home hard. Whatever the characters feel, we also feel. It's very connected.There are some very good tricks in there, too. The style in which the aliens are photographed makes the film all too more exciting and scary. The film feels exhilarating, and I was certainly very pleased.Another point of greatness is the short clips of the other film on the supposed tape. This is a very clever device used by the film-makers to make us want to see more, to identify with the characters, and it works incredibly well.'Cloverfield' was a much better film than I had hoped, and I do recommend it. It's possibly the most effective POV-found-footage film ever made.9.6/10",Cloverfield

530,CompuLOL,"Overrated, pretentious artsy-like project that shouldn't have been greenlighted from the start...",1,21 July 2013,"I get the camera motion and length of the movie. I get the supposedly hyper ""realism"" that they were going for. That doesn't change the fact that this is a gawd awful film. A bad movie with no premise, plot, script, characters, or salvage quality; except the monsters near the end. But by then it's just too late. You'd be annoyed by the forcefully lame camera takes; if not lit sickened. Unrealistic and senseless people that you actually wish were dead 5 min into their appearance. Terrible decision making that even a 5 five old would put to shame. The ""acting"" was a joke. In fact, the monsters are the only reason to not give it a written negative or zero rating; ie, getting it's sole star rating. The whole movie kinda works better like a comedy; if you're willing to tear it apart while watching it with your friends. The only surprisingly and frightful moments were the odd fact that the battery never died out. I kept on wondering; when are they just going to die? Plz gawd, make your heavenly monsters wipe them out of the face of the earth already! These people actually deserve to die. And I was relieved it ended sooner that I expected. This would normally be a bad thing with other movies, even the not so good ones. But in this case; it was gawd sent! Like the Blair Witch Project; which BTW is a masterpiece in comparison of this piece of excrement. This movie, with a lot of tweaking, might have worked in a 2nd rate festival. Not so much for general release. So in conclusion; just watch it if you're a masochist, or for a chuckle on TV; and don't even bothered rented it. You've felt like if you just wasted good money on this silly thing. And since it's so upsetting; I just wanted to warn common folks about the concealment and dangerous deceit this movie poses.

531,BloodStone,"Cloverfield: A thinly veiled soap opera disguised as a ""monster movie""",2,18 January 2008,"Let me get right to the point. This film sucks major AS$!! One hour & 25 minutes of run time & MAYBE 1 minute total of actual footage of the monster. Plain & simple, Cloverfield is nothing more than a soap opera that incidentally has some ambiguous giant monster with a few cheap scares thrown in. And to make matters even worse, the film is done entirely with a hand held digital camera & the inept individual holding it either has had too much caffeine or it's his first time using the damn thing. Because it's all over the place. My seven year old could've done better camera work-WORD!! We actually get more footage of the ground than we do of giant monster mayhem-no lie. And the first 20 minutes of Cloverfield will bore you to tears with vacuous frat party chattering that amounts to nothing more than filler. No explanation of where the beast came from, how it got here, why it is attacking New York... in fact no real ending to the film. Even the critter's progeny aren't given enough air time & they resemble 2nd rate leftovers from ""Starship Troopers"" One other note to pass along; most folks when they are being attacked & gnawed on by let's say a pit bull are not worried about their damn camera. They're interested in just one thing-RUNNING! But not in Cloverfield! Also, most folks I know do NOT want a camera stuck in their face non-stop when they are having a personal crisis/tragedy (but gee they're just so darn tolerant in Cloverfield). So the argument some may use of ""realism"" to defend this rancid turd of a film is laughable. The producers of Cloverfield obviously must have seen the success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and thought to themselves; ""WOW! Hey let's cash in! Except we'll have a giant ambiguous monster instead of a witch legend."" Problem with that is, once word gets out on how rotten this film truly is, they won't even come close to the box office take of TBWP. Warning: If you're prone to motion sickness DO NOT see this film because you WILL be queasy before the credits roll. Bloodstone's recommendation: Save your money & go rent Peter Jackson's King Kong or a cheesy Godzilla film. Both would be vastly more entertaining & you won't even need to take a Dramamine before hand. BloodStone's Rating: 2 out of 10",Cloverfield
532,forpassord,Regret that I watched it( again)...,3,22 October 2019,"I remember that I did not like this movie when I watched it earlier. But I did not remember that it was THIS bad, and I regret that I wasted my time again by watching it again...I can see why the movie contains so little answers about why, what, how and so on as other reviewers are complaining about since this movie obviously is meant to show the experience of what happens the way the characters in the movie experience things there and then, and just theirs. But this could have easily been (partly) solved by making the movie a bit longer by showing more news stories in the beginning. Alternatively the film makers could just have kept the same length of the movie by just using the part of the movie that took place before the ""event"" better.The beginning of the movie is a problem in itself in combination with the rest of the movie: The introduction to the movie took about one minute, and it is not until ca.19 minutes after that things actually starts happening. The end credits starts BEFORE the movie has lasted even 74 minutes. That makes the first 20 uneventful minutes of this more than 1/4 of the movie!!In my opinion both the special effects and the acting was as good as it could get given the premise of this film and what they had to work with. What mostly ruined this movie for me was the terribly exaggerated shaking of the camera: I sometimes during the movie almost wondered if it would be possible to make the camera shake more if they tried to...! I found the dialogue in this movie to not be bad as such. But it was written as if the characters in the movie was less than intelligent, and to a certain point naive and stupid with the consequences that had for the dialogue... Much of the ""acting"" therefore consisted of running in panic while cursing and asking ""what was that""/""did you see that"", and so on repetitively.To sum up: For more than 1/4 of the movie nothing happens, and the rest of the movie for the most part consists of the main characters running around confused while cursing and questioning what happened with barely anything getting answered.",Cloverfield

While watching the film you feel immersed in the action and it really is a good survival guide for disasters, so long as you're single.If reality TV is so cool, then a reality Movie, even though it is fictional and full of breathtaking effects, is a breath of fresh air for Hollywood and I for one think it's one of the coolest takes on Sci Fi in Hollywood's history.Two thumbs up for Cloverfield.",Cloverfield
534,YbsuhA,A thrilling and intense nightmare.,8,22 March 2021,"Cloverfield is a very special and intense nightmare on film. It's an action horror movie with smart decisions.The whole movie is filmed on a video camera by T.J. Miller, and it sure causes sickness after a while. It's not first time it's done. It was done in the 1999 horror movie The Blair Witch Project, and later in the action superhero movie Chronicle in 2012. Especially the last one is a simple comparison to Cloverfield of several reasons. I sometimes mixes them with each other, cause they look pretty alike, but it's easy to see the difference.It's a very exciting movie, and it takes some smart and clever decisions, and it's a thrill to be on this journey. Much of the movie is pretty good. It's kind of a horror movie, but it never gets too scary. That's actually a good thing for me, cause I usually don't like scary movies. I think some movies are scary, even though others might not think that. It depends on what you think is scary. This movie was not that scary to me. It had some creepy moments, but that was it. Besides from that, this movie didn't make me wanna look away, and it was not as scary as I thought it would be.But there's no doubt that the movie is good. It's just clever written, and I love that this movie exist. The movie only lasts for 1 hour and 20 minutes, and that's a perfect length for this movie. The only thing I don't like in this movie is that it causes sickness. I really considered to turn it off a little bit, but I made it all the way through the movie. So I'm glad the movie isn't longer. I also watched the ""sequel"" 10 Cloverfield Lane the day after. And to be honest, that movie is almost better. I suggest you go and check out both of the movies.

It is exactly this nature of movie making that makes me the more bewildered and dumbfounded whenever I witness something that's truly awful. Unfortunately, this movie turn out to be one of them.The whole movie is made from the perspective of a rather loud and dimwitted individual defies all common sense, shakes and bumps his handycam throughout 10 hours of ordeal of his friends trying to survive an apocalyptic event. During the 2 hours sitting, I've been constantly asking myself, why hadn't anyone who participated in the making of this movie tried to ask this one simple question: isn't it more plausible for him to ditch the camera and run for his life? Why on earth did he keep recording instead of offering a helping hand like a normal human being when his friends needed his help the most.Common sense aside, the viewing experience is crude and downright torturing. It is actually physically nauseating. I kept wishing that the cam is just a deploy before the real movie begins. I was wrong. By the end of the movie, which is one of those wtf ending, I felt violently ill.I understand the intention of the director, which is trying to make this movie appear to be as real as possible. It turned out to be a really cheap trick and gets so obvious and old 30 minutes into the movie. How can you convince your audience the experience is real when the very gimmick to draw your audience in totally unreal at the same time. A real person would have put down the damn camera as soon as the hell broke loose. Instead, the guy kept shooting and mouthing and yelling and violently shaking the camera for 2 hours.There're just so many this type of movie out there nowadays. So the director choose to do something different, which is understandable. But he ultimately failed when he decided to put all of his eggs in this one shaky basket. He bet the whole movie on the ""Blair Witch Project"" inspiration. I know the comparison had probably been made by others already. They are not the same. The difference is: it works well for Blair Witch Project, it totally failed for this movie. Blair witch project had a purpose of filming through the handycam.

The point of view, that of the video camera, could be tedious and trite, but great direction by Matt Reeves makes it highly believable, and the varied camera angles throughout the action scenes add a wonderfully unsettled feel to the unfolding drama.

I remember driving home after seeing the film in the cinema once it was already dark out, and looking at the sky and finding it too calm, after seeing the explosions and fires and general mayhem brought about in the film. I think moments like these are what make movies most memorable, which reminds me of being a kid watching Jumanji in the cinema, and on the way home hearing the drums of a nearby circus or fair which instantly led me to think of the Jumanji drums when someone is about to discover the game.Anyway, back on topic, this film isn't perfect, the obvious flaws are the pretty boring, elongated beginning of the movie. The first 20 minutes to me are unbearable, and one reason I love being able to watch the film at home, is that skipping the first 17/18 minutes is a trivial thing to do and very little of the feel of the film is lost. I do think it is important to establish a a ""calm before the storm"" atmosphere in films such as these. A film that nails this perfectly is The Host (2006), which has one of the best introductions to a monster in modern cinema. (In fact there are many similarities between The Host and Cloverfield, and anyone that even partially enjoyed one should check out the other.) Cloverfield, unfortunately, does not do the ""calm before the storm"" very well. The character's are not interesting, their lives are not something I want to witness 20 minutes of when they aren't running for their lives, which is obviously a big flaw in a film that needs you to feel loss when characters are killed.I do not understand the hate towards shaky cam in films that apply it well, and this film applies it well. Unfortunately due to the acting more than anything it doesn't always feel realistic, despite the visuals being stunning and very apocalyptic. I find myself having more issue with the acting, which isn't terrible, as emotional scenes like in the subway, I feel successfully do their job. However some of the throw-away dialogue seems very difficult to listen to, which might be more of a script issue than acting, but the acting to me still feels over the top, but without a better dialogue I guess there's no real way to measure this.I note that some reviews seem to indicate that people take issue with the lack of information of the origins of the creature and other facts and information about what exactly is going on, but I strongly disagree with this point of view. A ""realistic"" shaky cam film that is meant to be from the citizens' point of view shouldn't have facts, because it is unlikely facts would be given if a situation like this ever did arise. As stated in the movie ""by the time you see this video you'll probably know more about this than we do"", which is pretty much exactly as you'd expect, nothing is ever known the minute it happens. I hate to make 9/11 references because every review of this movie has one, but no one knew what was going on as the events of 9/11 happened, all we had was speculation.Finally, I also have a problem with the ending of the film. I don't want to have any spoilers in this review so I will be very vague, but some of the events (if not all of them) are extremely over the top. I'm not sure how it should have ended as trying to think of the film ending earlier than it does would make it way too abrupt and would leave the film very anti-climatic. Perhaps the film would be better if the flying scenes were removed entirely, which would be sad because the visuals are very well done. Also the ""face to face"" scene is over the top for my liking.I look forward to the sequel of this film, I hope they learn from their mistakes and if they do reveal more information about what exactly happened, do it tastefully and not just have a scene with a scientist explaining everything because he's a scientist and therefore knows everything.if you haven't seen this film, do so, it is for the most part a decent film, especially in terms of atmosphere and visuals. If you see this movie at home, don't feel bad about wanting to skip a big chunk of the character introductions, because they are pretty hard to watch.",Cloverfield
546,MrPink08,"Fun, yet questionable",8,8 August 2008,"JJ Abrams kept us in the dark with his film Cloverfield. Now that it's here, it's safe to say it lived up to expectations-and then some. Abrams gives a monster we've never seen before, a camera view we've seen only once before (The Blair Witch Project), and a film we probably won't see for a long time.The film centers on a going away party in honor of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), who is moving to Japan for a job. The party is being thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Jason's girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas). Rob's best friend Hud (TJ Miller, in a role that seems like it was written for Rainn Wilson) is given filming duties for the evening, and we see the night's events from his point of view. Later that night, the party ends early when a huge monster attacks town. What makes this film great is that not only do we have a huge monster, but we have little monsters too. Rob and his friends later go searching in New York for Beth (Odette Yustman), his ex-girlfriend, whom Rob clearly still loves.While the film has its good qualities (The monster(s), the special effects, Hud), it is sadly held back with its few problems. For one thing, it left more questions unanswered than it did answered. Sure that's fun, but this movie just went overboard on the unanswered questions. Another thing, with the exception of Hud, I found the other character quite annoying. And finally, the movie is just way too short.Overall, a great and fun film. Please, please, please, JJ...make a sequel.",Cloverfield
547,DelBongo,Cloverfield,7,13 November 2008,"If you're a misanthrope or a pedant (ideally both, obviously) then prepare to have a field day with this one.A steadily decreasing number of impossibly pretty and wealthy New York twenty-somethings scramble around Manhatten island as it is briskly destroyed both by a gigantic, unseen creature of some kind, and the US military, who are trying to kill it. There's a very rough through-line involving a missing ex-girlfriend, but as far as story goes, thats your lot.The film's premise and plot are all riddled with more holes than you'd find in a very productive tea-bag factory; the central conceit - that the entire movie is composed of home video footage shot by a civilian luddite - is visually and conceptually inconsistent; and if the story's decision to focus on a set of characters who are almost profoundly unlikeable is the injury, then a light smattering of utterly diabolical acting is the insult.But you simply can't argue with populist film-making this effective. The shocks pull no punches and hit home every time, the aura of suspense and expectation is ferocious and beautifully maintained, the effects are outstanding, and at barely 70 minutes minus credits, it is as tight as a duck's sphincter.Love it, hate it, relentlessly rip the pish out of it... just make sure you watch it.",Cloverfield

The beginning is a little slow, but as soon as the chaos hits I found myself at the edge of my seat the whole time to the end. You could actually feel what the characters were feeling throughout the movie. Scared, confused, all of it",Cloverfield
549,NeverAgain85,Godzilla meets The Blair Witch Project,10,15 July 2010,"Wow. This was just absolutely spectacular. Special effects were just amazing from the camcorder style, looked absolutely real. I didn't see it in the theater but i wish i had, I would have loved it even more. The atmosphere itself that just surrounded the whole movie and the emotions of happiness at a going away party that suddenly turn to panic and fear when flying debris from a building thats after being destroyed starts flying thorugh the New York skyline towards our characters on top of a high rise apartment building. It was so good.Im not going to go into great detail about the movie, because it is more about the experience itself of seeing Cloverfield. Our characters are likable, I liked Rob an awful lot, and his other friends that were at his surprise going away party also. The may seem like yuppies, but they're OK. Their journey through Manhattan, from crossing a massive bridge where the monster attacks, from underground subway tunnels filled with creatures to an open street where they encounter a war zone with between the military and the monster, through a mall where they come across a triage of wounded people/soldiers where we find out the monster can in fact release these smaller creatures and when bitten by one of them, one grows inside you and bursts out of your stomach. It may seem like it was ripped from Aliens, and it probably was.Otherwise, as other reviewers may have said, a breath of fresh air through the Blair Witch style. Excellent movie, you should'nt be disappointed",Cloverfield
550,lothd,Quite gripping and much better than I thought,9,17 January 2008,"I live in Thailand and caught the first show today. After all the hype I was pleasantly surprised. The story starts a bit slow, but the monster attack began before I got bored. The shaky camera work puts you in the middle of the action. Other than ""The Blair Witch Project"", to which this has been compared, the characters are sympathetic enough to make the story compelling. There's so much action that the movie seems to be much longer than the actual running time.The monster design is fine, if not completely original, with flailing, spider- or crab-like legs. The ""face"" reminded me a little of Ray Harryhausen's Ymir. The beast has only one clear close-up shot near the end of the movie, but its massive body is glimpsed several times before. It looks very impressive. The small offspring or parasite monsters are barely glimpsed, but they are vicious.No explanation is given about the monster's origin. The camera-bearing protagonists are all killed - no Hollywood ending for this movie.Altogether a solid entertainment with a big potential for sequels. Also one of the best uses of surround sound ever.",Cloverfield
551,Stoli_Raz_N_7,Not even 90 minutes - That is my ONLY complaint!,9,18 January 2008,"When you consider that my single complaint was that the film was not even an hour and a half long, and yet I still have so much to say...That should tell you something. From the opening sequence - a near-black background with pitch-black lettering spelling out ""Property of the U.S. Government Do Not Duplicate"", then in white lettering little official statements about ""designate Cloverfield"" and where the camera was found...It was already exciting. The editing in this film was stupendous!! The action was incredibly realistic, so much so that a suspension of disbelief was entirely unnecessary. I was immediately drawn in, completely immersed in the events, horrified and excited by each new happening and all that threatened to happen next. There was action, horror, comedy, drama, and intense realism all rolled up into basically eighty minutes of film! At the end of the film, many people sat through the credits expecting there to be more, seemingly unsatisfied, as if there had been no resolution...but I disagree. The events in the film did resolve themselves. But from beginning to end, this film was like nothing I had ever experienced in a theater. Blending the first-person-camera concept of the ""Blair Witch Project"" with the Monster in Manhattan ideas from ""King Kong"" and ""Godzilla"" with the harsh-realities-of-love-in-a-war-zone story from...well, pick any war flick from the bunch; this film stands on its own as the first extraordinary action flick of the new year! It was truly amazing! A definite nine star film!",Cloverfield
552,roseybaby63-59-43149,An Excellent Monster Movie,8,11 June 2011,"My only regret is that I didn't see this in the theater. My first view of this was on DVD. I'm sure it looked great on the big screen. That aside, I just love this movie. It's the best monster movie I've seen in a long while. The set up in the beginning, which introduces the characters, isn't too long and drawn out. You learn pretty quickly what the people's relationships are and what they're all doing there. It doesn't take long to get into the action. Once that action gets going, it's nearly continuous. All the actors did a fine job in their respective rolls and I liked the hand held camera. I realize that not everyone likes the look of hand held camera filming. It can be distracting for some people or even dizzying. I like it though. It draws you right into the action and the emotions of the characters. It makes me feel a part of the movie almost. My emotions took a ride right along with the characters'. There was never a chance to be bored. Also, I don't mind not having all the answers. I'm fine with just not knowing how it all started. I knew as much as the characters did. I found the ending fitting. I was quite satisfied at the end of it. The driving force of this movie is the dialog and the characters. I would recommend this movie even though I know people who say negative things (without seeing it). I say, let yourself get swept away and become part of the struggle for survival.",Cloverfield
553,stormlord-2,Better Than Expected,6,5 February 2008,"I must admit that I went to see Cloverfield not expecting to much. The old American city gets trashed has been done quite a lot over the last few years.However I was happily surprised to find myself quite riveted to the screen as events unfolded. However let me say this, Cloverfield has not one shred of originality in it. The old ""Monster attacks city"" has been done countless times in the old Japaneses Godzilla films, and the hand held camera work is a direct rip off of Blair Witch. Non the less the story was very intense, the effects very good with even the CGI monsters looking very real, and all the young actors turned in solid performances. Cloverfield may not be original in any sense of the word but it is a very well made movie from a familiar style of film.6 out of 10",Cloverfield
554,Fielga,Fun throw-back to the monster movies of old,8,30 May 2012,"I will begin by saying that, unfortunately, I'm going to have to agree with the many others who declare a distaste for the camera usage in this film. But in a good enough movie, I can often look past that. This is one of those movies for me.Looking beyond the shaky cam issues, the plot isn't particularly complex, but it is lots of fun. It's a good, old-fashioned action/horror with the special effects of today and the traditional ambiguous ending that these genres are known for, a winning combination for monster movie fanatics.It's a shame that the camera work has ruined an otherwise solid film for so many viewers and I can sympathize with those who experience head aches and/or nausea. But if you are someone who can tolerate the camera, go ahead and give it a try. You might even find yourself not noticing it by the end of the movie.",Cloverfield
555,kirkwuk,"Cloverfield tries to be big, but falls short of the mark",4,28 June 2008,"I hated Cloverfield.Maybe I've watched too many excellent films, but this film has a great concept, but poorly executed. I didn't care about the characters, none of them were even likable. At the party these guys fall out over a girl sleeping with this guy. Somehow this storyline smears the rest of the film like a dirty rag. I guess this is more important than helping the citizens leaving the city with their lives.Out of all the people in the city we follow a bunch of random guys who have their party ruined by various explosions in the city. Then we learn the city is under attack. What is special about the guys we're following? They are just ordinary twenty-somethings getting drunk and talking about who had sex with who. Would picturing it from the view of a hot dog salesman be any worse? I just didn't care about the characters or their Cannibal Holocaust-inspired amateur movies. Why not follow a small family fighting for survival? Why do we need to care about some heartbroken guy? One of the things which is both good and bad is that there is very little focus on the monster. And by that I mean, you will only see the monster once or twice in full view, the rest is obscured by the huge skyscrapers of the city. I like the fact the monster is barely seen. But they could have also added some suggestions as to where the monster came from. Space? Under the ocean? All we know it as is a monster. No more elaboration or subject to think about.The movie really is no more intelligent than Godzilla. Cloverfield yearns to be something new and exciting, and I was disappointed with the full package.Cloverfield is a cross between World Trade Center and Blair Witch. But it is an instantly forgettable movie which proves once again that Hollywood and hype will bring in money.",Cloverfield
556,VincentBauer,Cloverfield: Exciting and Intense,10,19 January 2008,"All right, I waited 6 months to see this god damn movie, and I finally have seen it. All I can say right now is that I liked it.The movie begins with a message displaying that the video belongs to the U.S defense department (not like the one in the trailer), and saying that it was found in Central Park. Then we go to Beth's apartment where we see that her and Rob have just had what I'm going to call ""A great night"" for ironic terms. The day is April 20 something and they plan to go to Coney Island because Beth has never been there.All of a sudden it is cut and we go to Jason (Rob's brother) and his girlfriend Liz going to plan his going away party as Rob has just been accepted for a job in Japan (Great line if you only get the reference).From there they give the camera to Hud (who serves as our comic relief) to film the events in this movie. The whole point of the movie is the characters trying to get to Beth so that they can save her (she's in her apartment bleeding and stuck).As for the writing, I got to say that even though the lines are corny, they really feel like it's real. The actors are good enough that they almost seem to create themselves. The actors do such a great job that I'm convinced at points that most of it is improved.I got to say that the movie is pretty intense. It's not SCARY but it's so intense it will have your heart beating.Now for the part of the review everyone wants to hear. THE MONSTER. Well... yes we do get a look at the monster and it is interesting. I can't really describe it because its so intricate. I do however felt a sense of Deja Vu because I swear I've seen the monster before.A lot of the people who went with me didn't like the movie however, and I can understand why. The hype was way to over. If you haven't seen the movie, and you do plan to see it, I suggest that you lower your expectations, because even my expectations made this movie half as good as it would have been had I just gone in with pessimism. I enjoyed it.Cloverfield 10/10",Cloverfield
557,pastanley,A real disaster,1,22 September 2008,"This is a pointless film because there is no context for what occurs.The camera-work is shoddy. It is meant to be like this but that is no excuse to serve up such an amateurish effort as entertainment.The film is a series of jerky scenes. There is no intelligent conversation. There is no reason for the main characters to do what they do. Nothing is credible. It is more fantasy than science fiction, however fantasy is usually crisply presented with a decent story.What surprises me is how a studio could have allowed this to be produced. There should have been a warning on the cover instead of the false advertising. I am disgusted with the system - is it the same one which allowed cowboys to trash the financial system?",Cloverfield
558,maveric1974,Well made and better than you believe,7,3 October 2009,"I actually liked this even the 2nd time around..Watched it at the movies when it first came out and was blown away by it and definitely needed to be seen on the big screen to experience the devastation and the disaster that they portray..Some really intense scenes, including the one in the tunnel..Sure, we've seen some this in other movies, but this is hyper-realistic, right down to the choice of the shaky-cam (or whatever it is you wanna call it). Personally, I prefer this type of cinematography for this movie as it fits well and adds to the chaos surrounding the characters.So, overall, I liked that you didn't know a lot. Imagine yourself in that scenario and think how you would react and behave? You would know squat, you'd run and if you had a loved one, all rationality would go out through the door and you would try to get to them. Obviously, Clovervield is not trying to be hyper-realistic, so take it as it it is and enjoy the movie as it it's trim, taut and terrific 81 minutes will have you holding your breath and ducking for cover at the destruction taking place on screen. ***1/2 out of *****",Cloverfield
559,quevaal,"Dude, where's my camera?",1,2 November 2011,"This movie was awful. I can't understand why it gets the high rating. First things first, the beginning. Why spend so much time on a boring party? Considering that there's not a lot of intelligent dialogue in the rest of the film it's not like you have to learn much at all about the characters. So, they had sex. Now that's going to matter a lot to Blairzilla. This part could easily have been cut down to three minutes. And in the tunnel, where did these bugs come from? They looked like they'd been hanging around for ages, but apparently they'd just washed up on land and went straight for the tunnels. When Marlena was starting to feel queasy I had hopes that she would become a zombie, but no. Her head just exploded.The only good thing about this film is that they had a really good camera that survived a nuclear explosion.",Cloverfield
560,carolineggordon,Thrilling with a slow start,8,8 June 2008,"It looks like Manhattan is the source of all evil and unspeakable things, on screen and off. I wonder how this feels when you actually live there? This movie starts pretty slowly and you find your mind really wandering during the warm up section but all goes to plan when their world is ripped apart by a god awful beast. It was refreshing to see some ""real"" camera work where the monster itself was shown in fleeting glimpses and for the most part they had very little idea what was going on. It would have been nice to get a little more at the end, but actually nice to be left to wonder how the future panned out and what that thing actually was. The spider like creatures were a masterful piece of horror, who wouldn't shudder and recoil at the site of Labrador sized beauties sticking their fangs in. After the slow start you spend the next 90 minutes on the edge of your seat totally engrossed and grossed out. Great!",Cloverfield

It was seriously Godzilla meets Blair Witch with unbelievable characters (didn't care if they lived or died), the monsters were hardly explored enough to give us reason to care about them, and the script was incredibly lame. I was looking forward to everyone's deaths just so that the movie would end. I guess some of the cgi was impressive but it got lost in the plot holes and ever continuing torture. This movie probably wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't had my hopes up so much by the hype it received. If you want to see Godzilla turns into a Bug, rent Cloverfield, otherwise, go see something worthwhile.",Cloverfield
562,Hawley_Griffin,Cloverfield,6,22 March 2008,"The kaiju genre is one of the best inventions ever dreamed up in Japanese soil. It literally translates as ""strange monster"", and that's exactly what it is, movies centered around the sudden arrival of a giant-sized, spectacularly ugly and scary monster in the middle of Tokyo. Staples of the genre are crumbling buildings, the giant foot of the beast stepping on a poor jap that stumbled while running, mayhem and generally useless military activity. I think the first Asian movie I ever saw was Mothra, which is about a giant butterfly monster invoked by the strange chantings of miniature twin geishas. Of course, the most famous kaiju monster is the reptilian anti-hero Godzilla. On his first movie he's a destroyer of humanity, yet on subsequent films he saves Earth from a gallery of creatures, presumably so he can earn back his title as its main nuclear nightmare. In 1998, there was an unfortunate American version of Godzilla which pretty much was an attempt at Jurassic Park on NYC. The movie featured an unrealistic evacuation of Manhattan. Now that US has been through 9/11, I think they've sort of earned the right to make a Godzilla movie. After all, Godzilla is nothing but a '50s metaphor for nuclear horror.The catch here is the Blair Witch Project gimmick, in which the movie is actually ""found"" home video material from a camera with seemingly unlimited batteries and capacity, in which a group of friends go from late-night partying to kaiju chaos. It's a great catch, actually. Like in Blair Witch, we get to know the protagonists before seeing them in dangerous situations. Our friends here are saying good-bye to Rob, who's trying to return to a relationship with Beth, and the main survivor group is composed of his friend Hub (the one who ""documents"" all the misadventures, a nerdish, annoying, comic relief presence), Marlene, the best character in the movie (it goes without saying she's a wino), and a hot black chick. I can't be arsed to remember her name. They find themselves in the disorder of the (slightly more realistic than in Godzilla '98) Manhattan evacuation, and suddenly decide they're gonna help Rob find her girlfriend Beth, who's trapped and suffocating, somewhere in the island that's being destroyed by a reptile the size of the Empire State. Smart bloody thinking.As you're probably guessing by now, I wasn't too in love with this movie. Its main problem was that, despite the superficial pains they took to make it a ""realistic"" witness home video (the recording over previous Coney Island footage, the date and time, the opening government disclaimer), it played exactly like a by-the-numbers Hollywood movie. Worse, actually. The characters in any teen slasher are more logical than these ones. If some guy loses his nerve and decides that the best course of action (instead of, you know, immediately calling his parents and close relatives) is to run into the danger area looking for some short-breasted chick who's probably dead, I think his mates have a moral obligation to knock him unconscious and save him. I can't believe in characters who are faced with a gigantic lizard and don't want to save themselves. That's not what's being a hero is all about. That's definitively not what a fireman was doing during 9/11. That's being a tool in a poor scriptwriter's mind. And some military guy suddenly decides that their suicidal tendencies are worth encouraging? Come on.Now, technically, this movie is so cool it's a shame it got lost in a bad script. Even if it has been shot in obviously high quality, the constant jerking of the camera (although, gimme a break, this is not seizure-inducing for anyone who has ever watched an '80s videoclip) and the filters made me believe I was watching a first-person account of a giant monster tearing down a city. The way the monster is introduced is clever enough - we see the inmediate consequences of its rampage, and eventually (with a little help from the parasites that climb off him) we get to know it in increasingly irksome detail. But none of this technical (and creative) wonder is any good if the story the filmmakers are telling us has so many logical holes and unrealistic behavior. There are a million plot devices that could realistically set the survivor group apart from military aid and into the claws of the monster. There's no need to turn the protagonists into self-righteous cardboared figures who mumble Garfield jokes (ok, I laughed at that one) while wandering into the unknown. Basically, why do we need a comic relief cameraman? Cloverfield doesn't trust the audience to be smart enough to endure the ""found"" footage without a C-3PO hanging around? So it wants to be realistic, yet everyone is a bloody stereotype? I'll admit it, it's a concept that's easy to explain and sell, but hard to actually film in a realistic manner. I'd say the closest they can come to make a great kaiju in this postmodern style is to combine footage from news and various recording devices into one edited narrative. That way, it wouldn't look so staged and it would offer a bird's eye view of the story with the added ""reality"" element. Of course, that's not what Cloverield, Abrams and company try to do, but I'd recommend a change in priorities. Maybe for the sequel. Who knows?",Cloverfield
563,Jonny-ironica,Better than any other monster-attack film...,10,20 January 2008,"So, I've been seeing previews for this film since late last year and the teaser especially had me wanting to see it. What I'm writing tells a whole lot of the plot, so yes, it's spoiler full. However, this first paragraph has no spoilers, and gives an overall opinion over the film. The movie is shot from a hand-held cam point of view, which we all know has been done, but it gives the film genre a new and interesting take. However, if The Blair Witch Project made you nauseous, I don't think this movie is for you. Other than that, I think the direction is amazing. The special effects are nothing less than spectacular, but it doesn't take away from the film's heart. I gave it a 10/10 rating because no movie is perfect, but this has got to be one of the best efforts I've ever seen. Therefore, it does deserve a 10.The film's first thirty minutes or so establish character development that actually makes you feel for the characters. Rob Hawkins' friends are throwing him a going away party as he's leaving for Japan for his job. It's discovered that he fell in love with his best friend, Beth, and they slept together. However, she brings another man to the party and the tension causes a fight. Beth leaves abruptly, very upset. You also get to know Rob's brother, Jason and his girlfriend Lily. Then you get to know Marlena, a sarcastic girl who has shifty eyes and looks uncomfortable. And of course, you can't forget the guy behind the camera, Hud, who has feelings for Marlena(thus causing her character's development).A tremor, which some very pointedly point out could be another terrorist attack, sends everyone onto the roof where they witness an explosion that sends things flying towards them. They all rush into the street to discover the head of Lady Liberty being hurled down the street and because no movie is complete without sad humor that defines Americans, people start taking pictures of it with their camera phones. That sent me into giggles.Fast-forward.They are then rushed by the military to the bridge leading out of the Island, but while Rob pauses because Beth calls his cell phone, panicked and injured, telling him she can't move and she's bleeding, Rob's brother, Jason goes down when the monster's tail takes a whack at the bridge or something. Marlena, Hud, Rob, and Lily all make it off the bridge where they race to the subway. They all take a moment to grieve when who else but Rob's mother calls. At first at laughed at his ""Hiiii Mooom"" tone, but then it brought tears to my eyes when he had to tell her about his brother, her son.Fast-forward.They decide to take the subway tunnel to Beth's street and try to get to her. Here you hear some of the funniest lines of the movie from Hud and Marlena. They do have a good chemistry together. The tunnel features probably one of the scariest scenes where they are attacked by parasites that came off the giant monster. All in all, they survive with Marlena suffering from a bite and lock themselves in a room. They decide to try the streets again.When they go up to the streets, they are found by soldiers and taken to a tent. Unfortunately, Marlena's bite causes her stomach to expand and explode(which you don't really get to see because as soon as the soldiers discover she's been bitten, they take her behind a tent, but trust me, the shadows are all you need to see; it's still pretty terrifying.Fast forward.Basically, they find Beth alive and remove the metal pipe thing(sorry for not knowing what they're called) from her chest and escape back down the building just in time.Fast forward.They get to the last helicopters fleeing the city before it's bombed. Lily is forced into a helicopter by herself and gets away first, supposedly surviving the movie.Hud, Rob and Beth make it into another helicopter and are watching the monster run from all the things being shot at it. It supposedly goes down in a cloud of smoke and just as Hud is screaming something along the lines of ""Hell yeah! That's what I'm talking about"" the monster reaches up and promptly smacks the crap out of them.The helicopter goes down, but Beth and Hud are uninjured. Rob is still alive, but apparently has a bad injury to his leg. (FYI, this survival is entirely possible, look it up if you don't believe it.) Anyway, the monster comes right in front of them and apparently chews Hud to death before spitting him back out. Rob and Beth grab the camera and flee to a bridge in the park. They document everything that's happened to them just before a bomb or something lands on top of them. The camera gets stuck under some rocks, unable to capture anything, but you hear Rob and Beth exchange their final ""I Love You's"" before supposedly being blown up and dying. However, people are already disputing this because after the credits, you hear someone say ""Help us"" played backwards sounds like ""It's still alive"".My complaints with the movie are far and few between. The movie has some obvious plot points that have been used before. For example, when being attacked in the tunnels by the parasites, Marlena comes back to help Hud by beating one off of him instead of running. Later, this is addressed by Hud who says,""You could've just run, but you didn't."" Clearly, that's generic, but it's completely forgivable in this movie. All in all, I recommend this as long as the camera work doesn't bother you.",Cloverfield

Overall though the answer to that question is yes. Yes there is a set up of 20 minutes or so...doesn't matter guys! It is necessary to gain some connection to the characters, so lets not complain about that.The part where the monster first hits interrupts a conversation between Rob (""Im like your main dude"") and his bro Jason -which, by the way, has very relevant dialogue to set the tone for the rest of the movie, so pay attention.Because, as been mentioned in another review, this is a step up from a monster movie; that is to say, when something terrible is happening, how would you react, what would you do for the ones you love? With the immediate threat, we get answers to these questions from our main characters.To quote a poster at the Rotten Tomato forums ""If life as you know it is ending, the world around you is crumbling, you are probably going to reach out for the ones you love."" I loved this movie, and i hope you reach out for it.OK, too cheesy end to a review, just see this movie! PS: There has been a lot of talk over motion sickness- i was fine with it, however the person i saw it with got a little nauseous, so be careful.",Cloverfield

566,BillK,The Monster Movie: this time it's personal.,9,20 January 2008,"Spielberg got us partway there with War of the Worlds (a huge missed opportunity to outdo the original). These guys -- Abrams and Reeves -- get us all the way there. 'There' is what it might feel like to be in the way of something big and angry and strange in New York city.I rate this movie a 9 because it is nothing if not effective. The unknown actors are credible, the atmosphere is credible, and the scares are credible. All three are hard to sustain, especially considering the premise of this movie. The way we all are blindsided and bewildered by events that jar us -- the way we lack the 'God's eye' perspective usually offered in such films; the way life-altering events seem to come out of nowhere... all are captured in a uniquely powerful way here. Someone called this the first monster movie for the MySpace generation, and I can't argue with that. But I'm way beyond that generation, and I thought this was a breakthrough.

The whole shaky camera, omitting specifics, cutting to other shots at crucial moments just grates me :) It is the easy way out. I wont go into specifics as I am sure there are plenty of other comments that can supply this detail.It is interesting reading the ""train spotters"" comments in the FAQ section. I mean what is the sense in having to slow a scene down frame by frame in super slow mo just to actually work out how a particular character dies??? Even after seeing the footage on you You Tube it is still virtually impossible to tell how the character meets his fate. So why even bother to include this? Also no explanation is given at the beginning of the movie as to why the tape is being played for us, the audience by the defense department.It just starts playing. Seriously??? I guess I have outgrown this kind of movie long ago but I know it will appeal to kids, teenagers and those who refuse to grow up.

569,I_am_Jacks_Revenge,"Good movie, but a bit dizzying",7,21 January 2008,"I would like to say that I wasn't particularly super-hyped to see it. Sure, a movie looks okay, but that doesn't necessarily mean I want to see it. Anyway, my friend talked me into it, and it wasn't too bad.A vague description:So, in New York City, this guy, Rob, is filming in the morning with his friend Beth, who he had slept with the previous night, so it seems. Later on in the movie, a bunch of people are setting up a surprise going-away party for their friend Rob, who's going to Japan. They have the party, but soon Beth comes with a date. It's not Rob. Lily tells Jason, Rob's brother, and Hud, Rob's best friend, that Rob and Beth slept together. Soon the word gets around, thanks to Hud. Beth leaves with her date. All of a sudden, an explosion occurs, taking the power out for a short bit. Just about everyone goes to find out what happened. They realize that it's a monster attacking the city.Continuing on, Marlena, a woman from the party who Hud seems to like, comes from outside where she says she saw the monster eating people. I don't like that thought. The Statue of Liberty's head gets decapitated and lands where our main characters are, of course. What happens next goes throughout the city, where one by one, the people die. One of the people's future is uncertain, because you don't know what happens to them, but that's all I'll tell.What I like about this movie is that it used unknowns in the lead roles, so it seemed more convincing, because why use Will Smith in a movie where he obviously would die when he's not really dead? This movie is sort of like The Blair Witch Project, which I haven't seen. It's all hand-held camera, and it feels like you're part of the movie. However, we know for sure that it's fake--unlike what some people thought about Blair Witch--because it's in New York. HOW MANY TIMES HAS NEW YORK BEEN DESTROYED IN MOVIES??!!! King Kong, Godzilla, Farenheit 9/11......well, the last one had actual footage, and it's a documentary.What I didn't like about this movie was that the movement of the camera was shaking a lot. I felt pretty dizzy, but that also could've been because I ate a granola bar, a piece of pizza, and a bottle of pop. Also, if the setting were in the middle of nowhere, like Blair Witch, it could have been more convincing in my eyes, but New York has just been used too many times, and they should set it somewhere else. Another thing, although it's pretty cliché, I like the 'somebody lives' ending. I have never liked the whole 'Everybody Dies' ending. Even though Cloverfield went against what everyone expects and did well on it, I am a sucker for the ending where there's hopes for our hero(es).Anyway, although I don't recommend it that much, it's an okey-dokey movie for me.",Cloverfield
570,Dillypogo,Cloverfield: Shaky but suspenseful,8,19 August 2008,"Why do movie monsters always seem to go for cities like New York with huge skyscrapers? King Kong, Godzilla and now the monster from Cloverfield. The plot revolves around four people at a going-away party who witness a huge explosion in the distance. They soon find out that a monster is rampaging through the city, destroying everything in its path.The film is shot entirely on a camcorder and poses as actual footage filmed by one of the main characters, just like The Blair Witch Project. Cloverfield does this very effectively, although I found myself thinking ""why the bloody hell is he still filming"" many times. Of course this way of filming leads to the camera shaking A LOT which sounds annoying but it actually helps with the suspense and sometimes hides the monster, adding to the mystery.The special effects in Cloverfield are fantastic and look realistic. When I first heard about this I didn't think they would be that great due to the way it was filmed but when I saw it I was pretty damn satisfied. The film does a good job of hiding the creature from clear view and I would have preferred it if it stayed that way, but there is a scene near the end where you get a very detailed and close up view of it which kind of took away its mysteriousness.The cast give very convincing performances which help with the realism of the movie. With the way it was filmed, strong performances were necessary and this cast certainly doesn't disappoint. The main character, Hud, (T.J. Miller) who holds the camera for most of the film, provides a lot of humour throughout.I found myself getting slightly impatient for things to kick off for the first twenty minutes during which the party is held. I think it just took too long for something interesting to happen such as the monster appearing. Maybe it's just me but I didn't enjoy watching footage in which someone goes around a room filming people. Also, if someone was to walk into that party they would have thought it was a party for the world's top models. Is everyone really that good looking in America? Anyway, Cloverfield is very exciting and the special effects are fantastic. I give it 8/10.",Cloverfield
571,teresaband,Monster Monster!,9,3 February 2008,"So it doesn't quite live up to the hype, but nothing that's had this amount of fan-boy speculation wanked in its general direction could live up to it. The fact that it very nearly does is incredible in itself. Genius marketing campaign aside and taken on its own merits this is thrilling event cinema at its best. Having the entire attack seen from the point of view of a camcorder-wielding everyman is a masterstroke. For the duration of the film you're there at street level among the panic and smoke, only catching glimpses of the threat and thus not being able to quite grasp its anatomy or scale. It causes a palpable sense of terror and it's sustained impressively for most of the run-time, only slipping on the odd occasion when you're shown too much (which is why I'm praying all this talk of a sequel comes to nought).Of course these shaky-cam deals aren't to everyone's taste, and the character-driven realism might not satisfy people who want some fast cuts of fighter jets and slow-mo explosions in their blockbusters, but these people would be missing out on the most visceral thrill-ride to come out of Hollywood in donkey's yonks. A genuinely frightening and unsettling triumph of a movie, so for once you can (almost) believe the hype.",Cloverfield
572,husks,Cloverfield is audacious.,8,30 January 2008,"this review contains spoilers!!!!! - That's a word I certainly didn't think I would be using in conjunction with a movie that I have been sort of dreading, a movie wrapped in a nonsense blanket of mystery marketing. Here's the answer to the mystery: Cloverfield is about a big monster who attacks New York City and the group of annoying, pretty yuppies who have to deal with it while filming it all. That's it. There's no Slusho, no conspiracy, no deeper meaning. There isn't even a reveal of the monster's origins, and it never gets a name. It's actually surprisingly straightforward.That's one of the two big things that writer Drew Goddard and director Matt Reeves got right; the other is the monster mayhem, which is impressive in scale and presentation (if not always logical - the monster's path through Manhattan makes no sense unless he is specifically pursuing our hapless and hated heroes). The monster is revealed in full, but the movie takes its time getting there, which is appreciated - especially since I wasn't completely over the moon about the final shots of the beast, which are pretty much full frontal. The monster works incredibly well in bits and pieces, especially because its anatomy is so strange; trying to figure out how these disparate body parts fit together is kind of much of the fun. And the flashes of the beast - especially its first face shot during a pitched battle with the National Guard - only add to the nightmarish surreality of the film.Sadly, Reeves and Goddard messes other things up. There's not a single character in this film to root for, and it's not because they're meant to be difficult characters to enjoy. They're shallow, vapid, beautiful yuppies, the kind of people who, when they start showing up at your favorite dive bar, signal the end of that establishment as you knew it. The main character, Rob, has a huge apartment on the Lower East Side that boggles the mind; we're talking about a space that costs millions in today's market, or even a couple of years ago, if we're assuming Rob bought it while the neighborhood was still 'up and coming'*. None of this would be that big of a problem - after all, I could just revel in seeing these people in terror and pain - except for the fact the movie is structured in a way that indicates we're supposed to care about these people and their relationships.What pushes the film's narrative forward is the fact that Rob desperately wants to find Beth, a girl he loves but has treated poorly, to save her from the chaos visited on the city. The main characters skip an opportunity to leave Manhattan with the army** to go with Rob on an insane mission to find this girl in a city being torn apart by a massive beast that has risen from the sea and that has little monsters falling off of it, eating people. Watching the movie I found this outrageous - how stupid could these people be? - but talking this point over with Nick I came to a weird realization: I had once done the same thing. On the day that the Twin Towers fell I was home, having overslept. My office was three blocks from the Towers, and my best friend was there - she had actually gone into the city when she saw the first plane hit the Towers because her father worked there. My first reaction was to run as fast as I could to the Brooklyn Bridge to get into Manhattan to try and find my friend. This was a stupid reaction, and a futile reaction, but it was the first one I had, and it was primal and happened without thought. And yet I couldn't buy Rob doing essentially a heightened version of the same thing, and I especially couldn't buy his friends going with him. To me it's a reflection of how little these characters resonated with me - even a reaction that I could identify with from experience feels alien coming from this phony person.I could go on nitpicking Cloverfield, but this is a positive review. The movie is flawed, deeply, but it works while you're sitting there in the theater, and with a movie like this, that's the main goal. I don't know if Cloverfield will hold up to repeat viewings or not but that first time is a blast. The action propels you along fast enough that you barely have time to raise the logical questions while you're watching, and the set pieces are done with style and verve. The movie has no music until the end credits, which have a bombastic, monster movie theme by Michael Giacchino called 'Roar!'; that theme belongs to the bigger picture movie that tells the full story of what happened in New York City that night, but I'm glad that Cloverfield focused on the small moments (well, as small as they get when the monster seems to be specifically chasing the characters in the film). In a lot of ways Cloverfield reminded me of the seminal graphic novel Marvels, which told the history of the Marvel superhero universe through the eyes of the man on the street. That perspective makes a moribund genre like the monster movie suddenly come roaring to life.",Cloverfield
573,my_anywhere,Cloverfield: The Explanation,9,21 January 2008,"I already wrote a review the night I saw this movie, but I need to change what I wrote because I just went through and read a whole bunch of reviews that were complete sh*t. Let me start by saying I have never seen such a huge bunch of weak stomachs in my life. Some of you said a lot of people ran out of the theater sick. Where do you live? Lameville? I sat through this entire movie, as did the rest of the people in the theater I was in, and not a single person left feeling sick at all. If you are running away from a giant monster you are not going to have a steady-cam, so what did you expect? Next, this movie didn't have all the answers because it was shown just as it was supposedly ""recovered"" from the scene of the attack. People experiencing the attack are going to be less bothered about finding answers than they are about getting the hell away from the giant, 300-foot tall monster attacking them. If you want an answer to where it came from, watch the very last scene closely and look behind the characters at the background of the frame, that gives you mondo clue to where the thing came from, so don't say they didn't give you anything. As for no character development? I don't know what movie you were watching, but Cloverfield has ten times more character development than 80% of the movies Hollywood turns out nowadays. What do you think the entire beginning 15 minutes was all about? Oh, and the ""Why are those 15 minutes even there?"" this is supposed to be a real videotape meaning that the characters in the movie didn't go out expecting to videotape a monster attack, they were expecting to videotape a going-away party. Someone else said there was no plot. I'm going to try not to spoil anything, but the plot was that there's a giant monster attacking Manhattan island and 5 people are trying to survive the attack while documenting it. Also, they discover that someone the main character cares about is in trouble, so they go to help her! How is that not a plot? Write a comment when you actually know what you're talking about.",Cloverfield
574,mattwaterhouse,A piece of art,10,3 March 2008,"There are films that take your breath away, and this is most definitely one of them. What could have been just another crappy monster movie is instead a piece of art, with incredible realistic performances from a largely unknown cast. The scriptwriter was clearly at the top of his game, the snappy dialogue keeps the plot moving at a good pace, and the set pieces in the film were genius. Never clearly seeing the monster also gave this film an edge and a sense of enigma. It makes a refreshing change not to have the stock goofy scientist, or any of the other stock monster/disaster movie characters, you find out the information as the characters do, which makes it easier to identify with the characters.J.J.Abrahms made a risky move in shooting this film on hand-held cameras, and thank goodness he did. Contrasting films like the Blair Witch Project, it works brilliantly, and contributes to the success of the movie. The sequence in the subway tunnel for example shows how the camera can build tension and create suspense. That this film works makes me look foreward to Diary Of The Dead, which will be an incredible experience if George A Romero utilises the camera half as well as Cloverfield has. Definitely a must see.",Cloverfield

Well, at least we were inspired to song. But that seems to be the only redeeming quality of this film school experiment (gone bad).In short, the film sucks. It really did seem like we were watching an uninspired film school project. And, it would not get a passing grade. No plot, storyline, or character development -- oh, and no ending or resolution. And even more important -- No MONSTER. When I go to a monster flick I expect to see..a MONSTER. Not suggested with low budget CGI effects, but very clearly realized on the screen -- A MOVIE MONSTER. Instead we get a gimmicky camera effect that has been used many times before (and done better) and guaranteed to make you hurl your popcorn (if you're into that), along with every cinematic cliché since GODZILLA was first realized to BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the 911 TAPES.The awards should really go to the marketing team.

576,Netjer-y-khet,Jaw-dropping garbage,1,8 February 2018,"How on earth this video rates a 7 is beyond comprehension. Maybe the cast and crew voted it up.Absolutely nothing happens in the first 20 minutes. Nothing.The dialog consists of ""Oh, man!"", ""Jesus!"", ""Oh, my god!"", rinse and repeat endlessly.The special effects consist of waving the camera around and dropping it on the floor.The finale is 11 minutes of credits. Really, it's not worth wasting your money on a cheap hire. In fact, it's not even worth stealing. It's just so much rubbish, and perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure to see.",Cloverfield
577,MetalMiike,A Joyride with a Few Kinks in the Track,6,15 July 2009,"More than anything, this film at least proves that showmanship is still alive. The major drawback is that it shows Abrams up to be little more than a modern William Castle, in that, in the light of the viral marketing campaign that preceded the film's release, there is a definite sense of ""design the poster first, make the movie second"". Case in point; with the promotion of Lost, he placed heavy emphasis on the fact that the plot and structure had been carefully mapped out beforehand, with a pile of seemingly random events leading up to a solution that would ultimately make sense. It later emerged that network executives had to pressure the production company into actually retrofitting a structure to it, since there never was one to begin with. In this case, Cloverfield was promoted with a massive viral marketing campaign where dark hints and bizarre clues provided by various websites connected with the movie suggested something far deeper than the film actually delivers. Fans across the internet were filled with wild speculation and they proposed ideas far more interesting than those contained in the finished product. One is ultimately left with the sense that the film makers were fishing for ideas whilst making the film up as they went along. There was anticipation that Godzilla, something out of Lovecraft and a whole menagerie of mythical, biblical and literary entities would be responsible for the devastation of New York. The Slusho website in particular gave fruit to ideas not contained in the finished product and the viewer can't help but feel slightly let down. Having levelled this criticism, one should probably leave all that in the past and review the film on its own. While using the already tired victim-of-disaster-with-a-camcorder technique that went out of fashion ten minutes into the Blair Witch project, the film actually gets away with it for the most part by emulating the Naudet brother's footage from 9/11. This does however get a little daft at times, since one does get the impression that an ordinary citizen wouldn't keep the camera rolling the whole time. This this a especially true during the rather hazardous scene where the main characters are crossing over from the roof of one high-rise building to another that is in a state of partial collapse. However, it works splendidly during many of the action sequences (particularly during a running street battle between the monster and army and a creepy scene in an abandoned subway tunnel) and also allows for the use of a truly unique cinematic gimmick, whereby we are given flashes of the footage originally on the tape being used to capture the attack. Although these brief glimpses feature nothing more than what appears to a trip to Coney Island, they ultimately pay off by giving us clear evidence of the origin of the invader and allow for an ironic twist, in that the victims of the attack had the answers in their hands all the time, but never noticed. Although the film does give you a decent knocking about for two hours and feels like a real roller coaster ride, the human action is vaguely stilted. If we are supposed to care about these characters, there is not much evidence for it. The reason for this is that early attempts at character development during the opening going-away party are so obvious as to be flawed. Also, since a title card establishes that fact that the footage was found in the area where central park used to be, it's pretty obvious from the beginning that our heroes aren't going to make it out alive so one has a natural propensity for keeping them at an (emotional) arm's length. But this is a monster movie so we're not really concerned with the humans, are we? So does the film deliver on its main protagonist? Well, yes and no. On the plus side, early glimpses are too weird and obscure to give us too much information but odd enough to be scary. The downside is that after craning our heads, squinting our eyes and wondering, ""is that a squid? Was that a foot or a head? Could it be a giant vole... etc."" the movie breaks the cardinal rule and shows its Thing full on and in the cold light of day and by God, is it disappointing. It's not the creature design itself (even though it mixes so much contrasting biology as to not really work visually) but the fact that our imaginations were doing so much better when we just caught the odd glimpse. Seen full on, it's far to anthropomorphic to excite chills. It's got two arms, two legs and a tail. Worst still it has eyes, nose and mouth. In other words, its disappointingly recognisable and nowhere near as weird as it should be. I might got so far as to say that it looks a bit silly. I REALLY wanted something big and lumbering and aquatic. What we get is an anorexic man with polio wearing a bat-mask rendered in so-so CGI. This is one of those times when speculative internet fan art is infinitely better than the real thing. So, is Cloverfield any good? Well, actually, yes. Ish. There are some fantastic ideas on display (the parasites the monster carries are far worse than the big guy himself; people keep stopping to take pictures of the latest round of devastation with their iPhones) and there's a lovely, almost cheeky touch where the overture over the end credits pays blatant homage to the Japanese monster movie scores of Akira Ifukube (particularly the Godzilla theme) and one does feel that our heroes have a valid emotional reason for staying in the city while all hell is breaking loose but for all the hype, one feels that it could have been so much more. Basically, it's well worth seeing for the ride but it is a one trick pony and you won't need to see it twice.",Cloverfield
578,LemonyShepard,A revolution in film making. Pure genius.,10,20 January 2008,"I remember way back when, sitting in the third row from an enormous screen with all of my friends, about to watch the midnight showing of an epic movie called Transformers. I remember wanting to skip through all of the stupid and ridiculously pointless previews as to see my favorite Autobots duke it out with the vicious Decepticons in 3D. I also remember a trailer that became more infamous than Transformers itself: the highly mysterious 1-18-08 trailer.Nobody knew anything about it. There was some teenager leaving town and the Statue of Liberty got decapitated bysomething. I remember everyone in my theatre gasping and whispering ""What was that?"" to each other when the trailer ended without a title.So, while Bumblebee was battling Barricade in the all-out brawl of the century, I was pondering one thing: just what was 1-18-08? After only a few days of Transformers being in theatres, the buzz was everywhere of this strange, mysterious movie. What was it? Who was starring in it? Was it going to be all hand-held cameras? However, there was no doubt in everyone's minds: the trailer was brilliant.As opening day for the newly-titled Cloverfield rapidly approached, everyone's thoughts were joined again with one simple question: can the movie live up to the trailer? The answer: No, it didn't live up to the trailer.It surpassed it and never looked back.Cloverfield is as real as it gets, folks. The very beginning of the movie shows a video tape menu of sorts, almost as if the tape was rewinding. Then it shows footage of our main character, Rob, and his girlfriend, Beth. However, the feel-good footage is soon recorded over with our main story, like it was a real video tape.The first ten minutes are simply hilarious, simply because it's undeniably realistic. It's as if you're watching some real footage of a couple of college kids who recorded a party with their camera, only it's on a big screen. You really can't help but laugh.However, the party is soon interrupted by a large earthquake caused by somethingsomething bad. And huge. And terrifying.You never actually see the Cloverfield monster in full until a good twenty minutes into the movie, and even then it's somewhat blurry. That hardly matters, though, because the hand-held camera look makes each and every special effect in this movie look 100% real. So, seeing a large claw/foot/tail/etc is horrifying.The footage (I can't bring myself to call this a movie; it's far too entertaining and real) is shocking, scary, and sometimes disturbingly realistic. You'll be on the edge of your seat so much, not because it's so action packed, but because you feel as if you're watching real people on the screen and you want to root for them.The acting is pretty good, the dialogue obviously phenomenal, making all of the lines seem incredibly modern-day ""what would this teenager say if the monster just killed his friend?"" sorta thing. That just adds to the intensity of the footage.There are so many twists and turns in the movie, so many shocking moments, and so many different encounters with the monster. But what makes this movie stand out from other monster movies is that it focuses on a group of nobodies. It doesn't focus on the military or a nerdy scientist who can defeat the monster. No, it focuses on a group of teenagers who have no clue what's going on. It deals with the fear of the unknown and the chaos surrounding them. The best part of the film is that it doesn't go into any detail as to what the monster is or where it came from. Which is good, because the teens recording the tape wouldn't know anyway. You see what they see.The footage is about 80 minutes (the standard length of an actually video camera cassette tape) and each and every second of it is breathtaking. The monster isn't what scary, it's the intensity of the realism that's scary. Think United 93 (phenomenal movie) with monsters instead of terrorists. That's the gist.Revolutionizing. Not only to the monster genre, but to movies altogether.",Cloverfield

582,french-michaelfrench,This is how not to do it.,2,5 March 2009,"This film really does collect comments way, way above its actual status or significance. Everything that might have made it good has been done before and better. Huge monster? Godzilla right on through the whole series. Things that come out of nowhere for no reason and kill you? Alien; The Thing; Halloween. Characters we don't care about getting what they may or may not deserve? Jaws. Shaky video? Blair Witch. So may I add my pennyworth as to why it collects so many comments? It is missing suspense. We ""know"" from the outset that everyone dies, and there isn't even the trick of a last scene in the chopper saying, ""Don't drop the camera!"" before a receding shot of the chopper's tail-fin. We ""know"" the monster gets killed eventually, cos there's someone around to dig the camera up. We certainly know that these people are supposed to be just average guys caught up in bad stuff, but they don't do anything to make their eventual fate interesting or to suggest that they have any real sense of danger. And in fact we ""know"" that the only source of danger here is monsters. There's nothing else out there in the dark; no other human interaction e.g. someone carjacking them in a panic or any other physical threat. Even scrambling across busted skyscrapers doesn't look dangerous, because the idiot with the camera still has it in his face and is busy filming. Because it is missing suspense we are left looking for plot or explanation. And of course the makers were banking so much on suspense that they left that out completely! And because there is neither suspense nor plot nor explanation we are not willing to suspend our disbelief. The only hook left is, ""that is a really cool monster! I'd pay good money to see a monster like that!"" Sorry, folks, the monster is dreck too. I though CGI was meant to keep a sense of scale, but if you watch the bad camera-work the thing seems to change size worse than Grape Ape used to! In the end the thing looks the size of a block of flats (and that would be about right) so why does it bother to eat one bloke lying around on the ground? And then spit him out? Ah, well, there it is, I think. It wasn't much of a film to start with and then it dispensed with all the things that might have made me forgive it. And I have forgiven worse things in my time! Wiser heads than I have pointed out the things that just can't be believed, but I'm going to give the merit award to the invulnerability of the monster because this is a common Hollywood trait. Humans are actually very, very good at killing things and causing mayhem and damage. Modern warfare is more terrifying and devastating than most of what Hollywood usually shows, which is why A Bridge Too Far can still be shocking. Having a lame monster like this wandering around the place and pretending we can't stiff it in five rounds rapid...that's both sad and a worrying pretence that war is harmless fun for the lads.",Cloverfield
583,Gypsybelle,Intense Moments of Total Fear!,9,19 January 2008,"I totally loved this flick! Sure the video is choppy, but it usually is when shot from a hand-held video cam. This was so realistic, I felt like I was there with the group. Total mayhem like that would happen if this were a real event. I didn't feel the 'motion sickness' many of the reviewers speak of at all. The ending is abrupt and I found myself really wanting more as I left the theater. The next best thing Abrams and Reeves could do is collaborate on a sequel which would be shot in the normal sense for a film - with a more complete storyline which would explain the origins of the creature and its lively deadly 'offlings'...This film is brilliant in all the pre-marketing and even in the choice of filming for this type of perspective. I was totally involved with all the characters. I will definitely watch it again when it comes on DVD.",Cloverfield

Everyone who saw this movie in the cinema either found it very creatively executed or a waste of time. I found it intriguing and engaging.Although at the beginning of the movie, not knowing what to expect, I felt dizzy after a few minutes into the scenes. I had to close my eyes occasionally to keep myself from getting nauseated. Just as I was regretting a little at this technique of story telling then it got all exciting and I forgot all about the swinging and shaking of the camera.It was done pretty well and believable throughout the entire movie. The only thing that I expected more of was the monster itself. I thought it could have looked better.If this had been just another monster movie like Godzilla, War Of The Worlds or King Kong then there wouldn't have been so much hype about it to make it one of the most outstanding creature features for all times.",Cloverfield
585,dermottferry,a film for those with an imagination.......,8,27 June 2008,"Do you like films with realistic story lines where everything is sorted at the end? If you do, then DON'T see Cloverfield. If you like films that take your breath away and have you talking about it for weeks after, then DO see Cloverfield. I, for one, thought that this was one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. It's so easy to get bored with a film and lose interest in it these days. This doesn't happen in Cloverfield (well, after the first twenty minutes anyway).The film is all filmed hand-held. The last time that happened with good results with 'The Blair Witch Project'. It opens with the two main characters Rob and Beth enjoying a fun day. It then skips to a going away party for Rob a few months after. Rob is going to Japan as part of a job promotion. But whats dominating his thoughts that night is the fact that the love of his life Beth is now with somebody else. So while Robs best friend Hud is having people record going away messages for Rob, Rob and Beth are arguing which leads to Beth leaving the party.I know it sounds all very Dawsons Creek, but bear with it. Out of nowhere, the party is interrupted by a bang and the lights go out. Everyone is a little bit shaken up but appear to calm down after the media reports it as a 'small earth quake'. Then the Statue of Liberty's head is knocked down the street and the whole City is faced with something they never thought possible.This is when the adrenaline begins to rise. You will watch Rob's, Beth's, Marlena's and Hud's search for safety as if you were there with them. It's an edge of your seat thrill ride that you wont be able to take your eyes off.In the months leading up to the release of Cloverfield, director JJ Abrahams of 'Lost' fame released many a teaser without giving too much away. What a stroke of genius. It all added to the mystery of the movie and was the perfect way to advertise it.The tag line reads- 'Some Thing has Found Us'- yes it certainly has. A fresh new type of movie that I loved.",Cloverfield

But without it, the film was pretty bland, not as original as some of the die hard fans are hyping it up to be. Im not sure why the ""shaky cam"" effect is considered a sign of brilliance and originality these days, when it's been done before and is mainly a tool for cost reduction, but oh well.Bottom line- if a movie can't stand on it's own merit, then it isn't a very good movie to begin with.

So the hand-held POV isn't wholly original, who cares? It works. And works so well.What is striking about this is it actually ends up being moving. Too many of these films make it (a) easy to spot the order in which characters will die and (b) make you start wishing they would all die horribly. This isn't so predictable. And by the end of this, partly because of the intimacy of the viewer's involvement in the action and partly because this is refreshingly thin on stereotypes, you end up caring about them.A thoroughly good watch, some genuine jump-in-the-seat moments, enough cleverness and allusions for the movie geeks amongst us and just plain enjoyable, which is rare enough in any year.",Cloverfield

OK good so far We have rising action. Wait didn't I just say that?? We have rising action. OK what is the climax? The End. WHATTTTT!!!!! No resolution? Are you kidding me??? You mean this movie ends prematurely and leaves the audiences thinking ""wtf""? Yes...all the movie is is one big WTFNothing is explained at all...not anything...not in the whole entirety of this debacle of a film.----------------------------------------------I have another comment now so im editing this.---------------------------------------------I think every Cloverfield fanatic i have heard thus far has said something on the order of ""there's not info about the monster because of the viewpoint the film is shot from"" or ""its a personal video...what do you expect"". People these are limitations the movie IMPOSES ON ITSELF. The material quoted above is more or less excuses as to why the movie couldn't possibly suck (which it does in my opinion). Don't get me wrong i enjoyed my time at the theater but shortly after i realized there really wasn't anything special about this movie at all. I gave it four stars for being a great action film but nothing more. I guess it can't be anything more. And the character development....man o man. It couldn't happen. There was the party scene at the beginning where everyone is first shown (exposition) but there's no actual character development going on then. The rest of the movie, of course, is hogged by the monster. Any appreciable character development could not happen. The whole movie long we are wholely concentrated on finding out just what the heck that monster is and how it became...making it impossible to care about the characters...so the monster is a mega hindrance to the film. Stop accepting this film as greatness just because its as good as it was allowed to be",Cloverfield

But it's absolutely an OK flick.Great effects and an extremely cool apocalyptic atmosphere. Definitely worth a watch.Hand-held camera can be tiring, yes - but in this case, and combined with the great effects, it works.The plot itself isn't exactly news, but as it's all seen from the antagonists point of view and with no further explanation, you really get that ""what would I have done""-feeling.Yes, we need explanations, but I really like that Abrams hasn't tried to tag on an ending explaining what happened.",Cloverfield
590,kanerazor,Tremendous thrills!,9,15 January 2008,"Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone's shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don't think that's a bad thing. What matters is who's in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it.Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me (there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare). Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster.What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over. Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people, but on the other hand I think that's better than a film wearing out its welcome. Great job J.J. Abrams and company!",Cloverfield

This movie's liberal use of hand held camera was probably the reason for my sickness. I didn't get any kind of similar reaction from The Blair Witch project at all. Anyway, the movie was good as far as the quality of the acting and the other budget related technical details. It was definitely a switch from the usual mega budget comic book character meets the silver screen, which I applaud. I'm not a comic book fan to begin with, but I am definitely sick and tired of all those types of movies. The premise has been well outlined by others, but basically this is Godzilla attacks New York filmed by hand held camera.

This was a masterpiece it was original and captivating The first person amateur video unlike blair witch made the movie I cant remember the last time i was at the theatre and more intranced in a film. the acting was incredible i felt that i knew every character personally and i felt like i was running the streets of new york with them i thought the imagery was perfect they showed just enough they gave just enough info which was none at all and even though i may be one of the few i thought the ending was perfect. I also want to urge everyone who is on the fence of seeing this film GO see it before its outta theatres because this film offers a theatrical experience that i don't think you will get from a rental at least not to the same degree.,Cloverfield
593,tasev1,Be careful when you see this,2,23 January 2008,"At my local cinema there have been A LOT of people complaining about this movie - the method of photography tends to make many people sick and nauseous. I fly aircraft in turbulence without seeing anything out my window, and I don't get sick. This film I COULD NOT HANDLE. I barely made it to the halfway point before I left.Now, I don't mind the idea of the perspective, but there is an excess of camera movement and lack of focus to make the film anything but enjoyable. I think the movie would have been quite fine if they still did it from the perspective of the people on the run, with camcorder cut-scenes stuck in for good measure, but would have still provided the box office numbers.

However, the mode of story telling was really unique and Kudos to the makers of the film. Also the actors did a really good job, not something you generally notice in a film of this nature.I really is Blair Witch meets Godzilla (Japanese version too). But in the best way possible. The camera work, like Blair Witch, was likely to cause some Nausea, but was cool cause it really felt like the perspective of someone right in the middle of everything going' down. Plus the character Hud, who spent 99 percent of the movie behind the ""documenting"" camera was probably my favorite character.We watched the DVD extras after the movie too; alternate endings were a waste of time but the ""I Saw It! It's Alive! It's Huge!"" feature is about the making and design of the monster and added a really unique perspective to the monster which of course anyone in the midst of a monster Attack on Manhattan would never even consider, nor would it matter but it makes the watcher (like it's designers) consider the creature more sensitively.If you enjoy Godzilla and other oldie creature movies, and not just for the Cheese, I suggest Cloverfield.",Cloverfield
597,acts2120,"Not a movie, per se",8,5 February 2008,"I can't say I liked this, as a movie. It didn't feel like a movie, which was probably the point. I certainly didn't look like a movie, which didn't bother me. It didn't develop like a movie, or begin or end like a movie, or ""work"" like a movie - unless it was a movie done by 7th graders w/ mom's cheap camera... I didn't get 'attached' to the characters, and I thought their decisions were idiotic - and at the same time, perfectly rational. And that is why this ""movie"" worked for me.It didn't pretend to be a ""movie,"" - it was erratic, poorly lit, poorly shot, and - my favorite aspect - absolutely, brilliantly acted.These people were so unbelievable real.There were aspects which I thought were 100% realistic, like their behavior and reactions in the subway (other than the fact that they were insane to go into the subway in the first place...). I was so very, very ""with them"" in the subway! But that was why I didn't think of this as a movie. A movie makes you think, makes you feel, makes you connect (or hopes to). This had no such goals - and yet, I found myself responding to the events along with the characters.I should think that generation-X which (according to marketers is all about 'experience') will ADORE this movie - nothing to think about, nothing to connect to... but lots and lots of reactive emotion.",Cloverfield

Well, maybe not but they don't lead you to believe anything else because at the beginning it said the government found the camera. SOUNDS LIKE THEY ALL DIED!!!! the party scene at the beginning was way too long, and I had no clue what was going on because it was so dark. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 was because of the actors. They were good in their roles, playing the scared and freaked out part. Also the monster wasn't too bad.

I was very disappointed with this movie and I wish I could get my money back!!!!!",Cloverfield
600,movieman430,Different in a good and bad way. Satisfyingly unsatisfying.,6,19 January 2008,"Cloverfield... Okay. This movie is two things. The first is a ripping success, the second is a near cinematic scam that doesn't exactly deliver anything in any great amount, accept vomit if you suffer from motion sickness. Cloverfield benefited from the best marketing campaign since Blair Witch. They based it on one question: What the hell is the damn thing? Now before you go to see Cloverfield, I'm going to hit you with some logic that might deter you or might fascinate you. First of all, if you expect answers, this movie is anything but up your alley, you just need to go with it. Secondly, when they say it's comprised of hand held footage, they weren't lying. The movie is constantly shot at odd angles, the film jumps certain segments, occasionally flashing back to a month prior, a day that the tape is recording over. There is also no soundtrack to the film, it's all just eerie sounds and all that jazz. For those of you who have seen Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, probably not many of you, this is not the same. The camera movements in Behind the Mask jostle just enough for you to believe it's hand held but don't overpower the images on the screen. In Cloverfield, half the magic, probably more than half, is how poorly the movie is shot. Is it effect at time? Definitely. Is it gimmicky? You bet your ass. The monster scenes are effective but too meager; J.J. Abrams said ""You will see it."" in response to whether this would be like Blair Witch. He probably should have said, ""You will see it, once or twice. And a handful of times really out of focus."" Another thing, for a movie that is really 75 minutes long, the exposition of the movie is far too long. Now there are moments of truly effective suspense and horror, the monster effects are good and the city in ruins looks pretty good to. Some people like to draw parallels to the terrorist attacks, there are one or two similar things, all drawn from the fact it's New York. Yes, it does suck that New York is constantly picked on, but you've got to expect that, its more effective to see the Chrysler building fall apart than some random building in Dallas. Okay, for those who don't want any spoilers, skip the next paragraph.Okay, if you're reading this you should have already seen the movie. Now, here are a few of my problems with the film. The movie fails to live up to it's potential. The shedding of spiders, is so freaking cool and yet they are only in three scenes... Okay. Design of the monster is cool but we never really see the whole thing clearly, we see it's face a brief profile, I kinda want more. This movie would have benefited from a longer running time, and an R rating. Like Marlene's stomach exploding was cool and gross, but probably should have been followed up fifteen minutes later by actually seeing something. Another thing, one of the big advantages to the hand held camera is that it almost brings reality to a completely ridiculous situation. Now, in a realistic world, don't you think one or two people might be dropping the F bomb, no, I think everyone would be dropping them right an left. But okay. Now, the ending. Does it suck, yeah, but could it have ended any differently, no. The movie's ending is redeemed by two things. One, in the ending sequence with them at Coney Island, you can clearly see the monster in the water. That's cool. Secondly, if you sat through the credits and listened really, really, really friggen carefully you heard something. Then if you're a douche bag like me, you drove home debating what it was and then looked it up. The following words are uttered in deep static. ""Help us. It's still alive."" That's pretty damn cool. Will there be a sequel? Maybe. If there is I hope it will not attempt to pull of the hand held thing again.Okay we're back. In the end, Cloverfield is a standard monster film that uses the home camera gimmick to build mystique and be a little different. Personally, I think with such a great concept and creature design, it might have been able to pull of the standard monster film angle. But it decided to be different. Okay. It's defining quality is also it's biggest fault. How many times will I watch it... Maybe once more. I'd suggest you see it, and then decide for yourself.",Cloverfield
601,olinlittlejohn,A Unique Thrill,8,7 May 2021,"Let's start off with the obvious: the films use of perspective. The choice of having the camcorder camera is very effective in immersing the audience into the story as one going through the events taking place, and consequently adds emotional weight and investment to the characters and events going on. The acting in this movie, particularly the character Rob, is top notch and really comes off genuine.The movie is also suspenseful and thrilling with small doses of humor and character moments throughout.

602,thebackofmyhouse,Doesn't Live Up To The Hype,6,17 January 2008,"Cloverfield doesn't live up to the hype. They clearly had a sequel in mind when they made this movie. At the end of the movie, I went ""That's it?"".It's a love story with the monster as a sideshow. Yes you get to see the monster, but it doesn't even touch on what the monster is, where did it come from, why is it attacking Manhattan, etc. I didn't go to see the movie just to see a monster being hit by missiles, but that's what the movie really is. Who cares about the love story, I want the monster to be the star of the movie, not a bunch of yuppies with relationship problems. I have nothing against sequels but at least make the first movie a complete movie, and not just a jumping point for the real movie. And the camcorder style thing, was okay, it didn't bother me that much, but I prefer normal traditional camera style.A real disappointment. Not worth my 10 bucks.",Cloverfield
603,marioonline,For you guys with a free evening: this movie is a 'go',8,28 October 2008,"I watched Cloverfield with a big, big delay with respect to its premiere. I was sort of turned off by all the very geeky hype surrounding this movie: nerds commenting on the trailer frame by frame, wasting their time on the Internet browsing through ""secret"" websites with mysterious numbers and code-names... moreover, ""Lost"" getting boring as hell shed a dim light on the whole J.J.Abrams world: did he lose his magic touch?, what if this is another invisible nonsense monster terrifying people on an island (in this case: Manhattan)? All these doubts prevented me from going to a theater, and so I only rented ""Cloverfield"" on a particularly dull evening. The movie? Not dull at all! The steady-cam technique gives a sense of reality and not, like in previous attempts, nausea. Never over the top, very effective special effects ensure more than a chill. Finally the nice unexpected gem: the acting. The young and not very famous cast delivered a very solid performance: we never had the hysterically screaming crowd on screen (and with a monster movie this is a strong temptation), but instead constantly tense and utterly believable drama. Bravo! The ultimate test for an excellent monster movie? When your friends who hate sci-fi tell you that the movie wasn't bad at all. Definitely a go on your home theater.",Cloverfield

This was done so badly that I may not see anything else from JJ, ever! Any first semester student could have done better on the graphics(CG)that they loosely call a creature here. I really didn't mind the low/no-budget, home-video filming style that was used, but even Blair Witch was done with more style and suspense...lol.It frightens me to think of him doing a Star Trek film after such a bad outing but I guess I will have to wait for that to hit video now too. I was interested in going to see it but with how poorly this was done I certainly will not.For all that liked this, everyone is entitled to an opinion and rightly so.

605,bkimbrell0,Cloverfield (2008),8,13 December 2008,"Cloverfield is not bad at all. In fact, it's great! I don't think I let my eyes off the screen once during the entire film. That brilliant opening set the tone for the entire film amazingly, and right from that moment I was hooked. If I were to rate it based simply on the level of involvement it requires by the audience, it would be a 10. I can't give the overall film a 10, because there were those occasional out-of-place lines and shaky acting. But the style is nearly perfect; the film feels like a low-budget film because that is what it is supposed to feel like. Not to mention, I was truly terrified in many parts of this film.I loved how intricate this film feels, like there's an entire backstory to the events that unfolded in the film; I am not only speaking of the origins of Cloverfield, which we get a little tease about right at the end on the Ferris Wheel, but also the backstory behind Robert and Elizabeth. The brief flashbacks were generally effective, although I think maybe they had one or two too many of them; one little detail I loved that wasn't really a flashback, but did reach back to the beginning of the film and bookend it wonderfully, was the use of the time 6:42A.M.. Wonderful little detail.Also, my favorite moment by far was the moment Rob tells his mother that Jason is dead; you never, ever hear the reaction his mother gives; instead, this film lets the audience member use their imagination as to what her reaction sounds like. There are various moments in the film where the director easily could have fed the audience every little detail, but instead decides to allow the audience to think for themselves, and this film is ultimately all the more brilliant for it.Cloverfield - 8/10, I appreciated and enjoyed it very much, and it will probably end up in my top 10 of this year.",Cloverfield
606,sinsro,Sci-fi Blairwich project,5,25 January 2008,"A big monster attacks New York, and some guy runs around with a camcorder and films what is going on from the perspective of average Joe. No heroes, no plot, no point. Just confusion until the recording ends at some random point in the event, leaving no answers to what really happened.The movie got high ratings because its new and unique presentation, you have a sensation of being there like an insignificant individual who is tossed around as a victim to events that are not clearly understood at any point in the movie. Its basically like looking at some war footage from a civilian who is randomly running around in a war zone, trying to survive. This gives the old fashioned Godzilla kind of movie an amount of realism that is unusual and fresh.But, its just not enough to make the movie a rewarding experience. Its a freak show of a movie, doing something a bit unusual, sure, but its like eating a cactus just to do something new when having dinner. Yes, different, but maybe its a reason no one did it before...To build a foundation of realism, the first part of the movie is only showing the camcorder guy walking around in some regular party, talking to random people. To give you the feeling that this is real. And surely enough, it could have been recorded at any boring party you have ever been to. And, this is just where the movie fails to entertain. Its like watching your relatives endless vacation photos.When things finally do happen, at the point where you are about to leave the theater out of boredom, the camera is mostly waving around like crazy while the recorder is running around in panic, making you want to throw up from motion sickness.Although I can appreciate them trying to do something different, to make you feel like you are really there to experience this, it just ends up like a blur of noise and messy clips.The whole point of the movie is obviously to recreate the kind of confusion and panic an individual would experience during such an unlikely attack, however, this fact also leaves you with some kind of unsatisfied taste in your mouth as watching the movie will not put your curiosity at rest. In fact, you can just watch the trailer, its the whole movie right there, you wont get anything more from seeing the whole thing. Just more of the same, but you can just watch the trailer in a loop until you get tired of it, and there you go. Saved you some money...Rent a video game instead, like Half Life 2 Orange box, it is a better way to experience monsters attacking as if you were there yourself...",Cloverfield
607,DigitalPhreaker,You'll Either Love it or Hate It - I Loved It,8,18 January 2008,"NO SPOILERS! I just got back from the midnight screening and I have to tell you how awesome I thought Cloverfield was. It is not surprising to see how many people are already bashing this movie. What is surprising though is why they are. People keep on complaining about the camera work and the way the movie ends. Let me ask those people this: What did you expect? It was pretty clear since the beginning that this movie was being filmed on a Handy-cam. So why expect still shots and Academy Award winning cinematography? I think the reason why people are giving this so much crap is because they were annoyed by all the buzz and just decided to lash out against the movie itself. I'm not saying that's the case with all of you guys, but I know there are those people out there that are like that.If you haven't seen the movie yet, let me just give you some tips before you do. Don't go in expecting a typical monster movie with a beginning, middle, and end. Abrams and Reeves set out to redefine the monster movie genre and that is exactly what they do. They made this movie very unique, managing to stay away from a lot of the pitfalls and clichés that always manage to sneak into the other monster flicks.I may just be the only person who enjoyed the camera work. Seeing it from the point of view of the people who went through it made it even more incredible and realistic. I hardly get scarred or jump in a movie, but this one definitely will cause a few jumps! However, if the whole shaky camera thing is not your cup of tea, then you have been warned (although you don't really need a warning). I did not find it distracting or nauseating like some people will say (overreacting of course), but I can understand how there are those of you out there who will not like it.Secondly, be prepared to find that there is actually a human element involved in this film. The characters are so realistic it's hard to remember that they are just actors; they do such a great job of keeping the film going when they aren't running for their lives. Basically, the main character Rob is trying to find the girl he loves throughout this entire attack, going against the common sense of getting the hell out of there! And lastly, do not expect to have all your questions answered. I'm gonna try and not spoil anything here so I'll just say this: whatever the hell that monster is or where it came from is up in the air at this point.Some of you may not like the ending. I found it fitting and strangely satisfying. Although, why people think there will be a sequel is beyond me.Cloverfield is a very entertaining movie that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat most of the time and has a surprising amount of humor from cameraman Hud. The graphics are very well done, the monsters are refreshingly new and original, and overall the film kept me entertained. IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE, but if this sounds like something you will like then see it! 8/10",Cloverfield
608,kidhasaces,"Good , solid, different ,excellent not quite.",7,21 January 2008,"A few weeks ago I didn't know much about this movie so I had little expectations, but a friend of mine wanted to go see it so I came here to see what people had to say. After reading a lot of comments I felt that this was a can't miss movie. So my expectations were turned from not much to anticipating this movie.All in all this movie was indeed solid, it had a lot of the same type stories that you can compare to other movies but with a different take on the presentation. The story was decent, it did however lack details but I think that if you think of it as a first person experience you wouldn't have all of the details either.The camera shaking was good for most of the movie, except some parts was making me dizzy and had to turn away if not I was going to be sick.If you get a chance give this movie a try, it is a short movie and the pace was good the entire way.My take this is a different movie in a lot of ways and if you sit down and think about it most people will enjoy it, but it isn't worth a 9 or 10.",Cloverfield

One Of My Favourites.",8,23 July 2011,"Done in the same style as breakout 90's hit, ""The Blair Witch Project"" and directed by the creator of ""Lost"", Cloverfield may seem like a risky proposition. But you can be assured that this one is worth any time or money you invest in it.I'm not such a big fan of the mockumentary style, that is quickly becoming common-place in the horror genre, but no film before has handled the style like Cloverfield. The camera style is not only used to create a more realistic feeling, but is also strategically used to build up tension and scares.The characters and special effects are top-notch and the non-existent storyline only makes things scarier. We never truly discovered the truth of what that ""thing"" was and personally I hope we never do.My motto for horror is, ""The less you know, or the less sense it makes, the scarier it is."" No film has carried that philosophy better than Cloverfield. 8/10",Cloverfield
610,DaleP1979,"Im Sorry..... but, I Hated It!!!",4,21 January 2008,"(((Parts might contain Spoilers)))I will be honest, I didn't really want to see this movie in the first place...... but my wife and some of her family did, so I went along.The first 20 minutes or so of the movie were so slow, it was hard to sit still. Then it picks up for a little bit when the Monster attacks. Then it just ends, and you don't know what ever happened.My problem is that, I hated the shaky camera gimmick!!! Granted, it did make me a little dizzy.... but more than that, I just didn't like the way it worked in this movie. You did kind of feel like you were really there,.. but I would have traded that for the chance to actually see what was going on, or actually see the Monster. Another problem for me was that there was no character development. I really didn't know any more about the characters at the end of the movie than I did at the beginning,... and as a result..... didn't really care about what happened to them. ALSO.... the guy ""filming"" all of this, and doing a lot of talking.... think his name was Chud. He was the most annoying character ever. And hearing him talk constantly through the whole movie was painful!!! After all his screaming and stupidity, the best part of the movie was him finally dieing.The characters were bland and boring; the story was very weak... and not much to it; the Monster and the little creatures from it, were lame and fake looking... from what little you see clearly;..... The only good part was the effects of the destruction of NYC.We went to a late Sunday night showing, so there were only maybe 40 people there. By halfway through, I had counted about 9 people who got up and left. Before it was over, I would say maybe another 4 or five left. Which I have never seen that many people leave one movie. After it ""ends"", there was nothing but silence. Finally you could hear people complaining, and a couple boo's. Although there were a few who liked it.It is up to you, if you want to go see it. But if you must, try to wait for DVD.",Cloverfield
611,alisoncolegrooveq,"Beverly Hills 902 9:11 meets Godzilla Crab Witch, via a pointless Lost plot",2,18 January 2008,"Most of the audience in the screening I attended with my wife (we're both ardent horror and sci-fi film fans) giggled (i was too stunned by how bad it was to laugh) whilst the 19yr (ish) kid 3 seats down kept gasping 'oh my god' sitting on the edge of his seat.I pity that kid and how easily entertained his generation is by smoke and mirrors that only lead to yet more smoke and mirrors (incidentally, like Shaymalan before him, producer JJ Abrams seems stuck using this tedious trick) Cloverfield spectacularly fails its very own premise : a monster movie shot in a faux documentary style(and you would have to be pretty willfully stupid to not see how obviously it feeds on 9/11 fear using incredibly similar angles as the TV footage we all saw that day).Here's the problem - to be real, you must commit. But we are presented with a cast of one dimensional cyborg 'beautiful young things' who are all impossibly perfect and all just so 'cool' hanging out together like they've all just stepped out of a alcohol ad. Their dialog feels empty, trite and fake and directly at odds with the direction of the film. OK so this is real? Why are these people just like the bad actors we see in so many other movies? We care about people with imperfections, we immediately want to see clichés like this die as soon as possible. (something Starship Troopers understood perfectly). Yes real life is mundane, but its not nearly THIS mundane or plastic.We are fairly successfully teased by snatches of the monster when it arrives, but why it seems to be selectively picking on certain bridges and buildings, much less why it seems to confine itself all night and in the relatively small area of Manhattan seems not so much a mystery but just an embarrassing void of sense we're not meant to notice because of the unfolding 'terror'. Sadly the film is riddled with silliness that just sucks the air out of any potential for true terror or fear. Electricity seems to magically continue working where it shouldn't, digital cameras are now stronger than the tanks being squashed...the 'realistic' camera shaking neatly settles down for the corny 'hero saves girl' scene in the toppling building 'set'. The monster, despite the fact we can clearly now see it's scale and position, seems able to reach much higher into the sky to knock a helicopter down.OK so you think that's just me being picky? Here's a reminder..remember we're being presented this as a 'hyperreal' account, thats the extra big SCARE right? How can you hope to do that when you are trapped by Hollywood contrivance and cheese...the answer is you cant.In some ways the film is bold, there is no music. But even here there are problems...we get Hollywood style sound design and effects. So again, it's raw but utterly pretentious.Some of the CGI is quite skillful, some looks downright phony. But in the end, unless you are easily amused (and many are) you feel the film is a conceit that just didn't work. You feel cheated the way many Lost fans (and before this i had NO opinion on the projects of Abrams) seemed to when the box within a box trick just became boring.There is some suspense created in the tunnel scenes (which felt uncomfortably loaned from some other film) but overall this is neither a scary or effective film.Since reading some of the reviews here though, i have realised the film's true capacity for terror : you can actually fool a lot of the people a lot of the time with the most paper thin ideas by simply remixing genres and techniques. When the smoke and mirrors clear up, we are not left with a classic of any genre, just a blancmange of cheap tricks we've seen before in different and more effective incarnations.There's nothing in the box, just more boxes.",Cloverfield
612,JustStone,Motion sickness with a twist,7,8 April 2010,"After coming out from seeing this movie me and a friend had a small debate about whether there would ever be a newly invented stylized genre of film, and if not will films always be pigeonholed in the same exhausted genres we constantly see rehashed now? I kept asking myself ""in a hundred years will audiences still be watching updated versions on the same old concepts?"" I was always taught, ""don't mess with genre"" and in today's market this regrettably holds true....Obviously Cloverfield is a ""updated version"" in a classic film genre; the monster movie. Also obvious is how this bothers me, mostly because of the hype that was built around this film, or rather the viral marketing campaign that sent fanboys everywhere racing to their online message boards in nerdy excitement. Producer J.J Abrams sent the Internet in a tizzy (yeah I said tizzy) with clever viral marketing tactics, never hinting on what the film was actually about until the ominous teaser poster with a decapitated Statue of Liberty entitled ""1.18.08."" With this much mystery-laden buildup a big payoff was certainly expected, yet behind all of this hype was just another variation of yes, a monster movie. Now at this point you're either thinking I'm being cynical or I just have high expectations, but you'd be right because yeah, I am and I do.See I was really rooting Cloverfield wouldn't just be another monster movie, that it be more clever, something no one has ever seen before. But maybe I'm just gonna have to just accept the fact that genre films will live a lot longer than I ever will and I should just get over it.... but not today friend, because, in fact, there really wasn't anything clever about this film at all, its basically Godzilla meets Blair Witch Project. The convention of telling the story in first person perspective through a shaky consumer camera was built for and attends to the iGeneration, and although commendable is still a cheap trick. However (and this is big however) under the guise of this marketing ploy, there is a really good film. The way the film's writer Drew Goddard establishes the lead characters in the first act is really involving, and I did actually kinda care for their outcome when the monster (eventually) attacks Manhattan.As good as the movie's cinema verite style is there is still a lot of questionable motivation throughout the film (They all go back to where the monster is, really?) and you also really have to use your suspension of disbelief to believe some of the um, logistics (the handicam has night vision, a built in light, can record over an hour and a half of footage, and can survive a 100 foot drop?) But forgoing all my negativity (as you should), this film ultimately achieves its goal of allowing the audience to experience first hand what the characters are experiencing. And even if it's in a hackneyed monster movie genre, as a native New Yorker I was at the edge of my seat, eating up every second of it, call me cliché.",Cloverfield
613,spacechick2003,Cloverfield - Beware big scary monsters!,7,8 June 2010,"THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!This movie is told from the point of view of a small group of people who are initially being filmed at a going away party for one of their friends. However the party is soon ruined by what at first appears to be a natural disaster but is in fact, a monster attack. A monster is attacking New York, a huge scary monster. The guy behind the camera keeps on filming whilst all this madness is going on around him. Personally I would be too busy running away to keep on filming, but I digress.I have heard this compared to the Blair Witch Project in terms of the hand-held camera work throughout, but as I have not saw the aforementioned I cannot comment on the similarities or otherwise. I have to say that the camera work did not distract from the plot, but instead worked as part of it.The relatively unknown cast do a great job of depicting a small group of people caught up in events that they can't escape from. The special effects are excellent and the suspense and tension derived from not knowing quite what is going on applies to both the characters in the movie and the audience.What I liked best about the movie was the fact that there was no escape from the monster. Just when our small group of people think they have found an escape route, they are outdone by the sheer enormity of the beast.This relentlessness on the part of the enemy is terrifying and in the end, none of the group survives. Fortunately for us, we don't know or care enough about the characters for that to be a problem.",Cloverfield

This WAAAYY too long introduction features a bunch of vapid 20 somethings that only the warmest of hearts could give a flying fudge about.A monster that seems to really dislike the Statue of Liberty shows up to crash the party and the kids are all like NOOO. So they head off to midtown to look for main douche-bags girlfriend who may or may not already be dead. Sure the rest of us probably would have been like hey bro good luck and headed to jersey but the only person in this movie familiar with NYC geography seems to be the monster itself. The movie is shot in super jerky handy-cam style to create an eye witness feel. Or as I like to say, the movie is shot in a shaky handy-cam style to cover the less than stellar or believable special effects.The monster is pretty stupid looking for the most part and he pops up all over Manhattan, he also seems to have a great hatred for architecture (both classic and modern). The monster can also take a full on hit from a massive bomb and just be all like yo son, not a scratch!Don't expect anything in the form of plot in this movie and don't expect much in the way of entertainment either.",Cloverfield

It might make you puke in a movie theater, which I guess could be life-changingly embarrassing, but aside from that you'll leave this film the same person as when you entered.That said, it does what it sets out to do admirably.The first few minutes of action are extremely intense, very heavily evoking 9/11 memories for better or for worse. The film keeps a fast pace from that point on, but never again recreates those initial moments of fear.The characters are likable, realistic young New Yorkers who are established ~quickly~ and effectively. Their behavior throughout the film fall somewhere short of realistic and there is heroism to a degree that seems sometimes unbelievable, and yet... people do heroic things in times of crisis. I'm inclined to believe that some people (not most people, but some) would indeed do what our main characters do.The ""camera work"" is a mixed bag. It's sometimes very effective and fun (the beginning and the military scenes are stand outs). It's also frustrating at times, and occasionally feels like it's try to save budget by not showing us what we obviously want to see. Overall I think it works in Cloverfield -- it gives the film a unique sense of immersion -- but I would not want to see this approach overused. It will become one-note very quickly.Without giving too much away: the ending is a shock. It will leave some viewers frustrated and others impressed. I was impressed. I thought it was ballsy and unique, and I appreciate its purity. I do not blame people for being annoyed by it, however.Overall I enjoyed Cloverfield. It's a rush. It's funny and honest and likable.

Come on, I want to see you guys climbing over a roof to another and holding on to the cam and filming the whole sequence...If you people think that's realistic...And on the other hand, as soon as action starts the camera is shaking, so you really don't always know what's going on....And the monster...it's cool.

It was a nice and inventive idea to have it told from the first person to give it a bit more intimacy but after about 10 minutes it just became incredibly nauseating. Literally at least half of the people at my screening had to leave at some point during the film for some fresh air or to puke.I also felt that there was no where near enough screen time of the monster and not enough action. I realise that one of the major points of the film was to focus mainly on the journey of the people involved, and also less glimpses of the monster make it more suspenseful, but when I saw this billed as ""a completely original MONSTER MOVIE"" I was expecting a bit more than just people running and sitting about for most of the film.On the few plus sides, I feel the actors were good, the characters (Hud in particular) were very likable and the monster did look quite cool and unique.

621,SiLenTxfAiRy,GREAT TWIST AT END! (if you caught it!) SPOILERS!,8,25 January 2008,"So like most movie buffs, I lined up for the 9 o clock showing on Friday night for cloverfield. The previous viewers, the 7 o clock showing was leaving and of course some game away the movie, but luckily enough I had already read all about it on IMDb before hand. The movie at first starts out with a warning that this is evidence found from central park, which pretty much insists that the characters that were in central park were dead. The relationship is built between the main character Rob and Beth seamed helpless... however, that is what the movie is pretty much based upon.I think the most intense scene in the movie is when they are sitting in the subway station waiting. It almost seamed crazy they were going down there, but where else would you hide? I was waiting for a loud boom, or some creature to appear suddenly while at the station, however, nothing happened. Which left you with more fear of what is happening above ground. Marlena exploding was amazing. Some people in the theater thought that she was shot, however, you can clearly see the two army men holding her and her body going crazy and her head exploding. The run to get beth was full of intense action and loud noises. The camera was NOT steady at all during the running scenes, however, it was easy to catch everything going on.The monster seamed to be a cross between a crab and a spider.. with little babies? or workers. Some believe that the monster WAS a baby, and the mother will be the main MONSTER in cloverfield2.STAY TUNED!SPOILERS.*while on the bridge there is a quick shot of robs brother on the pole, then for a brief second the camera focuses on someone else recording.*at the end in the central park scene, at the very last second it cuts back to the ferris wheel, then back to them. if you look closely you can see that the monster drops the minis into the ocean/lake right before heading towards central park.*end credits. at the very end of the credits there is a code that is written backwards. of course, i didn't have time to figure out what it said. but stay until the VERY END.",Cloverfield
622,mollymormonbrat,Nothing quite like a monster destroying NYC.,6,9 February 2008,"This review is late in coming. I saw this movie opening night with no idea of what to expect, due to the mysterious posters and trailers. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself watching the documentary of something large and weird destroying New York City.To be perfectly honest, I cannot decide if this movie was supposed to be serious or not. I was under the impression it was pure camp, what with the classic and simple giant monster and the smaller monsters lurking in the darkness. But yes, the key word is classic. Monster movies have definitely made their niche in cinema culture, and I guess they figured it was high time for another one.Besides the monster, much of the movie focused on the emotional plot line of the humans desperately trying to reach each other. I was interested in their courageous trek through Ground Zero, though I was mostly interested in watching them scream and run from various dangers. Still, I could appreciate the humanity.The effects. Oh, wow. Now these were some nice effects, from the Statue of Liberty literally losing her head to tilted buildings. The monsters, while still looking classically Hollywood camp, were awe/fear inspiring.I don't know if I experienced the same terror as the teenagers in the theatre as I spent a good deal of time laughing, but I was certainly entertained.Old school works. This proves it. Remember that, Hollywood.",Cloverfield

I expected an average apocalyptic monster movie with nothing interesting or different, but I have to say that I am very glad that I watched.The direction is perfect. The movie itself is a video recorded from a camera of one of the characters, so it seems like the movie is made of one take. The swing of the camera gives more reality to it; actually you kind of forget that Cloverfield is a monster movie. The writer and director managed to transform a silly theme into a must-see.The actors also made a great job, specially Lizzy Caplan and Michael Stahl-David, what collaborated so much to the sense of reality given to the movie.

When i was a kid I remember the feeling of leaving the cinema and wanting to rush back in and see it again or tell all your pals about it.Anyone of my generation remembers the heroin high of leaving star wars or superman and thinking that life would never be the same again - indeed how could film get any better - any more exciting? Of course now I am a grizzled weary 38 and have seen many hundreds of movies I do not quite get that wet the bed excited but Cloverfield delivers all that visceral wow and all that white light of all engulfing emotional high that I remember as a Kid. JJ dipped his toe in the big scary monster in Lost but here he pulls it out of the shadows and puts it centre stage for a roller coaster horror ride of damn near perfect cinema. Go see - go get excited - go hide behind your hands and go wet yourself.

626,AdamPeabody,"Great sound design...um, that's it, I guess.",5,22 January 2008,"This video (yes, I meant that) may be comfortably viewed on, say, my 7"" portable DVD player. Perhaps even as large as my 20"" bedroom TV. Certainly not the big ol' DLP in the living room. And under no circumstances should this picture be viewed on THE SILVER SCREEN. Clearly taking a cue from any and all video footage from 9-11, this is a movie about running. Not in the ""Run Lola Run"" Steadicam/Shotmaker Truck kind of way, oh no. This movie is about running in the same way as giving the video camera to your four year-old. There is more footage of the Lower Manhattan asphalt here than anything else. There was a warning printed on Salmon-colored paper at the theater where I viewed this explaining to me I might suffer motion sickness as result of seeing ""Cloverfield."" It should have said ""will suffer motion sickness."" When it ended, I swear I've never before heard more people groan wearily as they stood up.The one genuinely redeeming element of seeing ""Cloverfield"" in the theater was the brilliant sound design. That is what holds everything together and makes it remotely enjoyable. While somewhat unrealistic, being that no handy-cam microphone could record (to say nothing of playing back) such rich audio, it is still very compelling and engrossing to listen to what the visuals cannot convey. There are a lot of these moments. Particularly, there is a moment in the subway tunnels when the characters are being stalked by creatures unseen, only to reveal them in an admittedly clever use of the infrared gimmick. This was a really hard video to watch. I had to take full minutes away from the screen to focus on the theater's EXIT sign in order to prevent heaving up my popcorn. Entire running sequences are lost to me as I stared at the hairdo sitting in front of me. At least in the beginning, I could watch the on-screen time and date, which held perfectly still.

627,MOOVYZ,"If you're going to make a ""1st person reality movie"" then",6,18 January 2008,"everything HAS to be realistic. If you have to ""suspend dis-belief"", then you HAVE to use conventional 3rd person camera techniques.I give it a 6. The camera work was simply annoying. And even if you try and say ""well, it's realistic"" well, it's not. No camcorder battery lasts that long. And the entire time (basically) the guy holds the camera at shoulder level like he's looking through the viewfinder. Even when **SPOILER** the monsters are attacking him, he's pointing it in the direction of the action. I understand that it's necessary so the audience can see it, but if the director wants us to see it, then abandon that concept about the movie and do it 3rd person like every other movie.No one reacted like a real person would have. NO ONE WOULD HAVE GONE BACK INTO THE CITY! If someone would have, then hundreds would have. That was one of my gripes... where are all the other 20 million people? No one else has relatives? No one else hides out in the subway? No one else is hurt in a building? No on e else left their apartments? Give me a break.The special effects were very realistic. 9/10. The acting was sub-par. The main character, looking for Beth (Rob, I guess?) was totally non-believable. The smart-ass remarks by the guy running the cam were equally un-believable. Beth is impaled by a piece of steel, then is fine for the remainder of the movie.There were just so many things un-realistic, and that's fine for most movies. I can suspend dis-belief as well as the next guy. But for this specific technique of realism in camera work, etc. then it damn well better be 100% realistic. Otherwise, use conventional story telling techniques.I was very disappointed. Mildy exciting, horrible cinematography (which I would have accepted if 100% realistic in character actions), monster was just OK. Little monsters were copies of ""Starship Troopers"".

If that's the state of youth today, them I'm glad I have (hopefully) only another 25-30 years on this planet. The head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the middle of the street, and all everyone can do is scream, whimper, and takes picture of it with their cell phones; People can see the Brooklyn Bridge fall into the river, and all they can do is scream and yell hysterically- not one can help anyone else...Young people can see their world collapse in front of them in a post-9/11 environment, and their main comment is ""Dude? What happened?"" The main male character finally grows a pair and kills one of the spider thingies, and then drops the axe??? Okay, don't actually *keep* a weapon against them, throw it away and leave yourself totally defenseless.And so on, until I cheered every time one of the main actors was killed off...My only recommendations is that men under the age of 25 see their doctor for shots of testosterone.As to the movie: - What are the odds that 4 people are going to run into the same monster - which is engaged in a running battle with the military - on an island 23 square miles in size? Why were the spider thingies in the subway tunnel? It simply couldn't have been a case of they were in *every* tunnel, there's far too many miles of them. So, what? Were they simply chasing the 4 characters? In the same vein, how did one of them get in the girl's building, and how was it that it wasn't seen on the way up? Do people really think that the military is so stupid as to *track* the direction of a threat when carrying refugees in helicopters? The director should have allowed everyone to put a little salt on themselves: setting themselves up as dinner for the creature, the least they could have done was make themselves taste a little better: at least then the movie would have had *some* taste.....Joe",Cloverfield

I, like most people went see this without big expectations, and was blown away. The hand-held camera thing has been done before, but it really helps to suck you into the experience, and does sort of make the viewer feel as if they are part of the story. I think everyone has had a bad dream where something big is stalking them and seems to follow at your heels wherever you run to. This movie looks like they got into someone's head and filmed one of those nightmares. Good acting, a suspenseful plot, and Great special effects. Easily the best movie I've seen in quite awhile.~Randawg.",Cloverfield

Abrams did a good job provoking a sense of real intensity and terror in the film. The monster was well done and the acting was better than I thought it would be. I'm definitely planning on seeing it again soon to catch things that I may have missed the first time. If done right, I think this thing could almost be a trilogy. I'm so excited!

631,kimbistrups,Not at all what I expected!,3,8 June 2009,"First of all, why ""Cloverfield""? Second; what is that monster, where did it come from and why and how did it end up in New York City? What are the little offspring? Are they somehow poisonous? Is there a reason for all of this happening? And by asking these questions I believe I have struck the nerve of why this isn't a good movie!Cloverfield leans upon (at least) two different types of movies; the classic monster movies and ""the Blair Witch""/horror-suspense genre. But what we normally expect from those genres are explanations. They take the time needed to build a myth or tell the story and background, with answers to most of the questions I asked above. Sometimes these answers are highly imaginative if not far-fetched but that is partly to be expected in this genre and we often accept them. Cloverfield however does not offer any explanations, does not build a myth, does not really tell a story or give us a background for us to engage our imaginations in and does not answer our questions. This reduces the movie to a mere action-without-a-real-plot movie and leaves me pretty unaffected by the story that has just been told!I can imagine that this would have been a pretty effective game for Playstation or other platforms, but even then I would have liked a little more background story!",Cloverfield

A monster attacks New York, but here's the thing - WE USE HAND-HELD CAMERAS LIKE WE'RE REALLY THERE! Gosh. The studios must be really desperate because they fell for it. No plot, no script as such (thereby saving a whole heap of money), lots of CG explosions and a very unhealthy-looking monster that sheds parasites and lumbers about New York knocking over buildings and eating people for the hell of it.

The voice acting by the cameraman was so horrible like he was just making fun of it. What's more, there's so much sensationalism in the obviously Hollywood high-budget movie which strips off the suspense and realism. The numerous ""Oh my Gods"" are extremely annoying. Plus, the storyline was so bland that it would seem the movie was primarily for showcasing the impressive graphics and simulation technologies at the time. Whatever the case, this isn't even a scary or thrilling movie. So I wouldn't know why they made such a pitiful script for such a high-budget movie. I would like to think of it as a waste of time, but at the very least, it opened my eyes to see how big and wealthy production companies venture into the found footage genre only to end up mostly creating a trying-hard or trying-to-impress movie full of your usual mainstream movie elements; extravagant graphics and annoying sensationalism, two key elements not typically found in the REAL found footage genre.",Cloverfield

That isn't film length, that's TV feature episode length.For me, there was not enough bad guy action, you only saw little bits and then the camera often jerked whilst the camera guy was running. It would have been better if it used both perspectives 1st and 3rd person and mixed both. More action shots would also have been nice.The film was quite fun for 1hr and for me, the last 10 mins really let the film down.

636,MrTAToad,Just about bearable,4,7 June 2010,"The first thing to note is the ""Shakey-cam"" filming is very off-putting. Most users of hand-held recorders to tend to make sure that what they film can be viewed without the viewers deciding that the contents of their stomach's need to be examine by the floor. This does make it hard to see what is supposed to be going on.Next thing is that the the characters aren't particularly interesting. Nor are they particularly bright : Trying to use a lift in a badly damaged build ? Stopping under a bridge when there is a slightly miffed monster around ? These are the actions of Homer Simpson, and hopefully not the average American, although saying that... One good thing about the person using the camcorder becoming a monster sandwich : The camera work is a bit more steady.I didn't find it particularly frightening, nor interesting. There was too much talk and not enough action, particularly around the monster.

637,r-brasher,I Was Not Disappointed,10,19 January 2008,"Before seeing Cloverfield today, I read a few reviews on IMDb; not that that in any way would have influenced whether or not I would have gone to see it. (At the same time, I wish I had read the comments on ""Stinger"" before I plunked down 5 bucks at Blockbuster a few weeks ago-I totally agree with ""IMDb 3972""-getting a tooth pulled or an enema would be preferable, but I digress).Anyway, for my money, (5.75 for the twilight matinée) Cloverfield is well worth the time. It's not fair to compare it with the overrated ""Blair Witch Project"" or ""Godzilla '98"". The concept of New York being attacked by monsters has been done to death since King Kong paved the way in 1933. Since then, we've seen the city wrecked by giant comets (Deep Impact & Armegeddon) blown up by aliens (Independence Day) briefly invaded by Rodan (Godzilla: Final Wars), and tragically attacked by real life monsters on 9/11-no doubt there are elements of that seen in this movie. The concept may not be original, but the way it was handled by J.J. Abrams is certainly groundbreaking. The whole film is made up from the footage of a hand held video camera found after the events of the film are over. There is no explanation of where the monster came from, the ending is very anti-climactic, which, in my opinion enhances the film.The design of the monster was handled so well, it's almost impossible to describe-you just have to be there. I guarantee you haven't seen it anywhere else, not even in ""Stephen King's The Mist"".The special effects are top notch. New York never looked more devastated. This is one bad-ass Kaiju.It's what ""Godzilla '98"" should have been.Rating: ***** out of *****",Cloverfield
638,jeremyfredrikson,Hand-held camera passes inferior Godzilla rip-off as art.,6,29 January 2008,"When the trailer for this came out, I heard somebody in the audience say, ""What is that? Another Godzilla movie?"" Kind of. Unfortunately, kind of like the Matthew Broderick Godzilla box office disaster. In fact, I always thought that particular film would have received better reviews had it not been called a Godzilla film. Afterall, the monster didn't look at all like the traditional Godzilla, and the film took itself very seriously. It could have been called Cloverfield 1. The current Cloverfield film is very short, clocking in well under the standard hour and a half. Despite this, the first part of the film seems like an eternity. Half hour number one introduces us to the film's one dimensional...no, make that non-dimensional characters at a going away party. It also introduces us to a hand-held camera that is used throughout the entire film, generating more wooziness than the most avid Blair Witch hater could ever imagine. I wouldn't advise forking out 16 bucks on some stale popcorn/week old hot dog/flat soft drink combo for this one! Your stomach will want immediate pay back. I will give that awful hand-held camera credit for one thing, though. It sure is a tough little gizmo. It's outer casing survives monsters, falling bricks, explosions, the army, and an air raid that levels Manhattan. But that camera keeps going and going and going. So do the characters. That's all they do. They run and scream and shout and run and scream and shout. People are dying all around them, but all that matters to the film's ""hero"" and his pals is going back to save a girlfriend he got into an argument with at the beginning of the film. His friends don't take too much persuading to accompany him in this futile quest either, but then again, who wouldn't blindly follow an unfleshed out character on a collision course with a giant monster that's been killing everyone in sight? Not surprisingly, the friends get picked off one by one...yawn. Too bad you see so much of these disposable characters and not very much of the monster which is barely glimpsed at for the most part. When it is seen, the big guy looks like CGI. Night Of The Demon had it right, less is more when an on screen monster doesn't do justice to the off-screen fright it is supposed to evoke. There are a couple of ""whoah!"" moments in Cloverfield involving smaller insects which spew off of the big one for no reason other than to have something to chase the kids indoors and add some gross out moments. (Come to think of it, weren't there little Godzilla monsters in the Matthew Broderick Godzilla movie as well? Hmmmm.) Toho's Godzilla films are for the most part fun and campy. Cloverfield is basically a serious attempt at a giant monster flick. It's really just an artsy fartsy Godzilla film with 80% of it's time taken up by annoying college aged blank canvases either saying nothing much (that going away party, which was filmed as if you were there, was so dull that if I was an invite I would have left long before any monster ever showed up!) or huffing and puffing while running, screaming, and orally implying vague happenings that aren't shown on camera. I can't believe this nothingness has gotten such great reviews on this site. It has a few scares and moments of ""what's going on!"", but far too many lulls, repetitions, and nothing actually going on a whole lot of the time, a fact you'll realize if you close your eyes and actually stop letting the hand-held motion camera trickery fool you for a few seconds while trying not to vomit from dizziness. If you do see this one, grab some motion sickness meds and leave all analytical thinking out the door. Questions as to why there's a monster, why college educated people would go up on a roof during an earthquake, why little monsters are falling off the big one, why cell phone batteries die so easily and camera batteries do not, (etc.) have no place during this frill ride. If you think too much, sorry to say but you'll fall into a plot hole, not a hole caused by an inferior CGI Godzilla wannabe. Despite all the negativity I've stated, I give this one 5.5 out of 10, meaning, like most films, it's just a middling time waster to be seen once and never again. There are a few genuine critter jolts and some very nice building disaster special effects. It just isn't worth the raves on this site. I was unpleasantly surprised and disappointed after hearing so many overly positive reviews. (As time has passed, it's obvious that IMDb is no longer a place to go to base your decision on whether to see a new movie or not. A bulk of first reviews here are written by hired guns to get people to show up at the box office. The other vast majority of reviews on here are by people who love certain movies almost with an obsession. Trust only the ones that briefly describe the plot and tell you a few pros and cons so that you can decide if such a movie will appeal to you or turn you off. Only you can truly decide in the end, but at least the latter kind of reviews can help determine a rental versus spending a fortune at the theater.)",Cloverfield
639,wesleywisejr,This movie was incredible - The best monster movie ever in my opinion,10,18 January 2008,"Male/24 yrs old/Detroit, MI This movie has it all. Comedy, suspense, horror, and tons of action. My expectations were very high and this movie definitely exceeded them. I was weary of the whole ""Blair Witch"" aspect with the hand-held camera documenting the whole movie, however, it works VERY well. This movie feels very real, the characters are great and it is pretty funny in many parts as well.Fans who can't wait to see the monster don't worry because you see plenty of it in the film, much more than you would expect watching the previews. I don't want to describe it, but trust me, you aren't left guessing what it looks like.This movie had some of the most intense scenes I have ever watched, and I don't think I have ever left a movie thinking ""wow, that was an incredible movie"".

Loved most things about it, the fact that they made blogs for those characters, the hand-held filming etc. Some people were disappointed that they couldn't see more of the monster. This was not that kind of movie. It was more of a love story, love-in-the-time-of-monster-attack kind of movie. Those who haven't seen much monsters yet should go to youtube and search for ""Ultraman""; they'll then see monsters enough to last them a lifetime. I was sea-sick tho! I remembered at least 2 couples who had to leave the cinema, each time I could see their silhouettes with their hands holding their foreheads. An 8!!

It's basically just a bunch of inane characters you don't care about running around screaming ""Rob!"" or ""Jason!"" The acting is on the level of a high school play. The ""love story"" is silly and laughable. The special effects are okay, but not on par with those of the great horror and sci-fi movies. Honestly, I can't think of a single thing to recommend this movie, except for the fact that it was very short.I know a lot of people see movies like this for mindless thrills, but Cloverfield stinks even by the lowered standards of the genre. This is a movie for people with no standards. If you like intelligent movies, don't evenbother with this crud.",Cloverfield
642,lodewijkpollemans,Finally something interesting again!,8,12 July 2008,"I just rented this movie, and I must say that I'm quite impressed. The movie takes a surprisingly realistic approach, and even though you can still feel that it is acted, the movie serves a nice survival experience. There is much CGI used in this movie, but fortunately it never gets to the point where you think you're watching video game-footage. The CGI is impressively good integrated in the film. The actors also do a nice job, although some scenes feel more acted then others.Some might say that the basic idea of shooting a movie that is filmed by the actors (most of the time) is directly borrowed from The Blair Witch Project, but it doesn't share the same atmosphere. Unlike The Blair Witch Project, this movie offers much more on screen-action instead of hiding away all of the monsters (which I usually hate). The monsters are not spectacular realistic when on screen, but they could have been a lot worse.Unlike a lot of people, I didn't have too many problems with the ending. I think the characters were about to die anyway sooner or later since the film-footage was supposedly the only thing found at the site. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was the running time, which felt kind of short for my taste. But overall, if you want to see a movie that is finally different then the usual pile of typical cliché-filled Hollywood-movies then you should definitely watch this.",Cloverfield
643,DJRumpy,Great Movie...but those prone to sea sickness beware!,7,18 January 2008,"I really enjoyed this one. Although it's a short hour and 20 minutes, it's a fun ride. You'll feel like the party last forever before the action gets started, but it goes at a fairly good pace after that. The acting isn't academy worthy, but it is certainly good. I can't really fault any of the actors as they all did a great job considering they are all unknowns (you wouldn't know that from the quality job). The CGI is screen worthy. Very fast glimpses for the most part. The smaller budget shows a bit there. Action scenes are good and some of them have a good tension to them letting your mind try to figure out whats coming. I liked it for those points.All in all, a fun movie. I should warn you that if you had problems with Blair Witch, you may want to skip this one. The vomit cam can be a bit much. One of the people in my group actually had to get up and go to the bathroom because it made him nauseous. It's can get pretty extreme in scenes.Definitely worth a watch!***Minor Spoilers Follow*** ' ' ' ' ' ' For those that are moaning about the magical battery in the camera and such..Hello, there is only 1 hour and 20 minutes on the camera, meaning it filmed for that long. It wasn't running all night. For those complaining that the subways were empty, don't forget that they had already evacuated most of the city by that point. These people were running towards the monster, not away from it. The area they were in was already deserted. I will agree that this camera with it's night vision was a bit much to believe. That's more of a military type hardware, not some Best Buy video camera ;) Last but not least, did anyone catch the quick shot of this monster falling into the water at the very end of the movie? I'm talking about the very end of the movie when it flashes the scene at Coney Island and if you look out at the water there's a ferry. Watch to the left of it and you'll see something fall from the sky and hit the water. It is not flaming like a meteor. It looks gray and round. I'm guessing this is how the monster actually makes it's appearance? No one else seemed to notice in the theater.",Cloverfield

646,Screen-Space,"""Do you want cheese with your monster...?""",2,16 January 2008,"When Lars Von Trier was preaching his Dogma manifesto all those years ago, I'll bet my left nut he didn't think it would be embraced to create Hollywoods latest pile of steaming, stinking celluloid, Cloverfield.Take out the 12 minute credit crawl (arguably the most exciting thing in the film), and you get 73 minutes of headache-inducing hand-held camera-work, a monster that would've been best left unseen and a whiny group of objectionable Manhattanites, everyone of them perfectly suited - nay, deserving - of a fate between the backteeth of any monstrous beasty.I was hoping the brave creative decision to shoot the whole film from a first-person perspective would have the desired affect - put the audience into the action; redefine the disaster/monster movie for the post 9/11 generation; take genre pics to that next level that many promise to do but none ever really have.But in trying to provide realism to B-movie myths of years gone by, the film-makers only manage to emphasise the cornball situations and horrible clichés that have driven these films for decades. You can make the camera-work as dandy as you like, but it don't mean squat if the script and acting is every bit as turgid and wooden as it was 50 years ago - when the giant octopus (an obvious inspiration for Cloverfields critter) crawled over the bridge and headed Downtown.I know we have to give a movie about a marauding jellyfish a little slack, but its not the monster scenes that stink. It's the oh-so-lame set-up of the characters lives that is insufferably eye-rolling from the very first frame of the film. The intimacy your personal video camera captures isn't like a movie, so a movie about the intimacy a video camera captures was never going to ring true. The achingly slow story suffers from awkwardly staged moments meant to look spontaneous, weepy declarations of love and McGuyver-style heroics. The producer's could've saved big bucks on all the military hardware on display in the film - with the cheese in Cloverfield laid on so thick, the monster would've eventually died of cholesterol poisoning anyway.....It's hard to totally hate a film that tries to make something new out of an idea so old but, minus all the new technology that has gone into creating this screeching, lurching mess, Cloverfield is no better than the monster flicks that your mom and dad watched in double-bills at their local drive-in.When the only positive you can take from a film is the viral, pre-release marketing strategy innovatively employed, somethings up. Cloverfield is an admirable attempt but ultimately proves an immense failure.",Cloverfield
647,gargamel_gargamel,If you think you want to see this movie read this first!!!!!!,3,18 January 2008,"First of all, I understand that this movie will appeal to a certain crowd of people. But it will not appeal to most I feel. I gave it a 3 because there are certain parts that are.... well, okay. However, for the most part I just felt bored.Problem one, the camera. I liked Blair Witch, I liked the bourne movies. People said those movies made them sick with the camera shaking.. I didn't. Even this one didn't nauseate me or give me a headache, but it was overused. Just simply overused. Any idiot can keep a camera more stable than Hud did. Also, even in parts when everybody is sitting still and the camera isn't shaking, the picture is either out of focus or out of frame... come on. Overused.Problem two, the monster. Missiles, bombs, tanks, all sorts of ammunition expelled on this beast and nothing even phases it... even Godzilla feels pain, really. The sub-monsters that came off of it were cooler in that they were fast and scary and at least defeatable. It was obvious from the closeup of the big one that it has no exoskeleton and actually has what looks like soft spots (gills or lungs) on it's head that move when it breathes.... they weren't even scuffed after all the explosions..hmmm.Problem three, the story. I saw every single thing coming. OOOh they are going to escape across the bridge, huh.... oh look the monster made the bridge fall down.... Rob's girlfriend is trapped in her apartment with a piece of rebar through her chest for 45 minutes.... instead of escaping I'm sure they'll go back after her in her apartment building that didn't 'quite' fall all the way over but happened to lean against an adjacent building so that you could climb out a window, blah, blah, blah, give me a break.. I'm sure she's fine and once they pick her up off the rebar she'll be able to run with the best of them.... Oh wait, that's what happens.. then everybody dies... real original. The monster seems to only want to stay in New York where thousands of troops are trying to kill it rather than crossing over to Jersey or going back to sea... oh, and the troops, wow! Thousands of troops with tanks and other heavy equipment are in the middle of Manhattan within minutes with the Brooklyn Bridge down and certain gridlock at every other entrance/exit to the island... I found myself extremely bored watching everything happen exactly as I thought it would. Even the last 3 surviving a helicopter crash while the 2 military personnel in the chopper died.. of course they lived... the movie's not over yet. And as others have said, the first 15 or so minutes at the party is absolute drivel.... waste of space.I'll give it this, I liked the lack of music leaving you able to pick up on some of the same sounds the characters hear. I DO like the filming style, it does bring you into the situation, yet over used in this film greatly. Picking not so famous actors so that it seems like it could be anybody, and a pretty good job of keeping the details of the monster secret so that you are always looking forward to seeing it. I DO like that it doesn't give you all the answers.... but that kind of movie has to at least be entertaining or full of surprises... The people here that say it scared them or surprised them must have the mentality of five year olds. The theatre I saw it in had about 100 people in it and after the film was over EVERYBODY was laughing and saying what a horrible movie it was.....is that how you want to spend your hard earned money??",Cloverfield

Frankly, there was not a single identifiable element of the plot or the setting that was not readily demonstrable as derivative of some previous B-movie or other. A purely technical inconsistency also plagues me from the start: how can an ostensibly ninety-foot creature (it looked much, much larger, but that's what the press releases all said) suffer from seven-foot parasites--and how can these be compared to whale lice? Whale lice are teeny, tiny creatures that infest the tiniest crevices, and whales have not the mechanical means (read as ""hands"") to remove them. A ninety-foot animal having seven-foot parasites equates to a six-foot human being having ""parasites"" five and one-half inches long: wouldn't the sufferer merely pick them off with his hands and toss them into the gutter?

After 18 minutes of mindlessly banal banter at a party before anything remotely suspenseful even happens, I was also wishing the same fate on the director and screenwriter. I'll give the movie two stars rather than one because of the decent production values.",Cloverfield

Completely unoriginal - those who have already compared it to a mixture of The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla are absolutely correct. Add a touch of Alien and that just about sums up the whole thing.The whole film is unrealistic. I had no sympathy for the characters - most seemed to be selfish and unthinking. The events are unbelievable. The camera-work is appalling and I don't just mean because it's supposed to be shot on a hand-held camera - of course I understand that - but the camera doesn't just shake it judders, jolts, convulses - so much that the action is often obscured. I suspect this is a deliberate ploy to disguise the very poor special effects.A very amateurish effort.",Cloverfield
653,AvonKerr,Unspeakably bad,1,20 February 2008,"If only I'd known that J J Abrams was involved I wouldn't have gone within a mile of this utter stinker. Unfortunately I deliberately avoided seeing or reading anything about it before going in the hope that any surprises wouldn't be spoilt. Sadly the only surprise was that I made it to the end. The appallingly bad fake-camcorder style is annoying after about two minutes and by the end of the ""film"" it is migraine-inducing.The only character of any interest says almost nothing meanwhile his idiot friend won't shut up yet says nothing of value or interest at any time. There is no story at all worth mentioning, if you've seen the trailer then you've seen everything that happens in the film already. Actually you've seen a better cut of it, the trailer looked cheesy, formulaic and predictable (which really should have warned me Abrams could be involved) but at least it was over quickly and had some small promise that the full movie might be interesting.If you like monster movies: avoid this, the monster is on a par with a cutscene in video-game at best. If you like action movies: avoid this, watch the invasion scenes from ID4 again on cable. They are a million times better If you like sci-fi movies: avoid this, there's nothing here for you at all If you like mysteries: avoid this, there is no mystery, except how they were allowed to put this garbage on general release In fact if you like movies at all: avoid this.",Cloverfield
654,Mudbug711,"Ahhh, here we go again!!!",8,28 January 2008,"Now this was a very hyped movie. Yes it was. I believe it was when I went to see Transformers, that I seen the teaser trailer. My friend, and I were a little surprised by the short action scene, and then a date appeared... and that was it!!! No title..nothing. Got to admit, this of course had a lot of people trying to figure out about this movie.I went to the theater, KNOWING that this movie was shot in VERY REALISTIC way, by someone running around with a camera filming the movie like they were actually there!!! So, I was expecting a SHAKY camera. I went to this movie, expecting a movie that had real life scenarios, and situations...not just a mad, crazy, powerful monster on the loose. Grant it, that was the main thing, but like in real life, other things matter. There was some-what of a plot.. not very strong mind you, however there was a plot. That was the courage for one to go out of one's way, in the face of unrelenting danger, to attempt to save another. Sounds sappy, but it does really happen. The acting was strong, the cast was mostly upstarts, but good. The NYC backdrops, and scenes were great. The monster was awesome, and VERY original. The camera work was spot on, makes you feel like you were right there!! I really liked that, the sense that you part of the situation itself.So, let me say this.. You should not really compare this movie with Blair Witch.. I liked Blair Witch, but originally, the Blair Witch movie folks (storyline) tried to make you believe that was actually a true story...remember??? This movie (Cloverfield), we all SHOULD know is FICTION!!! I give this movie a 9 out of 10, for the originality, and cinematography. Good work, folks. I was impressed!!!",Cloverfield
655,Rick_Bman,"Too much melodrama, not enough monster.",3,20 January 2008,"A lot of the reviews I read about this state that the camera work is the only real negative about the film. Other than that it seems that people, for the most part, really enjoyed the movie. I will however start off my review by saying; the camera work was the least of my problems and in fact the camera work didn't really bother me at all. However, I was bothered by just about everything else that the movie had to offer.Warning: Spoilers in this review.The ""relationship"" that was a major part of the film was, in a word, boring. It wasn't at all interesting and didn't make me any more interested in the characters then I would have been had we just been thrown into the middle of the film with no previous knowledge of the characters. None of the characters were at all likable, so I pretty much wanted them to die... well except Marlena she was kind of cool. The relationship melodrama that was going on in the uninteresting people's lives was so dull that beginning party sequence bored me to such a level that when the attack finally came I looked over at my friend and said ""Finally, now these annoying people can start dying."" I had heard from several people that the movie was scary and suspenseful so I was at least hopeful on that level once the attack started. However, none of the ""scary"" moments were at all scary, I saw each and every scare coming from a mile away. As soon as they went down into the dark subway it was pretty obvious that they would get attacked down there and then when the attack finally happened they gave it to much build up that it didn't surprise or shock me. Also, when they were flying over the monster in the helicopter and they were cheering because they though it was dead I just knew that it was going to jump up and hit the helicopter. Which brings up the question, if the pilot of the helicopter was supposed to be evacuating these people why was he just flying directly over the monster while it was being bombed, why didn't he change course and get the heck out of there? Which then brings up the question, how did they survive the helicopter crash? The pilot dies but the three main characters somehow survive? How does that work exactly? The movie seriously should have ended with the helicopter crash; it would have made a lot more sense.Some of the scenes of the monster attacking the city were pretty cool. One scene that stands on in my mind in particular is the one that happens right before they go down in the subway where the tanks roll in and start attacking the monster and the main characters are just kind of stuck there with nowhere to go. That was actually a very cool scene; however scenes like this were too few and far between to keep the movie interesting for me.I will agree with some of the things I have read that the CGI was very well done, especially considering that all the shots were hand held. I am sure it is hard enough to animate a monster into a movie when the camera is still, but it has got to be extra hard when the camera is going all over the place. It probably becomes much harder to find references for where to put the monster from frame to frame.So, in short, the characters weren't at all likable or interesting and the love story was dull. I never really felt that there was any suspense in the movie because all the scares were predictable. The only cool parts were when the monster was destroying the city and there really wasn't enough of that to justify an 84 minute length. And it is pretty sad when a movie is only 84 minutes and is unable to even justify that short length.I feel the movie could have benefited from maybe seeing everything from more than one perspective. Perhaps instead of finding one camera, the military finds three cameras at different places in the city that see different things. This definitely would have helped the movie reach feature length without having to pad it with the uninteresting melodrama, because honestly the relationship part of the movie felt like it was just there as filler to get the movie up to a length that they could actually show in the theater.",Cloverfield

In fact it looks like a high school student film assignment that got a hold of too much support.Camcorder-view movies are already old hat and every example done before is better than this. Besides, there are tremendous inconsistencies within the idea, showing a poor understanding of camera-work. I'm not sure I understand why the movie was produced or given even the faintest praise. I remember I enjoyed the trailer....It should have stayed a trailer. And I see there's a sequel planned! There's a not a single original idea in the film.

657,mrmac-1,The first 23 minutes,4,16 October 2012,"23 or so minutes of uninteresting film. Lot of time in a film. Uninteresting people, unless you are actually there at the party. Stories are about us. Doesn't even need to be your age group, economic group, any group. But the story depends on some bit of interest in the difficulty, pleasure, angst, whatever, happening to those involved. In other words, we must feel some empathy with the story's characters, whether it's Star Wars or Cloverfield, or especially your own life.23 minutes of watching these people live their lives. So what? If the story is confined to you at 20-something, then it;s only empathy for your age group, and that is certainly not going to give you any support once you reach 30. I like fluff as much as the next person, but I also need some balance. This story simply has no connection to real life. Even the fantastic must have a connection to everyday life, yours and mine.It's always the extraordinary in the mundane, the ordinary. So, the imagination becomes so important in our everyday lives, let alone films. Even if your 20-swomething, remember when your were a kid? What did you use the last time you experienced a travesty, something painful, a loss, a taking away? Probably in some sense, it was your imagining something better, or at least something different. I have worked in a bureaucracy for over 40 years, yet the most uninteresting people I have met and worked with, I would place in Cloverfield and make you a better film for their quirkiness, and certainly their innocence -- they are totally who they are. Would you truly trust any of these personalities in Cloverfield?Call me nuts, call me crazy, but I watched The Avengers recently, and it's all ""pie in the sky,"" so to speak.

658,myspiderungoliant,The way monster movies were meant to be.,9,19 January 2008,"I had been looking forward to this movie for months. I knew that it was being told from the perspective of a movie camera found after the fact, so I was prepared for a lot of crappy angles and jumpiness ala Blair Witch Project...but I was not expecting to be taken to the edge of my seat and held there for the remainder of the movie.The plot is fairly basic: some friends are gathered at a farewell party for one of their buds who has been offered a high paying job in Japan. The guy gets into an argument with a girl he slept with a month ago and she leaves in a huff. All of a sudden there is a tremor and the power flickers off and on. What then follows is terror and insanity beyond anything that Hollywould has thrown at me for the last 5 years. These people are trying to escape from the city when the central character gets a call from his friend who was injured and he decides to go rescue her.I will not make any attempt to describe what this creature looks like except this: if a mountain could be said to walk or stumble. It follows no body pattern that I can say belongs to one particular type of organism. Cthulhu of the Lovecraft mythos could not have been as huge, intense, or as insane as this beast. Absolutely NOTHING the army does to it seems to affect it in the slightest.This film does not tie up any loose ends, and to me that is a good thing. As with the Blair Witch Project its what you Don't see that makes this film. Most (if not all) of the loose ends are not tied up. If you absolutely must know what this creature was or if it was finally stopped, sorry but you will be disappointed.All in all this was an excellent film for what it is: a fast paced odyssey of pure destruction and chaos that, while it may not have great acting or much of a plot, will grab you and hold you in your seat...until it shakes the life out of you and swallows you whole that is.",Cloverfield

I went into this movie with the eagerness I once had seeing transformers (the 1980's one)and then this time i came out wishing i had watched something else and waited for the rental.FIrst off the movie is incredibly slow off the get go. A bunch of meaningless backstory which ultimately if you're a science fiction buff like myself wont care anything about. It took nearly I'd say a good chunk of the movie till they got to the actual part of the movie i came to see.The monster is nothing surprisingly. I wont give away details but it matches the typical swamp thing cliché. Also the movie gives you almost no reference just a bunch of whats this whats that how'd that happen etc etc etc, using a technique i call 'WHAT WAS THAT', basically looping the viewer in simply on curiosity.Also I have to complain about the shaky POINT AT THE DAMN SCENE camera control. There were a dozen times easily i was going to myself learn how to use the flippin camera. If this was a real doc i'd understand. THIS Isn't this is a totally fictional BUDGET movie so lets film like it. THey filled it full of nonsense simply as if to squeeze a bunch of meaningless 'stuff' in just to draw out time.In the end it really comes down to about an hour of back story and jargin added to 20 mins of 'Cool stuff'.Good for the sci fi buff but don't go in with high hopes.",Cloverfield

Something that makes you thinkwhat would you do if you were in that situation? How would you re-act? I liked the film. I really only had one real disappointment with this film and that was the how it was filmed through the eyes of a single camera. Some-what like ""The Blair Witch Project "" thankfully our camera person in this film was much less shaky then that of the Blair Witch crew so you could actually see what was taking place as it was happening. The character build up was nicely done. You're quietly introduced into the lives of a group of individuals that at a perfect time were all brought together. If not for this moment some may not even have spoken to one another. Within a second everything changes and the city feels like it's become a war zoneno one even knows what's going on.

663,Mattissimplythebest,Fun at the Cinema for adrenaline junkies,10,12 February 2008,"First up this story isn't exactly new, the monster attack on a big city is a well rehearsed and old favourite. What is new about this movie is that they take some One Tree Hill/The O.C. type twenty somethings, add a dash of humour, and a camcorder point of view and mix it together to create an unexpected and surprisingly exciting blend.The cameraman Hud, who spends most of the film documenting the film is the key source of why the film works; although the main story is about a guy and a girl - Hud is the one who makes sure the whole thing doesn't come across too seriously and it allows the audience an amount of breathing space within the non-stop action. I think whether you like this film will depend a lot on whether you find Hud funny or annoying; regardless of that though there are some wonderful apocalyptic shots of Manhattan to enjoy, and the monster itself is a site to behold.I walked out of the cinema and I had that strange feeling you get sometimes when a movie draws you into it's world and then casually spits you back into the real; for starters I kept expecting to hear deep rumbling noises and the site of nearby buildings being smashed to pieces. It is definitely a film that hits hard and fast and its nice to see something new for a change.

664,Shinzons,Feel it's might,9,8 April 2008,"The first thing i saw of Cloverfield was back on July 3rd, 2007. Me and my friend had met at our city's cinemas to see Transformers. The movie was great, and it had two trailers that greatly intrigued me. The first was I Am Legend (The Last man on Earth is not Alone), scared me. Definitely intrigued. I also saw the trailer for Cloverfield. Didn't know what was happening, just that there was a massive explosion, and then the head of the statue of Liberty came flying into the street, someone was screaming OMG, then, that was it. All we knew was that it was from J.J. Abrams, and that it would be coming out on 1/18/08. that was enough to get me intrigued. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and as the month's passed i got more and more excited for the 18th of January, 2008. When the day finally came, i saw it right after school. Never have i been more satisfied with a movie. It was laugh out loud funny at the right parts, had great characters, and was just as thrilling and scary and captivating as i had expected it to be. I have never been under more adrenaline in a movie theater in my life. I was even flexing my muscles during scenes without even realizing it. The movie was incredible in that it was actually able to live up to one of the biggest amounts of hype ever. I would see it five time in theaters. By the fourth and fifth time however, i was starting to get bored. understandably. That's the one problem with Cloverfield. I have realized that since it relied so much on suspense and shock, instead of eye candy, that after the first couple of times, you don't really get as much pleasure out of the movie. I know its kind of hard to judge based on my four consecutive seeings, but i think that even with DVD it still could be boring, although i haven't bought it yet. It's still fun to watch, because its so good, but i think the reason it wasn't the super blockbuster it could have been was because it didn't show enough scenes of buildings being demolished, or helicopters exploding. Still, the Cloverfield Monster was incredible, and you can't help but feel awed by it. The movie is good because it isn't scary primarily because of the little parasites, but because of the skyscraper sized carnivore. It is actually able to make something so fantastic, impossible, and big, scary, and an abandoned New York is the slaughter range. After seeing that thing, it is actually a little scary to walk at night, for fear it might appear. Because Cloverfield could capture that crucial and classic aspect of the monster movie genre, it is, i think, one of, if not the, greatest monster movies of all time. Go see the movie, and feel the might of the Cloverfield Monster.*I am going to go see the sequel. Cloverfield, 2009!",Cloverfield

All of done with the latest film school craze, the jumpy hand-held video camera. I saw it at a second-run/Dollar cinema (paid $1.75) and still felt ripped off.The sad part about this film is that if it had been made like a regular film and not some half-assed pseudo documentary, maybe you would have had an OK film. The idea of a Godzilla-type monster attack as told from the viewpoint of ordinary people, rather than from people (scientists, reporters, military, etc.) on the inside was an interesting idea. However, the shaky camera was painful to watch and took away from knowing what was going on in the movie. As it is, this should have been a bonus disc for a Godzilla DVD. My advise would be to run away from this film like you were running from Godzilla, Mothra, or anything else like that.",Cloverfield

The found footage style to the movie feels amazing. It makes you feel as if you were there, which is something most found footage movies don't do. It's also a very intense movie that grabs your interest near the beginning, seeing how the characters act before the Clover attacks New York City. And when the it does attack, it is as exciting and intense as it can be. When you see the Statue of Liberty's head land on the ground all scratched up, you know how powerful this thing is.

This movie was horrible. The concept was a pretty good idea I guess, but the movie sucked. Okay so I waited 20 minutes in the beginning to see a whole bunch of people talking and drinking and seeing this guy behind the camera trying to hook up with this girl. And when the action really started, it was just like looking at a video of September 11th and the movie the mist. I could not believe J.J. It also seemed like the smaller creatures that would jump on people were the bugs stolen from Starship Troopers. Except that he made them smaller. Those small buts attacked like the bugs from the movie. And was J.J. serious by have that camera move so much. I mean yes I understand that we are suppose to be viewing the movie from the point of view of a guy who is running for his life but still!!!! After all, it is a movie, how are we suppose to follow what is going on when almost everything is blurry. Another thing, what the heck was up with that scene when they medics take the girl who was bitten behind the screen. Did she explode or did they shot her brains out. The movie sucked.

The main characters do usual teen-horror scream-run and -""what the f will we do now?"" lines, and they do it quite well. Handycam technique and low field of view will make CGI if not believable then at least functional, and sound is really good on most parts.Only thing that disappoints is the storyline. It doesn't go really anywhere aside from showing thrills, doesn't answer questions and leaves you with glass half empty.

Cloverfield brought back a sense of excitement and delight for me.The movie draws you in, makes you a part of the experience. It succeeds primarily because of two things; what you see and what you hear.The movie does not have a major actor stealing the screen. Everyone is treaded just about equal. As the viewer you feel you are with the group as you are seeing the movie from the first person view. You feel connected to the characters as you understand that because of their loss, they have to set something right and not escape from the city. The movie draws you in and you feel like you are a part of the action.There is no music. Ambient sounds such as creeks and thumps don't distract you from looking at all the finer details. You stay focused on what's important and constantly entertained.One thing you must remember going into this movie. Remember the first 10 seconds of the movie (the stuff that comes right after the Star Trek teaser). If you keep that in mind everything will make sense and make the movie more pleasurable.",Cloverfield
671,miketigas25,Simply amazing,10,30 January 2008,"As a kid, I used to love watching monster movies. That's right! Watching a 15-minute introduction of characters, trying to guess who's gonna die next and how it's gonna happen and ultimately trying to out-guess friends on how the characters will manage to kill the ""monster"" were all part of the good old days.So when I heard about ""Cloverfield"", I got so excited. Of course, I had my doubts at first. I mean, I saw the trailers and really got a liiiittle disappointed upon learning that the movie was to be viewed through a video camera (I hate Blairwitch). I also hated the thought of speculating whether the guy/girl holding the camera would have the guts or sanity to keep ""filming"" while running away for their lives (because that's just stupid). Still, upon succeeding in convincing myself not to watch Aliens vs. Predators 2 (it's ALIENS vs. PREDATORS - why the heck are there people in it?!?!?! *roar*), I went on to watch the much-hyped monster movie.Personally, I think the movie succeeded in many ways. One is that it made me (or you) feel like it's NOT a movie. Yes. It sorta felt like the real thing. Why? Because of the camera. Another reason is that you actually feel like you're part of the group. It was an amazing experience. If only the guy holding the camera stopped talking, I would've really imagined myself to be the one looking in a first-person view.Of course, not every movie is perfect. Clearly, there were times when the guy holding the camera would've NATURALLY stopped filming. And some of the scenes were obviously UNNATURAL for a camera-holder's point of view.All in all, however, it was really an amazing work. Never before have I been pushed towards the edge of my seat when watching movies (let's see.. 10-year old me watching Godzilla?). Compared to the last three movies I've watched over the weekend (I am Legend, Sweeney. I resisted watching the ""others""), this movie is the probably the one that will last me for weeks. I do hope they make a part 2. I also hope that they'd include more ""stuff"" upon it's DVD release.Last note: don't mind what other people say or think about this movie.

672,Hannibal_Chigurh,Starting the year off with a colossal letdown,3,22 January 2008,"Jesus, what a disappointment. I didn't eat a thing all day cause I thought I'd get motion sickness from the movie. The only part of the movie that was unbearably shaky was the very beginning. For some reason, once the monster shows up the camera steadies a bit. Now, of course no sane individual would go towards the monster, cause if they didn't we'd have no movie. But I have an issue with the number of people who went. Out of the five who attempt to rescue Beth, only three have any business going. Rob wants to save his love, Jason naturally will follow his brother, and Jay's girlfriend will naturally follow Jay. Only problem, Jason doesn't go with Rob thanks to a series of unfortunate events. That rules out the reasoning for Lily to be there, and leaves only Rob with a legit reason to travel into the heart of Manhattan. Even then, Beth is not Rob's girlfriend; she is merely his crush. He is willing to risk his life and the lives of his idiot friends (he doesn't put up a fight when the volunteer to tag along) to save the chick who blew him off. That leaves Hud and Marlena. Marena barely knows any of these people, yet she tags along. At one point, she and Hud bring this up; Marlena busts a Clerks-like ""I'm not even supposed to be here!"" (which is true), and Hud questions why she came. Bad move! Films shouldn't call attention to their own plot holes unless it's for comedy's sake. Hud also has no reason to go, other than curiosity. Am I really supposed to believe that the guy can't wait long enough to get out and watch CNN in the morning? This was supposed to be intense and thrilling. The only real moment of suspense came in the subway tunnels with the lice. Even then, the setup for the scene was ludicrous. If you see a herd of mice (or any animal) running in one direction, run in that direction! They just power walk until they hear something, then stop and fidget with the camera. How stupid do you have to be? However, the lice attack was truly terrifying and the only real jolt of the film.The monster is the source of so many plot holes I couldn't focus on the movie. If this thing came from the depths of the ocean, how can it breathe on land? Why does it have legs? Even if it can breathe, how does it survive in the drastically different climate of land, where there isn't the crushing pressure of deep ocean as well as a different make up of nitrogen and oxygen? The thing looks so unadapted for marine life that I wish they had just made it an alien. Many people complain that they wanted more monster and less crappy acting. While the acting is bad, I think they gave you too much monster. Hud's final scene serves only to give us a closeup look of the thing, but we got a hell of a lot of revealing glances along the way (I assumed the way people talked about it that the most you got was a roar and a foot. Instead, you see the whole thing several times, but at a distance.) Also, the lice bring up questions. If they infect anything they bite leading to an Alien-like chestburster explosion of blood, why hasn't the monster been infected? I don't think there are enough creatures in the deep sea to feed the huge number of lice on the creature, so how have they survived the thousands of years that the monster has been underwater?Abrams and Goddard came up with this elaborate back story for the monster involving a Japanese corporation that makes a drink called Slusho. Note that what I'm about to say may seem like spoilers, but at no point in the movie does any of the following come up: Slusho's main ingredient is a super-sweet nectar found in the depths of the ocean. Apparently, this is the monster's source of food, and when the drink becomes a hit, Slusho mines the hell of it, draining the beast's food supply. If the thing lives off nectar, why does it have such a predatory mouth (it looks like it was made to kill)? It should be something like a proboscis to suck the nectar from the water. I understand that Abrams and Reeves couldn't reveal this within the confines of the first person POV of the film, so why bother? It's like they tried to tack on a point to the film, making it as much about consumerism's effect on the world we live in as Godzilla was about the atomic age. But you can't do that if it doesn't appear in the film. This is why I never got into Lost.The first person POV was something I got behind, and it remains the highlight of the film. It made the subway scene and some monster reveals actually scary and tense. The rest was just annoying. The group makes frequent stops that are too long, yet they make rash decisions during this time of rest. The dialogue is bad, but happily there isn't too much of it. It made me feel like I was there even though every shoddy line took me right back out. It also didn't help that whenever I saw Lily, I couldn't focus cause the moron is running around in heels. Yeah right.In the end, this was marginally entertaining at its best moments, but I spent way too much time laughing at the idiocies, bad acting, and glaring plot holes to be fully engaged with this film. 3/10",Cloverfield
673,targaid,Hand-held interference spoils reasonable premise.,1,31 January 2008,"The Blair Witch Project has a lot to answer for. None of it good.J.J. Abrams latest production has taken chunks of Godzilla and mixed them with Blair Witch's hand-held, reality TV style and web-buzz advertising and come up with a film equally annoying and devoid of interest.There's a good premise here which seems to be looking at the action in Godzilla from the viewpoint of ordinary citizens not involved in the main action. As a result the main monster is almost kept to the status of featured extra. The fact that the creature looks so much like the CGI from Godzilla helps this impression along nicely as does our heroes being chased through the subway by small versions of the parent. The cast are pretty and the performances more than adequate, but Abby & I were both ready to leave by 20 minutes in and afterwards we heard not one good comment from the assembled reviewers. Several did leave.What's the problem? It's that hand-held style. Leave aside that we're supposed to believe that a slacker who didn't want to use a camcorder he's never handled suddenly becomes an obsessive photo-journalist who continues to film even as being attacked or running from explosions. Forget that we're supposed to believe a domestic cam-coder can film constantly for about 8 hours on one battery and an SD Card (I want an SD card that can hold that much footage!). Ignore that the military don't take it from them as they run around filming their operations or that it's apparently indestructible. Forget all the stupid rubbish you're just meant to ignore and all the rip-offs from other films and being unable to care about most of the characters & their yuppie lives & concerns. The BIG problem is that hand-held style.There are times you can't even look at the screen it's so awful. In a thriller/horror movie the only thing that should make the audience look away is fear not motion-sickness induced by aimlessly waving the camera around. Long sequences pointed at the floor as people run, more lying at an awkward angle as the action flits incomprehensibly through the static frame or others pointed away from the action leaving only sound for a clue as to what's happening.The style is meant to make one feel part of the action. It's meant to give a sense of immediacy and truth and use the power of imagination to heighten the tension. What it does is get very irritating very quickly and soon becomes an insurmountable barrier to connecting with the story. Did no-one watching the rushes spot this? Or were they all too busy feeling self-satisfied & clever? Hell, they couldn't even be bothered coming up with a real title; they named it after the street the production offices were in. SHows the level of thought they actually put into this mess.Total turkey. Avoid at all costs.",Cloverfield
674,eagle804,terrible.,1,22 April 2008,"I'm really surprised this has such a high rating. the only thing good thing going for this ""piece"" is that it had a decent budget. what a waste!the filmmakers were smart not to release such a spawn of 'the blair witch project' until years later but one doesn't easily forget such an original film that quickly. if this had been the first i might be singing a different tune but regardless...And so 'Godzilla' has been in hibernation for a while, it doesn't mean that we have or have we? with such a high rating on here it makes me wonder. i resent wasting my time on this movie and if the rest of us ever wake up i'm sure you would too.",Cloverfield
675,Infest0125,Pure genius,10,18 January 2008,This movie was definitely one of the greatest movies I've seen in a very long time... The effects were great along with the acting and it was actually incredibly freaky... There was one plot hole though. Where did the monster come from? I may have missed something but there was nothing about where the monster came from... I won't say what the monster looked like but I could have never imagined what he was or what he does... It is not one of those cheesy monster movies that made in Japan (Although a reference to Japan is made) and the monster design and what it does is actually very original... They actually do a fairly good job of hiding the monster too especially for something that size. The only amazing shot of it is at the end of the movie... Either way I recommend you see it no matter what!,Cloverfield
676,enzedder,Don't have preconceived ideas,8,17 January 2008,"I was expecting some sort of Godzilla 'after' September 11th thriller but I was WAY off. I'd even heard some bad reviews - again, cannot agree with them. I don't want to say anything of the adventure in the film, suffice to say that while watching it, one will undoubtedly put oneself in the action and will be thinking of one's own family and friends. It's not often that one sees people coming face to face with a fear such as this in film that isn't accompanied by music, different camera angles and other features of film that remove one from the reality that could be experienced. Graphics, movement and, of course, acting all contribute this one hell of a document... erm, film.",Cloverfield
677,keith-774,Not What I Expected,4,29 January 2008,"This show is a combination of Alien, Godzilla, The Blair Witch Project, and Beverly Hills 90210. It wasn't what I was expecting (which was a good monster movie).1) The first 20-30 minutes which, theoretically, was setting up all the character interrelationships was BORING! It was worse than watching a soap opera. (Note to J.J. Abrams: twenty-somethings who pout in their bedrooms because their childhood sweetheart is dating another guy DON'T become corporate vice-presidents. Sheesh!) My wife and I were literally leaning forward to stand up and walk out when the first bang happened (we're still not sure if staying was the better choice). Most of the info delivered in this prelude went unused in the movie, so it could have been shortened to five minutes without losing a thing.2) The FAQ is dead wrong about Beth's wounds. She had a piece of rebar through her shoulder, for crying out loud. All the adrenaline in the world wouldn't have stopped her from bleeding out in about twenty minutes after they lifted her off it. If, by some divine miracle, she didn't bleed out, her left arm would have been utterly useless, and rapidly and overwhelmingly painful. The movie portrays Beth as fundamentally uninjured by the end of the movie. Dumb.3) People talented enough to become corporate vice presidents rarely associate with people as brain-dead stupid as Hud. I'm surprised they didn't show his urine-soaked pants after he died.I'd go on, but it's not worth it. ""I Am Legend"" was much, much, much better. Better suspense. Better storyline. Better acting. Better movie. And that's despite knowing the storyline from watching ""The Omega Man"" years ago. When you remove the effect of motion sickness caused by the bouncing camera or the rising pulse of the beeping emergency strobes in the buildings (did you think we wouldn't notice, J.J.?), there isn't much to be scared about in ""Cloverfield."" By the way, other than being the secret document name of the government file we are purportedly watching, the word ""cloverfield"" has absolutely NOTHING to do with the movie.Dumb. I'm glad I only paid matinée pricing to see this movie.",Cloverfield
678,sabenge,"What to say, what to say...",1,6 February 2008,"Here goes...First and foremost, anything that relies on a gimmick as a major selling point is normally nothing more than a ploy. I'm referring to both the filming and marketing style.The necessity of the party scene made sense. The introduction of the protagonists. Although, the characters offered the audience almost no opportunity to empathize or even understand who they were or how they felt. Instead, we were treated to people who had no real problems. They had no depth. If they intentionally weren't supposed to have depth, that would mean that the central focus of the movie would be on the monster as it is the other medium of expression. This can't be true, though, as the monster receives very little screen time and no back story.The beginning shows the time stamp in the lower left hand corner. This only reoccurs as the snippets of Rob and Beth's relationship are shown. The rest of the film doesn't have this time stamp. Most, if not all camcorders, automatically show this unless the feature is turned off. Since this was turned on the last time the camcorder was used, I doubt it was turned off. It's appearance throughout the film, I'm sure, may have been offsetting, but it would fit in with the motif the director was going for and dispel some of the ambiguity that plagues the film.The director seemed like he wanted to remind people that it was filmed with a hand-held camera at times. The camera would shake excessively for almost no reason.Rob is obviously no older than 28. To get promoted to VP of a company is more than impressive (even more far-fetched) at this age.Some people try to defend this movie based on the claim that it is original, unlike the majority of Hollywood films that have been made recently. Boy falls in love with Girl. Boy and Girl have a falling out. Boy is confronted with own mortality and loss. Boy feels stronger than ever about Girl. Boy saves Girl. Boy and Girl confess their love for each other. I rest my case.The cameraman constantly repeats the same things over and over.The monster hadn't been to the area where Beth lived when Rob arrived to save her. If it had, the destruction would have been greater. How then, did one building fall to the side to be braced by another building? If the resulting tremors of the monster's actions caused this, isn't it then logical that the second building would have fallen as well? If the building lost the structural integrity at it's base to fall over in the first place, it would have toppled over entirely regardless of the bracing affect of the second building. Of course, this is all hypothetical.Beth gets impaled, yet can run around once they get out of the building. Adrenaline can only do so much, and can't logically be used as an excuse as she would have been nauseous from blood loss.The sound effects made by the spawn creatures were laughable at best. Maybe they were meant to be a throwback to older science fiction films and not a theft of them.When Hud goes to retrieve the camera after miraculously surviving the helicopter crash, the monster ""sneaks up on him"". To make matters more confusing, all but Hud's head is devoured by a monster that is the size of a skyscraper while Rob and Beth are able to run up and get the camera, that is unscathed, without being touched.As for the claims of this being an allegory for the 9/11 attacks, that would have to imply that the writer has the capacity to understand such complex ideas as art representing life. This claim is as dumb as the woman who made a list of songs that have no subtextual correlation to anti-American values or in most cases anything violent and having them banned because she believed they reminded victims of the attack.This list merely scratches the surface of a film that condemned itself to a sub-par story by it's own faulty mechanisms. The use of the first person POV limits the story more than forwards it. The Hitchcock idea of letting the mind draw it's own conclusions leaves this movie desperately wanting. I can formulate some sort of idea as to why the bites from the seedlings cause a person to ""explode."" I can understand why Rob decided to save Beth. I can even understand why the other three characters decided to go with him, but every explanation for every event throughout the entire film seems entirely too convenient.",Cloverfield
679,RichFlower,Horrible,1,25 May 2018,"One of the worst films I""ve ever seen. Jerky, amateur cinematography made me nauseous, as did Blair Witch, only this was worse. Even fast forwarding the DVD didn't help. I can't stress how horrible this film is. It's not even enjoyably-bad, as some bad films are. it's migraine bad. A total waste of time.",Cloverfield
680,RCD1321,Wow...,9,20 January 2008,"Seriously, that's about all I could say, or think after walking out of the theater at the end of this movie. I still remember nearly having a heart attack when I fist saw the teaser for this movie before Transformers. It left a lot of questions and I immediately went crawling on the web to find answers. JJ Abrams and his crew that put in a lot of really hard work did a very impressive job keeping this under wraps and building the almost endless and impatient-inducing hype. From the beginning of the film all the way to the end I was constantly craving more. Some critics say the acting was terrible, but to them I show them a certain finger, because honestly, if you were running around NYC fearing for your life, how would you act? The story, which the audience can relate to, revolves around, for the most part, Hud and his best friend Rob (Hud being the comic relief behind the camera). Rob is leaving for Japan with a new VP position at some unnamed company (my guess from the start was Slush-O, look at what shirt Rob's brother, Jason, is wearing). Weeks before Rob sleeps with his good friend (and as we find romantic interest) Beth, what do you know, Rob falls in love. Then the night of his going away party he sees Beth and it pretty much ruins his fun, that is until the ground shakes and the power fails temporarily. Enter: ""Cloverfield"" from the ocean tearing off the head of the Statue of Liberty and capsizing a ship on it's entrance into Manhattan. The rest of the film continues with Hud behind the camera and Rob with a small group of close friends in tow in a desperate attempt to save Beth and flee from this creature. There is the story that I can tell without ruining the film. This unique style that hasn't really been done before (we'll just forget Blair Witch on this one) really gives the audience a new view on a movie not yet seen, the first person perspective of the main characters. Yes, you see the monster, and they do a great job of teasing you with small glimpses of it (and the smaller almost more terrifying creatures that come with it). The special effects are well done, and the action scenes involving the Army are just as intense as the destruction this creature unleashes. A ""you never know what'll happen next"" ""edge of your seat"" thrill ride- sorry to sound cliché'd. I loved this movie and really hope they follow through with the rumored plans to make another from a different perspective. If you like monster movies, thrillers, action, and keep-you-guessing films this is one you must check out. Hey, if it's good enough to beat out Star Wars: SE and Black Hawk Down on the opening weekend box office records then it must be good. $41 million and counting can't be wrong!",Cloverfield
681,MartinPh,Emperor's new clothes,1,22 February 2008,"Spoilers... Really now, what's to spoil? Story lines don't come any thinner than this. Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere, destroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of commitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous intro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense, no explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is saved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's intentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of inspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty foot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders  contact with which will make you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One does wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big cities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling imagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison for decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live', shaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch rip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt insulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just sheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs.",Cloverfield
682,starman-wa,Found footage with a big monster,6,28 October 2015,"I had few expectations watching this movie and was pleasantly surprised with the result. The special effects are all good, the camcorder shot footage is a bit annoying but at least it is good quality and well edited.Acting was good even though there were no big name actors, they made the characters believable and likable and they were all given a good development throughout the movie. The exception was the camera guy - don't know if it was his acting or just the character but I found him annoying.As for the monster - I like how it was not seen much at the start - tantalising us as to what it might be, but needed far more work around the background and reason it was there, this lack of necessary detail loses several points for me.Worth watching but don't expect much around the monster story, this is about the group of peop0le caught up in the action.",Cloverfield
683,nightswatch,sneak peek early screen,8,10 January 2008,"I attended an early screening 1/10/08 at Michigan State University. I've spoilerized in case anyone doesn't want to know anything about the film, but I will try to stay away from anything that'll be too overt.Simply put, the film is an amazingly visceral experience. It's studio logo, production logo, film. No credits whatsoever, which just adds to the overall immediacy of it. If you've been following it to any degree whatsoever, you know that it's shot entirely with hand-held cameras. The characters also run. A lot. So immediately, I think this will be a love hate experience. My own reaction to it was that it again, added to the immersion, and I didn't find it to be really distracting at all. Many people I saw it with said they couldn't even watch the screen at times, so buyer beware. It also will anger those who need all the details, and need to have every loose end tied up (or even a majority of them). The entire film is the tape found after the events of the film are over. That's it. There is no set up, and no hold-your-hand-for-you resolution (or really, much of one at all). It's unconventional, and I enjoyed the ending TREMENDOUSLY. I definitely have to applaud the decision to not simply make a cookie cutter action film that is easy to watch. I think it will be interesting to watch how it does at the box office though.After that...I feel like there isn't much that can be said about the acting, and that should be a credit to it. It absolutely feels like you are experiencing this with the characters, who feel more or less exactly like real people. After leaving the theater I was on edge for a good deal of time, as I tried to shake that level of immersion. The film is also surprisingly humorous, and I would say that our crowd laughed more than they screamed (although the screams were definitely there).Cloverfield definitely will not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you're already excited about it, I have no doubt that you'll be satisfied. It was a relatively unique experience, and again I want to applaud the decision to make it in that manner.Definitely recommended: 8/10",Cloverfield
684,Tom-91,An interesting approach,8,23 February 2008,"**Spoilers, of course, below**While I would be the first to admit that a great many points in this film were hardly original, I have to say that I have never seen them all used in such a way.Certainly, if you were looking for the standard Godzilla or King Kong fare, you were disappointed. This film isn't about monsters. It was simply made a lot more interesting by including one. This film could have been made about an earthquake, a nuclear attack; just about any disaster, and most of it could have been done with little change. The points wasn't the monster, the point was what it would be like if you had to be on the run for your survival.I would guess that this is something relatively new for Americans and Western Europeans to contemplate. Unless you've been in a major earthquake or some such, running for your life on this scale is not something we have ever had to do. Certainly not in an urban setting. In many parts of the world, running from an army, militia, or some such is sadly a part of regular life. That is my take on the film: putting you in a nearly non-stop run-for-your-life scenario in a very real setting (and a very unreal cause).The first person perspective was great, and extremely important. Too many times, films ""take you there"", but you aren't there. A lot of people were reminded of ""Blair Witch"" but I was more reminded of ""Private Ryan"". This use of hand held video forces the audience to leave the safety of the theater and enter the world of disaster. Has it been done before? Sure. But it has really not been done in this kind of a film before.In closing, I have to wonder what people were thinking when they claim this somehow reminiscent of 9-11. I didn't see it. Were buildings knocked over? Yes. Were there people running for their life? Yes. But, that is standard in any disaster film. Have we reached the point that filming on any disaster film can't take place in any urban setting because ""that's too much like 9-11."" I hope not!",Cloverfield
685,northwatuppa,"viewer alert: crazy making camera work, otherwise good creature feature",5,26 April 2008,"I am writing this review specifically to alert viewers who might not yet be aware of the camera work in this film. If you know about that and don't care, you needn't read what I have to say.First, camera work aside, it is a fresh, engaging, well-done creature feature. I can find no fault with the script, the directing, the f/x, or anything like that. I kind of enjoyed that part of it.BUT this film takes shaky cam to a new, nauseating level--to an insane level. The film is photographed ENTIRELY, BEGINNING TO END, as if it were shot using a hand held, consumer quality, video camera by someone who has never, or hardly ever, used a video camera before and who is, once the creature shows up, running and jumping for his life most of the time. The camera *almost* never stops moving and a lot of that time it is moving *wildly*. Once things get moving in the film, you almost never see more than a split second of still footage at a stretch.And it isn't just that. They keep in all of the weird, random, accidental junk shots--pants legs, shoes, blank walls, stair steps, railings, etc., etc., etc., that most people would edit out of their home movies.They might as well have suspended the camera from a slinky and bounced it off the floor and walls of the set. Let's just say I spent a lot of time wishing the kid with the camera would get killed so the picture would stop jumping around. It about made me seasick, literally.Now, if you really don't mind that, if you really aren't expecting an actual movie with actual cinematography and professional-style camera work, where you can kind of see what is happening and absorb the acting and the characters and the f/x and kind of zone out and enjoy the mayhem and the weirdness ... if that isn't what you are looking for, then this film's for you. However, if crazy-super-jumpy camera work ins't your cup of tea, then take a pass on this one.",Cloverfield
686,pfeiferlj,Dizzy,2,2 April 2016,"Filmed as if holding a hand-held smart phone. Many scenes involved swooping back and forth, up and down, slanted angles, and sometimes shaky (emphasis on hand-held) which made me dizzy to the point that I couldn't finish the film. Rather than adding a sense of realism, the phone-screen filming approach felt gimmicky. It made me nauseous. I could see using the hand-held phone screen a few times for style, but the technique is way over-used in this movie, in my opinion,and tires quickly. The plot itself is a good story with good acting and script, but the confines of the smart phone filming limited how long I could watch it without closing my eyes, not from fear but from feeling dizzy. I wish I could have given this film more stars, but filming techniques shouldn't get in the way of telling a story. In my personal experience, with this movie, the filming techniques became the story.",Cloverfield
687,Ianmcane,Dozer-field,2,13 October 2008,"Oh God, what a joke! This was a joke, right?No, sadly it wasn't. If it was, and the film-makers had fully-embraced it as a 'monster- spoof' then maybe the complete lack of any discernible, feasible and intelligent plot could be forgiven and we could just get on with laughing at it. They could of perhaps even have woven in some funny jokes and stuff. But no, no, this is for real. This is a real 'woooooh, scary' monster thriller, devastatingly and terrifyingly immersing you in the action through the ingenious (and completely original) decision to film it entirely on handy-cam.The plot begins at a............oh who cares anyway. Seriously, this excuse for a plot is beyond stupid and i can't even be bothered to go over all the gaping holes and logic failures that litter this rubbish. Just read any of the 1-star reviews on this site; they pretty much sum it up, if you're really interested.So here's my two stars. One for the feeble attempt to assemble some sort of plot to carry this tripe, together with the cast and their half-hearted acting (all forming one single, shiny star) and the second for the technically well-executed CGI effects.Right, i'm off to find that nuclear-resistant, reinforced-titanium poly-alloy, fission-powered, night-vision-enabled super-handy-cam, and give the makers of this film a bloody good thrashing with it until they realise that we don't want to know what the conclusion was and that making 'Cloverfield 2: They Have Found Us Again' would be a really, really monstrous idea.",Cloverfield
688,dj_wang,A Monster Movie About Human Bonds Very Well Done,8,26 January 2008,"What makes life meaningful? As human beings, what kinds of experiences contribute to an existence with purpose and significance? These are the kinds of questions that watching ""Cloverfield"" made me ponder.It's a movie about a monster, but the monster is just the ""catalyst"", the ""pressure"", the ""mover"" that really tells a story about the bonds between people and those bonds being tested under great duress.One of my fellow moviegoers told me he read some people left the theater crying after seeing the movie. I can believe it. People who knew what it was like to have truly strong bonds formed with other people. People who knew what real friendship was. People who knew what love was. People who long deeply for these things in their own lives (I would be one of them, though I did not cry, though I would have been OK with doing so. I have before. Crying feels...good.) The movie made me think about the separation and distance we all feel between us and how powerful experiences like the one in ""Cloverfield"" force us together. I think we are seriously lacking these kinds of experiences in our society, the kind that prompt us to drop our barriers and connect with one another because a potent situation demands it. Now, the city we live in being attacked by a giant monster is highly unlikely (still could happen though...who knows what lies buried in the Earth's depths...), but there are plenty of powerful experiences we could make a regular part of the time we spend alive as humans. Any experience which demands that people rely on one another would do.The movie makes me realize, keenly, I need these kinds of experiences in my life. So, was it a good movie? It made me think these kinds of deep thoughts, so I'd say : yeagh.Oh, and ""Marlena"" was a great character. She represents a new kind of personality type emerging in our society. Outwardly attractive in an unconventional way with a disconcerting reservation on the surface covering a noble soul within. Her heroism struck a resonant chord in my heart. ""Hudd"", in his duh-ish simplicity, was attracted to a special girl. I liked that.",Cloverfield
689,Stevek-48,"Very good, but I wanted it to be better!",8,25 June 2008,"I'd heard lots of good things about this film and have just watched the DVD version of it. I enjoyed it enormously - the writer, director and actors did a great job, but somehow there was something missing for me.There are a couple of conceits in the story that are necessary, but just a little annoying. Why do these outer space monsters always attack big cities? Why is it always New York? Yes it looks good having the Statue of Liberty's head rolling down the street, but... And I defy anyone to be under attack from a hardly seen monstrous creature and still try to film it rather than running for their lives. But they're small points.The hand-held thing is good - it's kind of Blair Witch, but with an actual plot. Occasionally it's a bit wearing, but I really like the way it allows us to see glimpses of different parts of the story and just a hint (mostly) of the monster. The monster itself is a bit bizarre. It's not actually that scary, except for the fact that it's incredibly huge. You don't see that much of it, just the results of its actions. Not explaining where it comes from or why it's here is a great way to unsettle an audience. There's nothing reasonable or even credible about what it's doing. It's just on a rampage and we're in the way. Is it eating people because it's hungry or just because they're there. Given the size of it we can't be much more than an olive starter for the monster, so it's not really clear why it would even bother.The actors do a great job, with what is really almost an improvised piece (or it sounds like it is - no offence to the writer!) Trying to make these characters real and making an audience care is not easy. And the fact that any one of them can be killed at any time ups the tension (not like your normal stalk and slash film where you can just about tell who is going to die and who'll be in the final reel). And those parasite things are a little too reminiscent of the facehuggers in Alien.It's a bleak film - there's no happy ending, no tidy tying up of all the plot points and no explanation at all of what actually happened.I really enjoyed the film - and I can't even really put my finger on why it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The tension is high, but it didn't leave me gasping in amazement. it just lacks a certain something that would have really racked up the suspense and I think that's a missed opportunity. Still it's definitely a film worth watching.",Cloverfield
690,jgibbon08,"Entertaining, tense thriller",8,20 January 2008,"When I saw the first Cloverfield trailer during Transformers, I was in awe. It was unlike any trailer I had ever seen before, having no title, been shot with a hand-held digital camera, and having zero recognizable stars. I ran home after the movie to find out more about the film. For six months, me and millions of other moviegoers turned the internet upside down looking for answers, getting only random inexplicable photos on 1-18-08.com and fake additional trailers. And on January 18th, our prayers were answered, and we flocked to our nearest movie theater to end our guesses and speculation.It's difficult to imagine anything being worth the wait. No film could have surpassed the excitement of a clip of a massive explosion in the middle of New York, and the statue of liberty's head being hurled at unsuspecting citizens. But if you can lower your expectations slightly and keep in mind that it will not change cinema, you will find that ""Cloverfield"" is quite enjoyable.The first fifteen or so minutes of the film introduce our heroes, who are throwing a good-bye party for their friend Rob Hawkins, who is moving to Japan for a job. The subplot is set up at the party, conveniently all within earshot of the cameraman, who has been told to ""document"" the night. This opening is just short enough and has just enough humor to keep the viewer from shouting at the screen to demand that the monster appear.And soon enough, the monster comes with full force. Like you all have seen in the trailer, it begins its tirade by setting off an explosion in downtown Manhattan and tearing off the head of the statue of liberty. To make matters worse, the larger monster is accompanied by smaller monsters, which are also hostile and deadly. For the next hour, our heroes travel through the streets and underground tunnels to find a missing friend and get to safety.The characters of the film are not particularly deep, and there is hardly any development. But there's just enough to make the viewer care about them, and hope that they can all escape safely. The film is shot entirely by a hand-held camera, much like in ""The Blair Witch Project"", which at times can make the shots seem quite shaky. Though I did not experience this, a common complaint about ""Cloverfield"" is that you feel dizzy at times. But the cameraman manages to hold the camera steady for the parts that matter, especially those that are heavy on the special effects.What is most remarkable about ""Cloverfield"" is the budget. For just $25 million, we get to see special effects that are comparable to those of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Godzilla"", both of which had budgets of at least 5 times that of ""Cloverfield"". The setting looks like New York, and the explosions look real. It would not have been surprising to hear the budget costing as much as $150 million. I guess it goes to show you that well-known actors and large production teams really can jack up the price.The film runs quite short, a crisp 84 minutes. The viewer will most likely be left with a desire for more. But there's an old saying, and that's take what you can get, and what you get is a very entertaining show.",Cloverfield
691,Gbradley13,Very Good Movie,7,18 January 2008,"What's good about it: It was a new movie and not a remake or anything like that. There was a lot of nonstop action (and not as much talking like other monster movies.). It felt like you were in the movie running with the main characters and it felt really real.What's bad about it: The camera was shaking nonstop, so it was sometimes hard to concentrate. Also how the monster wasn't shown as much as I think it should have been. Also the ending was a little disappointing.Overall: Very good movie, although the camera made you dizzy by the time the movie ended. The movie felt pretty real (although they could have shown the monster a little more). The movie's ending was a little disappointing, but I can see why they made it like that. Overall it was something new that was actually really good!

692,algjgg,An Absolute HUGE adrenaline rush,10,19 January 2008,"Cloverfield is by far the most unique movie of 2008. And it's definitely the most shocking. If you've been waiting to see this movie, go see it. It may not suit everyone, but its bound to scare a lot of people. It's always in your face, with every moment seeming so real thanks to the camera perspective. It's by this lone element that makes Cloverfield scary. And yes you are guaranteed to jump out of your seat at least once. I jumped a total of three times, each one bigger than the last. It's unique, it's scary, and it's the most mysterious and shocking movie of the year (so far).",Cloverfield
693,Faisal-Hashmi,"Stylish, scary, and smashingly good.",9,10 February 2008,"Tighten up, and enter the theater for one of the best movie-going experiences of all time. Cloverfield is an intense and brilliantly made horror/monster movie, highly stylized in direction, and handled with successful execution.The film follows five young New Yorkers who throw their friend a going-away party on the same night that a gigantic monster attacks the city.Though the movie takes it time to start off with introducing the characters, it takes a split-second in the movie to start right off to the point, and takes the fast pace and suspense all the way to the last frame. The special effects are brilliantly handled, making the movie all the more believable, with its handycam view, though might be distracting for some, is actually a great way to show the movie through the eyes of the victims, rather than using aerial shots and pans.Overall, this is a must-watch for the new generation who even have a passing interest in the genre, and sets a new milestone in movie-making.",Cloverfield
694,dedeurs,Underrated movie,8,9 September 2018,"Cloverfield, while not perfect, is a clever film. It starts with a boring and seemingly overlong party. So when finally something is happening, you will sit straight. Another strong point is that the horror happens too fast for the people of NewYork. For the cinemaviewers too. That, and the uncontrolled camera movements, works very well. What I kept in memory mostly is Lizzy Caplan sitting in that subway tunnel. Huge eyes. I never saw an actress express SHOCK so convincingly. Complaints all around that the 'villain' is hardly in view, or not clear enough. But that is how it would be had it been a real disaster. At such moments no one is able to keep a camera still and be concerned with focus. 9/11 is sort of an example: the shots in the streets very close to the towers and inside the lobbies; shaky, chaotic, moments of overexposure from daylight and lowering of the recorder so only the ground is filmed. And these filmers were profs with professional camera's.Cloverfield works far better than the rather aimless Blair Witch Project. I found the ending a bit too abrupt, and realized only later that the 1h 25m film really SPEEDS by.",Cloverfield
695,frich71-1,holy hell i didn't think it was possible,1,21 January 2008,"a movie as bad as AVP:r and I didn't even have to wait a month.I promised I wouldn't see it. Then a friend came into to town and talked me into it. Blair Witch with a budget. Just what I thought it would be.Much like AVP:r Cloverfield lacks just about everything, such as: a plot, decent writing, believable sympathetic characters, continuity and direction. You suck JJ and if you ruin Star Trek, which based on your casting choices I think is likely, I'm going to be extremely peeved.Not once did this movie honestly build tension. All tension is created by way of gimmick, ie a quick flash of the camera to an incident. Why is this movie so bad? Because like Blair Witch, which I hated and thought was over-hyped unentertaining trash, the use of the shaky cam is a cheap way to try and build tension the script lacks. Ooooh things are bouncy, they must be running, crash, oohh someone fell--oops. But whereas the BWP was tolerable visually Cloverfield is not. The theater was full when the movie started...not so full when the crap finally mercifully ended. Memo to JJ..shaky cam OK, but you can't focus on strobing lights---are you trying to kill people via seizures? Between the bright lights and nonstop jitter it is hard for someone who doesn't have motion sickness or epilepsy to watch this movie. I'm just glad the people who got sick were able to get up and leave and didn't try and force themselves to stay and suffer worse health problems.Finally, how do these movies get funded? ""I have no script. I don't want name actors. It's going to be shot POV handcam. Monster. Statue of Liberty's head will roll. You in?"" ""Why sure that sounds wonderful? But how you going to market it?"" ""Well, glad you asked. We film the trailer first. We leak it on the web. Viral marketing. People will see the trailer. 1-18-08. People will try and solve the riddle of Slusho. 1-18-08. That is all."" All aspiring directors, hire a good web based marketing firm then you can produce a five dollar movie and make a fortune. I'm sure the CG, which was clipped and well awful in Cloverfield, was costly but other than that this movie was done on the cheap. The bare bones cheap. The honest to god must've paid cast and crew with beer cheap.Now a new age old conundrum is born. Which is worse, AVP:r or Cloverfield? Well only about a dozen people shared the theater with me on DEC 26 for AVP:r and none ran out to puke--then again at least a few people leaving Cloverfield were smiling. I don't know.",Cloverfield
696,grindhouse_fan,The most thrilling and horrifying film ever made since 'Donnie Darko'.,10,9 April 2008,"I say that this is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Visually and freakishly strong. The first time you see it you say like: Whoa! Because it's pretty shocking. The photography is genius. So magnificent. And the thing that is recorded with a video camera makes it even shocker even though that some people may get dizzy.This is the work of a genius. Anyone who's studying cinema got to see this film. Yeah, this movie is very original. I mean, the decapitation of the Statue of Liberty and that the film is recorded with a video camera it is the thinking of a genius (Drew Goddard).The 85 minutes are really worthy and from beginning to end the film maintains you to the edge of the seat. Some people will say that I'm wrong but I'm not wrong but this is one of the best sci-fi movies you'll ever see.Verdict: This is one of those barely movies you do not want to miss.",Cloverfield
697,rblade963,Not that intelligent a film,4,8 September 2008,"Well for those who loved this film well, sorry you didn't see the same film we did. For those who hated this film well, your not that far off from true enlightenment. For those who thought it was OK we have given this film a better review than it probably deserved.It was just OK for me. I just seen it and didn't know anything of the film before hand.I enjoy intelligent film making where the technical details and realism is somewhat in check. This movie was not in any way remotely kept in check.Didn't mind the first person filming (that much) but would have been nice to see other shots to add to the realism and emotions of the characters. First person filming in this way creates confusion and disorientation as to were you are like, ""is the camera on the ground"" or ""against a wall"" very disorienting. Cannot place this with Blair Witch as that film was total crap this film did have some redeeming factors that Blair Witch did not have. (Like a budget)Problems I have with this film. -spoilers-IMO Both characters at the end were dead long before they made it to hide under the bridge. The girl with the re-bar threw the (left) shoulder and near her heart and they lift her body and slide the re-bar threw her ... yea, she would have bled out in no time and passed out from the pain yet she is very mobile and the use of her left arm was amazing after suffering that type of injury.The guy after the heli crash (her pseudo boyfriend) suffers a leg injury that requires a belt to be used as a tourniquet yet he remains extremely mobile and doesn't bleed out before they reach the bridge at the end no way in hell is that possible.The massive injury suffered by the quiet girl in the subway tunnel wasn't even bleeding when we see her back and she really doesn't seem to be in any real pain or seems to have a life threatening injury by the way the other characters react to it. she says ""how does it look"" , reply ""it looks like it hurts"" but she isn't crying, wheezing, moaning heck she is fine.There are way to many non-intelligent items in this film to list here and agree with other comments here about how ...You don't care about the characters they are stupid and not believable. I cared more for the monster I really did. After they bombed it and the guy is recording it from the chopper I was worried until I seen the monster preform that amazing jump up to the chopper and caused it to crash was the first time I was excited in the film ""He's OK!"" wow that was an amazing jump. I thought the chopper was higher but I guess somehow it dropped altitude and the monster got it.Yea, thank god it was a rental for me.

It's about dumb, early twenties, party goers who run away from a monster that is terrorizing the city. That's about it. No deeper story line (some vagueattempt at a bigger story but too weak to qualify), no interesting dialog, hand-held camera technique is just a gimmack to make you forget that the movie is simply horrible. They don't really do anything to try to survive, they don't try to figure out how to help themselves, they are completely helpless, and stupid. Without a plot, without dialog,without characters you care a wit about, I just don't see the point. If you're intelligent and in your thirties and up, don't bother. In you're in your twenties, and not too bright...Enjoy.",Cloverfield
700,TonesH,A surprisingly good film,7,26 January 2008,"I have to admit, this was not a film that I would have seen on my own accord. I hadn't heard of it when my friend invited me to this, and after a bit of research I was put off by two things: firstly that it was a monster film, and that it involves hand-held camera. But in the end this was a surprisingly effective monster flick, up to the same standard as The Host.Firstly I was not captivated by this movie. The beginning bit in the party was frankly quite irritating. I grew to quickly dislike most people, particularly the guy behind the camera. I think that not much character development was made, nor was it throughout the film. I think I would have preferred to have come in when the action begins, not really knowing who these people were. The core of this film is the action, not the characters.The action is surprisingly good. The special effects were fantastic, and even in vast New York one feels a certain claustrophobia. The pacing was very good, and the action was nicely quick. It wasn't lingered on, and it wasn't built up to. It was sudden and horrific, making it seem more like the danger could come from anywhere at any time. The danger of the large beast and then the little creatures made the danger feel both epic and personal.I had heard before this film that we wouldn't see the creature, and that certainly would have disappointed me, I think. I think that the hand-held really made the creature more real, as we only see brief glimpses of it until the very end (which sort of countered the effectiveness of the rest of the movie, to an extent). The fact that we didn't really know what the creature was, or what its intentions were, made the movie far more effective, as one never knew what was going to happen. Nor did the movie fall into that irritating trap of the stranger who knows everything, and comes and goes at different times.One thing that frustrated me was the going back to the previous tape of the couple. I think I would have liked it better if that was our only knowledge of the characters. I think it was underused as a device, because it really only happened four or five times. I think I would have proffered it if the last scene, and the last video flashback, were our first real insight into who those people were. But such is life.In the end I thought that this was a terrific monster movie, certainly one of the best I have seen in a long time.",Cloverfield
701,jeff934,Shouldn't this also have been labled as a comedy?,6,16 March 2009,"OK, first off I'll admit when this first came out I wanted to watch it so badly. But due to money reasons I couldn't see it in theater so I waited and it came out on DVD. Once again I wasn't able to watch it but this last Sunday I finally got my hands on it. I wasn't sure what to expect to be honest, I knew it was about a monster that attacked a city that much I knew. But now that I've watched it I'm not sure if this was the intended effect but honestly I couldn't help but laugh my butt off. It seems that some actors used too much emotions while others didn't use any at all. It seems that they couldn't have a target zone for emotions, Rob was all over the freaking place and Hud... I'll be honest in my opinion Hud was annoying. He seemed to be overly energetic considering a 15 story monster is coming through town and just laying waste to everything. I'm really wondering if he did some drugs or something prior to the attack. Even when he got eaten by the monster there was a comedic effect with that, even the monster couldn't handle Hud anymore and spit him out.Now lets talk about some of the things I noticed in the movie I stated this earlier but was it me or was Hud really annoying? The guy was told in strict confidence that someone slept with another person so what did he do? He ran all over the party just blabbing it out. I mean seriously if this guy was at my party I'd thrown him out the window by the time I got to talk to him.Next, there is the issue of the little monsters in the subway but isn't it me or did the monsters make the same sound that the Hamburgler from McDonalds use to make? You know the whole ""Wobble Wobble"" sound, I hear that and it's like whatever intensity they were trying to build up for this movie just got trashed because of that sound, I heard it and honestly I laughed it's just so cheesy.Now, what's with the Camera? this thing lasted almost what 12 hours on one battery? this has to be either a top secret camera that only they had or... I don't know but the thing was also rugged as all get go.The last WTF moment I'll talk about is what was with the horse going down the street? what was the monsters taste specific? it'll eat a human but it'll not touch the horse? Overall the Movie was nice with the exception of what I talked about if they ever do a sequel lets try to get the emotions in check.",Cloverfield
702,photographyscotland-969-933420,And All For A Packet Of Chewits!,1,17 August 2015,"They say never judge a book by its cover but for many years now I've been good at spotting a bad movie just by looking at the title and cover art. The title of the movie 'Cloverfield' set in New York was a bad sign from the start and the bland poster art absolutely screamed mediocrity. Again I was right! This DVD had scuttled about in my closet after picking up from a bargain bucket somewhere for quite a few months before I found the will to put it in the DVD drawer. I was prepared to be pleasantly surprised but expected, as usual, to be badly disappointed. Guess which it was!Typically for me to score 1/10 I have to quit midway through and I quit after about 35 minutes with Cloverfield, less than half way through. I could see how mindless the whole thing was. People running about screaming, running and screaming, more running and screaming, explosions but why we know not, hand held camera work, all topped off with more running and screaming. In the background you can see some squidgy prehistoric creature waving its tail about amid explosions and fireballs. Nothing makes sense in this movie. Was I the only one wondering why the Air Force doesn't just make a surgical strike on the monster with an air to surface missile?I wont say anymore other than it was as bad as I expected and so I wasn't too disappointed, especially when it cost about 50p to find out.",Cloverfield

The first like 15 minutes of the movies is kinda slow and boring and I really considered skipping but hold myself back. I like how the characters kinda move on and dont take stupid long period of time just looking into the nothing just because they heard a voice, kinda was pissed that the whole point is just to go back to save Rob girlfriend but whatever.
The jump scare were perfect and I totally got so into the movie that I start shouting instructions and that something I didn't do for a long time now. Totally recommend",Cloverfield
704,Cards_fan,So so (possible spoilers),5,24 January 2008,"The film ""Cloverfield"" seems to have a polarizing affect on most; people tend to love or hate it. Reading through the comments and reviews the past week, it seems that a lot of the folks who love it made up their mind before they even saw it. The folks who hate it all seem to list the same reasons such as the motion of the hand held camera, the ending, the lack of any sort of exposition, or elements they found improbable (i.e. surviving a helicopter crash, the battery life of the camcorder, or the survival of the video after the bombing). I didn't have a problem suspending disbelief for most of the film. I found most of it quite believable save for one element. The character Hud is videotaping the exploit because he feels it is important and people will need to see it later. This makes sense. The movie took place over a 7 to 9 hour period with Hud turning the camera off and on during this period and actually only recording less than 90 minutes of the experience. Apparently, nothing important happens at any time when the camera is shut off and the camera is shut off 90% of the time. And the camera is always on BEFORE something important to the story happens. I found this form of narrative extremely forced and felt it didn't work. Although I appreciate the effort to try something different, it isn't really original as it had been done in ""Blair Witch Project"". On the other hand, I found the novel way they mixed what was already recorded on the tape and the events being recorded over it to be extremely clever and interesting. That's the highest praise I can give the film, though. I thought most of it was a little dull and, being a fan of the genre, was really disappointed with it. It's understandable how the ending frustrates so many but most will realize how it will end at the beginning of the movie. So I'm one of the few who neither hated it or loved it. It's somewhere in the middle.",Cloverfield
705,buggyinthevolvo,Yawn... bring out a REAL INTENSE film please,1,29 November 2009,"Cloverfield was so boring for me, i lost interest from the 35th minute. I did not find the story eventful or the movie intense ! It was basically a badly directed, shaky camera, unfinished piece of a well thought of idea. I did not mind the shaky camera and i did not mind the very short monster sequences. But the directing was just so whacked up they had to end it so terribly... basically it is a group of friends who tries to find their friend who is trapped inside a hotel room, and the adventure starts with heartache and fear... they save her, enters the helicopters, then the helicopters gets owned by the monster than they run away again , then... the end. This is not a movie people, this is not even a bit scary, and i do not understand the people who say that is was intense and it was a thrill ride. i almost slept during this film... hardly entertaining and a huge let down ending.

I go to the movies to be entertained, if I want amateur camera tricks I will spend an hour and a half on YouTube.The acting was amateurish, very minimal to zero character development. The director/producer I am sure decided it would be too expensive to make the movie with clear cinematography so they probably said, ""I know we will film the whole thing with this hand held camera and jerk it around so much so nothing is clear, we won't need to spend any money on special effects because it will be one big blur.""

Romantic while not being sappy. Tender while being tough. Just like the name Cloverfield, the movie conjures up uncertain, ill defined images and internal reactions. It is the perfect analogy for today's listless world.It was a pleasure to see a film which fully utilized the movie watching experience.Stay until the end credits for a mysterious clue and an amazing piece of music titled ""Roar.""If nothing else, the overture theme should be nominated for an Oscar.",Cloverfield
708,evolbaby,I was rooting for the monster!,3,8 November 2008,"Five minutes into the film I found myself chanting, ""Bring in the monster! Bring in the monster! "" I have the strange feeling that movie monsters only attack when the persons in the film conduct themselves as useless to the bio diversity of the animal kingdom.I couldn't wait for the monster to show up. I was hoping we'd get a good look at it so I could run out and get some t-shirts of it or maybe some action figures.Technically the movie is brilliant. The effects and camera angles are outstanding. The dialogue is what murders this movie. I mean the dialogue is like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of dialogue in a monster movie. The plotting falls apart as the characters don't act anything like real people. I was hoping Freddy Kruger or Jason Voorhees were going to show up and guest star in this to make it interesting. Had this just been people running for their lives instead of the sub plot nonsense it would have been a masterpiece. The characters were boring and lifeless and I'd have rather the monster gotten hold of a steady cam and run amok with it, us getting his viewpoint of the action.Monster with a camera, great concept, you read it here first.There've been some great monsters over the past 100 years in film. To call yourself a movie monster you have to earn it like the big boys did. Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, Godzilla, King Kong, Alien, the Blob. All of them still horrifying creatures to this very day. Cloverfield, I missed why the movie was named this, I'll figure it out when I read more, this monster was cool, sadistic, sense of irony, powerful but no personality. Maybe there'll be a sequel or something that does what a movie is supposed to do, tell us a story.So again, had awesome potential, great technical skill, bad acting, bad dialogue.You want some monster movie dialogue watch the 1950's classic ""Them!"".Now THAT'S a monster movie worth mentioning!",Cloverfield

The camera work made sure you saw the necessary things and didn't frustrate you like I was worried it would.The creature wasn't cheesy and I actually cared about the characters. The camera does jerk around some but it isn't a reason to avoid the movie and I found myself so engrossed in the story that I hardly even noticed it.Were there a lot of unanswered questions? Sure there were but not so many that you felt cheated, just enough to make you want more.

711,MattsMovieWatchingWorld,The video camera is my favorite inanimate object in movie history that could almost be a character.,8,22 January 2008,"It all started when I watched Transformers (2007), which I just happened to watch on opening day, July 3. Before the feature started, we were privileged with a unique trailer of a movie that contained a video-taped party that turned into a video-taped monster disaster. This trailer only ended with a caption that said ""From producer J.J. Abrams"" and a caption that said ""1-18-08."" The monster wasn't revealed, and the title wasn't revealed. My first reaction was ""Okay,"" like I didn't know what that was all about, or like I didn't know whether or not it was a real movie at all. Later, after watching Transformers, I thought again about the strange trailer, and thought positive thoughts about what the movie could be. I first saw the trailer to Transformers about a full year before seeing it, and a big blockbuster movie like that would basically only be showing trailers to movies that also would be big blockbusters. So this unusual ""1-18-08"" movie must be pretty big despite the release date in January, which is usually a month for ""stupid"" movies. Because of a partial premise that we didn't know exactly what the monster was, or whether or not we've seen this monster before, the movie did get a bunch of anticipation from trailer fans, which I think I'll say I belonged to.The release came, I decided to remain positive about it, and I saw it opening day at midnight. And the cinematic experience I experienced was very unique and original. Like the promotions suggested, it is a documentation of a monster disaster following a going-away party for a friend, all taken from the perspective of a single hand-held video camera. The plot is intense, and I liked the idea quite a bit. And because the entire movie is taken from the camera's view, we get things that we don't get in movies very often. Behind The Ring from LotR (which does have a will of its own), the video camera is my favorite character in movie history that can be argued whether or not it's a character as it is an inanimate object.The story is: First, the story of friends who decide to videotape a going-away party for a friend Rob Hawkins. The monster attacks, and these friends attempt to survive. Second, the story of the government as they find the camera at the end, mark the beginning of the tape with ""Multiple sightings of case designate 'Cloverfield' Camera retrieved at incident site U.S. 447 Area formerly known as Central Park,"" and the government uses it for government and/or history purposes. Third, and most of all what I want to emphasize, is the story of the camera, from the beginning of the tape to the end. More than the story of the victims, whose characters we come to appreciate and hope for their survival, more even than the story of the monster, whose neither origins nor fate is entirely explained, it's the story of the camera. We only see the middle of the story of the monster, we see the beginning and middle of the story of the victims, and just with that, the movie isn't quite enough to appreciate. But the story of the camera has a beginning, middle, and end. And the story of that is more than enough of what we need to enjoy the movie.Because this is nothing more or less than the story of the camera, from the camera's documentation, no music is scored. The credits after the camera's story, which document how this became a fictional story with the intent to entertain movie fans in theaters, is the only place in the entire movie that has music attached. And the music there is quite fun. When the credits for the songs came, I was surprised that there were many songs credited, which I guess were entirely used during the beginning party scene. I almost impatiently waited for the end credit music score to be credited. There was a big space in the credits between the other songs and the end credit music. It was called ""Roar! (Cloverfield Overture)"" by Michael Giacchino, who I have previously appreciated for the music for The Incredibles. When that credit came up, I clapped madly. I loved the music, and I probably loved the credits just as much as I loved the rest of the movie.This movie is fun, it proves that there is originality left in the world, and we come to love everyone in the movie, the friends, the monster, and the camera.8/10",Cloverfield
712,sammy_girl_78,This movie rocks big time ... best ever ... See it !,10,5 April 2008,"Cloverfield is one awesome and very unique movie !! WHAT A RIDE !!! Without a doubt the best and most innovating and thrilling movie for years !! maybe the whole century !!Beats Everything in this genre (and most others as well) The movie also has a good pace/tempo about it ! Wonderful in every way possible !Filmed in a genius way (takes a little getting use too) This is not a ""typical"" Hollywood movie ! it is not following the flow so to speak ! The only downside in the movie is the opening scenes.... they are a bit slow and take a little to much room in the movie! and the ending (but maybe there will be a sequel .. i hope soooo).And another little downside is that i thought that the movie was a little bit to short... but hey you cant get everything !I think its a good underlying concept/idea in this movie about the monsters .... represent terrorists and the fight against them but also some points about sep 11 2001 attacks ! In the real world ....... terrorists are monsters so its a good comparison!The monsters in movie are well made but not very scary but good ! The special effects in this movies is awesome ! The monsters make the movie what it is !! VERY good !But what really makes the movie special is the actors that portray ordinary people (could have been anyone of us) they make the movie interesting and exciting !!This movie is a must to see ! And i will get the DVD as soon as i can ! Everybody that will see this movie will love it i can guarantee it !!I really hope the will be a sequel... because i want more !! Or maybe another one like this one !And they have made the movie soooooo good that it feels like you are there in the movie and experiencing it yourself!!And don't compare this movie to The Blair Witch Project because that movie sucked big time and this does not it is the complete opposite/contrast !!I give this movie a full 10 because it deserves it and it is that gooooood !!",Cloverfield
713,crako1,This is a terrible movie,1,19 January 2008,"Awful. Bad. Stupid.First, using the 'shaking camera' thing is effective when people are running, falling, fighting, etc. Using the amazing shaking camera when people are sitting and chatting, it's just stupid.Second, this movie pretends to be an alien invasion movie, but it's not. Actually, it's about this really great guy Rob or Tom or something and he had sex with this one girl Beth, and like, totally no one at the party knew that they had had sex, so now that an alien giant monster is attacking Manhattan, it's really important for Rob or Tom to go find Beth.Ya'see, ""Giant Alien Attacks Manhattan"" is the headline. ""Stupid boy seeks girl in monster stricken city"" gets coverage on p18, right? You can't make the alien attack the 'back story'. It didn't work in War of the Worlds which was ""really"" about a divorcée trying to reconnect with his kids. It didn't work in Signs, which was ""really"" about a man's quest to recover his faith.I'm all for Alien movies. I'm for love movies, divorcée movies and movies about recovering one's faith. I just don't like hyped up movies that pretend to be one thing but aren't. I mean, you don't even get to SEE the stupid alien. How dumb is that? Not to mention, an hour and a half of shaky cam and I literally went home and puked.Terrible, awful, bad movie. I want my money back.",Cloverfield
714,ariyanto-18808,This film is overratted,1,19 August 2019,"Shaky camera from beggining to end will make you puke. And..., whats going on? Whats the destination of this film? 4 teenager doing ridiculous mission,? Saving 1 (nowhere but miracoulusly found) person but let other friend or theirself die?",Cloverfield
715,joe d,Still Not Sure,6,25 April 2008,"Saw it last night on DVD and still not sure if I liked it or not.The film follows the technique as used in Blair Witch Project. We see events unfold as captured through a hand-held camera. This works out very well for with no musical background and actors portraying characters as everyday, ordinary people, we're able to see a realistic documentation of an attack on New York by a monster as experienced by of a handful of people. There is a complete absence of macho men and women trying to be heroes; instead the people are real, expressing their fears panic and confusion just like you and I.However, it's this slick type of production that also leads to disappointment because it severely limits the action and special effects. With no communications and utter chaos in the streets, we are as completely in the dark about what is happening as are the characters. And like Blair Witch Project, we're left without any ending. Since we know the tape has be confiscated by the Government and is the only know video record of what had occurred, we don't know if the monster was killed, how much of New York City itself has been destroyed and if this devastation has been expanded to other areas. We get only a little glimpse of what is actually unfolding by seeing a small portion of a television news cast and by what we're told by army personnel evacuating the city.So, at best, the film is half monster movie and half study of how ordinary people react. Depending upon one's preference, it could be either a 10 or a 1. That's why I took a little above the middle ground in my rating. I found Cloverfield both entertaining and disappointing for it held my interest but denied me the fun of knowing what was going on, hearing the scientific explanations and following the attempts to destroy the monster - the ingredients necessary for good monster-movie making. I also realize it was the producers' intent to keep us in the dark in order to become fully engrossed in the more realistic terror experienced by the film's main characters. Will admit this different approach did work and after having some time to think about it I can also honestly say that Cloverfield has indeed started to grow on me despite my initial disappointment.",Cloverfield
716,jiraf,Great balance between a monster movie and a love story - IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT,10,20 January 2008,"Or maybe this is what the perfect love story look like ? The story is told from a very interesting, unique, point of view. Instead of the usual, chase the monster, find its nest and weakness, and kill it with a gazillion bombs, this movie finds a new way to explore a horrible (yet familiar through all previous movies) event. The film itself focus more on how ordinary lives are affected by an attack on Manhattan, instead of filming a bunch of superhumans who can always find a way out of a tight spot and escape unharmed. It makes everything seem so real. Matt Reeves & JJ Abrams did everything absolutely right. I love the subplot of what happened between Beth and Robby. Flashbacks in the movie made everything seem so human and reminds the audience of more normal times,when the only thing that matter was love, and each other. In the end, in the midst of all the destruction, that's all there is left.",Cloverfield
717,smellysocks12,"Awesome, just awesome!",10,24 February 2008,"Cloverfield is nothing like your average Hollywood movie. Entirely filmed from the perspective of a (shaky) handy-cam, one would not expect a very visually attractive movie. This movie proves that this assumption would be so damn wrong. The story starts at a yuppie party, but then crap hits the fan. And when I mean crap hits the fan, it really does hit the fan hard. Cloverfield is a very intense movie and the first person view really makes you feel like you are in the middle of something that you would try to avoid in real life. It has been a long time ago that I sat through a movie with clenched fists and my jaw on the floor most of the time, but this movie managed to do so. Nevertheless the movie still has its funny moments, which are timed right, so it does not take away from the tension. I could say much more about this movie, but it is really something you should see for yourself. Get the tickets now!",Cloverfield
718,toffeedragon-3,A pretty good monster movie.,7,14 June 2008,"I watched Cloverfield the other night and have to say that I did enjoy it. The movie is all told from the viewpoint of a group of friends with a video camera so maybe avoid watching it on a big screen if you are prone to motion sickness.Anyway, the film begins at a surprise going away party for a man named Rob who has got a job in Japan and is about to emigrate there so the Manhattan apartment is filled with people having a good time until the power briefly fails and there is a tremor. They all rush to the roof after hearing an explosion only to flee out of the building to the street when debris rains down and the power totally fails.Once in the street the action really begins and they catch a glimpse of a giant monster on a rampage. The group tries to leave Manhattan via one of the bridges but are foiled when the monster smashes it killing Rob's brother. Rob then decides to go and rescue his girlfriend Beth and his friends follow leading to encounters with monsters and so forth.The reason I enjoyed this film is because it makes you feel on edge as it is quite claustrophobic because the only viewpoint is through the hand-held camera and I found it quite exiting. It also has a running time of about 80 minutes so it is not dragged out too long. The special effects of buildings collapsing and the monster itself were really good and realistic enough that you don't feel like you're only watching a movie.I've noticed that this movie divides opinion between those such as myself who can switch off enough to enjoy it for what it is, an hour and 20 minutes of entertainment and those who like to expose improbabilities such as Rob stealing a phone battery from a looted electronics shop and using it in his phone without needing to charge it. Also, the fact that the cameraman films unlikely moments such as when Rob has to tell his mother that his brother has been killed and moments when they are being chased and the fact that a half demolished skyscraper is leaning on another without collapsing.What gets me about those that enjoy picking films like this apart is that they complain about things like the phone battery, which are plausible as I have bought electronic gadgets that are supposed to be charged before first use but which do actually work for a bit before the first charge and the fact that the tower of Pisa has been leaning for centuries without toppling but fail to mention the biggest implausibility of them all which is the fact that a 100 foot tall monster is rampaging through New York and can't be killed by conventional weapons.If you don't like implausible plots and dialogue then why do you watch movies? I admit that this film does corner itself by only using the hand-held camera but it was very entertaining. The only complaint that I have is that it ends very suddenly and you don't get any closure. I wonder if a sequel is on the cards?",Cloverfield
719,robinhoodfilms,"Wow, was this bad film-making at its worst!",1,28 April 2008,"The ONLY compliments I can make for this film is the quality of the effects and satisfactory acting. The direction and camera-work were awful. The character actions were laughably absurd. The story itself was beyond paper thin...even for an action film. The recent Godzilla remake was even better than this. The fact is, without resorting to a lazy, hand-held ""style"", that alone could have pushed the film into the realm of decent. Coupled with a modestly intelligent story (and that bar is already low for this kind of movie), it could have been a enjoyable film. They couldn't have screwed it up worse with what they had at their disposal...but, as long as suckers keep running to theatres opening weekend for their pathetic ""bragging rights""...well marketed crap will continue to dominate the box office!",Cloverfield
720,WordUpJack,can you say.. AMAZING,10,25 January 2008,"Don't listen to all these people who were saying Cloverfield was bad. It was actually amazing. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.Anyway..Cloverfield is something I have never seen before in my life. It's original, scary, suspenseful, sad, uplifting, laughable. It is original because of the whole idea of the movie. Yes it's another monster movie, but how it was filmed is something new. It was scary because come on a huge monster attacking Manhattan. There were some parts I jumped out of my seat.I love how the movie completely takes you in a new world. I felt as if I was in the movie with all the characters. There were a couple of times my friend and I would look at each other and say we felt like we were about to run out of the theater lol. I just couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a second.Now the movie is really about the characters which was interesting. Rob and Beth were exes that still loved each other. Jason is Rob's brother who is dating Lily. Then there is the one and only HUD who is great comic relief throughout the movie. There were times I would be freaking out and Hud would just say something and I couldn't stop laughing. He was the best character in my opinion. Lastly, Marlena who is just sarcastically funny. She reminds me of my best friend so I really enjoyed her character.Enough of me rambling but I will say again this movie was amazing and everyone should just go into the theater with an open mind and really concentrate on the characters more so than the monster.",Cloverfield
721,Hugo_diaz,Totally underestimated!!!,9,10 February 2008,"I think I understand why this movie is so underestimated. It is clear that we have not seen a truly re-invention in a long time and many viewers doesn't know how to react. And the thing is, all the main good reviews and press notice that this film has received are not for nothing. All the praises have been given by people, I mean critics, who actually knows a lot about cinema and storytelling, characters development, etc.I am not saying this is a sort of citizen Kane, just referring to the fact that the form, the way this movie has been made, may distract from the substance and the value this piece has as a drama.Marlena, for instance, is a great character, and it totally shows a lot of work in his creation and performance.I think this film should be called ""Cleverfield"", because it is not just a success regarding marketing campaign (the filmmakers actually create a parallel universe), but also as an entertaining film.It impressed me, and not because of ""the monster"". It simply took me by surprise in a good way.",Cloverfield
722,phojo-1,"Cloverfield, or Field of Cow Pies",1,1 August 2010,"WTF was that? was what I asked myself as I struggled my way through this so-called film.The title of the movie, Cloverfield, has absolutely nothing to do with the story in the movie, unless they decided to name the rarely-seen monster such a pretty name.The story is done as a series of videos shot on a single tape over the course of a night. However, we see scenes of happier times as the main characters are getting ready for a party, messing around the park and town, and generally having fun. Then all hell breaks loose when some thing decides to destroy New York in the Godzilla fashion. Throughout the movie these people run around taping everything with a single hand-held camera. The story covers the early evening, all night long, and the following morning. (Please tell me what camera can film all that time without once having to recharge it's two or four-hour battery.) As the story progresses, in true four-character horror film fashion, they discover that one of their dear friends is missing on the other side of town, opposite of the evil mean and nasty CGI monster. So, with camera in hand causing nausea to the viewer, they run all over town, through the subways, and into the military who, in true horror-film fashion, wants to kill everything in their path, including the meek and bewildered characters.They finally find their friend impaled through her chest on a long piece metal rob and, gently pulling her off, they ALL run away from the now collapsing building toward safety. And the camera still runs.The ending is something of a downer and one by one the people all meet their demise. Nothing is ever said as to why the monster appeared or what anyone was doing about it, save lobbing rockets and missiles at it. (Here's a tip: Kill the guy who created the damn thing on his laptop!) As far as the stars, no big names were in this picture. And the one who should receive the most recognition is the hand-held camera that filmed everything all night long, without having to change tapes or sitting through a recharge.Not worth watching unless you are a film student in need of what not to do, or you just like bad movies. This one should be ranked down there with the movies ""Absolute Zero"" (2005 - TV) (which is so dumb it's insulting), or ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (1959) (which is so dumb it's funny).",Cloverfield
723,texrangers31,I wish 'Cloverfield' was as good as it's marketing campaign,7,31 January 2008,"J.J. Abrams has a reputation for leaving audiences hanging. While I won't reveal if 'Cloverfield' follows the trend, I went into the theater ecstatic about seeing the mysterious monster that he had cooked up for this film. The first person camera is difficult to handle at first, but after about 10 minutes you will hardly notice it. Abrams does a good job of not having it shake when the character is running or during action shots. The plot is very fast moving, and the characters in the film are very real. Getting to see the monster is probably the best part of the film. I would recommend this movie, but it probably won't make my top five for 2008. It really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. 'Cloverfield' isn't a must see...I would classify it as a ""Should See"".",Cloverfield
724,genesis1978,Left Unfulfilled,7,1 August 2008,When I heard about this movie and read what it was about I thought that it would be pretty good. Also after seeing the reviews for this movie I saw that people really didn't like the hand held camera that was put in this movie. So as I was watching the movie the hand held camera really wasn't that bad and plus it's something kind of different. When I saw the monster on the camera I thought that was pretty cool but after awhile I thought it was playing peek-a-boo with everybody because I didn't really get to see it that often. It just seemed like all I was watching were a bunch of people running around scared and that's about it. On the bright side the visuals were fantastic and the acting was pretty good. Overall good movie but I'm hoping that Cloverfield 2 will be much better.,Cloverfield
725,Darrellbjones,The greatest action movie of the year,9,21 January 2008,"First of all, this movie is awesome. Great action, great CGI(some of the best) and great acting. The movie was perfect almost. The only thing that I didn't get was why did this guy keep the camera. I'm sure that if a monster that was 50 times bigger than Godzilla was coming after you, you would have dropped the camera. Other than that, this was very strong in every way. In the movie, your rarely ever see the monster enough to get an idea of what it is. But for those that want to know what the monster looks like, you won't be disappointed. At the very end of the movie, you really see the monster, up close by its front. I'm not going to tell you what it is, but it's scary. In the beginning when the Brooklyn Bridge broke, it looked like a giant snake, but it's not. The CGI was outstanding, especially that it was all shot on a home video camera like the Blair witch project. The only shame on this movie is the ending. It's not a mistake, but it is not at all satisfying, and leaves you with a ""what the heck just happened"" feeling. Overall this movie is definitely worth seeing twice, and getting the DVD. If you like action, sci-fi, thriller, horror, fantasy, or adventure movies you will like this.",Cloverfield
726,catalyst8-1,A sub-mediocre 4 for a sub-mediocre film.,4,12 April 2008,"Think Blair-Witch meets Godzilla, with a substantial amount of Manhattan sightseeing.A thoroughly predictable rampaging monster sci-fi. It should have been good what with good character development, acceptable acting, and all the money so obviously spent on effects and extras. Unfortunately it was let down due to the appallingly formulaic, and apparently deliberate unoriginality of writing.After about the first fifteen minutes I was beginning to wonder if they'd run the wrong film. Add that first fifteen minutes to the last ten minutes given over to the credits, then the majority of the film seemingly devoted to walking around Manhattan, and you have the idea.Oh yes, and did I mention that in the opening credits they let us know everyone dies? Only watch this if you have absolutely no desire to think, or simply can't be bothered to take a nap.",Cloverfield
727,mausar,A revolution in sci-fi movies,8,5 February 2008,"This is a great movie, because it changes completely the perspective of sci-fi. We are used to watch monster movies (Godzilla, for example) from three different points of view: the monster, the army and some great hero who is trying to save the city from destruction. We don't care about the people who are under the main action. In a classical sci-fi movie, if the monster or a missile destroys a building, we never think about hundreds of screaming common individuals who are inside or under that building. If the monster or the artillery devastates cars, destroys houses and properties, we never think about people who lost their home and all their properties, we can't even imagine what can do or think someone who is suddenly surprised under fire and loses friends and relatives. We never think or care about it in a monster movie. But they are humans and not ants. They have their own lives, personal stories, passions, frustrations and courage. I asked it every time I watch a monster/sci-fi/super-hero movie. This is the first time I have had an answer: this movie shows us what could be reaction of common people (not heroes, not army commanders, not monsters) facing a sudden and unknown menace. It's a real revolution in sci-fi. And it's a necessary revolution, because of Youtube and modern digital technology. We are living the information-age and everybody can bring a camera, always and everywhere. Sci-fi has to simulate and re-create reality in surreal circumstances. And this is nowadays reality: everyone could be a journalist or a director with his or her camera. Look at amateur's videotapes of 9/11 or the combat cameras in the Iraq War: these are great events documented by ordinary people or private soldiers. If you imagine a fictional great event and you want to make it real, you can't re-create it with traditional means, as the great hero or army commander's perspective. You have to see it from the common people's perspective: common people armed with hand cameras and smart cells. This perspective doesn't mean that the plot and the screenplay become useless. Matt Reeves, the director, keeps a great role. He built complex and realistic characters and the screenplay is a high-standard horror movie, with some reference to the first Zombie (the scenes in deserted supermarkets and the task for survival in a hostile environment) and Alien (the attack in the Underground). The scenario is simply beautiful: just every particular is built with accuracy: the hall of the upper class building continues to transmit soft music, also during the tragedy, the alarms of cars start every time there were hit or shacked, the lights of the city change, all the security systems react to dangers. Of course, this movie is far from perfection and we can't consider it as a real masterpiece. The introduction, the party before the attack, is very realistic, but quite boring and there is some lack of realism: the cameraman recs too much, also in impossible situations. I can't rec when I risk to lose my life, or rec my friends when they are living a painful or intimate situation. A heavy wounded girl can't run and behave as a healthy person. The point of view is limited: only one camera. And this is very reductive. I wish I would have seen a puzzle made by lot of cameras used by different characters, from different perspectives to have a panoramic view of the event. These are mistakes and flaws and could be perfected. But, above all, this movie is a revolution. The next sci-fi movies can't ignore it.",Cloverfield
728,eplanti,Wow,9,3 February 2008,"Well, i was going to give the movie a 5 out of 10 for the ending, however after reading the other reviews i changed my mind. Very creative style of directing, they switch the style of the movie around from a third person perspective back to a first person perspective, but, unlike in Doom or the unheard of and wildly unpopular ""a day in the life of.."" star trek series they take it up a notch and put it in a familiar handicam tone, so the moviegoer can relate to the action( no sense in bringing a huge moviecamera with you when running right?). Anyway, i liked how the entire movie after the party was a continuous ride through constant obstacles and loss, they try to run, but they lose people, they try going back, more die, they try running again. The monster too, I loved that it wasn't just a 1 dimensional thing like Godzilla, go in, smash city (rawr!), leave. Instead, it looked a bit more advanced dropping off drones in it's wake, apparently for recon and attack. The monster's movements also, not random at all, I was just sitting there going ""omg what tank does this thing not step on?"" and jeez, it even took advantage of a cloud of smoke at one point, you'd never see Godzilla do that.Overall, i'd say it's a pretty good movie, though they could've done better on the ending, I think maybe they would've been better off with the cameraman doing the ""outro"" than the hero, though if that had happened they would've had the ""hero"" getting chewed apart pushing the cameraman out of the way, bleh, they should do that for the director's cut. I just say that cuz it's out of character for the guy in question to suddenly turn around and grab the camera and do a confessional when the guy who's main priority it was is gone.",Cloverfield
729,newby_rox3,Don't see it.,3,26 December 2008,"Sure, Manhattan has its share of young party-goers, but now we know all New Yorkers are in their 20s, allowing a photogenic cast (whose characters lead boring lives and are annoying enough to have you hoping they die deaths that are as excruciatingly painful as their farewell party -- an exercise in human drabness -- that the film opened with). And to add to the torture: yuppies using colloquialisms that left the ghetto decades ago. So, sorry, director, the intentional over-lameness backfired severely.Jason's nicely-complected girlfriend Lisa takes the Looks honors but the only skin shots we get are of her legs, with contrasting white high-heels that she sports in half the movie.It's conceivable that this would be truly terrifying to post-9/11 New Yorkers; that there would be real suspense in the initial possibility that whatever this was, it was caused by terrorists who might follow with other forms of attack. I'd left the room four times during the ""party,"" and after the first explosion, we thought this was going to be a killer movie. Until we saw how mundane the terrorist actually was -- a huge crustacean that spits meteors and sheds man-eating cockroaches.Some of the sounds added to the film's terror and scariness, like the first attack explosions, the weird baby monster sounds, and the mother monster's bellowing, anguished King Kongish sounds.The messianic alpha-male hero Rob was peppered throughout the movie with inane questions by his friends who find it so difficult to see or think for themselves, it's no wonder they haven't been invited to be non-Japanese-speaking 24-year-old American VPs in Japan, like Rob. Amazing is the lemming-like behavior that compels them first to try to walk in the dead of night across the bridge (at the urging of authorities -- a 9/11 slam) into Brooklyn whose residents would no doubt welcome a team of Manhattan yuppies with open arms, until Mama Monster attacks the bridge. They then follow Rob back through swarming subway rats and baby monsters, past evacuees going in the opposite direction as fast as they can, to Ground Zero where the monster thrashes skyscrapers, so they can climb across crumbling roofs of skyscrapers leaning at dangerous angles, just to rescue Rob's girlfriend, lovely Beth, who's able to skedaddle just fine -- what's a little impalement? But the badge of courage goes to the Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) who in a toasted state can swing an ax like A-rod and knocks a monster off Rob's back -- in the process having three-inch chunks of skin removed from her torso by another monster. She unflinchingly applies dressings to them (we all know how easy it is to find clean paper towels and bottled water in subway tunnels!), only asking if the wounds look unattractive. She stoically toughs it out through exposed wounds and dizzy spells until she perishes in a glorious explosion of her own blood.The DVD's Features reveal Caplan to be brighter and much wittier than the others. She was nominated for a Supporting Actress award. Some of her acting is kind of cool and she seems the only one to portray the depths of their fear and utter despondency, as they rest in the subway with the hope starting to drain out of them. Marlena uses facial expressions well. Hud, trying to hit on her, gets superb disinterested expressions from her. During a lull in the film's questionable dialog, the effects of the sustained assault on the senses and fatigue from the raw terror are spoken in one glazed look at Hud.But no one seems to have the chance to build on her acting. Some of the improv from Hud, who fashions himself a comedian in real life, was distinctly unfunny, and I wonder if this wasn't the film's worst setback. If his character's intent was to annoy, it succeeded.The hand-held cam shots are overdone to the point of ridiculousness. This loses the desired realism. It makes a lot of people nauseous and dizzy, or, in my case, caused me to focus just on the DVD subtitles or close my eyes. Even the classic Bourne films used ""hand-helds,"" but judiciously and tastefully. And mostly on shots that couldn't be taken otherwise. Without the shaky video I would have given this film a 4 -- it IS a monster movie. Without the party, a 5.It's hard to pull off the concept of ""the medium is part of the message"" without boring, so we could have had much less of the videotaping parts. Hud, the one doing the taping, could have sounded less like a ten-year-old.But the flashback playback of the videotape being made over an old tape of Rob and Beth DID sort of work. This allows us glimpses of parts that hadn't been completely taped over while watching the movie itself during the military's ""presentation"" of the recovered tape (whose magnetic domains are immune to NEMP). The last flashback completed the depiction of the once-sweet but shallow relationship between Rob and Beth, and was the vehicle to the film's ending, where, juxtaposed after Rob saying, ""If you're seeing this I'm dead,"" is Beth at Coney Island the month previous, full of life, and saying ironically, ""I had a good day."" What the film lacked was dialog, screenplay, suspense, real emotion, and character and relational development. Cheers for the shots of military action and first responders which looked fairly credible. Pretty decent CGI rats or fake human legs because I don't think the actors would have supported those fat, real ones running between their legs. The plot was only mildly interesting -- trying to flee Manhattan, rescuing Beth, then trying to leave again.FYI, if one can't take hand-held action found in films a refund is normally available at theaters only within the first few minutes of the film.",Cloverfield
730,CrenshawPete,"If you didn't hate shaky cam before, you will after seeing this!",4,10 April 2016,"Despite being a cross between a rip off of Godzilla, War of the Worlds, and Alien / Aliens, Cloverfield (whatever that refers to) sort of had an interesting approach: make the viewer feel like they're along for the ride. Unfortunately the execution was horrible.I've always hated this ""shaky cam"" approach to TV and film that's become a fad in the last 15 years or so. Although some of my favourite TV shows and movies have been filmed using this approach, I totally despise it. What is wrong with mounting the damn camera? People are going to look back in 20 or 30 years and roll their eyes at this idiotic fad. Was it supposed to make us feel like we're there, in the scene? It doesn't.Well anyway, someone told the makers of this movie that people love shaky cam. In fact, they love it so much so that they want to see the effect put on steroids! And so we're treated with two hours of the camera bouncing up and down and zooming in and out of focus on random things. It's an abuse, not only on the eyes, but to all the senses.If that weren't bad enough, the first 20 minutes or so of the film is just a party where a bunch of twenty-something hipsters babble on about the usual twenty-something he said, she said nonsense while looking at their phones and nursing their beers. This is what passes for character development. For me, it was about as exciting as watching a dog lick itself where the sun don't shine... on shaky cam!After the monster is introduced into the movie... I don't know 30 minutes into the film... we follow Rob around town. Rob is apparently some genius who makes the world go round, because all we hear about throughout the film is ""where's Rob"", ""what does Rob think?"", ""what's Rob doing?"", ""Hey, Rob!"", ""Rob!"", ""Rob!"" Not since Mary Tyler Moore in the Dick Van Dyke Show have I heard someone say ""Rob"" that many times on screen.Unfortunately Rob's an idiot. He decides to go against conventional wisdom (i.e. to get out of town) and instead goes marching straight into the carnage. His friends, who follow this guy around like David Koresh, go with him on his merry adventure to an early grave. When the group finally stumbles upon the military, the military allows them to leave the secure zone and go back onto the streets! Why? Glad you asked! In order to climb to the top of a skyscraper that's on fire and has fallen over and is now leaning against another skyscraper. Apparently these folks didn't watch ""The Towering Inferno"".The cover of this Blu Ray had quotes like ""Terrifying!"" I think it should have had quotes like ""Stupid!"" or ""Absolutely makes no sense!"" Had I been at the theatre, I would have walked out. I couldn't have cared less about any of these people or their white upper-class, privileged, yuppie interpersonal drama.The number one problem with this movie was the camera gimmick. It was like watching unedited vacation footage shot by a five year old on a Sony Handycam. NEVER again will I sit through a movie shot like this. The second problem was the characters and dialogue, or lack there of. I can live with the fact that the plot makes no sense and the film really has no point, but the former ruins what little redeeming qualities this thing has left.I'll be generous and give it 4/10 for a twist on the themes it ripped off, but I don't think I could sit through a second viewing. All in all this film seems to be a marketing gimmick, rather than an original contribution to the science fiction genre.",Cloverfield

732,jaceodemedici,Excellent Monster Flick,8,17 August 2016,"I give this movie 8 stars just for the main creature. Coming from someone that is a big monster movie fan, this is a great monster and the little spidery things that come off of the larger creature are indisputably terrifying (almost more so than the larger creature), not to mention that you explode if you're bitten by them (which is super cool). The downside of this movie is that none of the human characters are all that likable. None of them are very relatable and the movie fails to make you care about any of them or their concerns. So, while the whole movie depends on the crew trekking into hostile territory to save someone, the emotional weight is never there.",Cloverfield
733,martyshoemark,"Aims to be realistic, but the characters are undeniably unlucky",6,23 April 2012,"One monster movie that aims to be just as fresh as Japanese Kaja films, such as the amazing Godzilla starting in 1954. This movie however uses monster movie elements that were not original, but that's acceptable because no story is original.The plot is as realistic as it aims with the exception of how the characters experience the story of the movie. The characters were the only human beings who have encountered the monster 3 freaking times. The first was when the military was trying to kill Cloverfield with very loud gunfire and monster screams in the battle. The 2nd was that the monster crashed down the helicopter the main characters were on. The 3rd was when Hudd got eaten by the monster, and the camera actually survived the fall. How the characters keep getting unlucky more than the other unseen citizens of New York is far from realistic, just to decorate the plot.There were 2 weaknesses in the film. The parasites falling off of Cloverfield only had 1 scene in the film and were an unnecessary part of the story just to keep the audience paying attention before the monster strikes. Also, the Nuclear bomb that was dropped on Cloverfield was not technically explained in the film, the audience was not told that of the military's ultimate plan to kill the creature.Other than that, this is a pretty good movie. Not very brilliant, yet not too boring.",Cloverfield
734,DVLefferts,A destruction movie with the purest intentions,8,19 January 2008,"There's been a lot of talk going around that Cloverfield is a creature feature that tries, and fails, to put a humanistic face on the experience of destruction. But Cloverfield, which is filmed entirely with a hand-held camera operated by several of the main actors, does not need to be a humanistic; it's just human. With its characters' almost total lack of information, its sensory limitations, and its shortness, Cloverfield presents a truly real view of destruction. We cannot see everything, can see almost nothing, and that is where the horrific truth lies. Its success lies in its ability to capture how weak humans are in the face of terror, how insignificant and cursory our sufferings.No, the acting isn't terrific; no, the writing isn't even close to original; no, not all the plot points click together just so. But what is clear here, and what lasts and lingers and is remembered, is the producer's and director's deep affection for monstrosity, for fear, for buildings falling down and people being sucked up into abysmal misery. Cloverfield is all at once visceral and clever, shamelessly entertaining and uncompromisingly scary, emotionally sadistic and wisely comic. Maybe everyone, in the end, does die; but no recent movie has offered as much proof that blood is still pumping through American cinema's veins.",Cloverfield
735,rhodescabbin,Name That Storyline Please,1,2 July 2008,"This movie can't even be called a movie really. Whats the storyline??? Rob? His name is said over 200 times in the film , and in real life, would everyone still follow Rob after so many screw ups? I watched this with 3 of my teenage kids and at the end when it said Do not copy one said (Who would want to.) I seen many ideas from I am Legend, so many goofs, a couple, the Statue of Liberty's head is 5 times bigger in real life and when Hud gets chomped by a creature that just grabbed their chopper from 1,500 feet up, this creature reaches down and chomps him??? That would be like a man reaching down to chomp an ant. The ending sucked!!! I mean good grief I expected at the very least maybe a kid 10 years from now discovering the tape or a foreign Army team watching it to give the affect the monster was a war weapon... The first 30 minutes is dull, very little action in relation to applying common sense to how people would really react and the first scene of the Monster attack was a sickening copycat of 911 when the Towers dropped... As my daughter also pointed out, Hud sure kept a steady hand, I have seen footage in life death scenarios and the cameraman is always shaking... Very well deserving of a one rating, I have seen much better on You tube...",Cloverfield
736,hesdeadjim82,A new genre is born,10,2 February 2008,"When the film ended in the cinema, the audience was silent. Amongst the silence all I good hear were ""that was brilliant"" or ""wow"" comments. I have to agree with them!! It shows that a movie doesn't have to have a detailed story line or background explaining origins, to entertain you. It was a movie made purely for the viewers experience, you are on the journey with them and know all they know as they try to understand the situation. The camera work makes you feel a little dodgy at first, but you get use to it. I must say that the editing to make a big budget monster movie look amateurish was inspired. This monster really puts Godzilla to shame! The look of it is very different to my preconceptions to what it was like. I am disappointed at people who expected more from this movie (in terms of the story). Nothing else was needed, you are meant to use your imagination and fill in the gaps. That is what makes this movie great because it was different.",Cloverfield

The tape is found in the area FORMERLY known as Central Park. So, you know exactly what's coming.

742,rowlandy,Cloverfield - Review & Interpretation,7,4 February 2008,"This review contains spoilers and is meant for people who have already watched the movie.Cloverfield is an impressive movie technically; the hand held camera technique combined with high tech special effects feels so real. However, taken at face value, the plot is pretty much meaningless. A monster rampages through Manhattan, senselessly tearing down buildings and killing people. You're not told what it is, where it came from, why it's destroying the city or where it's planning to go next. At the end of the movie you are clueless too. Is this part of an invasion or a lonely stone age entity, awoken too soon from a deep slumber from the ocean floor and now has a bad headache? If so, why did it choose NYC?To take this movie literally, there are no satisfactory answers to any of these questions. Forums are obsessing over where the monster came from, the ""slurpo"" connection, hidden clues, and Lost references to find answers. The viral marketing clips on youtube are telling. It is an oil drilling rig that gets destroyed. Factions are fighting over oil.After watching the movie, I chose an interpretation that makes sense to me and gives the movie a bit more depth. I see it as an analogue of the war on terrorism and in particular, the war in Iraq. The movie starts with an earth shattering thud and a huge explosion in the downtown area of Manhattan, very near in location to the World Trade Centre. The attack on the Statue of Liberty is clearly meant to represent an attack on the US. The home video footage is similar to the footage taken by people during 9/11. The references to 9/11 are throughout the film. Examples include the way the Woolworths building collapses generating the dust clouds, subways halted and the fact people are leaving the city via the Brooklyn Bridge. These images all seem eerily familiar. The ""monster"" wants to kill as many people as possible and this is seen in the way it destroys the overcrowded bridge. It has a purpose.The creature that appears to be born out of the explosion is seemingly impossible to kill. It represents the terrorist threat and in particular the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq it spurred. You hear the camera operator (Hud) come up with a conspiracy theory that it's something the American government created, that somehow they are at fault. You see the momentary elation that the monster has been killed by the huge arsenal of bombing directed at it only to find the monster still on the rampage (compare that to the initial bombing of Iraq and how quick the war appeared to be over when in fact it was only the beginning of a long conflict). The monster itself has these small offshoots that act independently of the main creature. These are synonymous with suicide bombers. You see one of the actors blow up after being bitten by one. From the civilian population, there is a lot of confusion of why did this is happening, very similar to peoples thoughts after 9/11. Apparently, at the end of the movie credits, you hear that ""it's still alive"" (that part of the film needs to be played backwards to hear it  see youtube).The other possibility is that I'm probably reading too much into this film and it's just another monster movie inspired by Godzilla . . .",Cloverfield
743,thejoo05,"A blend of a bad, and s***** movie",2,2 March 2008,"To me this movie was G-d awful, I mean, to me this was nothing more than the Godzilla movie, the one that was in New York, not the good ones where he was terrorizing Japan, and Blair Witch Project mashed into one. Thats right, the new Godzilla movie = S***, while Blair Witch was just Bad. Now don't get me wrong, it was pretty intense, and defiantly new way of looking through the ideas of if there was a giant monster terrorizing a major city, this is what you would be like if you were in the mess, and lived that long through it, while trying to save a love interest/friend. But after so long, it just got annoying. I also had a problem with one of the monsters, the little ones that were given off. I'm sorry but they look like the Bugs from Starship Troopers with a more spider like look. Which made me feel like the people in charge of monster design, were effing lazy. I'm a person who loves movies, and can't get enough of them, but for the first time ever, I wouldn't even want to own a movie like this, even if it was given to me free... with a small country in the bundle.",Cloverfield

I watched it for the first time tonight, nearly three years later.Really what I wanted to comment about is how far CGI has come in these short three years. Watching Cloverfield tonight, it struck me how mediocre the CGI in this movie actually is in 2011 standards. The scenes of the monster wrecking NYC look awful. A few of the closeups of the monster later in the movie have held up fairly well, but overall, what awed me then, doesn't fly nowadays. It's pretty amazing.Also, tonight I realized how AWFUL the acting is. Some of the worst in recent memory. I felt like killing HUD the camera man long before the monster did.

All the actors and actresses are incredible and you truly feel like you are in New York at the time of the Attack.I thought this film is up in league with awards winners such as Transformers and Pearl Harbor.I was mesmerised by the power of the film, and how the directors created a sense of reality by getting the characters to film the footage.The film was also left at a halt and there is a great opportunity to make a sequel.",Cloverfield

The camera movement will make you throw up if you have motion sickness easily. The actor's emotion and the action in the movie wasn't realistic. Things were exploding next to you, they are basically standing around for most of the time during the beginning of the movie. When their friends die they basically act like nothing happened 5 minutes later. The monster was childish. It was something out of a comic book. It was straight out of a comic book. The acting was not very good, motion sickness was terrible, and what they were doing and why they were doing in that circumstance was very bad. Some things didn't tie up.Especially the camera movement is not for viewing. It is always shaking and you can't see anything and makes you want to throw up right then and there.Not recommended because of the camera movement. Big time motion sickness movie.

There is absolutely NO closure...It just ends.I'm not going to say anything specific about the movie because the mystery makes it better and I still believe that it is worth seeing in that it is extremely entertaining, I just think that it doesn't deserve he merit of a great movie because a believe that a movie should have a beginning a middle and an end...call me old fashioned but i don't think that a movie should stop in the middle.Go see it...you'll be entertained...just don't expect it to make in your top 500 list.",Cloverfield

750,redoubt-2,Revenger of the Sushi,8,27 April 2008,"First, just a few words on the subject of 'spoilers'.Preface: Cloverfield is so completely bizarre as to be nearly immune to being spoiled by anyone's comments. I could have read every spoiler here and still been nowhere near ready for what was waiting. (But I'm signing onto the IMDb 'spoiler' program just in case, lol!) The home-movie stylizing of this flick makes the plot entirely indescribable. Basically, you are as helpless to grasp the 'what' and the 'why' as are the main characters. I had hoped to discover the answer to some of the mystery by the end of the story but apparently, the 'what' is still alive and the 'why' is because our military is buying its weapons systems from the same folks who make Frisbees.Seriously, this is a very good, very unique movie. Some of the best FX are the helicopter scenes of the beasty getting blasted by a B2 Stealth Bomber. How in the hell did it avoid being turned into sushi is beyond me!Okay, I'm gonna wait for a sequel because it just wouldn't be fair to mess up New York like that without offering the Red Sox fans in Boston some equal time ;) ...",Cloverfield
751,MamaPapaXP,I was genuinely gob-smacked...,9,3 February 2008,"Where to begin? Firstly,a quick nod to all the forum flamers and negative reviewers here: Yes, this is a VERY shaky film and could induce motion sickness in some, but that is not a reason to mark a film down. If the motion detracted from the storytelling, I could understand but, in my humble opinion, the camera in this film comes off as a character in it's own right. At least, unlike a certain other film, the camera's picture quality is utterly perfect for most of the film and, also unlike that other film, you get to see a fair bit of this film's 'witch'...From the moment this retrieved camcorder footage begins, you are fed crumbs that come together neatly later on. Rob films his new sweetheart, Beth. All of a sudden, (as this is a typical linear recording,) it's a month later and Rob's brother has acquired his camcorder and is unwittingly about to record Rob's friend's goodbye messages over these earlier memories of what turns out to be a now soured relationship. These messages are chillingly echoed at the end of the movie, as are the occasional breaks in the current recording, revealing some of the too-short time Rob spent with Beth.After just enough time to become acquainted with the major characters, Cloverfield appears. And what an appearance. If you want to know what it feels like to be caught in the middle of a surprise terrorist attack, a-la 9/11, I imagine the feelings I experienced by proxy through Hud the camera guy's perspective, and those around him, would not be too far off the mark.I will say little about the beast, except that you DO see it. Not too often and not too much of it. (What person is going to run with a camcorder toward such a thing, with buildings collapsing around them and soldiers running amok?) But later on, you are rewarded with some honestly brilliant creature effects, or at least you are convinced of such because you think it is being filmed live, with a camcorder... (...all of a sudden, the decision to use this type of camera makes PERFECT sense.)There isn't too much story from here on in. The need to survive is easily enough to drive you onward, but the aforementioned sour relationship comes to the fore here to add a little bit of humanity to the mix and, conveniently, give our victims a reason to actually get closer to Cloverfield while everyone else is bugging out.Overall, the acting was appropriately tense, camera-work (don't laugh,) was excellent, and the special effects some of the most 'realistic' I think I have ever seen. There are a couple of oddities, such as the nasty Nokia product placement throughout certain scenes, (BAD idea, so obvious, the damn camcorder moves at one point to position the subject on the far left of the screen and allows the centre/right to be filled with a massive nokia poster on a wall! Another scene has a crowd quieting in the lower half of the screen to allow Rob, in the upper centre, to give a speech, and guess what someone in the crowd holds over the heads of everyone else so they can record his speech? Slap bang in the middle of the cinema screen? A bright pink nokia! Stop it!) There was also the very odd 'Dolby Digital' moment that I won't spoil, but when you get there, you'll know it!Nevertheless, this one still pushes all my buttons and I have finally found a reason to buy an HDTV and HD-DVD.9 out of 10",Cloverfield
752,bjones7-2,Pretty cool monster movie,7,21 January 2008,"The much anticipated ""Cloverfield"" was finally released and I finally saw it today. Being a looooong time Godzilla fan (japanese movies) I have been excited to see this movie since seeing the original teaser before ""Transformers"", and I really was not let down. It was an extremely original monster movie, and brought new life into the genre. The movie feels unbelievably realistic, to the point where it is pretty freaky sometimes. Although, I can really see where all of the people complaining about it making them remember the events of 9/11 are coming from. Because it feels exactly like it in many scenes where the monster is not involved. It's almost TOO realistic. If i have one complaint though, it is the monster. I thought it looked to cgi and fake sometimes, and wasn't shown enough, but maybe that's just me. Overall I thought Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams did a great job with this idea and made it very realistic and fun--7/10",Cloverfield
753,bloodweiser1,Dross... complete dross.,2,17 July 2009,"Where to start? Although Cloverfield has a high rating here on IMDb, I honestly believe it to be one of the worst movies I have recently viewed. No. Check that. It's one of the worst movies I have EVER viewed.I really cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can rate this movie highly - it has NO redeeming qualities. To begin with, the first 20 or so minutes are just pure tedium. My guess is that they were put there to ""flesh out"" the characters, but apart from being mind-numbingly boring, all they succeed in doing is to irritate. By the time the monster appeared, I really couldn't have cared less about the people in this movie. Sure, there are always those people who go down into the cellar when you just know there's a monster there. There has to be - without the characters doing dumb things there would be no movie. But the characters in this movie? I would have shoved them down the cellar steps myself. They're so dumb, so annoying, so damn pointless. In fact, if I were a monster in Manhattan, I would have specifically targeted these guys and squashed them or eaten them myself. Just to save the rest of the human race from having to share oxygen with them.And then the guts of the movie - the ""monster section"". There was nothing. No story to speak of, no monster to speak of (we see very little of it), no great finale, no real gore, no logic, nothing but a bunch of people running around, screaming on a jerky video camera. Sure, leave me something for my imagination but at the same time, at least give me SOMETHING to work with. Cloverfield is just empty. I feel like I got the husk of a movie, something with no substance - a chocolate wrapper without ever tasting the chocolate.There are those who will say that this movie has ""depth"". There are those who will say it is ""realistic"". There are those who will say that it stands out as ""unique"". Yeah? On which planet? Here on Planet Earth, all I saw was an incredibly dull and poorly made rehash of a Godzilla movie. I am utterly amazed that this dross pulls in more than a 7 rating. Not only that, but reading through some of the positive reviews here, I can't help wondering whether I actually went and viewed the same movie. Perhaps I just dreamt that I saw an incredibly bad movie called ""Cloverfield""? Perhaps I haven't seen the real ""Cloverfield"" that others seem to be raving about. That's really the only explanation I can come up with when looking at the discrepancies between my opinion of this trash and some of the views of the people who rave that it's a decent movie. Or maybe a lot of people see an America scarred by 911 and believe that a disaster movie where New York gets trashed is some sort of Holy Grail that can only be venerated? I honestly can't see any other reason for giving Cloverfield a second glance.Believe me: don't be fooled. Cloverfield is NOT a good movie. It's terrible. I could go on and on about what makes it bad, but analysing every scene would take ages and this movie really doesn't deserve any more of my time than I've already given it.",Cloverfield

For starters, there was virtually no character development. Even if you try to appreciate the movie for its special effects, it's a no go! Perhaps even worse, was the fact that the damn camera was shaking PROFUSELY throughout the ENTIRE movie! It's understandable that the perspective was shot via that of a novice camcorder, but they could have at least ensured that the bloody camera had Steady Shot! To say that the shaking was extremely annoying would be a gross miss understatement! As bad as the movie was, I stuck around until the end thinking that the film might somewhat at least TRY to redeem itself, by giving us some good visuals on the monster, but... Well, let's just say that I don't want to be accused of writing a spoiler!",Cloverfield
757,Friday_Saturday,Giant Monster! Killer Parasites! GREAT Movie!,10,20 January 2009,"First off, I'm not a big monster movie fan.Second, I wasn't a fan of this movie until a little while ago. I was following the boards for a long time, so it got me intrigued. Then, one of my best friends, Quel, who was afraid to watch TDK cuz she thought it'd be ""too scary,"" revealed that she thought that Cloverfield was ""the best movie EVER."" I HAD to see this movie.So, last night, me, Quel, and Neels all got together and watched it. Despite the fact that I'd read EVERYTHING about the movie prior to watching it, I was still on the edge of my seat the entire time. (Oh, and I saw the splash. Made Quel rewind it and play it frame-by-frame.) Several parts (Marlena's bite, torso-less soldier, Marlena explodes, getting Beth un-impaled) were a tad too gory for me, but overall, awesome movie. (Let me say, you haven't had a weird movie experience until you see it with me, Neels, and Quel. They're talking about how cute Rob was, I'm pitying the monster and saying that it's cute. It WAS.) I know that one of the biggest complaints about this movie was the shaky, first-person view. Didn't bug me. It pulled off some INSANELY awesome shots, and I suffered with the characters the whole way..I'm fully on board for a sequel.",Cloverfield
758,danim33,"Good movie, but take motion sickness meds before!",8,19 January 2008,"I have been looking forward to this movie ever since I saw an unnamed trailer online a long time ago. It did not disappoint, but it did make me feel ""car sick"" from almost the very beginning and one of the people in my group actually threw up in the bathroom at the end of the movie. Although it made me feel queasy, it did not take away from the experience too much, actually made it more real. If you are not prone to motion sickness, you will be fine, but I tolerated the Blair Witch and Bourne Identity movies just fine, so do not use those experiences to compare, because this one made me sick immediately, but it was mild and I still enjoyed the film greatly. It is funny, suspenseful, and gives you plenty of shots of the thing attacking New York, which is not Hilary Clinton, as one moviegoer shouted at the beginning of the movie- one of the reminders why going to the theater often can enhance the experience. So if you do not mind a shaky camera, and not having all the questions answered and just want to enjoy a different thrill type of movie, then go see it. If the shaky camera and unanswered questions will bother you, then you might want to pass, or wait until video when you can have a bucket nearby! 8/10! Addendum- I feel strongly that I should add, after having read other comments, that again, know what you are going to see. If you lived through 9/11 in New York, you may want to skip this if you are prone to post-traumatic stress, as the destruction of New York may bring that back to you. And, if you know you are prone to getting sick, then seriously, go to the store and get some over the counter medications! The warnings are out there people, heed them if you are vulnerable, rather than go then say it is a terrible movie!",Cloverfield
759,Bardok82000,Sort of kind of,6,23 December 2009,"I never went to see this in the cinema but after watching it i really have to say, It's alright in some respects and fair enough it isn't based on any truth anyway (lol). However it is chock full of corny acting by mid 20 model types, so anyway the start of the film introduces our heroes and how big a douche, they all are and at one point three friends are talking, two of the three ask the third for secrets about someone- she says no but after about 3 seconds of persuasion she gives in. Five to ten Min's into it the havoc soon ensues people panicking, eventually realising what kind of threat they're under the group of friends -the film's based around- head for safety looking for a way out of Manhattan (following a comfortable maze which ranges from subways to mall stores). In my opinion the group seem a little too confident on their ability to survive, another irritating aspect has to be the guy with the camera (conveniently named HUDD) no matter how close to dying they are THIS guy never seems to lose grip of his camcorder and his constant yammering surprisingly doesn't cause anyone to flip out and strangle him. He and his camcorder are in heaven now.A large chunk of the film involves a man desperate to find his gf before he can leave. Now with all this said it is just a film, and the rest of the films plot does retain a scary aspect and certain scenes make you want to question just what it is that's terrorising them and where it really came from. So if you can stomach 45 Min's of cheesy acting the rest is a breeze",Cloverfield
760,Sausage_Demon,Fresh take on a stale genre,9,17 January 2008,"Cloverfield brings some originality in the telling of the classic Monster attacks city story.Some like to complain about the fact that it is hand held and not filmed in the usual standard, this I feel is what made Cloverfield so easy to get into, as it has an almost first person experience. Others complain about the infinite battery on the camera...unless you want to be watching black after half an hour I think people should really let this one go, the ""infinite battery"" criticism is something people use who are looking to hate this film, they make a point of how unrealistic it is, you know since all other movies are entirely realistic of course.someone wrote a review saying they couldn't believe that the camera happened to have night vision settings, a built in light and all that. Well newsflash, most handi-cams these days come with those features, I have one over 3 years old that had a very bright light on it, plus a nightvision mode...very unrealistic of course.The two big things that really make this film great are two things missing not only from the genre but most films these days, and that is Characters you can care about, and not over explaining everything. This film doesn't explain what happens to NY, or the monster, or what the little creatures infect people with to make them explode, or where the monster comes from, why it is attacking NY. That may seem like a lot, but it allows people to use their imagination and considering most people these days do very little thinking I would call this film a type of therapy. The monster itself looks cool, I felt it could have had a slightly better design but since it is not in your face throughout the film that's forgivable. It is a new take on the genre, any monster film in the future will have to emulate the immersion the audience got with this film or fail outright. Some people will feel sick due to hand held filming, thats a given, and those who hate it when people do something new will hate it but I recommend giving this film a go, J.J. has redeemed himself to some degree with this film after ruining LOST with season 2&3.",Cloverfield
761,evasmum,How could a monster movie be this dull?,5,20 January 2008,"I'm always up for a great Hollywood monster movie - nail biting thrills...great special effects...heroes you can very nearly care for. Well this ain't it. The first 15 minutes is just excruciating as we are forced to 'get to know' a group of pretty awful, self satisfied 'Ys'. 15 minutes of pointless, tedious back story that could have been established in 2 minutes. And if that isn't bad enough we are made to watch it all (nauseously) via a hand-held camera. This is followed by 55 minutes watching these same people...or rather their backs...or mostly their feet shakily run from (apparent) horror to horror. The most amazing thing about this movie was how completely lack lustre and dull it is. A seemingly clever idea...but no better than any run of the mill video game out there with a 'run away from the monster premise'. We were conned by the cleverness of the 'ad'- once again no film could live up to the hype, and certainly not one with characters you really don't care about, doing REALLY stupid things for the flimsiest of reasons.",Cloverfield
762,DuffyShort,Godzilla meets Blair Witch and Dr. Strangelove,1,26 January 2008,"This movie is not worth watching. I can best explain it as Godzilla meets Blair Witch and Dr. Strangelove. The persons that rated it as a ten must be on drugs. The theater was almost empty at the start and the feedback among patrons after the show was consistent. This show is a real waste of time. The sound is way too loud and out of control. The special effects are adequate, but why waste the technology to make this junk. Get a job or do some volunteer work, don't go to Cloverfield. It would be time well spent compared with watching this. I bet that if a poll were done that less than 1% would sit through this again. I would rather watch Milo and Otis again, or was it Otis and Milo....RR",Cloverfield
763,elandyll,Disappointed,6,21 January 2008,"The movie, despite (and certainly not thanks to) the shaky camera was enjoyable. But did it live up to the hype it tried to generate? No, at least not for me. Not even close.The Story can be summarized in just one sentence: ""Giant Monster attacks New York and a bunch of friends are caught in the middle."" This is what is generally called a ""pitch"" in the Hollywood biz, and it is supposed to generate interest, and make you want to know more.Alright. There's been worse teasers in the past. But what's -beyond- this pitch, this one-liner? I mean, you gotta have a script, a story, right? Not here, I am sorry to say. This one sentence, this ""pitch"", -is- the story, from beginning to end. Oh there are some great moments, visually very impressive, and even some genuine scares (fewer than some people might have you think). But in the end it's going nowhere fast. If you could imagine the bastard child of Godzilla (the Emmerich version) and ""Friends"", that'd be it, also thanks to the weirdly out of context ""humorous"" comments made by the cameraman (who, for someone intent on filming ""how we all went down"", is doing one hell of a crappy job at letting us see what is going on. I swear he was shaking the camera on purpose at times).Acting is suitable, certainly not Oscar worthy, the script nonexistent, and some rather stupid decisions made by the characters will rapidly leave you uninterested in their fate, letting you picking while talking with your friends who did which ""most stupid"" action or decision.In the end, the movie will be probably a hit due to teenage interest in great FX, mix of action-horror (kinda ""light"" on the horror side) and the bunch of friends stacked against impossible odds. Some could also mention the same recipe used in Lost (more questions than answers thrown in the mix) and doing something ""just because it sounded cool at the time"" and let people think there is something deep behind it. No wonder with J.J Abrahams at the production.This being said, rarely have I seen such a vacuum of a story put on the big screen, and that is saying something.In the end, I cannot bring myself to rate ""Cloverfield"" any higher than 6, despite having genuinely enjoyed some moments, between the headache inducing camera moves. Great visuals and a few scares do not a movie make. If you look for great visuals, an actual story where you care about people and that makes you think, try to find a theater where ""The Mist"" is still playing. You'll thank me later.",Cloverfield
764,darkenchantment-1,great,9,3 February 2008,"one of the best films I've seen in years. ignore all the kids and the losers on youtube and other sites that can't understand what this movie is suppose to be.the movie is told from the perceptive of civilians, normal every day people; so don't expect a lot of questions to be answered. this is not bad movie making because it was intended to be done in this way!the camera work is suppose to be shaky, and the shots are meant to be blurly; it gives you enough without showing u too much and i thought that was great.i loved the idea of knowing only what the characters in the story knew, it felt as if i was right there with them trying to make it out of the city.if you want everything to be explained to you because you are too dumb to come to your own conclusions, there's millions of other movies u can watch that will give u that; but if u want something a bit different, then watch this.",Cloverfield
765,ShawnM1,What is going on here?,2,25 January 2008,"This website used to be a place I could get fairly reliable reviews. It appears to be now polluted with idiots or people getting paid by the studios because everyone in the theater where I saw this let out mumbles of disappointment by the film's end, yet I see plenty of enthusiastic reviews on here. Cloverfield is a very big disappointment and a total ripoff on a whole slew of footage and Fx that were made for prior films. It lacks everything from originality, good acting, pace, character development, Etc. I left the theater with a minor headache. There were a few suspenseful scenes, but not worth the hassle. Also, I am not coming back to this website for reliable reviews again.",Cloverfield
766,Dennue,Didn't see it in the theaters,4,11 October 2008,"I didn't see it in the theaters cause I really wasn't that interested. My friends all saw it and they said it was alright so I decided to watch it when my friend bought it on DVD. I was at his house watching it and honestly I was just annoyed the entire time I was watching it. The acting was terrible and I really didn't give a about any of the characters. One of my friends told me it was so I wouldn't feel so bad when they start dying. The monster stuff was pretty cool but I just hated the characters so much and the beginning with the whole party (I understand it was meant for character development and everything) was terrible. I don't care about these people, I have no reason to care about these people. Maybe if they weren't so lame I would like them a little more but they just aren't likable at all. When does the monster happen? I just want the monster to happen! I have to say though, one scene I thought was really cool was the very end when the footage cuts back to before the accident and there is a shot of the ocean. My friend pointed out that you see something fall from the sky and land in the water, possibly the monster.",Cloverfield
767,lnorder,Draws you in!,9,1 May 2021,"What an awesome movie! Although it has a slow start, once the action begins, it completely draws you in! The visual effects in combination with the shaky handheld cam, makes you feel as if you are running through Manhattan with them. The scenes in the apartment buildings where Beth is trapped, are very eerie and surreal. Well done!The monster is already creation, original and frightening. There are no explanations as to why, how and what, which makes it even more realistic. The abandoned carriage with the horse running around in the midst of chaos and destruction is unsettling. The traumatic experiences of this group of friends become yours while watching. You are running with them as the viewer, drawn into this frenzy madness and fear. No room for happy endings, no heroes defeating the bad guys. The monster wins. What a great production!",Cloverfield
768,fivesaints,Breathtaking and very Realistic,9,21 January 2008,"When I first came to the movie, I had heard skeptics about it and heard that people were getting motion sickness; the movement of the camera was too intense for them...Finally though, I was able to first walk in to see the climax of the previous events. The movie starts out with actual realism to playing home video: really cool to me...After the camera is rolling about Robs personal life the monster finally attacks after his surprise going away party. His friend, Beth, whom had a sexual relationship with him weeks earlier is now trapped in midtown and is in need of rescue. During the movie I thought that their was no storyline but that the basis of the movie was for closure, more of a regret that Rob needed to say *I love you Beth* (At the end this makes perfect sense.) Well after they rescue her the monster crashes their helicopter that is taking them out of the city and they do die, but at the very end get to say,""I love You"" which was really what he wanted to do(Rob) Back to the realism of the whole movie: if a disaster was following a video recording on a home video of a group of people their would be now story line and no background to what it is or why is it happening...The realism of the movie is spectacular*gratz for director* because their was no music no huge orchestra to outline a foreshadowing event.The movie was dazzling and all in pieces when I left but made more than real sense when I put the pieces together!!!! 8.5/10!!! Great movie in the end!!",Cloverfield
769,sheshetta,Don't Be Such a Sissy!,10,12 October 2008,"People said the same thing about ""The Blair Witch Project""; that is, the hand held camera made them nauseated. Get over yourself. It is an effective film technique that is used to heighten the feeling of panic and escalate the manifestation of fear in the film. I liked ""Cloverfield"". I thought it was great fun. I thought the hand held camera was used to good advantage to help build the emotion and move the story along. It is appropriate to the characters running in the streets from a gigantic monster. It helps heighten our own fear and is appropriate to the situation. It certainly would not have been the same movie without it.",Cloverfield
770,michelleeb,loved it,10,2 February 2008,"First, see it in the cinema - you need that massive surround sound.Second - this was so clever. This is supposed to be the film someone takes on his video camera on the day New York is attacked by ... something. That means the camera-work is sloppy and amateur - which makes the whole thing look incredibly real and immediate. The characters are just so normal and ordinary - they could very easily be someone you know. And the destruction of New York is breathtaking - seeing on a hand-held, amateur camera like that gives it overtones of 9/11.And there were a few genuine scream moment- and I hardly ever scream.This is an intelligent monster movie for those who like their horror, death and disaster mysterious, unexplained, and without 'clever' funny lines. If all you want is a big monster, snappy one-liners and a pat ending, complete with explanation, watch Godzilla. If you want a challenging monster movie, one that makes you feel this could happen to you, this is the one.",Cloverfield

Cloverfield.As I watched this movie I just kept wondering what I would build on the vacant plots of land that the monster was leaving behind.Enjoyed the movie, once you get passed the first 15 minutes of plot filler (that was never in SimCity! though maybe it will be in the latest version :-)I can't wait for the alien attack sequel.",Cloverfield
774,ruthspiteri,A lot of things dragged it down.,4,2 September 2020,"My biggest complaint is that the introduction where everything's calm and you're supposed to bond with the characters goes on for WAY TOO LONG. For a whole quarter of the movie this guy with a camera goes around talking to the party guests and it's clear we're supposed to be bonding with the characters, but it just doesn't work because there's too many of them and it's too casual apart from a stereotypical cheating partner sub-plot. It could have been bearable if there was some dread buildup, something to show that things weren't quite right.Other than that, the monster itself isn't particularly unique. It's parasites are unexpected and make the film a bit more interesting. But I was severely disappointed when the consequences of their bite/disease just ended with the person exploding. Like really? That's the writing of a child. From other reviews I was expecting more talk on the origins of the monster and how it and its parasites function, but either I didn't catch it all or maybe there's some interviews or content explaining it that I don't know about.The only saving grace is the great acting, the way the film was shot and the realistic scenes of panic and destruction. Unfortunately the bad points weigh this film down too much.",Cloverfield
775,ANightToRemember,"Quite possibly the ""King Kong"" of this generation",8,18 January 2008,"Wow... just, just wow. This film was, without a doubt, one of the most incredible films I have seen in recent years. I expected something along the lines of Emmerich's Godzilla, but I was very wrong. From the moment this film starts, it's addicting. You immediately begin to wonder about these characters, will they live or die? Cloverfield is about a group of people who are throwing a going away party to their friend Rob, who is leaving to Japan for a business promotion. During the party, however, all hell breaks loose when an ""earthquake"" strikes the city (New York City). After an explosion, and the Statue of Liberty scene, they go on a journey to find Beth, Rob's ex-lover, who is trapped in her apartment.Acting was very good from everyone is the picture. With no-names running the show, I was surprised at how good they were, considering monster films can be some of the hardest films to act in. And with a 30 million dollar budget, they did a lot. That is very little for a film(the average is about 70-100 million). J.J. and his team did a fantastic job on this film. With the mixed reviews, I was worried about everything that would happen, would it be worth the money I paid for a ticket? Guess what? The answer is, without a doubt, yes.J.J., Mr. Reaves, and everyone else involved, I hope your proud, because it was one hell of a ride.",Cloverfield
776,terren8556,Stunning and Groundbreaking,9,28 January 2008,"There are only three other movies that I have seen that have evoked such intense empathy on my part as did ""Cloverfield""""Open Water,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and ""Wolf Creek."" All of them shared, to a varying degree, features that I consider extremely effective: a cast of unknowns, minimal to no musical score, a minimal to nonexistent use of sets, and dialogue that one must think was improvised or so ingeniously written that the viewer is convinced that the people on the screen are not actors, but are real, and ordinary people that are being eavesdropped upon. A large part of making that work is that films such as these take their time in getting the viewer to the crisis/disaster, and convince you of the fact that the people on screen don't just exist for the sake of the movie, but existed, and have lives and concerns and issues that began, long before we are introduced to them on the screen.Thus, when they experience the horrors that they eventually do, one feels right there with them, and feels that what is on the screen is really happening to them.There are no opening credits; the opening scene of the movie is of one of the twentysomething male characters in a rather posh upper Manhattan apartment, clowning around with his camera, and then rousing his sleeping girlfriend. They tease each other about what they are going to do with the day. In the background, out the window, are Central Park, the forest of buildings and the streets far below, teeming with traffic. The dialogue is completely mundane and real. The view of the city, on the eve of what is to happen, is majestic, and spectacular. That is clearly for a reason.Eventually, we see the preparations for a party, one of the characters arguing and bantering with his other friends, shopping at a corner grocery store, one of the women getting off a line that causes the cashier to laugh.Then the party at a midtown Manhattan walk up apartmentagain, all captured by the hand-held camera that changes hands and is there for posteritya send off gift to one of the principal characters who is off to Japan for a big-time job.The movie spends a lot of time at the party, one attended almost exclusively by other twentysomethings gossiping, dancing, goofing off, drinking, making fools of themselves, and flirting. Again, I got the sense that it wasn't a movie, but a documentary or reality TV show of a real party. It, and the participants were in and of themselves so believable and interesting that I and some of the other people in the audience chuckled at what was going on.Disaster, and the end of life as was known, begins without warning, and in the blink of an eye. The amount of time that the movie has spent showing us the characters, and the city, during normal and ordinary life renders what unfolds for the rest of the movie all the more wrenching. Life, and reality, for the characters, and for New York City, is turned upside down, and irrevocably, in an instant.Unlike any previous such disaster/monster film that I know of ""Cloverfield,"" shows in graphic and realistic horror (with the viewer in the middle of it) what the people on the ground would experience were such a thing to really happen. In reading some of the reviews online or in the papers, I've noted that people have talked of, or criticized, the movie's implied allegories to 9/11. I think that's overly simplistic. The source of the chaos and death is almost irrelevant. The human condition/reaction under such circumstances would be the same whether one substituted any sudden real world calamity--a mass terrorist attack, an earthquake, a bombing raid, or tsunami. The horror would not only stem from the source of the destruction, but the suddenness of the event, the complete lack of knowledge (at least initially) of what is happening, and the utter helplessness. In communicating this, ""Cloverfield,"" was unsparing in depicting what it would probably be like to be at that age, to begin an evening, at a party, with a vast future seemingly assured and taken for granted, and then, by wee hours of the following morning, to suddenly have the rug pulled from under you, and to suddenly be in the middle of a war zone, fighting for your life, clawing for survival, seeing the city you live in crumble, and seeing people--including people very close to you--dying en masse and violently, before your eyes. The special effects were all the more potent in that the advent of the attack begins at night, amid a sea of light and explosions. The depiction of the collapsing of the buildings was not merely effectiveit looked as if it were really happening. Initially all that we, and the characters know is that a vast and destructive force has been unleashed, and is completely out of control. The creature, when finally revealed, is all the more terrifying in that it is totally malevolent, destructive in the extreme, and in that no one we encounter in the film, from the military people to the newscasters, seems to have a clue as to what it is, where it came from, or how to stop it.An especially effective, and heart sinking scene is when the soldier confides in one the characters and his companion, the true magnitude of what is happening, and that if they're to try to find one of their friends, they have little time and need to get out of the city as soon as possible. It is all but confirmed to the viewer that there will be no eleventh hour triumph, or happy ending.""Cloverfield"" is a first of its kind meld of drama and science fiction that I think is destined to be a classic.",Cloverfield

It was entertaining and thats all you can ask for in movie like this. You don't need great acting you just need to be simply entertained. I thought it was a good idea to have the movie shot from the point of view of one of the charters it made you feel like you were there.

778,dpo-6,Excellent Monster Movie,9,19 January 2008,"Aside from the very drab first twenty minutes or so (though they bear a striking resemblance to most home videos you would see coming from twenty-somethings...) this movie was very, very well done. The suspense level once things get rolling (literally, the Statue of Liberty's head comes flying down the street) is top notch. I found myself white-knuckled for long periods of time, wanting to see the monster, but not wanting to at the same time because I knew what it was capable of. As for the monster, it was very cool, great design, and HUGE! The special effects for such a smaller budgeted film are awesome and Phil Tippet's studio did a great job on the big monster, along with the mites or whatever they were, that were attached to it. The acting is spotty, but for an unknown cast, pretty well done. The best part about the movie though, is unlike the Blair Witch crap, you actually feel like you are running with the characters and it makes the experience that much more intense. Great movie, great CGI and a fun theater experience. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see America's Godzilla (which by the way, Cloverfield's beast would destroy Godzilla if they ever had to fight!). 9/10 for doing what it was supposed to do: create a fun movie experience.",Cloverfield

If you want to save your money, shake your head a lot, scream, and bang it from time to time against the wall.Overall, it is a pity, because I would like to see some new great sci-fi thriller, but unfortunately every attempt is bad clone of something.

Not much, and the shaky camera thing didn't help in anyway, it actually made it worst.

The movie succeeds, and delivers as promised.As reported elsewhere, the film unfolds from the point of view of some people being filmed on a hand held video camera. When things start happening they are totally clueless, as are the military personnel that show up.People panic and make irrational decisions. Unexpected heroism leads to tragedy. People find hidden strength they did not know they had. The monster rampages, confused and deadly. People die.The interpersonal drama is what makes this movie work so well. The scarcity of direct views of the monster help rack up the tension. In saying that, one does get to view the monster, and it is impressive. It has a certain weird realism to it that makes it that much more intense.Overall, this is one hell of an intense ride IF one just accepts it as if it is real footage while watching. The hand-held stuff can be a bit disconcerting at times,but it also lends itself to making things seem more real. I highly recommend Cloverfield. It is innovative and involving.",Cloverfield
784,Lord_of_all_zombies,Intense Action/Thriller,8,22 January 2008,"I decided to use my ""movie money"" that I got for the holidays on this movie. It was well worth it.Cloverfield gets your attention and keeps you drawn in, wondering ""What happens next?"" throughout the whole movie. The action is intense, the cinematography is great (For how its done, that is, with a camcorder) and this movie makes you cringe, jump and laugh in all th right places.The characters are realistic and there's no big-name actor to pay special attention to. I actually CARED about the characters a little bit, something I do very rarely for movies.Give it a shot if you're a big action/sci-fi/thriller fan. You won't be disappointed! 8/10",Cloverfield
785,villanwilson87,The finest picture monster movie of all time!,9,1 February 2008,"In my time of watching films nearly all my life, I have never witnessed a film like this. Before the film was released, there was this big hype of potential, and a massive marketing scheme for the release date of this film, know-one never seen a big budget monster film, or about the monster itself because the film was kept secret. People either saying it is going to be another War Of The Worlds or Godzilla or just another promising movie becoming a disappointment. And after watching this film, I have never witnessed something so striking and ground-breaking. This is a film that you will never forget because it is different, very different. There has been many similar monster movies in the past, but this film flips all of them easily. The story is basically simple and something very clever thanks to the brilliance of J.J. Abrams and an unknown Matt Reeves. The film opens up with the main characters party before he leaves for Japan, and we then watch and try and solve who are the main characters with ease. Then the monster arrives with one of the most memorable action sequences to date with an explosion and the Statue of Liberty's head on a main street in New York, and yet we still haven't seen the monster yet which makes it even more terrifying. Then the Carnage begins with a group of people and one person holding the camera throughout the rest of the movie, whilst all of them are picked off one by one randomly and quite horrifically. The camera work is disorientating but at the same time very realistic and this what makes the film very clever, because it feels like you are there with the survivors and also watching the camera flick to the side and catching glimpses of the enormous and quite breathtaking, most terrifying monster you will see. When watching this film, bizarrely you start to think that this could actually happen with the way that the civilians react to the arrival and the military throwing everything they have at the beast but to no use. There is also other great spectacular sequences in the film, either the Brooklyn bridge sequence, military fighting and stopping the monster whilst it creates massive and amazing destruction on the city on several accounts, and in one sequence which is so scary (reminiscent of Blair Witch Project) in the tunnel sequence where you will move not one part of your body until it's over. On a budget of only thirty million dollars, this is a triumph in Sound design, camera work, and obviously the C.G.I. on the monster. The film is ground-breaking, moving, funny, shocking, spectacular action sequences that will live long in the memory. This is what Abrams and Reeves set out to do and did it in some style. This film was made for the silver screen and it's cinematic genius at it's best. One of the greatest films ever created and one that is a classic within it's genre.",Cloverfield
786,Deschenes,Worth My Money,7,24 April 2008,"While deciding to see this movie, I thought it was going to be a waste of money and time. The runtime looked too short, under 1:30, the genre looked too dumb, and hearing about the filming style, I was having doubts. At first, after taking up what seemed like half the movie, I thought I knew that I was right. Then, the action started. The action was fast paced, there were no long periods of time with nothing happening. The ending was kind of a surprise, but ended like the Blair Witch. After thinking about it, I have realized that this was a great movie. It had a monster that couldn't be described in words, great killings, and lots of blood. A different style monster movie.",Cloverfield

I had read all the reviews and watched the trailers and clips and really may have gotten myself over-hyped for the whole thing but......FOR ME, I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. I am a big fan of sci-fi/horror movies and thought this had a lot of potential, even though it carried a PG-13 rating. After the ""earthquake"" the movie goes head on into action/sci fi and never stops. When the Statue of Liberty's head lands in the street and people are scream I was going crazy. That was wild and fun to watch. Also, there is a lot of talk about 9/11 and such but you know what, I could not even compare or think about that while watching this. I am sure there are plenty that say it reminds them so much of it when the building goes down. In any case, if a building callopses, there is going to be a lot of dust and smoke ...... So the acting is first rate, the special effect are first rate, and the whole set-up of the movie is first rate. go out with and open mind, some motion sickness pills, and hopefully enjoy one of the best monster destroys a city movie in a long time.",Cloverfield
788,apetitefor,Really Good,9,6 April 2008,"An amazing movie! Original, full of unknowing segments which can stop your heart out and most of all- done with a lot of thinking and analyzing how a person can react in dangerous situations. It's not just the crazy action scenes where the American soldiers fire at the monster and the guy with the camera is trying to take cover, giving you the chance to experience something that has never been done before in the world of cinema. It gives you the preview of normal daily life with a bunch of people who are throwing a party for their best friend who is going to somewhere and you don't want to loose contact with him. And everything goes on and on, until suddenly the reality strikes you and last but not least, fear is contacting in you in a full circle of madness.As final words, I don't want to spoil anything for you, I just strongly recommend you this movie, done by a real genius, who knows how, when and where to put his big sack of money. And truly he should be taken as an example of how can you do an amazing job, without wasting cash on something that has been already seen. 9/10 By the way I'm giving 9 out of 10, because there were some parts which i really didn't like- for example the way the monster is showing up . Its true that it can be seen from another side, like who cares, this is the real world, this is really happening, a monster is coming, so i don' t have time to read news or something like that.But, it would have been cooler and more satisfying to have hidden- mini introduction of the terror. Again, this could be a hint, a step for another sequel, and if there is... ooo I'm going to watch it, definitely. :)",Cloverfield

But with a few words I could say that Im proud to watch this movie...! I really appreciate how difficult was for the director to show as all this amazing special effects coming from the ""home camera""...shaking...with not filters and huge color resolutions... If the director's idea was to make it look and feel real....then he did the best anyone has done until now in the movies history! So what if the camera was shaking all the time?...why everything has to be so perfect in the Hollywood industry?..and had to be a ""perfect"" studio movie?.....believe me if it was a huge ""perfect"" movie I would had this warm feelings about it right now...and I would'not siting and writing a comment about it! Im really proud watching this...it gave me a lot of feelings..some of them horror ones...some happy ones! I would really like to watch a sequel soon...I look forward for it..even if its not going to be the same good like the first one.. Mr director you have a lot of explaining to do !!! and keep up the amazing work and brain you have!",Cloverfield
790,smart_harsh,Amazing movie,8,4 January 2009,"Cloverfield is a story of a night when a monster attacks New York City, told from the point of view of 4 friends. At first I thought it to be another monster attack movie but the movie is different.Firstly because it's a story told from the point of view of 4 friends, who happen to be at a party the night. Secondly it is shot as if one of the friends is shooting the events of the night on his video camera, probably to upload it on YouTube. Thirdly because it does not put them into mission to save the world or in fact the city, as they try to rescue a friend of their.As the story is told as if being shot from a hand held video camera, many a times camera angle becomes erratic as you don't get the full view and also shaky at times.Movie has its share of special effects, like the beheaded Statue of Liberty but they are a limited due to the story line and camera angle, which is something hard to digest for a monster movie.Being a story told from a group's point of view we do lose out on getting a panoramic view of the whole story and at times feels like where some people are just walking the lanes of ruined city.It's a decent movie with a different point of view. This movie is a must watch who likes movies which are different and not for viewer who like to see loads of special effects and world saving moments.http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/",Cloverfield
791,mtali42,Pure Genius!!,9,14 March 2008,"This film has exceeded my prior expectations. This film is so good that it is safe to say that it is way before its time. The director took a risk in the way he shot the film and pulled it off extremely well. Just when you think that Hollywood is getting monotonous with blockbusters and losing its audiences with the rise of lame independent films. They go and pull a fat, obese, artery clotting rabbit out its tiny, minute, mouse sized hat. There really isn't much more I can say, other than its ingenious. Not only did they take risks in shooting the film, but the film stars a bunch of unknown, young, newcomers. Although the film is shot in an irregular, home video, amateur-ish, documentary type of style; the director was very methodical in giving the audience what it needed and wanted at the precise times throughout the entire film. The characters and their stories, although realistic, were the only weak points in the film.I will warn you though. If you've seen 'The Blair Witch Project' or have seen documentaries involving camcorders and constant movement while filming, and while viewing you've felt nausea, or some type of sickness arising, than you probably shouldn't watch this film.",Cloverfield
792,silkshadow,"Run faster fat ass, I want to see the end of the movie!",8,19 July 2008,"I really enjoyed this movie, though I am glad I waited for it to come out on HD disc before watching it. This movie - will - make you dizzy at times but its a trade off, as the filming style allows you to really get engrossed into this movie. I found myself saying: ""Run faster fat ass, I want to see the end of the movie!"" several times. The first person angle got me so engrossed with this movie that, among other things, I sometimes forgot myself and worried about the ""cameraman"" surviving so I could see how it ended. I had a three friends over watching the movie with me, and a couple times that I yelled that they actually yelled along with me instead of just laughing.Other than the filming style, this was a great movie. It was totally engrossing and fast paced. It created a great air of tension but only sparingly used the ""jump out and say boo"" element that so many other movies abuse and overuse, making it meaningless. Actually, there may have only been one of those in the entire movie! When the movie ended I wanted more, the hallmark of a good movie experience.I might have to say that the acting was aided by the filming method, not relying on the actors to do much more than look scared and yell many times; but I couldn't actually tell you if they were good actors or not. It doesn't matter. This movie didn't need much acting as the story and direction were the real stars.Took 2 points off because the camera work made me very dizzy in several scenes and I had to pause it and settle my head. There has to be a way to use this filming technique without making the audience ill.",Cloverfield
793,kadianpusher,Why can't a disaster movie ever have REAL people?!,1,26 September 2013,"Don't know why, but never saw Cloverfield until the other night, and didn't really know what the movie was about. Just saw a 77 Rotten T rating on Direct TV and taped it. To say this is one of the worst film I've even sat through is an understatement! Yes, it completely rips off The Blair Witch, who is now a 500 foot monster in New York City. I'm mind-boggled how anyone with any sense could find this movie even the slightest bit entertaining.??? It drags on in the beginning with ""Hud"" (TJ Miller) who is given a hand-held video recorder to film comments about some friends who are preparing for marriage. BORING. Of course the camera wiggles and goes in and out of focus to the point of migraine. BTW, how did Miller ever get an acting job. You only hear his voice through 99% of the movie, and that's annoying enough! So the monster FINALLY shows up and people do what they always do in Hollywood movies.... The exact opposite of reality. If you see a 500 ft monster destroying NYC and a friend wants to go straight towards it, to save his girlfriend who is injured, you're not going to follow. More like, ""You are crazy, and if you go it's on your own, idiot!"" Oh, and when your buddy holding the camera continuously films your friends getting killed cause ""people will need to see this,"" instead of turning the damn thing off and helping, you're probably going to kill or seriously injure him. It was so stupid!!! You also know that, like in Blair Witch, they are all going to die and the camera will capture it. Took me 5 min to figure that one out. Oh yeah, the guy actually does get to his injured girlfriend. Yeah, she's got a piece of rebar sticking out through her chest from the building she was in falling over. She's not dead. Nope, she is very much alive, and is then violently pulled of the rebar, and then continues to run around, seemingly unhurt, the rest of the film. Of course, only until she's killed in the last scene... A ""7"" score on IMDb??? Is this for real, or is this as science fiction as the characters in this awful movie. Oh, there's a sequel coming. Wow!",Cloverfield
794,DEATHSukka4,"Fresh, intense, and exciting all around.... but does ""Clovi"" dethrone Godzilla?",7,27 June 2011,"I never got the chance to review this movie, but now that JJ Abrams has released yet another monster movie blockbuster (Super 8, 2011), I thought maybe people would be turned on to Cloverfield. Perhaps this review might offer some insight on the film, but probably not...In a time of remakes and Sex in the City, Cloverfield was exactly what Hollywood and cinema all over the world needed and it was refreshing to see an all but forgotten genre revisited.With the perfect marketing strategy, JJ Abrams and his production company Bad Robot had interested movie-goers on pins and needles as clues revealed more of what Cloverfield was about. An extensive viral marketing campaign, some of which is still up today, brought amazing depth into this movie. Although very little of the viral marketing is referenced in the film, those who watched carefully the prior year of the film's release were treated to a spectacle nonetheless. And even after all this hype, Cloverfield excellently delivered.The whole style in which the film was shot is important, because I believe it's a realistic reaction of today's society. In a metropolis like New York City, homw to millions, there is bound to be thousands or even tens of thousands of video cameras in operation at any given moment - web-cams, cell phone cams, handhelds... You know it kind of reminds me of the ""tornado"" event that swept through New York City last year (2010). The following day, there were hundreds of videos uploaded to Youtube documenting all the different perspectives from different areas of the city. Of course this is also reminiscent of 9/11. Nothing brings more closure to a situation than seeing it from eyewitness points of view, where the intensity of the event is not just seen but more-so experienced. A lot of people docked Cloverfield for the shaky, awkward hand-held camera style but it just wouldn't have worked any other way.While I think it was a pretty genius idea it also presents an awkward point to build a sequel from too. Should it also be shot in hand-held? If it were, than would it really be worth seeing in theaters again? It was an intense effect, but I don't think it would be as marketable a second time.The actors are decent but definitely no Oscar winning roles here. While they do provide enough of a emotional connection to the audience to really bring them into the movie, the only real flaws are the inconsistencies in behaviors and really forced dialogue. It didn't help JJ Abrams to keep the movie so secret that not even the cast had a full understanding of what was happening and sometimes it shows as the dialogue and reactions seem random at times and ""no-sells"" certain effects or even a whole scene. For example, there is no dialogue about the monster or the event itself - most of the dialogue revolves around Rob's lost girlfriend, who they set out to rescue instead of saving themselves. In fact I don't think they ever mention the monster or the parasites that drop from it. It's pretty awkward that the only real dialogue about what's going on is mainly gathered from newscasts or military jargon happening in the background. The actors do simply a satisfactory job with what they had to work with - which is saying a lot because they had nothing to work with in the first place.The real star of the show is of course Clovi (the monster), of who JJ Abrams reveals bits and pieces of throughout the movie. He doesn't seem to have any particular superpower but even though his lungs are located outside of his body Clovi is impervious to explosions and all kinds of different military ammunition. His mannerisms on camera seem animalistic but otherwise he seems to have some sort of political agenda when not in the frame of Hud's hand-held. In the production diary on the DVD, he's described as a confused baby that's maybe defending itself in an unknown alien world, but ripping off the statue of liberty's head and tossing it across the city directly in front of Hud could earn him some votes in Iran, Russia, or North Korea. Now Clovi seems to get around despite the fact we don't see him move too much in the scenes he's in. Mostly he's roaring at the camera while the military frantically fires away, doing as much damage to the city as the monster (see War on Iraq). But he seems to be heading to the same part of town as our band of heroes because wouldn't you know it - they just keep bumping into each other! Well... JJ Abrams claimed that he wanted America to have its own monster and to have its own franchise comparable to Godzilla in Japan, in which apparently there are entire stores devoted to the King of Monsters. The reason why Cloverfield doesn't live up to Godzilla is because it would had to have been released at that time in Cinema when monster movies were the big thing, way back in the 1950's and 1960's. Hell, they could've had a competitive run back in the 1980's even... but for today's audience a monster movie is more of a cliché, corny spectacle rather than a truly scary experience. There was a time that Hollywood was over-saturated with the same old monster movie, remade time and time again. So right of the bat, the timing of Cloverfield is way off - by two decades at least. But then again, it was refreshing.",Cloverfield
795,afamouspetty,"OK, but not a must see",3,8 June 2008,"After seeing previews I was ready to watch this film.The beginning clips of the film make it seem very believable with the intro. You actually feel you are watching a home video. Similar to the ""blair witch project"" but not quite as ""raw footage"" as that.During this time, you get to know the characters briefly and get an overview of who is who. It actually is a little boring.Then it switches gears, still filming as if watching a home movie, and you are taken to a party scene. This part is very boring and could not hold my interest. I would have rather them moved ahead. It seemed a little unnecessary and really had me ready to move on to another movie.It then picked up a little when the ""news"" breaks in during the party. Some of the reactions are a little over done, in my opinion. They all leave the party to find out what is going on.Havoc ensues and everyone is running for cover. Their curiosity gets the best of them and they just have to go out in the danger, debris, and unknown. The movie begins to pick up at this point. You then want to see what is reeking havoc on NY but they keep you in suspense with just a few little glimpses here and there. It is effective. The movie continues as if it were some one's home video tape which makes it seem a little more believable with the movements that would take place if someone was running or walking with camera. The way the filming was done came across believable and convincing.However, throughout the movie a few second blurbs flash with images of two of the main characters outlining their friendship. That broke up some of the effectiveness when the blurbs would pop in. Regardless of the reasoning it made the overall watching a video tape less believable and it strayed away from the original filming. There was one point it sort of worked when the characters were ""viewing"" the tape and you were kept occupied with the clips of the friends. But all the other break in's throughout the film sort of spoiled it.When you finally get to some better information and some more images of the attackers in the movie, it reminds you of what the movie is about. Sadly it just did not deliver as you would expect.The movie has some good parts, some good story points. The filming was effective for the most part and this overall could have been so much better.The movie was OK for me, not quite what I expected. It really wasn't a movie I could watch again. Once was enough. I don't really think this is a must watch movie.",Cloverfield

In fact it was so shaky and vague that i had no idea that one of the main characters had died until 10 minutes later when the leading male characters says so. overall i was left wondering why the director even bothered to use CGI, the camera movements were so shaky a big cardboard cut out would have sufficed for the creature! needless to say i would not recommend this film for anything other than burning.watch Godzilla instead...at least you will know what is happening",Cloverfield
797,Spookwhiskey,Film Review - Cloverfield,9,20 January 2008,"Following a six month viral marketing campaign marked by its steadfast and absolute refusal to cough up so much as a cursory peek at its creature of feature, Cloverfield arrives as something of a miracle in this spoilerific age: an honest to goodness blockbuster that's managed to save its thrills for the theatre, an intense, accomplished dash through B-movie terrain given a snappy do-over thanks to a fresh eye and the savvy execution of a potentially gimmicky conceit.It's the night of Rob's (Michael Stahl-David) going away party, a last hurrah thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) prior to his jetting off for an impressive new job appointment in Japan. Asked to document the occasion on Rob's handicam, Hud (T.J. Miller) finds it difficult to keep his wandering lens off the beautiful ring-in Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), the aloof object of his puppy-dog affections. But when Rob's one-time partner and long-time secret love Beth (Odette Yustman) departs early with her latest squeeze, it's only a hiccup in time before their lives are changed forever, as New York city finds itself at the mercy of some horror from the depths, some great, lumbering thing...Shot entirely in handicam point-of-view with Miller's Hud acting as both commentator and cameraman, Cloverfield takes the 'human perspective of catastrophic events' approach employed by Spielberg's War of the Worlds and pushes it even further, offering a frenetic, man's-eye-view of the disastrous and grand-scale destruction typically relegated to Godzilla flicks. Towers are felled and bridges collapsed as the mysterious leviathan blazes a trail of ruin through inner Manhattan, the audience offered only the most fleeting of glances at the lion's share of the action as our band of protagonists flit in and out of shopfronts and alleyways in an ongoing effort to survive.The hand-held photography is the real hook here, a device which proves eminently inspired. Director Matt Reeves sure knows how to sell the immediacy, ensuring the camera-work remains every nauseating bit as frantic and chaotic as you'd expect of the real thing. Sticking to his faux-vérité guns, however, means audience members craving the usual sweeping shots of the over-sized beast demolishing cultural landmarks and venting frustrations on sky-scraping highrises will be ever-so-slightly frustrated, wishing our camera-pointing heroes could perhaps adopt a brisk and steadied trot in lieu of their customarily haphazard hell-bolt. Of course, the frenzied slant obviously works wonders dramatically, and Reeves and scripter Drew Goddard even manage to find a use or two for the camera along the way beyond the obvious documentation tack to stave off any 'Why don't they just drop the damn thing and leg it?' critiques, the most noteworthy of which is a genuinely frightening giant parasite attack which plays out entirely in night vision. It's sequences like this which help reel us in, furthering the suspension of disbelief exponentially.Of course, the harrumphing nitpickers will find much here to bemoan, from the lack of any discernible story and threadbare attempts at character development, to the questionable decisions made by said characters borne of a fundamental necessity to keep us close to the action, a problem inherent to the 'found footage' setup from the outset.But hell, frownmongers be damned, for to focus on the minutiae is to deny yourself the thrill of an indisputably exciting exercise in escapist cinema. Cloverfield is a new take on the giant monster movie, nothing more, nothing less, and a terrifically entertaining action movie experience is there to be had for those open to it.With its good-looking young cast and intrepid director all working overtime to ensure not a second of its economical runtime is wasted, the outstanding Cloverfield is a searing, white-knuckle monster flick from which fans of the genre will reap greatest rewards. Superior special effects and a city-trashing creature worthy of the anticipation push this over the line as a cracking, inventive example of a film that actually lives up to the hype.",Cloverfield
798,prettymuse789,An Amazing Interactive Experience,7,19 January 2008,"The scariest part about Cloverfield is not its monster, but its realism. Casting a bunch of unknowns to be witnesses of the monster's wrath was a brilliant idea; both that and the camera footage added to the movie's believability. I've heard some reviewers criticize the ""acting"". I think they're missing the point. This movie isn't about that, and making millions of people believe a terror is raging Manhattan through dialogue does take some sort of skill.If you're reading the review you know the story: a bunch of twenty-somethings are holding a party to see their pal off on his new job in Japan when something straight out of Japanese cinema rudely interrupts their celebration. The scenes before the monster do feel a little forced; the screenwriter's desperation to make his characters more authentic shows in the first twenty minutes of screen time. The actors do their best with the direction and script, but the party almost feels like the homework you need to finish but rush through so you can go watch television.Yet the first few minutes are pivotal. While slightly one-dimensional (Rob is stubborn, Hud is the comedian, etc.), the interaction of the characters does set the entire movie in motion. Listen to all the conversations closely and you'll be even more impacted by the movie's ending.And a few booms, crashes, and explosions later, our twenty-somethings are scrambling through the streets of New York, trying to find a way out of the perilous wasteland our monster has created. Most likely you'll be frustrated by the characters' inability to have common sense in an emergency--the most cliché part about the film.However, the cinematic experience entirely compensates for the stupidity of the characters. You will the notice the difference between a true Hollywood film and JJ Abrams' creations. Something...gets you about seeing CGI characters on homemade, crappy quality, REALISTIC footage. The moving camera did make some people nauseous, but for me the cameraman should have been nominated for an Oscar since it added to the chaos quite well. By the third BOOM I was in almost as much confusion and panic as the people on screen--and I liked it.The movie's gritty reality--in contrast to its overblown, often ostentatious genre--was what captivated me. Cloverfield was made on a budget of 25 million, and I was 10000 times more into it than I Am Legend. Making anyone satisfied is the least of Abrams' priorities; all the horror film and monster movie clichés--INCLUDING THE MONSTER--crash and burn like the decapitated Statue of Liberty. Horror and thriller cinema needed a shock to the system, and this is it.The ending is expectedly unexpected, but appropriate. It doesn't matter what it would have been because the audience would have applauded anyway.P.S. Stay after the credits.",Cloverfield
799,njnya,"Not bad, but a bit overrated...",6,29 June 2013,"Cloverfield is a found footage film about a monster attack on the city of New York. While it's not a bad film, it's a bit overrated for a couple of reasons, but is okay overall.The first 30 or 40 minutes or so are good, but after that it starts to get old (with a few exceptions). It ultimately turns into people running around the city with a lot of shaky camera. On the other hand, the FX are good and there are a couple of surprises here and there. It's really not all that scary in my opinion, but others may think differently. it's an overall well made film, just not the best.

Wait ... what was I saying? Oh yeah, there's this thing that runs rampant on Manhattan. No one knows what the hell it is, it's just there. In the meantime all of the monster crap interrupts a very special episode of Dawson's Creek, you know, the one where Dawson's going to leave for Japan and he finds out at the party that Joey's been sleeping around on him? Alright, now picture that, filmed with your dad's handycam in the middle of a Godzilla movie. It's a big sh!te sandwich coupled on either side by two slices of moldy bread. That's how fresh and satisfying of a movie this is.But hey, on the bright side, everyone died and that made me smile.It's a big-budget C-movie, and while that may sound like something entertaining to fans of shlock films, trust me when I tell you that it's not. Give me Godzilla vs. Mothra any day over this steaming pile. At least those movies have heart.",Cloverfield
801,adigelunar,a little senseless,3,20 May 2013,The movie has some illogical parts that's not because it is a science fiction but because it wasn't close to real life. For example in the movie a girl gets hurt from her chest by a stick and she can move without moaning- if we don't count the first time she was injured. What is the worst about the movie is that the shakes of the camera. It moved so much that I could not focused on the movie. What I liked about the movie is that one can not easily predict from where the monsters came. If it weren't my teacher I would still do not know that . By the way the sound effects and make up were great. Especially the appearance of the wound wounds look like real.,Cloverfield
802,littlejimmy835,"A fantastic, shockingly authentic depiction of a monster attack.",8,16 January 2008,"Most giant monster movies you see are horrible. They are laughably unrealistic, poorly directed, unexciting, cliché, not frightening, and incredibly cheesy.Cloverfield is not one of them.Instead Cloverfield treats us to a fantastically thrilling adventure, which depicts a horrifyingly realistic situation, shot in the most believable and frightening manner, with breath taking visuals and is genuinely suspenseful.The film is shot entirely from the point of view of a small group of civilians via the use of hand held camcorders. Unlike movies such as ""The Blair Witch Project"", the film is well photographed not relying on overly erratic and nauseating shaky camera movements, but rather has a much more pragmatic style, which allows the movie to both look like it was really shot by camcorder during a monster attack, but at the same time not leaving the audience grasping for straws as to what is going on, or worse feeling motion sick.Better still, the events that unfold during the movie are entirely plausible. Not once during the movie are you left thinking, ""Oh come on as if that would happen"". No, instead the movie is encased with realism, from the military weapons, tactics and formations during battles with the monster, to how buildings collapse when struck by the monster, to the choices that the characters make when presented with unimaginable circumstances, to even the reactions that characters have when their comrades are injured or killed. The movie even goes as far as to make extensive use of symbolism of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, such as when a building collapses sending dust and debris rocketing down the street while the characters run inside stores for shelter, to emerge covered with dust.The plot is immensely character driven. The movie isn't as much about the monster attack, as it is about our main characters trying to deal with this situation. This movie does not dive into the cliché of having the movie be about the military commanders and scientists coming up with theories trying to defeat the monster, but is rather about the problems and turmoils that our lead characters have to go through during this situation. The movie though staring a cast of ""unknowns"", is wonderfully acted, with all of the cast giving superb performances. When somebodies friend dies in this movie, they mourn and cry over their fallen companion, and when something attacks, they appear genuinely frightened.Do not let the fact that this is a giant monster movie turn you off. Forget that you ever saw a travesty like a Godzilla (1998) or King Kong (1976), and prepare to be blown away by the extraordinary movie that is Cloverfield.",Cloverfield
803,hbk_nwo33,Great monster movie that focuses more on the characters than the monster,10,27 August 2013,"Cloverfield exceeds as both a monster flick and a horror movie. It does so by being old-school in its approach and showing restraint. The film is all about the characters placed in this situation, not getting carried away with plot or set pieces or making the film about the monster itself. Atmosphere is more important to establishing the horror for the characters, with them not feeling safe at any time after the party.A good horror film knows that less is more, and that is a philosophy that Cloverfield nails. You rarely see the monsters face (only three times) and only see it in its entirety once. Instead you get glimpses that allow you imagination to fill in the gaps.The film's atmosphere is also to its credit, with the constant feeling of insecurity even though our characters don't face direct danger all that frequently, they never once feel safe. The anticipation of something horrific happening is much more powerful than the actual act itself, something that many modern horrors could do with taking into account. This is achieved, in part, by the hand-held camera effect, but it also a credit to the writing of Drew Goddard and direction of Matt Reeves. There is no fear of placing the characters, and the viewers, in complete darkness and situations that are barely lit and when you cannot see what's happening you naturally assume the worst in a situation like this. The amateurish camera work (with bad shifting focus, weird angles and close-ups, even sometimes missing the action) all immerse the viewer in the story of the characters within the invasion rather than just being a plot film centred around the invasion itself with characters secondary.The performances are all good, particularly from Jessica Lucas and Lizzy Caplan, with every character progressing in some way over the course of the feature.Rob's character progression relies solely on his relationship with Beth, initially reluctant to go after her at the party but after the accident he dedicates his life to save her. The love story between the two is sincere and endearing, you really believe that Rob would risk his life on the slightest chance that she is still alive. The abrupt cuts to their Coney Island trip (that is being recorded over) help their story, but the true heart of the work is done by Rob during the opening party sequence.Perhaps the biggest character change throughout falls squarely at the feet of our designated cameraman: Hud. He is annoying to the point of almost being unbearable during first third of the film, with his endless stupidity and questioning, but as time goes on he becomes much more likable. His dedication to capture both the party and the 'Cloverfield incident' on camera is admirable, doing it simply because ""people will want to see this.""A detail that is unlikely to be picked up by most people, but is still fantastic nonetheless, is that the film is the exact length of a DV Tape (the type of film the characters are filming on) to show a true dedication to the lost-footage genre. The opening governmental graphics were also very effective in giving the film a genuine feel of legitimacy (as well as providing LOST fans a little Easter egg).",Cloverfield
804,darksketcher,Disappointing,1,9 September 2020,"So I finally watched this movie 12 years after it came out and I was very disappointed. Flashback to 2008 when I first saw the trailer it was appealing. Growing up watching Godzilla that's what I got from the trailer. When it came out I heard nothing but bad reviews and every time I saw the logo ""Bad Robot"" I thought it was a guaranteed bad movie. Now that I setup the back story let's get into the review. The Negatives: Never a fan of shooting a movie through the perspective of somebody video taping everything. It takes away the element of seeing the characters develop and it's too much to process while the story develops. Also no one yells at the person video taping while they are being chased by monsters, jumping off buildings and dealing with the death of their friends. There was only one legitimate scene where the video taping view made sense during the climax of the movie; when they had to use night vision mode to see in the dark. Cheesy high-school drama romance. Yes, they are well beyond college but they act like high schoolers straight out of prom. When the two main characters who are supposedly in love but the scene makes it sound like it was more like a one night stand get separated, the man decides to run across NYC to save her although she could be dead. Yes, it's a movie but seriously, how many couples are willing to race to their lover's rescue knowing that there is a high chance they're dead and going after them could get themselves killed along the way. Missing dialog. Too many unanswered questions in this movie. A girl is not feeling well, a nurse screams ""bite, bite, bite"", rushes the girl behind a screen only for the audience to see her spontaneously combust and no one asks why she combust, no one explains how they came to that conclusion or anything. I know it was a short period of time between the party and the attack and there couldn't be any scientist to deduce something in a short period of time but a normal human reaction would be to ask what happen and/or to explain what happened. No one was camera shy. In the moment of awkwardness or bad timing, no one said ""what are you doing, we don't have time for this or etc."". Near the end of the movie, it's evident that the man and woman are going to die and he is recording his last words. At least he was kind enough to ask the woman if she had anything to say on the video recorder. Seriously?! You're about to die and someone tells you ""do you have any last words you want to record"" what do you say? Acting was horrible and very unbelievable. Military just allowed everyone to do what they wanted.Positives: I enjoyed the mystery behind the creature until they revealed it in full. In the beginning you didn't know what it was. You knew it was massive, that it ripped the Statue of Liberty's head off, and that it had a tail or tentacles. The fear of being hunted by a unknown enemy adds suspense. But once they reveal the creature you're like ""OK, not as scary or big as I thought"" Want a comparison? Ok, here's one: Imagine you're seeing a tail of a T-rex, claw and teeth marks, a shadow of it but then all of sudden Barney the Dinosaur pokes his head out. And that's that. After 12 years of not watching it and a friend saying I need to watch it because it ties to the Cloverfield movies I found it a waste of time. Also, why was this movie called Cloverfield? Took place in NYC and no where mentioned other than in the beginning the name Cloverfield.",Cloverfield
805,paneraifreak,2008 reviews vs 2018 reviews,9,6 February 2018,"I get a kick out of reading the early reviews of 2008... interesting to read the sensitivities people expressed here when comparing the movie to 9/11.
Things are different in 2018.",Cloverfield
806,RamirBorja,"Watch it just to see New York getting trashed, again.",6,6 February 2008,"A 'Godzilla' movie for the YouTube generation. A giant building-sized monster came out of nowhere and just wrecks havoc in New York City. The thing that makes this movie different is that the entire film is captured with a hand-held camcorder by a bystander. Couple that with the excellent special effects and the movie has that gritty and yet out of this world realism.Conventional narrative, this movie is not. I heard a lot of disappointed groans from the audience at the end of the movie. Just treat the movie as a documentary and that this film was just extracted from the rubble during the aftermath of the monster's attack. This gimmick has been done before in The Blair Witch Project. These two movies really share a lot of similarities by the way.The movie production tried very hard to give it that amateurish film-making look at the expense of the viewer's comfort. The cam is so shaky I heard stories people throwing up while watching the film, so beware. It didn't bother me but my only beef is that the lighting is so dark. A lot of times I can't figure out what the hell is going on or even the entire look of the monster. I guess it's the intent to show as little as possible to make it more ambiguous, and hence scary.A very good monster movie but the acting and story are so-so. Watch it just to see New York getting trashed, again.",Cloverfield
807,PhoebeDay,Firsthand Experience,8,25 October 2016,"The movie does an extremely good job of making you feel as though you're taking part in the movie. The creatures are a good mix of scary and interesting. JJ Abrams did a good job of creating a story that not only offered the viewer a first hand experience because of the camera style, but also the chance to connect with the characters. Even though you're only shown bits of and pieces of each person and how they act - they way they respond to things really gives us, the audience, a good view of who they are. The cinematography itself is intense, but interesting - some may find it hard on the eyes, but it does offer the viewer a unique firsthand experience of a monster attack and I highly recommend it.",Cloverfield
808,xanitra,"Hold the camera steady, please",3,19 March 2008,"This is the sort of movie where I really don't understand why it was so important to take the Blair Witch Project approach to filming. I mean, sure it is a cool effect. But it was cooler in Blair witch. Cloverfield, despite the clever name is nothing more than another take on Godzilla. I wasn't disappointed, no. But I wasn't exactly thrilled either. This is one of those movies where you come out of the cinema and say to yourself ""ok...."" and forget the whole thing a short time later. I know you others who probably went to this page on IMDb, probably think this movie is top of the barrel, and can't believe that an actual person in real life would bother to review the movie if this somebody didn't think it was that hot. But anyway, there you have it, my five bucks, or five minutes anyway.",Cloverfield
809,xtcklubber,Dejavu feeling,4,19 January 2008,"The movie basically is just a copy-paste of Godzilla. The little monsters seem very Starship troopers familiar. Where is the imagination, and the creative part in creating a movie/script ?They went in for too much with the hand-held camera effects, which screws up your eyes. No real plot except for the so called love story - which is not something out of the ordinary these days. They were friends. They realize it was love not friendship. Crisis situation, and he runs to save it, ya right ^__________________^ As a matter fact, you could have a monster go throughout this movie's plot.This goes like this.Put a red sock along with white clothes in a washing machine. Turn it on. Every time you see the red sock, pretend to be scared.That's my opinion, barely feeling any fear or any emotion at all.Btw, Why the f*** do all monsters (GodzALIENS or not) pop up in NY ?",Cloverfield
810,jakedog-1,"An amazing feat in immersion, tension and excitement",10,9 June 2008,"Cloverfield is the film equivalent of a roller-coaster ride, pure thrills. The story begins with a group of twenty somethings in New York celebrating the departing of one of their kind, Rob, who has accepted a job in Japan. Hud, a layabout with feelings for another girl at the party, is given the job of documenting the night on the home video camera. It is through what Hud films, that we see everything that happens throughout the night and as the party progresses we get a good feeling for each individual character and their respective romances and qualms with one another. Then the events take a turn for the worse when the city is rocked by ominous rumblings and subsequent power outages. Suddenly the city is under attack by 'something' and the friends find themselves running for their lives from a gigantic creature (and various smaller ones)that are wreaking havoc.Cloverfield is an exercise in 'what if' and as this, it works incredibly well. The Handy cam style creates level of immersion i have never felt with another film. The style results in the building of tension and fear, through the fleeting glimpses we see of the monster, a leg and a tail glimpsed only for a second are much more frightening than seeing the monster in all it's CGI glory (which, inevitably, we do.) From the get go Cloverfield grabs you're attention and doesn't let go until the credits roll (though you wish they didn't have to.) Handy Cam style may have it's enemies but here it has never worked better, creating untold levels of realism. A a creative, original feast for the eyes and nerves, this film will leave you buzzing and hungry for more, just DON'T watch it on a small television!!!",Cloverfield

812,eliz7212-1,The Worst Film I have ever seen (Possible Spoiler),1,21 January 2008,"I have just viewed this MASTERPIECE!!! And believe me, I am being sarcastic. When you pay $10 or more to view a movie, first of all, you do not want hand held shaky cameras. You are sitting in a movie theater, and you want a visual experience. What the hell is the matter with producers and film editors?? That they can produce such a stupid, (believe me, all the excitement is in the trailers), and non-eventful movie?? Yeah, there's a monster. How long to you see the monster?? For about one minute. And the visual of the little monsters and the big monsters, well, it's not clear. It's not like Godzilla, WHERE YOU SAW THE MONSTER!!! This movie teased us first with the trailers and promos. Then, with the promise that this would be a great film. Maybe it's a great film for teenyboppers, and little kids.But I bet the parents of those teenyboppers and little kids will just sit there and get sea-sick from all the shaky camera work.And yes, it's exactly like the Blair Witch movie.This movie opened with $41 million dollars.

814,davidguest,Could be watched Clover and over again,9,13 June 2008,"I had heard a lot of hype surrounding this film, as most will have done when it first arrived on UK shores in the cinemas. I managed to resist the temptation to go and see it however and have only recently watched it on DVD, boy do I wish I had seen it on the big screen.Personally I think this film is technically magnificent. It is a risky strategy using a first person camera style and can go horribly wrong (Blair Witch Project). But this has been carried out incredibly well. The director has managed to capture a glimpse of the true horror that these people would have been facing in this scenario. I actually like the fact that very little is explained  it feels more realistic to me, as the film is trying to place you in the shoes of one of the civilians. If you were just going about your business on a normal night in NYC and that kicked off, you wouldn't have a clue what the hell was going on, you would panic. For the same reason I think some of the seemingly flimsy dialogue can be excused. What the hell would you say if a huge monster starting tearing up a city? I think this film captures the shock and horror of a classic genre perfectly and adds a new spin to it. There are some scenes were you feel like you're running through the crowds of panicking people and your heart races.All in all, I would recommend you see this with an open mind.",Cloverfield
815,hstanage,Pretty good,7,26 May 2019,"This movie isn't as bad as a lot of the reviews say it is. The acting is good. There weren't many big names which is fine. I am torn between the decision of going to save Beth and leaving her. Rob still loves her, so I get that. But you aren't sure that she is still alive, so why not just leave the city. The visuals are excellent. I love the fact that we don't know what the creature actually is. It reminds me of some zombie movies. We don't need an explanation. Overall it is a pretty good movie.",Cloverfield
816,RebrandSoftware,Very Exciting!,8,25 January 2008,"I recommend seeing this without knowing anything *except* that it is filmed POV Camcorder style like the Blair Witch Project. I sat in the back row and was fine, so you can stop reading now before you ruin it for yourself.I thought this movie was extremely exciting, well acted, and very scary. Some of the scenes were so cleverly set up that I found myself grinning unintentionally.I think that there are allusions to 9/11 and that they are absolutely necessary: after all, we have experienced 9/11 and we know exactly what it looks like when there is a disaster. This film captured that feeling. It brought back my own memories of that morning, trying to get out of Washington D.C. under the impression that we were being bombed, panic and false information everywhere. I don't think it was exploitive.If you liked the escape scene in the most recent War of the Worlds where the aliens attack for the first time, you will love this. It's the intensity of that scene drawn out over an hour and a half.I think we need more films like this which are willing to take risks.",Cloverfield
817,kirkintha26,"A movie to ""experience""",9,19 January 2008,"Nay sayers of ""Cloverfield"" will point to the inevitable: it is herky-jerky, kind of plot less, and a tad two-dimensional with a dash of too many beautiful people.Well, opinions are like... y'know.Cloverfield takes a tired genre of disaster films and horror melange and brings it into a class that unfortunately has to be compared to ""The Blair Witch Project"" and a few other choice first person horror narratives. However, Cloverfield takes the ""less is more"" genre, from where ""Blair Witch"" left it off and truly brings it to another level. It follows with an unflinching lens (a handicam none-the-less) a group of friends, lovers and relatives in a seemingly mundane day that turns into a classic life and death struggle, and the heroic efforts of the cast as the mysterious events unfold - something (a very big something) is attacking NYC.Cloverfield is the ""B"" film spirit with an ""A"" cast/crew, and I think that's the point. It takes the cheesy ""Godzilla vs. insert whatever here"" and completely re-invents the way that it is portrayed. I did find the plot a little scattered, other than the story of a group of people on a quixotic quest - but I think that the ""crazy"" viewpoint of the videotape (it's from the viewpoint of someone watching a videotape, not just holding the camera) and people making decisions under pressure is what captivated me the most. That and the fact that you are being given just enough: in the character development, the one camera viewpoint, the special effects, the reveals - that I really wanted to ""experience"" more and more. And how many movies can you say that about? For most of the action, I felt like I was as close as I needed to be. I liked being part of it, but detached at the same time. Cloverfield is thrilling, and I don't get that from many movies anymore.This is one of those films that challenges you. It leads you along and spoon feeds you, but only because revealing everything at once would have made this a tired story line of city officials spouting BS melodramatic lines about saving the city and the token child and dog routine, everyone running away as the hero saves the day. That's just old.There are no easy scenes here, not a lot of explanation, no scoring (save for a soundtrack of organic sounds), there are no Hollywood super stars mucking it all up and I know it's not real life - but it feels as authentic as any sci-fi/horror/action movie is going to get. I think the obvious correlations to terrorism etc are contemporary for our time, and to be honest I am good with that: Real and imagined Monsters loom in the deep and can attack at any time.Cloverfield is not for streamlined movie goers - this is for people who like to feel like they can suspend their disbelief and put themselves into the other persons shoes. Somehow this movie struck a chord with me that's been missing for sometime. It's a shame that a movie like this can come along only every so often. If it did, it would feel like an overused gimmick. Thankfully it runs just long enough to not overstay its welcome.",Cloverfield
818,theghost1,GREAT MOVIE *may may you sick* BUT NOT BAD MOVIE,9,24 January 2008,I won't mention any of the details of the movie I will only say that I went and saw this movie knowing as everyone should have that went to see it that it was going to have shaky camera shots the whole way through. Alway's check out a movie before you go see it to find things like this out. It was all over the net without revealing any details that this was from the perspective of a video camera. I know my home movies shake like crazy. I HAVE VERTIGO. SO I knew going in that I was asking for trouble. first 10 minutes or so I was thinking ... oh crud I've messed up i'm gonna get soooo dizzy and then get sick.. but I stuck it out. I made it through the entire movie and you know what? out of over 100 people in the theater I saw 2 or 3 get up and leave but they came back... with POPCORN and drinks so they were not getting sick. Now will some people get sick from this? Yeah sure. Will some people get sick from rollercoasters? YEs I do and I know not to ride them because I can't do it I get sick every time.About the movie though? IT ROCKED. FRESH New Ideas and action and scares.. Sure there were some stupid things in it but hey what movie does not have from time to time? I give this movie a 9 only because It was not perfect as I have yet to see a perfect movie.As for some not all but some of the people giving bad reviews on here. One guy said he had to leave about 10 or 20 minutes into the movie because he got sick and then says the plot line sucks?? How can he say that if he did not watch it? The plot does not even really start until about 20 good minutes into the movie maybe 30. I think a lot of these people are just upset because they got sick. And I can seriously sympathize with them. If I had to have paid 9 - 12 dollars to see this movie and got sick I would be upset too... at myself for not going to matinée and paying 6 dollars when I know that I get sick sometimes with motion. That way I've only lost 6 dollars and it's my fault not the movies.Bottom line is this. I LOVED this movie. IF your able to watch things like this all the way through without getting sick then you will probably love the movie also but take the advice of other people and take some Dramamine if you get motion sickness. Not sure if that stuff makes you sleepy or not I've never taken any. But the movie is only an hour and a half long so maybe you can make it with some. It's too good of a movie to wait for DVD or VHS,Cloverfield

821,Zachman3001,Puts you in the driver's seat,8,21 January 2008,"When I first went to see Cloverfield I was skeptical about the movie. A monster attacks Manhattan and tears off the Statue of Liberty's head, seemed like a normal monster movie plot. When I went to see it, however, I was thoroughly impressed. The movie is shot as from a hand-held camera, yet another part of the movie I was originally skeptical about, which ends up working out brilliantly. Usually when you see a bunch of people running through streets you still know what is going on, but with this style of filming you are actually in the street. You can't tell what is going on any more than the characters in the film.The acting I thought was great. It seemed as if the actors were really into their roles. When Manhattan was first attacked, everyone's reaction was perfect. The fear that you could see in people's faces was very realistic.The ending I did not like at first. It seemed that it just cut off and that was it. After I thought about it though, the ending worked out really well. It fit perfectly with the style this movie was trying to achieve.The only complaints that I have about this movie are that some of it was predictable, like in the subway tunnels, and that sometimes they would leave the camera tilted one way, even if someone was still holding it. I felt that when they did this, people were focused more on trying to figure out what they were seeing rather than what was going on in the movie.Overall, this movie was really good and very entertaining. I would suggest to anyone that you see this movie in theater as that just adds to the fear that the characters go through.",Cloverfield

It was horrible, a giant lizard that takes over New York, nothing in my taste. Than 10 years later came Cloverfield and some friends talked me into too go and see this movie and boy was I surprised. What a great movie, I have never seen anything like this before.Plot: Cloverfield is presented as a series of scenes taken by a digital hand-held camera obtained by the United States Department of Defense pertaining to Case Designate ""Cloverfield"" found in US-447, an area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The footage that comprises the rest of the film is shot under the context of a personal hand-held camera used by various characters throughout the film's events.Even if the story is about a monster it deals with so many other things. It is about being young and in love, about friendship and how people can come together, how we react in different situations and it is great, it is something new in cinema.",Cloverfield
823,rustyalex2,"Cloverfield, Felt Somewhat Real",8,21 January 2008,"Cloverfield was filmed in a unique way. The style of the camera was in a document first person form where the viewers (us at the theater) are able to see the film in the perspective of a character who is holding the camera and recording the action as if the events were to be happening in real life. The story focuses on a group of people whom are trying to survive as a monster begins destroying NYC. The whole view is through one camera, the 25 million dollar budget was well done on the special FX, Sound and Graphics which made the film feel real. The plot is stunning yet makes you feel at times that there could have been more towards it. At times the camera movement swayed too fast and made you look away from the screen for a short time. A lot of people loved the climax and were confused by the ending, therefore the film didn't balance out entirely to the expectations. This movie compares to other hit movies such as Godzilla, Day after tomorrow, War of the worlds and even the Blair Witch Project. The actors deserve credit and so does the film.Many people were disappointed because they didn't understand that once the camera shuts or turns off during the film, the whole movie turns off too. This appeals at the end. If you didn't enjoy the films it compares to then maybe you should wait until it becomes available for rent. Though Altogether IMO this is a good film to check out in 08.",Cloverfield
824,madmax007,An Exceptionally Awful Piece Of Film,1,8 June 2008,"First off I didn't like this film to begin with seeing how the monster movie genre has no cinematic value to me at all. However I could be biased on this review to because while in the theater I endured one of the worst movie experiences of my life. A group of loud rambunctious teens who sat next to us where giving away parts of the movie before they were shown swearing talking out loud and not amongst themselves. Though critics and film goers alike say that the way this film is done is said to be innovative but I cant see Hollywood basing many of their films on a Blair Witch theme were the whole film is seen from a camera.This film is basically a rip-off what you get when a bunch of producers decide to mix Godzilla and the Blair Witch. The plot line is all out of place just them running around the city away from the giant beasts which there's really no logical explanation as to how they arrived here. The main characters are naive ignorant obnoxious but what are you going to get from a group of characters fresh out of college how are trying to live decent lives but this is an exceptional group of people who are unsophisticated obnoxious and indiscreet. Their idiocy eventually leads to their inevitable deaths as if it wasn't obvious that the whole film would turn to chaos and everyone would die what kind of film that has no morals no values make a wholesome movie. It doesn't this film is hyped and overrated and in the past few months this has faded into obscurity like it should. This is basically a fan film I can see many references to the producers favorite films including Alien, Blair Witch, and any monster movie crap. A fan film thats poorly edited produced and all out of place there's not even an actual plot line just the characters running around. There's no reason why you or anyone else should see this just because you like seeing this type of crap.",Cloverfield
825,fygall,A unique take on the mocumentary-esquire. Very enjoyable.,9,25 March 2008,"There have been a few movies made over the last few years that have tried (and failed) to take the title off Blair Witch for a documentary style thriller/horror etc... This one might just nab it and take the crown. Blair Witch Project was so successful because it was new, unique and bloody scary. Others that followed (The Last Broadcast, Amercian Crime, etc) have failed because they haven't given anything new to what we've already seen, apart from a different storyline and worse acting. What Cloverfield does is take this genre and mix it with big Hollywood effects, and when you watch these big expensive effects through the lens of an ordinary home cam-corder it looks bloody real. Throw in some talented unknowns to the cast and make sure the plot-line never goes without a thrill for the duration and you got yourself a winner. I literally had to come up for air when it ended. I like J.J. Abrams, he tries to give us something we haven't seen before and keeps the suspense along with the thrills. Take ""Lost"" for instance, it might get you tearing your hair out for an answer but you keep watching! Cracking movie!!",Cloverfield
826,spirit_pulse,Roller-coaster,9,10 February 2008,"See it. If you can stomach the hand held motion sickness that may afflict some people, this is well worth the admission fee. Some people have compared it to Blair Witch, which is somewhat puzzling as they aren't even in the same league. A bit like comparing a ferrari to a skoda. Just because they are both cars, or in this case movies, it does not make them in anyway alike. The plot and characters are shallow, but the choice of hand-held camera immerses us right into the action and it feels more like a roller-coaster ride than a movie. This is where the films premise works so very well. Could Abrams have pulled this off with a complex plot, deep characters, elaborate camera angles and huge set designs? Its doubtful. We only have to compare this movie to others of its kind such as Godzilla to discover that bigger is not always best. By taking it down to street level where we are given as much knowledge, vision and sound as the characters in the movie, we have a more intimate perspective on how this scenario would happen for real.The sound plays a large part and the noise during the action scenes make them all the more intense. The effects are realistic and the monster designs creative. The action scenes will have your heart thumping and you will you cling to your seat. The story is simple and provides us with a good setting for the ride/movie.We are left with many questions, and very few answers. All we end up being are passengers along for the ride in Abrams imagination. This film is not to everyones liking. The shaky cam, lack of deep characters and plot may deter some people, but its all good fun. One intense scene summed it all up for me. I won't post a spoiler, but it involves a helicopter rescue. That scene had me holding my breath for the whole sequence.Some people will complain, as the cynical public always do. They will say that they were unimpressed and behave with underwhelmed emotion when describing this movie. But much like children being asked is they found the roller-coaster scary, they will try to hide their feelings as though it is some how cooler to say they weren't, in an attempt to impress their friends. Watch it on the big screen, because it is not meant for the small screen. I for one would pay to see it again.",Cloverfield
827,truthseekers,I was excited but after watching it not any more,5,31 January 2008,"Its an average disaster movie with ""Godzilla Final Wars"" like special effects. Considering the hype, the fact that we have to suffer hand held camera-work which makes our moments of view of the creature, rather frustrating I felt after watching that I was being cheated of experience. Really the filmmakers got away with not having to do so much because of the hand held effect. If they had been making a full cinematic movie they would have perhaps screwed it up because it would have been harder to pull off and look good so I am sorry I just see this hand held stuff as a way to skimp out of good filmwork. For this reason I feel I was cheated. Also the people in the Uk didn't get a simultaneous release date when the movie was advertised as 18.1.08 and no name.. so the whole appeal became a joke when people in the UK never got to see it on that date. Thanks Hollywood for screwing the UK again and making the movie an instant pirates dream. Godzilla Final Wars wipes the floor with this movie anyday.",Cloverfield
828,mimbaxter,Not as good as the marketing. Not nice people.,6,6 February 2008,"The idea of the handy cam following a group of people through a disaster works really well. The quality of the sets and the CGI is very high and the action is believable.The story flows well enough, but there are parts where it feels like a re start of the action as they can't think what to do next. The point where they leave the Army camp for the first time being an example.The Army come out of this really well, organised, brave and with plans already in place. It's just that the numpties that have the camera don't have the self awareness to realise this.This is where the film falls down badly. I really did not like the people that I was following, they where self absorbed and without context in the chaos that was around them.",Cloverfield

The narrator (previously mentioned nerd) provides awkward, inarticulate commentary on what is going on while the watcher sees the entire cast, one by one, being killed by either the ""somethings"" or a result of the ""somethings"". Negatives include: The movie in general lacking any substance, No suspense, Inability to attach to any of the characters, I was never convinced of the reality of the situation as the psychology of the characters (reactions, motivations, behavior) wasn't believable, The previously mentioned big nerd.Highlights include: Watching one of the female characters miraculously walk around the city in high heels the entire time, Seeing the head of the statue of liberty (as the ""somethings"" had broken it off), Seeing another female character live even though she has been impaled, The two characters in the underlying love-story profess love for each other before being blown up by the US military, And my favorite, the death of previously mentioned nerd.2/10 stars because I finished the movie.

But ill get past that and stick to the plot. The first 20 minutes are a stupid beginning of somebody going to Japan, he gets a party, sex scandals and drunk people. But when the statue of liberties head falls down it picks up. It has all the usual horror movie things we've come to love- a giant man eating monster, weird spider crab creatures that make peoples stomaches explode, and underpaid actors swearing in the streets. It was definitely better than The Blair Witch Project and was slightly scary. Hopefully the sequel will be longer. This movie is a good Saturday night movie and is rental approved. Alright ill see you guys later and remember Iis Still Alive!",Cloverfield
831,malmroes,"Has a lot of potential, but does not quite make it through.",7,4 July 2008,"I had not heard that much about Cloverfield when I first saw a trailer on the internet, but it did look good. The idea of narrating a story through the lens of a camera had been seen before, but the idea of making a disaster movie this way still appealed to me, though I was not expecting much, but still hoped to get that wow effect which is very much in demand these days. The movie and the ideas behind it really had potential and succeeds at some points to capture and engage the audience because you feel like you are in the middle of the crisis. Unfortunately some issues relating to physics etc. is able to spoil the movie if one thinks very logically. The movie has for instance been criticized for lacking realistic physics relating to the cameraman. A point which can also be seen as a let down for the audience and more or less destroying the reality factor, is the quality of the video, which is quite good. This is of course to make the movie as good in quality as any other cinematic movies, but some might still think that this is a flaw and makes the movie lose a bit of its supposed atmosphere. At points the animation of the monsters look a bit misplaced and it is clear that they are animated creatures. It is hard to criticize this because the perception of the human is much harder to convince in this age of technology than ever before, so it is difficult to make animated characters that look genuine, especially the fictional ones. There is no musical score, obviously, but the sound effects are very good and when you sit in the cinema while gun bullets hiss and military tanks works it way through the streets, the sound really makes it all come to life. Again the sound is in a bit of an over quality state for a normal handy-cam, but it does not spoil the film too much. The acting part is overall okay, but not perfect. They are able to make the movie experience endurable, but again, they do not add up to the wow factor that they could have.To sum up Cloverfield is a justifiable movie and easy to watch as the story is not that complex. It also tries to show the audience the innermost urges and instincts that follow with trying to survive and it both delivers and fails at doing so. The idea of narrating the story through the lens of a camera has got some real potential, but the top of the peak has not yet been reached. It is all a matter of time before a big breakthrough is made and meanwhile one must just wait and see. See through the lens of progression.",Cloverfield
832,amba9,Too short,6,25 October 2008,"After the 15 minutes of party at the beginning it leaves about 60 minutes of movie time. I felt a little 'robbed' because it ended suddenly. In fact you hear 'Rob' said too many times by Hud.The hand-held camera effect(like it was used in '28 Weeks later') was great, it maximized the suspense. The main characters could probably could have escaped the monster and the city but Rob had a conscience. He had to find his ex-girlfriend and so headed back to her apartment. We need more of these types of movies where **SPOILER ** the good guys/pretty girls don't survive. Overall though, it didn't achieve the heights it promised at the beginning.",Cloverfield
833,salorkent,"Close, but as they say, no cigar.",6,23 April 2008,"By the end of the first season of ""Lost,"" I was hooked on the show. By the end of the second season, I'd all but given up on it. Now, I'm a casual watcher, but if I miss an episode, it really doesn't bother me (even though I know that's heresy to some.) I feel kind of the same way about Cloverfield. I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it a LOT. I bought the DVD, taking a risk. I watched it back-to-back three times. Sorry. No cigar. I almost like it, but that's because there are elements I do like about it. Those elements almost swing me over to it's side. But not quite. So what do I like? I actually liked some of the characters, particularly the female friend (I forget the character's name) who survives. She played her role with honesty and believability. I even liked Hud. He was annoying rather than funny, but that was his character. I like the fact that the creature was revealed to us in fits and starts, so that we were still left, to the very end, with a sense of dread and wonder, because we still knew so little about it. Finally, I liked the fact that the green-screen effects were done so seamlessly, that a great deal of reality was created, and that reality almost saved the movie. There were other factors that were so-so. The opening party scene was longish, though not painfully so. There were several other 'bridge' scenes that ran long. Also, I was really only surprised by an appearance of the creature only one time. But the main thing that sticks in my craw, is that J.J. did the same kind of ""explain one thing, create two mysteries to replace it"" manipulation that finally burned me out on ""Lost."" It was obvious from the get-go that he had ""sequel fever."" It was obvious that this movie was almost a throw-away to set up a franchise of sequels. Maybe not, but it sure seemed that way. Argh. The movie was technically well made, the acting was mostly adequate, the creature was indeed uniquely ugly and threatening. Still, it didn't win me over. Oh well, I think a friend will take the DVD off my hands for enough to make the cost equal to a matinée ticket. I can live with that.",Cloverfield

Each card is designated to a character. Say Rob = Ace, Hud = 2, Beth = 3, Marlena = 4, Lily = 5. Shuffle the cards face down, then let each player choose one. Finally, before starting the movie, select a timing interval for re-shuffling and re-picking the cards. Anywhere from 7-10 minutes should work nicely.RULES: Once everyone's got their cards, start the movie. Every time anyone in the film says the name your card is designated to, you drink. It's that simple. Then, when the film hits the 7-minute-mark (or whatever time interval you chose for your game), quickly re-shuffle and pick again.Sound easy? Sound boring? Trust me, it's not.

835,wolveren,Shaky Cam Hype Disaster Movie,1,23 June 2013,"I checked spoilers to warn readers of this highly marketed garbage, that is if revealing a found footage shaky cam vision all throughout is considered a spoiler. You see, I've always been out for top of the line blockbuster movies that is worth every cent. I don't see film greats such as Spielberg, De Laurentis, George Lucas, James Cameron and Roland Emmerich use found footage crap in their films, and even if they did, they used it moderately to make a point, but not throughout. Super 8 gave us a shaky cam feel but it was so blended well with the entire movie you don't even notice it or get epileptic watching the movie. Now I call that pure genius in film making. So far, we have been bombarded by found footage, shaky cam types since it's conception, and most of these types are truly garbage. Should I say more to smash the likes of these films to oblivion? Sure, I'll give you 2 more examples to ruin your appetite. Imagine the movie ""Godzilla"" (1998) or ""2012"" (2009) by one of the greatest directors of all time Roland Emmerich, shot with found footage, epileptic shaky cam! Now tell me if you will enjoy it like we all did if it weren't. Cloverfield sucks! If the director tried to emulate the greats it would have never been so bad. It's all hype. I hate to see this movie get a higher rating than a 1. For fuck's sake, we want to see a disaster movie with all the special effects and not from a stupid handy cam.

Then this kind of drama show begins with a group of Friends clones. It didn't get good until the monster touched down. Then those kids started to run. Run, chumps run! Of course, they acted just like movie characters act in monster/horror movies, not using their heads. Then again, if everyone had sense then there would be no movie. I wish for a sequel because I like the concept of Cloverfield. That monster has a lot of possibilities. He could become American's answer to Godzilla. Picture it. Godzilla vs Cloverfield. I'd buy tickets to see that. The filming the movie with a hand held camera would have been cool in parts, but it was used way too much. One thing that amazed me was how Cloverfield was shot with just 25 million. That's what I call good budgeting and good use of unknowns.

837,cuteasfunk,The best film of 2007/2008,9,4 February 2008,"Forget that the viewpoint has already been explored with Blair Witch... this film is a fantastic departure from the traditional method of film story telling.....Forget that there is very little depth to the narrative, beyond the allusion to 9/11.... the power of the delivery is incomparably more intense than a similar narrative such as the recent War of the Worlds.Forget that the actors are, as per Blair Witch, not particularly well known and that the focus of the storyline shifts interest slightly between characters .....we still become interested and concerned about the characters.As you will know this is basically a hand held camera gimmick.....but taken to a new level...for instance...... in traditional film story - telling...when the camera focuses on something.... it is ""code"" for telling you to watch...this was taken to new heights by the film Cache.....but......with this film in a number of incidents the camera shot for a variety of reasons does not always focus on the action......and as a result the audience engagement is intensified.Also unlike Blair Witch, there is a great deal of cgi going on but you only see it in passing because of the camera work....nonetheless, I am told that for a film maker to use cgi the camera must remain steady...therefore for what seems to be an amateurish presentation is actually taking professionalism in a totally different direction.Cinema audiences have become incredibly sophisticated. We do not need men to wear white hats or black hats to tell us good guys or bad guys....we do not need exposition from third parties to follow complex story lines...although oft times we are given it...this film makes you work a little to join dots...but no-one in the audience I sat with piped up with ""what's happening""......there was enough happening to make that question redundant.The ending will be disappointing for some people .....but I felt that it was exactly right for the narrative device and anything more would have appeared to be have been contrived.At times I felt I was on a fairground ride travelling with 4g of force....but here's the thing...you go to a fairground and pay £2 for 2 minutes of physical excitement....with this film...you pay your £5 entrance fee and are subjected to 80 minutes of physical excitement, mental stimulation and nerve flaying brilliance.....I am uncertain about the idea of a sequel....but I think that it is likely that the production team must already be streets ahead of the usual Hollywood thought processes and therefore we should rest easy and await with anticipation.Go see this movie...but take travel sickness pills first.",Cloverfield
838,knowinglygotebola,Alright,7,16 September 2013,"Cloverfield is definitely something new and interesting. It is a lot like Children of Men in that it completely immerses you in the world the director creates. The camcorder is an interesting lens through which to view New York City and the main characters.The characters were all realistic and varied, and the whole thing was very believable. The acting was very good, and the special effects were flawless, especially considering the format.The only complaint I have is that there is no real story, and there is no real exposition about the monster that attacks the city. The movie is immersing, and at times pretty scary, but by the time the movie ends, you will be left with no more information about the monster than you had at the beginning. Altogether, it is a good viewing experience but an inadequate film overall.",Cloverfield
839,Imforeverone,"Interesting, But Not Memorable",3,9 April 2008,"Cloverfield is unique in the sense that the entire film is supposedly filmed by the actors. This makes it interesting because it makes the film seem very real. Also, for a hand-held camera, the special effects were notable. However the cons outweigh the pros by far. The entire movie can be summed up in these words: ""Look, big, mysterious, scary monster; lets all run for our lives!"" Their is no plot, subplot, or other, the characters are as shallow as the movie's concept and the theme is tired and redundant.If anyone does wish to see it regardless, go ahead, but it is not a movie that stands out particularly. You can watch ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Spider-man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" and see the same kind of action (and scenarios) as here. The dialog was interesting, the acting even I can say I liked, but the story is empty, devoid of any true depth and very predictable.NOTE: The writer also seemed to enjoy being as exceedingly blasphemous and showered the script with enough Oh My Gods and ""Jesus Christ's"" to save a nation.In all 3 out of 10 is the most I can give for this attempt at entertainment. Even the monster is void of any depth; no details on what exactly it is where it came from. Let me stop commenting before I drop the rating down to a 2. Truthfully, the manner in which it was filmed is unique, the acting is nice, and the ""scary moments"" are intense, but ""Cloverfield"" is shallow and lacking in the entertainment sector of movie making.F.N.

This movie came out in 2008 and I just got done watching it on August 24th 2015. I remember seeing the ads for this movie, but never got to the theater & kind of forgot about it. Until I saw it on TV. It started out good. Except for the guy that was holding the camera (Hudson but they called him Hud). He wasn't very likable. And he ended up surviving almost the entire movie. It's weird because these people had the best luck and the worst luck at the same time. First, they went through A LOT & all should have probably died 5 times before they actually did. That was their good luck. Their bad luck was that they just couldn't get away from this monster. I know they headed right into the hot zone trying to save that girl (I can only remember her last name for some reason.) I know the creature was big but so is New York. I guarantee you that others got away. When they left the party and on their way to the girls apartment building, I understood that part as they were in the city. But it was driving me crazy when they were in the helicopter. For one thing, it hardly looked like they were moving at all. Then they go the same direction as the creature and fly over it! Was it REALLY that surprising when the creature hit the helicopter? They survived the crash (luck) and then Hud looks up and Shazam!! The creature just happened to be right there. (Bad Luck) I know they were hurt, but why did they stop running? These people went through hell and back, lost friends and family members, got attacked by small & large creatures, & survived a helicopter crash and they couldn't let them live?

As hard as it tries to be realistic, there's moments, for example, the lead 4 characters are heading on foot through a subway tunnel, and they are joking? given that they've experience something on a similar scale to the 911 attack, all be it with monsters, I doubt anyone one would be joking, fleeing for their lives.If the stuff in the film was happening for real, would anyone really hang onto their video camera, and focus their attention on documenting what was going on? Towards the end events take a turn for the ridiculous. The lead 3 characters (1 dropped out) want to enter their apartment. The apartment is located in a tall building which is on the brink of collapse. The top of the building is leaning over touching the building opposite.

From the camera surviving a nuke, to the cliché lines, the statue of liberty surviving being used as a bowling ball by a monster, a helicopter crashing and only the main characters surviving (of course the soldiers die and the idiots survive?), other stupid gimmicks. But most of all it was like this movie has no point. Plot is non- existent. Normal disaster movies you get a happy ending with 'humanity working together' and a feel good ride off into the sunset after enjoying some fun special effects.

There we find out that the woman Rob's in love with has brought another guy and an argument ensues. The gathering feels what is originally reported as an earthquake. The initial attack has taken place. The movie gives you hints as to what the monster looks like. The parasites are quite frightening as well. I really enjoyed the fact that I felt part of the movie at some points as I became engrossed in the story line. The only problem I had with the format was it can make you a bit nauseous if you're sensitive to motion. It's like when you watch someone's homemade videos and they move the camera too fast.

Still as good as it gets, It will make you think twice about being in a big city with monsters!",Cloverfield
847,onairbob,No stars,1,30 April 2011,"I had no idea what the film was about before I started watching it and I was so bored by the inane beginning, I got up and walked out after ten wasted minutes. Why on earth do we have to wade through bits and pieces of somebody's life and then go to some completely uninteresting party for some character who never shows up? We are treated to incredibly bad amateur photography featuring every bad angle made by people who apparently never saw a camera before. There was zero plot development until sometime after the time I got fed up with the movie. Next time, at least tease me about something that might happen at the beginning. That junk about the video being top secret hooked me for the first minute, but after that, all I wanted to do was run out.",Cloverfield
848,lukas8,The ugly love child of the blair witch and godzilla,3,22 January 2008,"This movie may be remotely enjoyable as long as you can turn your brain off. Unfortunately, I couldn't.The characters were so unbelievably bad, and the worst was definitely the camera man. He was somewhere between quagmire (without the funny) and dude, where's my car. The writer couldn't have made the characters any more linear and cliché.The story is exactly what you expect. Even if you haven't seen the movie but have seen the trailer, imagine what it is going to be like and how it is going to end, and you are probably pretty close. For a movie that is supposed to be mysterious, there are no real surprises here, and nothing terribly original.The first person amateur video gimmick is so tastelessly done. The most annoying part is they feel the need to explain everything that is going on. I am pretty sure they are counting on an audience with a low IQ. Blair Witch broke some ground with this technique, and director Matt Reeves must have decided that they got it right the first time and there was no need to build on it. There are so many similarities that you can pretty much count on hating it if you didn't like The Blair Witch.Finally, the movie is completely unrealistic. I am not talking about the monsters, I am talking about very simple details that it is not easy to ignore. For example, the beginning clearly states that it is on an SD card, yet the movie keeps cutting back and forth over footage that was supposedly filmed over. Also, apparently helicopter crashes are a lot safer than most people would guess.Like I said before, the movie might work if you can simultaneously block all of these things. The rating it got here on IMDb absolutely boggles my mind. I can only assume an 8/10 is the new 5/10.",Cloverfield

The adrenaline rushes from this movie stays with you for about an hour afterwords. This movie is shown as a video tape, nothing more and nothing is explained, however JJ Abrahams has done a wonderful job. He has succeeded where few have gone as monsters come. He has shown the monster's features, what it can do, and how it does it, but still contained the fear factor within the monster. This is a wondrous movie, definitely worth seeing, renting afterwords, and also buying to watch again and again. With the greatness of this movie, and it's almost inevitable high grossing weekend- I smell a sequel!P.S. Did anyone else notice that there seemed to be two separate monsters?

Sure, people are talking about it now, but in a year, it will be totally forgotten, thank goodness.

Making scary monster movies that follow the standard formula of characters doing what they know they should not do when facing a scary monster(s), is not scary.3.

The best thing that happened was when they all died. Except for the dog. God, I loved 'Lil Scruffy. I hope he (she?) turns up in the sequels. P.S. Note to J.J.

856,dfmapalo4,"Two words, Motion Sickness",5,27 April 2008,"First of all, the taping was horrible. I know that taping with an actual video camera (Used for home videos) was supposed to create a documentary effect but seriously I felt like I was gonna puke the entire time.Second of all, we've all seen The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla. Cloverfeild was like both those movies and I Am Legend mixed together. Plus, this movie had a bunch of horror movie clichés like there's a surviving group of people and each one of them dies one by one except for the main character and his lover. Or, the lover dies and the main character lives. And again, like most suspenseful movies, they left us hanging in the end with no sequel. Not explaining if someone found the video or not, what happened to the monster or where the freak that thing came from. Which made my jaw drop. To me, it was sort of a waste of time. ""What where's the ending?"" now it's left to my imagination to finish the movie off.The rest of the movie was okay I guess. Some unrealistic parts were included. Okay like the part when that Beth chick was stabbed with something sharp through the ground totally bleeding. She was left there for like two hours and is still alive. Later, she is still alive after getting pulled out of the ground with the thing through her heart, jumping out of a building and falling out of a helicopter. ""What the hell?"" that doesn't make any since. Did the director keep her in the movie just cause she'd pretty? It's an intense action movie with humor, horror and romance? WOW!!! Anyway, Cloverfeild was good until the end. It kept me on the edge of my seat.

857,Kratos666,Monsters in Manhattan? Who would've thought..?,7,2 January 2012,"""I had a good day."" I remember when I saw the teaser trailer for 'Cloverfield' at the cinema. Having Lady Liberty's head thrown to the streets of Manhattan. Wow. At the same time, advertisements of 'Cloverfield' started to take over the web. Little did they tell about the movie but I guess it worked cuz the audience found the movie.I basically knew nothing of Matt Reeves, the director, but I guess everyone knows who J.J Abrams is. The man behind 'Lost' and the amazing 'Star Trek' reboot and 'Super 8' as his latest film. All you need is one talented name in the production and the interest level goes way up.'Cloverfield's' 15-20 first minutes focuses mainly on the main characters. Character development shown thru flashbacks found on the camera recorder and the ""live"" development going on at the party and voila. There you got the assembled characters for things to come. I consider these first minutes prior to the main event important, cuz if you'd have like no interest in the persons, the film would not work at all. Some may look at this as something very dull and useless but they don't know sh*t...After the Statue of Liberty scene, the viewer is put straight to the core of the action. The viewer knows and sees just as much as the characters. Answers like ""what, why and how"" aren't answered. You have to experience them yourself. Things aren't explained at any point, not even during or after the credits. The film starts as an evidence clip found on the site ""formerly known as Manhattan"". This leaves a good ""aftertaste"" when the film has ended.The richness of 'Cloverfield' lies in its technical execution. Some may feel the shaky hand-held camera as annoying or whatever but I think that this is the stronger parts of 'Cloverfield'. This documentary like feeling works nicely and I couldn't think of any other way on how the filmmakers would have shot the film.Use of the lesser known performers is also a good thing. It makes 'Cloverfield' look more ""realistic"". I really wouldn't wanna see any of the Baldwin brothers or any other B class has-been screaming in panic on the screen. The performers do a good job but then again it's mostly just panic like fear and screams displayed on screen. But I have to mention once more that it all seems so realistic.'Cloverfield' isn't the most profound movie out there but it does have some fine, intensive and exciting scenes. It does have some illogical things here and there but as a 80 minute thrillride it works perfectly.",Cloverfield
858,rob55-2,Another movie that doesn't deserve the rating it has.,4,25 January 2008,"I read many of the user comments before deciding to chime in myself instead of just rating the movie. For starters, I want to clarify something. Many comments criticize the seemingly endless battery life of the camcorder. Having done a fair amount of videography (both for personal use and professionally), I can tell you that getting 73 minutes out of a camcorder battery (particularly a high capacity battery) is not a stretch. Comments have mentioned the ""7 hour"" battery life of the camcorder but failed to consider the actual amount of footage shot (again, 73 minutes worth). It's not like the camera ran continuously for 7 or so hours and then someone ran home, edited it down in Final Cut and then returned to Central Park to die in a nuclear explosion. One of my pro-sumer cameras can easily do 90 minutes with a single, fully charged, high capacity battery. And, with the appropriate length, all the footage can fit on one tape. If anything, the only stretch is how durable the camera seems to be (but again, not impossible). With all that aside, here's my review.Whoever said this wasn't done before obviously hasn't seen or heard of the Blair Witch Project. It's the same basic concept except the shooter here wasn't shooting a student film. Oh, by the way, another user also commented about how BWP bombed. Well, $140,530,000 is not too shabby for a movie that cost extremely little to make. Anyway, getting back to the subject, Cloverfield manages to pull off the whole ""handheld cam"" thing better than Blair Witch did. It's unfortunate, however, because the shaky camera actually obscures some of the nice CGI work. The opening 15-20 minutes was another big waste. It seemed like they only came up with 60 pages of script (if you can call this movie scripted) and needed to fill in some time to actually try to get close to being feature length. It reminded me of the opening of Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" with the drawn out conversation between the characters in the car in the beginning of the movie. Once the story gets moving, things improved somewhat. As others have mentioned, it was reminiscent of some of the 9/11 footage we saw with people running from the towers and the dust cloud when they came down. That, to me, helped build up some tension. There are some inconsistencies, not the least of which are the subway attack on our 4 characters by the smaller creatures where only one person gets bitten or infected. The rescued girlfriend's amazing recovery to the point of being able to run almost on her own is another example and the whole surviving the helicopter crash virtually unscathed comes immediately to mind as well. It's not like I wasn't expecting to suspend reality (this is a monster movie after all), but let's not push the envelope. The acting was generally what I expected from a bunch of people acting like they are in a critical, life-or-death struggle. No big-name actors made the whole ""these are everyday ordinary people"" situation more believable. Ultimately, some background details, perhaps from the military perspective, would have been nice. Even some after-the-fact details to explain what happened to the creature after the nuclear blast. Did it move on to New Jersey or head out to the Hamptons for some R&R after laying waste to NYC.All said, this movie will not last very long at the box office once word of mouth gets around as to how disappointing it is. Most will not have a good time with the shaky-cam footage and will be upset about the short run time as well. I wouldn't go so far as to say the movie was terrible or awful, but in my opinion, it falls way short of living up to the hype. I think a second viewing at home once the DVD comes out will be in order to see if the film is more tolerable on the small screen.",Cloverfield
859,HUEfilms,Good movie..but the film type takes away from the story,10,19 January 2008,"I went to see Cloverfield the day it came out. Just like ""I am Legend"", its trailers were shown all over TV and the internet. It was almost impossible not to see it. I go with my friends and we get in the movie. The beginning begins with the characters getting ready for a man's going-away- party (it was hard to remember their names, as it was very fast paced). Well, this thing attacks and they're stuck in the middle of it. So this thing just starts coming at everything and destroys New York. Then, it starts dropping these little monster things and they start attacking people. They attack one of the group's friends and she eventually has to be killed...but why???? It doesn't explain anything...i mean nothing. It doesn't say why, it doesn't say how....nothing. So if you've been reading this than you're probably thinking ""wow this movie must suck"". Not quite, i liked it...except for that it didn't explain anything. The story was great, and I liked the Blair- Witch type filmography. But with doing it like that, they have to drop elements of the story. If you did not like how the Blair Witch was filmed, then you probably will not like Cloverfield.",Cloverfield
860,johnmovies-3,phewwww,4,12 April 2008,"My first impression was a high-budget ""Blair Witch"" type movie. It was shot entirely with a hand-held camera.I found it incredibly dull on first viewing. I then read many reviews which raved about it so I decided to pay more attention on a second viewing.The first few seconds tell us that this movie was recovered by the government in Central Park. We then go into 18 minutes of bad photography and inane dialog at a Manhattan party. At about 19 minutes there is an explosion and people start running around. The hand-held keeps on running. The rest of the movie is basically panic, people running around, screaming, more inane dialog (much of which is hard to understand because of ambient noises,) Monster movie? NOT. It might as well be an attack by a foreign power or a bunch of crazies.Is this a realistic depiction of what it might be like in Manahattan during an attack? Yes. Does that make it a good movie? No.A good movie requires a blending of many elements - Screen writing, acting, directing, cinematography. A good script should have a few basic elements such as meaningful dialog, plot, character development. This movie falls way short on all these factors.If you liked the art films of the 60's you might like this. Otherwise don't waste your time",Cloverfield
861,titolee06,Don't Waste Your Money,4,29 January 2008,"So, it was a Friday night after my band practice and all of the parties hadn't begun yet, what a better time killer than going to a movie? That's what I thought, but I was expecting to be entertained. I had heard some great and awful reviews, but was expecting this movie to be great....boy was I wrong.At the very first scene, I was ready to leave. THE SHOT WAS SO HORRIFICALL Shaky THAT I ALMOST THREW UP!!! I have a SLIGHT motion sickness problem, but that was over the top. There was no steady camera work except when they set the camera down, and even when they did that, it was tilted!! I was so irritated at the poor job done on this film. Imagine your hatred for Epic and Date Movie, yeah, those were horrible, that's how I felt about this movie.In my opinion, it was way to hyped up because of how original it was set to be. Every movie now a days, has that stupid shaky camera work and they just can't keep it steady, if there had been some steady camera work, I would have enjoyed it so much more than I did. I got the fact that the producers wanted you to feel as confused as the characters, but dear god, they did a horrible job at it. If they would have shown the monster a little bit more, or even AT ALL, and cleaned up the dumb dialog, then I would have responded a lot better than this.The only reason that I am giving this a 4 is because I really like the idea that they wanted to film this in a different perspective but they just didn't do a good job or succeed at doing it. Bad job producers, the camera work totally ruined the awesome potential that this movie could have had if you guys would have used multiple cameras and given us the multiple perspectives that we NEED to enjoy a film and not had the camera mainly focused on the ground when running, moving in a thousand different directions, zooming in and out and focusing unnecessarily, then I would have really liked this movie.

It just ended. Everybody in the storyline dies. (except for that one girl that took the first helicopter at the end).The movie did have a few funny parts, and a few scary parts, but having the whole thing through the viewpoint of a video camera ruined it overall.

I'm sure my rating would have been higher if they had just made it as a normally filmed movie. It would have worked just as well.. As I have written in the title, I watched this movie hungover in the cinemas and I had to throw up halfway through it which, if it hadn't been filmed through a camcorder, then I'm sure I would have sat through all of it with no problems.

864,milofromtheblock,Godzilla for the Youtube generation,9,22 February 2008,"At one point in this film a single shot tells us all we need to know about what its all about. As the decapitated head of the statue of liberty lies in a street we see someone calmly walk up and take a photo on their mobile phone. Ignore the monster, the characters and the fake mystery of its promotion, this is a film about the hand-held video camera and the mobile phone video. If there is such a thing as the youtube generation this is their film.The prevalence of hand-held video and photographic technology has made the grainy, and out of focus mobile phone video a part of our daily lives. Its also allowed news organisations to replace eyewitness accounts by shaken and upset individuals with videos of the actual events themselves without losing the human element of their story. In this way the film recalls the amateur videos and photos that appeared in the days after both the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington and the 7/7 attacks in London. This is not done in an allegorical manner but merely in a visual recall of how all major events will now be recorded.The film begins with a going away party which serves a dual purpose, in introduces the characters briefly and also serves to ground the film in a reality. This is not an alternate version of New York when monsters attack on a regular basis, this is the plain old ordinary New York you've seen a thousand times before and these are ordinary people with their ordinary lives, no heroes here. This segment lasts long enough to make the initial arrival of the monster genuinely surprising whilst being kept short enough to get dull. Its at this point that the use of generally unknown actors really comes to the fore. You honestly believe that any of the people at the party could be the stars of the film and not only that but they can die or be separated from the group at any time. A point only emphasised further as the film progresses.The film sets its stall out for the rest of the running time as the cast cower in fear in a convenience store as the monster apparently walks past, shaking the ground and blowing out windows. We know what role we are to play in this story, the cannon fodder. This is the disaster movie re-imagined from the perspective of those in danger, on the ground, and in need of rescue. The characters spend the film looking after themselves and hoping that someone else can solve crisis whilst they're still alive. Focussing on these people allows the film to stay clear of clunky exposition and fake science. We don't know where it came from and we don't care we just want to survive it.All the while the director Matt Reeves assaults our senses with a perfectly paced series of breathless action sequences and momentary rests where our characters recuperate and count the cost the ordeal is having on them and their city. As with any good action film its the rest moments that define how attached we are to the characters and there is one genuinely heart breaking scene in a subway station that shows just how connected you have become without realising it.The action sequences combine tension and action brilliantly and all showcase different aspects of the monsters' abilities well to keep the threat evolving and consistently scary. This also helps prevent the scream-and-wave-the-camera-around style of action sequence become to prevalent as would normally be a threat with a film shot in this manner. In all the only weak point in the action sequences is one supposedly roof top scene that looks far too much like a sound stage. Apart from that the feel of authenticity is kept ever present throughout these sequences.Special mention has to made of how the film balances the need for believable hand held camera work with the need for proper cinematography. The film could easily have fallen into the same pitfall as other hand-held camera films, such as The Blair Witch Project, where shots can lack composition and framing to such an extent as to negate the film as a visual experience.The film has generally been criticised for the almost traditional monster and disaster movie failings of a lack of plot and poor characterisation. While it is to an extent true that the film lacks a coherent plot and characterisation its also true that it benefits from its lack of both. The plot makes the audience feel as the characters do that we are being thrown around New York by forces far beyond our control and that we are constantly waiting for the next intervention from either the monster or the military to throw us off course again. Also the characters act believably in the sense that when a disaster of this scale occurs all people become pretty much equal, no one wants to be seen as a coward, every one wants to make sure those they care about are safe and no one wants to be alone. These are all the motivating factors the band of characters we follow are likely to have in such moments of extreme stress.This is a massively entertaining, thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride that seeps innovation and free thinking from its every pore. One of those rare cinema event movies that make you feel you're a part of the film and a part of its events without ever forgetting to entertain. Cloverfield is a film I genuinely wanted to dislike due to the manner of its promotion and my dislike for monster films generally but it is an undeniable piece of cinematic brilliance and the first film I've seen in some time that feels genuinely new.",Cloverfield

868,differentbutsimple,A Test-Drive Comparison of Film-Making Gimmicks,6,6 July 2008,"It has been noted that the one thing people are really interested in is people. The whole history of culture and art stands in testament to this fact. So it beggars belief why anyone would decide that the one perspective we have really been missing all this time is a bullet's. Watching a film from a bullet's perspective is like viewing the first world war from the perspective of the ground where Archduke Ferdinand was shot. Sure it has a necessary role to play and even a small share of the action, but it's completely beside the point.It is therefore somewhat refreshing to see a new perspective come this time not in the form of a munition but a video-camera. OK, a video-camera doesn't whiz round the screen or allow you to bend time in an ever so nifty way, but it does do one incredible thing. It forces you to make a film about people. This mainly boils down to the fact that a video-camera is limited to being picked up by one person and recording another from roughly the direction of the first. The result, a film with not one slick bullet-tracking shot to be seen; which we can agree is a good thing.Which is why I find myself drawn to the inescapable conclusion that Cloverfield is like a hydrogen airship; it is a really neat idea that is unfortunately also a total disaster. As it turns out, when it was noted that ""the one thing that people are really interested in is people"", what was meant was ""the one thing people are interested in is people more interesting than themselves"", and it is in this respect that Cloverfield fails with gusto.This is because Cloverfield coats itself in the banality of an authentic home-movie like a seal coats itself in the Arctic Ocean. It immerses itself in it, rolls in it and playfully flaps a flipper just to see what will happen. For the first half-an-hour of the film very little does happen. Where it's not happening is New York, in a party - which is like one of those New York parties you've heard about filled with exciting intelligent people who have interesting, insightful things to say, except that it's not. It's a party filled with people who don't have anything interesting to say at all.So when the party is interrupted by a multi-storey alien who insists on eating the guests it's a welcome change. This is a feeling that will no doubt be familiar to anyone who has been to a party in New York. And with this the focus changes to the toing and froing of the party's survivors pursued by the hungry, hungry aliens. At least I assume they're being pursued because the aliens are hungry; quite what they are up to remains somewhat of a mystery.And so it ends, and I find myself thinking again about bullets and how perhaps they're not so bad after all, and I find myself wishing that film-makers would just exert some self control, and thinking wouldn't it be nice if for once they thought not ""can I do it?"" but ""should I do it?""",Cloverfield
869,jack_woods,Brilliant.,8,30 April 2013,"When the first indescribably spontaneous trailer for 'Cloverfield' previewed, Abrams and co. effectively threw the absorbent mystery net over the viewers. Releasing the brilliantly teasing two minute trailer of a ravaged national sculpture being tossed through NYC and supporting text other than 'Produced by J.J Abrams' - no movie title. Terrorist movie? Monster movie? Disaster movie? What we acquired about J.J's style from 'Lost' was that there were no limitations. This movie was spectacularly marketed. The opening character meet and greet serves a comfortable introduction to the characters who endure the mystery J.J has in store for them. Deciding on a slightly less recognisable cast really allowed the interest in the characters to flourish, with no John Mcclane's or James Bond's to assure us they'll get the girl and save the world. 'Cloverfield' is boldly portrayed, tensely gripping and since its release in 2008 has been a monster movie unrivaled (arguably until Abrams returned with 'Super 8' in 2011).8/10.",Cloverfield
870,Malteser999,One word: Breathtaking,7,6 May 2016,"Wow. I mean wow. I had really low expectations when in reality, it became one of my favorite monster movies of all time. A concept like found footage is still pretty new amongst the film industry after the insane success of The Blair Witch Project back in 1999 (picking up 3 times its budget). That's why we are still exploring with this new format of cinematography. Thus, a lot of them are utter garbage.Let's go over what makes this movie phenomenal and, especially, why does the found footage style does fit as the cinematography. The main plot of the film is basically ""Cloverfield"" attacking Manhattan alongside with the filler love/family conflict just for the sake of the runtime. Even though I absolutely didn't find anything interesting or at the very least likable with the characters, the experience that they had to go through made my heart raise to the level I barely couldn't breathe. The camera-work was genius not because it's ""new and groundbreaking"", but because we have to witness the horror the stars of the movie had to deal with, mainly the big dude holding the camcorder. Now for the ""not so great"" portions. Like I mentioned earlier, characters are just as bland as a plain yogurt you can find at your nearest grocery store, with the addition of being total unlikable d-bags. If there's a skyscraper-size creature demolishing New York, might want to hide inside the building or find an underground cellar rather than roam around the streets.But hey, it's a monster movie that suffers similar issues like Pacific Rim and Transformers. You were expecting the monsters and robots to be the icons, not the people. Yet, you left the theater without a major let down.I highly recommend this found footage movie (unless you have motion sickness) if you're into disastrous flicks. And believe me when I say it's worth on Blu-Ray.",Cloverfield
871,sonnyrainy6,An extremely enjoyable and tense affair,8,9 March 2014,"'Cloverfield' has to be one of my favourite movies ever. It's scary, clever and ever so enjoyable. The plot follows a group of party goers that have to fight for survival when a giant alien monster attacks New York. Even though sometimes I think ""haven't I heard this before?"", I was seriously pleased with my movie find. Just to warn people, this is a found footage movie, meaning that it was taken entirely from a cameras point of view, but you don't feel sick watching it, unlike some other movies. The alien itself in the movie is incredibly animated and seriously provides a sense of terror and dread throughout the movie. The whole cast deliver extremely realistic performances and I' surprised that some of them hadn't had much work since this movie was released. The script is realistic, the special effects are great, the actors are completely and utterly convincing- what can I say? In my eyes, this movie is the next 'Godzilla'.",Cloverfield
872,NovemberKin,Cloverfield a mystery still,8,4 February 2008,"I have been following some of the hype surrounding this movie since the end of last years summer, when people where questioning, right here on this board I might add, what was this monster Godzilla, Ctuhulu (or however you spell it) or even a popular belief a lion (seriously what the freak was up with that!?).It spurred a lot of interest in me because not only am I of nature a curious person but I also happen to like what J.J. Abrams has been producing and thinking along those lines I knew that we probably wouldn't get to know what this monster was or neither would any plot points be revealed (but hey as the curious person I am I tried my beast to get a teeny bit of information cause let's face it, it was a long wait).To be honest while sitting in the theater I couldn't help but to feel this story wouldn't be concluded, in the sense that we are used to. There would still be questions unanswered (We are talking about a guy producing LOST remember), but the main story will be delivered not like it's done now a days with movies like Matrix Reloded and POTC: Dead Man's Chest. We get a sense of closure.Yes, we do not get to know what the monster is, alien or submerged behemoth that clearly woke up on the wrong side of the bed. We do not know if it is defeated or not in the end. We don't even get a good glimpse of it. But watching the movie I found that it would ruin it putting in such information in, people tend to forget that this movie does not focus on the monster but a certain group of people, about loss and hope. Not giving up and staying together in a situation that can only be explained as surreal and terrifying. The threat of not knowing what's going on is a lot more unnerving then knowing what is going on. People fear what they do not know.I for one felt satisfied with this movie, it gave me everything I was promised, I do not care for it's creation but for the people running away from it. A hand held camera was exactly what this movie needed, it made the camera a person in this whole ordeal, making an objective camera we'd just get nice objective shot that esthetically may be beautiful but lack the soul, you do not need to focus on everything or what can be initially meaningless (the monster). This is what for me exactly the 98 movie Godzilla did wrong they focused more on the monster then the people.Forget the term monster film and see it for what it is, do not search the monster but the bonds that tie the characters together.",Cloverfield
873,bjlockie,whole plot relies on stupidity of one character,6,26 January 2008,"The movie leaves too much to the imagination.Like a lot of films, it relies of people doing crazy/stupid things for ""love"". I don't understand it, but there wouldn't be a movie without it.I find it very detracting when the plot totally relies on one character's stupidity.The motivation for stupidity is ""love"" but I don't think that is a good enough reason.It was entertaining though.Worth seeing on a cheap night on a big screen.",Cloverfield
874,gograyfirego,A vote I can feel good about.,9,27 January 2008,"I seriously gave this movie little chance of being more than just slash & bash craziness. And I believe that kind of pessimism made a huge difference because, when the end credits popped up, I was happy to conclude that I really liked this movie.It essentially starts with a party that seemed to go on and on but it became a great way to introduce the characters. And like comments by others, I think how the movie focused on the characters was terrific vs. focusing on the ""big bad"" while dismissing the characters as film fodder.New York has sure been the victim of some phenomenal yet destructive visual effects and this movie might just be the pinnacle. Whether it was the ""big bad"" itself or the perspective from a camcorder, this movie was visually outstanding.And the cast - Seeing Lizzy Caplan was a treat...especially after CBS dismissed 'The Class' just when it was getting great. And Jessica Lucas' time on 'CSI' has probably been child's play compared to what happens with her in this big screen thriller. The rest were terrific as well but you can see for yourself.So, it gets my vote for one of the best surprises I've had at the movies in quite some time.",Cloverfield
875,shrikrishnamay,good one,5,6 September 2018,"Watched it after watching the cloverfiled paradox so the appearance of the monster made sense , something has found us on the title also made sense , but if you are watching it without knowing the other one then its little unrealistic to understand from where the monster appeared

877,dr_brendan,"Fun for a while, then you might get sick.",7,16 January 2008,"Here's how to make the best advertising campaign ever. All you do, is just show the most exciting and disturbing parts of the film and nothing to do with characters and then put the title at the end and people are like ""SO GOING!""At least half of the people in the theater found Cloverfield hard to watch because it's all hand-held. At first I was really excited for the film and then one of my friends said ""Oh, so it's like Blair Witch Project meets The Host. (I can assure you that, that's what you're gonna get but with a little something extra) I was also really sick throughout the entire movie. However, it's probably the best survival/horror/science fiction all year but what am I really comparing it to? Hmm? First Sunday?I was worried about Cloverfield because not only did I see it for free, but it was supposed to come out in January (to film geeks, it's known as dump month.) However, rest assured that the film isn't half bad. The characters are somewhat minimal but there is actually a reason for what they are doing. Most of the stuff seems plausible kinda, and they didn't ""find a scientist"" and he didn't give the ""we don't know what it is!"" or ""Human's played god!"" speech that was found in the other horror/adventure movies of last year. When the characters die, you feel for them somewhat, but, to be honest you didn't get to know them that well. It was kinda like seeing a really cool person on the street and then 10 minuets he gets hit by a car. You're kinda sad cause that character was funny, or pretty, or kinda important. Also, you feel beaten up from all the shaky-cam if you're affected by motion sickness. So when a person dies it's like you're drunk and someone told you that a relative died. You're disappointed but you can't really control your emotions at this point so you're already crying. It's kinda like, the film beats you up, and makes you feel sorry for someone else cause you can kinda sympathize with there pain since you're experiencing something similar to a seizure.NOW FOR THE IMPORTANT PART: The monster. Cloverfield's monster is interesting and will make your mouth drop to the floor, because it's always changing. It's also surprising. You think you have a full understanding of the monster, and then you see a newscast and it totally changes everything think you thought you knew.I also like how the movie was also like a metaphor for a love. Hold on to people and never let them go kinda thing. It really made you think. And by the end if you saw it with anyone you'll kinda have a group hug at the end.Still, like I said before, the characters are minimal because the movie is only an hour and 24 min. Which is a fantastic length, because if your the one half who can't stand shaky-cam you'll be like ""oh wow, that was over soon."" and for the people who aren't affected, they'll like how it got right to the point.But, because it's so short, you might want your money back if you payed $10. So I heavily recommend a matinée . No one really feels cheated out of $6. Still, an overall fun movie to see with friends if you aren't affected by motion sickness. Also it's a great movie to see Downtown cause when you get out you'll be paranoid for like 20 min cause you don't know if a monster will get you when you're on the way to your car. Overall, I would say, worth seeing if you have a strong stomach, if you don't wait for it on DVD.",Cloverfield
878,hellhound8,"Could have been good, but...",5,30 June 2008,"Alright, I'll overlook all the minor inaccuracies. Obviously there's no way 1.5 million people can be evacuated that fast. Obviously there would have been more chaos and carnage. Obviously you can't carry a camera through all that, nor would you. BUT, it's supposed to be a fun movie, so we'll overlook all those.My problem is with the acting. It sucked. Why they chose to go with a group of models instead of legitimate actors is beyond me. I honestly can't believe anyone with an IQ over 10 would act like that. Apparently, this movie would have you believe that Manhattan consists solely of supermodels with giant hearts and superhuman strength, all of whom are immune to pain and talk in scripted comments.The actors and dialogue are scarier than the monster itself. The cameraman is more annoying than hepatitus. Could have been an amazing movie, instead it turned out slightly better than most of the garbage horror movies released.6/10 just for ingenuity",Cloverfield
879,DJRayC,It sucked. I can't believe people say it was so great,1,27 January 2008,"It had no plot. The beginning sucked cause there was no explanation of where the creature came from or why. The middle just had no sense, I mean would you really risk your life behind your friend to go save someone that you barely know? And who in their right mind would keep filming. Any normal person would have dropped the camera and run. I would really like to know what camera that guy was using because I want one. It was too shaky, at times just couldn't make out anything that was happening. All the falling down, dropping it and it still worked. And that was one awesome battery pack it had. The ending also sucked. I want my money back....",Cloverfield
880,middle_earthfan454,Good...but not what I expected,8,21 January 2008,"When I first saw the trailer, I was expecting a solid monster movie with an original but enjoyable and fair plot where the monster is eventually, destroyed, everyone celebrates, the day is saved, etc.But instead, there is limited plot, only the characters get an actual backstory. Almost nothing is revealed about the monsters origin or purpose. In fact, only glimpses of the monster are shown until a clear shot of it is seen near the end of the film.Finally, the ending (as well as the whole film) is quite dark themed and full of unknown, making it difficult to determine what happens at the end of the film.However, there are some pretty good points that I enjoyed.The shaky, realistic motion of the camera adds tension to the experience. It almost feels like your actually there. There is no music, but the sheer amount of gripping sounds(explosions, screaming, the monsters roar) was enough for me and they are pretty realistic.Finally, there is plenty of action and it is enjoyable to see the immense destruction the monster causes while fighting with the military.I enjoyed this movie for the most part and it is one of the best modern monster flicks I've seen. But all too often, I prefer a movie that is a little less gloomy and with an original ending.",Cloverfield
881,Jeen,One hell of a ride...,9,18 January 2008,"Caught the film today...and after all the months of waiting, yes, it was worth it. CLOVERFIELD stands as one of the best, most visceral, suspense-filled films I have seen. It is a solid giant monster film, clearly in the league of GODZILLA (the original), THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and most recently, THE HOST.To be more honest, it is actually a character-driven giant monster film. *Spoiler* Yes, there is a giant monster--where it came from, why it's tearing through NYC and how the hell it can be stopped is never made clear (but there is a lot of speculation made during the film). And yes, pretty much almost everyone does not survive by the end of the film. But--you do care about these characters. You do care what happens to Rob and his friends as they try to survive what is truly a terrifying experience. The monster itself is a scary beast, because you never truly get to see all of it. Also, the POV provided by the video camera adds to the suspense. This film is experienced from the characters' point of view.And while the film was funny in some spots (thanks to the character of Hud), it is a white-knuckle thrill ride. It also has some of the most realistic CG I've ever seen--I mean, the film supposedly cost only $30 million to make, but it looks like a lot more.True, it has the ""found footage"" angle of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but CLOVERFIELD is much, much better. Some may see it as a reinvention of the giant monster movie, others may see it as a shameless exploitation of 9-11 (which it is NOT). Some may just call it a piece of crap...but they're wrong.CLOVERFIELD is a taught, thrill-ride of movie, and it deserves to be the first true blockbuster of 2008. You've got to see this one.",Cloverfield
882,Vince-44,Watch this at your peril,6,3 February 2008,"Well, I went to see this full of the hope given by just about every review I head read or heard that the movie delivers something special. For me it didn't work, there was absolutely no way I could sit through 80 minutes or so of the worse camera action I have ever seen. It starts promisingly enough, but the moment the hand-held video camera that the film is shot on is passed to someone who has obviously never held one before, that did it for me. I have to admit and it's not easy for me to do, that I walked out on this movie. I have seen thousands of films and consider myself passionate about movies. I will give anything a chance but the continual movement of the camera, replicating a badly shot home movie just left me feeling sick with motion sickness. I got about 40 minutes through the movie before my stomach could take no more swaying too and fro, back and forth. I felt like my brain had been thrown about in my skull, what a shame. I was really looking forwards to this as I love a good monster movie. I have rated it 6 out of 10 as I gave it a chance.",Cloverfield
883,Hound222,Poor. So Poor.,3,22 January 2008,"I'm going to try to keep spoilers at a minimum here, but having wasted $12 this weekend to see Cloverfield (thank you Manhattan), I feel it's my duty to try and save others from the same fate.There's a reason why the early parts of the year are traditionally known as a dumping ground for studios. Because it is. A good deal of the stuff released at this time is done so because it's the furthest possible time between this year's Oscars and next year's...allowing studios plenty of time to distance themselves from bad films before the noms come out. Cloverfield is no exception to this trend. Borrowing liberally from films such as The Blair Witch Project, the recent Godzilla remake, and every horror movie you've seen where the main characters act completely illogically and are knocked off one by one, Cloverfield fails to meaningfully deliver on its goal of taking the big monster film down to the level of the individual ""ordinary"" people caught up in the wake of an attack.It fails mostly because it fails to make us care at all about the central figures and their ludicrous quest to save a girl who is most likely already dead. I'll set aside the glaring logical inaccuracies (cell phones blacked out one moment, then working the next, cell phones working underground, extreme compression of basic New York geography...there's more but...), but I can't ignore the fact that for this little experiment to work, we have to care about these people who are running around doing really stupid things. Ostensibly, the first twenty minutes of the movie sets this up, within the thin framework of a party for the male lead. But all we really learn from it is that pretty much all the guys are kind of jerks, so no help there.There's even an exact recreation of some 9/11 footage just to flavor the pot, which I found kind of offensive, and other New Yorkers might have too. I'd probably have been even more offended if the movie was any good. But it's terrible, so, there you go. Look, I wanted to like this movie. It was great promo. When I saw the trailer the first time I was really excited, as many of you probably were too. But i urge you to save your money on this one. Rent it if you must, the jerky camera-work and sub par story will be exactly the same on the small screen as the big screen.",Cloverfield

885,Midgarmerc,The First Great Monster Film of the Century,9,18 January 2008,"If you haven't heard by now Cloverfield is a film about a giant monster attacking Manhattan all seen through the perspective of a 20-something's hand-held camera. The film has been hyped for months via viral marketing, JJ Abrams fan boys, and media coverage/ monster speculation. Did it live up to the hype? The answer is OH GOD YES Cloverfield is by far the most intense monster film I have ever seen in my lifetime, after the initial 15 minutes of character introduction and whatnot the film does not go 5 minutes without a HOLY CRAP moment. Constantly driving you to the edge of your seat at every turn and it really pulls no punches, I was surprised to learn it was rated PG13. Now the film is entirely filmed in shaky cam since you cant really survive a monster attack pushing a trolley around and it just works, you may get motion sickness though so be warned. The camera itself becomes a character of the film as it IS the viewer making everything happening on-screen more and more realistic. Now the acting is amateur but thats for the best considering that the film would have made no sense if they had used big name actors/actresses, the characters are not that deep either and mostly serve as fodder, comic relief, moral guidance, panic, commentary, puzzlement, a little bit of annoyance, in other words they're people surviving a monster attack. The presentation is brilliant, the only music heard is in the party and at the ending credits and the special effects are some of the most seamless stuff you'll ever see in a film. The monster itself is actually not seen in its entirety only being viewed from different angles for the audience to piece it together as the survivors themselves are, you pretty much know as much as they do about everything going on making you actually feel like you're there. Critics compare the film to Blair Witch meets Godzilla but it is so much more than that, Cloverfield is the definitive American Monster Film, best if seen on the opening weekend just to hear the audience's reactions not to mention the presentation is far greater on the big screen, watch it again to see the things you missed or just to enjoy the ride again, admittedly the shock value will wane with multiple viewings but for what it's worth Cloverfield is an excellent piece of film and special effect engineering and is the first great monster film of the millennium. Its also downright scary at parts. 8/10",Cloverfield

I probably wouldn't have minded this movie if it hadn't been shot from the bystander's point of view. I admit, this had some excellent thrills to it, and I always love films about gigantic and destructive monsters, but it was filmed like the Blair witch project. It's almost as if they wanted to take a wonderful idea and ruin it. I felt so physically ill that I kept my eyes closed for five minutes of it so that I could control the migraine that this useless piece of crap gave me. It almost felt like the director was trying to insult the general public.Goal well met, jerk.And now they're planning a sequel.

First it's earthquakes, then it's aliens, then it's terrorists, then it's a government conspiracy, then it's terrorists again, then it's aliens. My god, when is Hollywood finally going to let the city rest? I guess the only good thing about the film is the mockumentary camera work which creates an interesting atmosphere and keeps the audience in the seats. Apart from that, well, you'll just have to face more of the same over and over again, but that's Hollywood, and apparently that's New York, too.",Cloverfield
888,twentyfour_fps,Well done considering the concept,7,5 December 2009,"I delayed watching Cloverfield because my 19-yr. old son told me it sucked. We both dread shaky-cam films, and he said Cloverfield takes the cake in nausea-inducing jitter. I finally watched the film, and was pleasantly surprised at not only the quality of the special effects, but at the producers' success in evoking a real sense of dread and horror. The Blair Witch style handy cam approach lends quite a bit of realism, and the destroyed city was portrayed to stunning effect. My guess is that all the negativity in many reviews of this film stem from the 16-24 yr. old demographic of viewers, who probably couldn't get past their emotional biases against the main characters in Cloverfield. Sure, the plot was simplistic, and the monster invincible and undefined...that's the hallmark of a truly frightening monster movie - mystery, the unknown. We fear most that which we don't understand. In summary, I think Cloverfield, even with the annoying shaky cam, manages to do something most horror films fail at - create a real sense of stark fear.",Cloverfield
889,Ender_mhx,unappealing and predictable...,4,23 January 2008,"I found this movie very boring and unappealing, but everyone is raving about how amazing this film is. I have to say I usually find IMDb quite accurate, usually I agree with ratings, but as it stands right now the movie is at an 8.1... 8.1!?!?!? This suggests it is one of the best films of all time (by IMDb standard), which I feel is absolutely untrue. By these ratings this film is better than Scarface, Kill Bill vol. 2, Snatch, Trainspotting, and Patton just to name a few. I can't help but find that absurder.Anyways, enough ranting, on to the film...The lack of a narrative really hinders the experience of this film. There is never a clear distinction about what is going on; things just randomly happen, the characters get scared, they move on. Nothing seems to have an effect, they cower for a few seconds (or feel depressed) then they are over it and moving on. Any scenes which could have been used to convey serious emotion happen so quickly you never have a chance to really feel what the characters are feeling. As well the action is so quick you never really know whats going on, and like a teenagers first time having sex its over before you know it. The shaky camera also adds to the lack of intensity, often you just see blurs or quick glimpses of the action then its over. You are often left asking ""what just happened?"" A huge problem I have is that so many things happened in such a short period of time with no explanation as to why they happened. You don't know why that one girl blows up after being bit (I disliked the characters so much I can't even remember their names lol), you don't even know if they really kill the monster in the end! I need character development, I need a plot with originality (not another lame love story), I need surprises (this movie had none, ie. in the tunnel when they turn the night vision on...you know what I'm talking about...if you didn't see that coming you shouldn't watch movies). I simply can not recommend this film, in fact I found it boring and lacking in engaging qualities. This movie is below average at best: 4/10.",Cloverfield
890,horlicksng,Good concept and nice cuttings but Simple Story and Shaky Camera,2,19 January 2008,"I was so intrigued to watch this film on screen after watching the trailer on screen. The concept was so awesome, a monster suddenly appearing in New York Manhattan and wrecking all the buildings into pieces. The feeling was like something really usual and unbelievable happened around you all of a sudden and how different people reacted to it.Today I watched the film on screen and got out entirely dizzy and frustrated about the story. The filming technique was different from typical movies we watch. It resembled that in ""The Blair Witch Project"" that the movie was viewed from the Video Recorder's perspective but in a much clearer version (Maybe the DV was of Good quality, thanks to Rob!) However the screenplays were just too shaky and made people feel dizzy most of the time. I understand in real situation it should be as shaky as hell like in the movies, but I think for most audience viewing this movie it would be a disaster. Somehow movies are for entertainment to the general people so I think it would be better if they have improved this part.The cast did their parts in the movie. Without stars in the movie made it more realistic and let us feel more close to real life. The cuttings and lightnings were great. CG effects were good. However the dizzy camera screen stole a great deal of marks from them. It made me hard to concentrate on all the details as I was about to throw up watching the movie! In addition, personally the story was too simple. There were no twists at all and much was predicted after being surprised by the first attack of the monster. It was sort of the ""Resident Evil"" style of movie where the government last resort was to bomb the entire area. And the cameraman Hud was doing too much trash talk which made me hate him more than appreciating his sense of humor.If you can tolerate riding on roller coasters for a continual of 85 minutes, I think you can give this movie a try. The concept was really really nice and I liked it, but I just could not stand watching a movie that makes you throw up. Given improved shaky camera technique and more twists to the story, I think this movie can deserve a higher rating.",Cloverfield

892,Ivonneabsy,Nothing new,4,11 April 2021,"Cloverfield is like some mix of the Blair Witch project, The mist and Godzilla. The plot is very monotonous and boring, there are often screams and alarms in the film, but the plot does not give us anything new to see. The monster in the film looks pretty funny to me and is shown in very few shots. The actors could be better and more convincing, but what I like most about this film is exactly that shooting from one angle like in the Blair witch project. I think this is amazing because it certainly better conveys the alarm, fear, and catastrophe that befell them in the film. A solid movie to watch in the afternoon with cup od tea or coffee.",Cloverfield
893,daveinfi,over-rated garbage,1,16 February 2008,"Everyone has their own opinion so i will give mine and everyone i have spoke to about this film, in fact to find anyone who likes this film i had to come on this web-site. it got booed in my local cinema and rightfully so. i had a head-ache watching it, the amateur camera work was pointless and spoiled the film. there was no tension (what they tried to achieve with the amateur camera work) the main thing was that this film was totally BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I only watched it last night and i can honistly say that i cannot name any of the characters names. the acting was poor and the characters were boring. i'm not going to waste anymore time in telling you anymore about this film as its not worth my time its already wasted an hour and a half of my life, either listen to me or not i'm not bothered, some of may like it (dont understand how) but if i save anyone money by putting you off this garbage at least my hour and a half wasn't totally wasted.",Cloverfield
894,stephenmcgowan,More realism than all the rest,9,18 February 2008,"The movie was dubbed Blair Witch meets 9/11. Well thats not far off. The cameraman draws you in as you strive to visualise what the camera sees. Like War of the Worlds, the movie works because you only ever get to see the monster from a first person perspective and you only get a limited sight of it to. This creates tension like the Alien movies did and the horror is limited so the viewer is not subjected to a gore-fest like some of the other Hollywood horrors. There are also questions of the monsters presence. Where did it come from? What type of animal is it? Can it be killed? Is it alien? The length of the movie cannot answer these for us and again it adds to the realism of the movie. Because such a disaster has never taken place on our planet in our history, you cannot make it a glossy blockbuster like a war movie. You have to make this as realistic as possible. Filming it in hand-held camera works a treat especially with a back story and humour. I think they have done well with this movie, so much so you have to see it in a cinema to experience the best of it. I for one will be going to see it again.",Cloverfield
895,TheUrquhart,Did Hollywood just do a cool film???,8,17 January 2008,"If you like having everything explained to you, tedious backstories, and all loose ends tied up in a no brainer so you won't have to use your imagination, don't go see this movie.If you like cheesy Hollywood music scores telling you when to be frightened, when to be sad, or happy, don't go see this movie.However if you want a visceral, original, immersive experience and are prepared to take this film as the monster film it is (albeit done in an original and interesting way) then you'll love it.It was like an amusement park ride. loud, tense, INtense, and not exactly Shakespeare.And for once the characters (mostly) made believable decisions, and were believably scared, freaked out, and ran like hell screaming most of the time. As i damn well would too.Different, original, and a whole lotta fun.",Cloverfield
896,have_a_nice_day131,"An very good, intense monster movie.",10,21 April 2008,"I'll always remember what I ate in the theater watching Cloverfield: a bag of smuggled Tootsie Rolls. That's because this is a very memorable film. It's Godzilla with a handicam, following a group of tame but horny (it's PG-13) teenagers as they journey through New York as a raging monster from outer space attacks the city. Their story is less important that that of their camera, which has been on their shoulders during the course of the film. Indeed, they believe that future generations will want to know what went down on that horrible day. ""Cloverfield"" is actually very frightening. A surprising attack by the monster on a helicopter, a chick exploding into blood, and that shaky, shaky camera add to the deep realism of the situation. I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece. It's just not that type of really, really, really good movie.",Cloverfield
897,joel-678,Good and Different,8,10 June 2008,"i was impressed bye the film it had a different look on you normal ""Block-Buster"" Cloverfield follows five New Yorkers from the perspective of a hand-held video camera. The movie is exactly the length of a DV Tape and a sub-plot is established by showing bits and pieces of video previously recorded on the tape that is being recorded over. The movie starts as a monster of unknown origin destroys a building. As they go to investigate, parts of the building and the head of the Statue of Liberty come raining down. The movie follows their adventure trying to escape and save a friend, a love interest of the main character.i must say the acting was very well done, Especially by Lizzy Caplan(mean girls).the Special effects where pretty good but all up the movie was something different and very entertaining",Cloverfield
898,gastricdistress,"Fun, Fun, Fun!",10,24 January 2008,"Wow! Thoroughly enjoyable! I've been reading a lot of comments from viewers who didn't like it. Most of them complain about the hand-held camera aspect. Many others complain that it didn't have every aspect of the story laid out with surgical precision, leaving no room for the imagination. Boo-whah! The first 15-20 minutes allowed us to get to know the characters. The rest was just go-go-go and is what you'd expect from a first-person experience. They didn't linger on the creature, but just their own experience while it was happening.This is a movie that depends on the intelligence of the viewer to let their own mind fill in the blanks - the beginning and end of the story. I feel sorry for those who need to have everything handed to them on a plate.So what if the characters do stupid things...isn't that part of the news everyday?",Cloverfield
899,Equinox1772,must be a monster movie fan,6,18 January 2008,"This movie was excellent if you like Godzilla and other old school monster movies. Like the remake of the Poseidon Adventure, new computer CGI is used to modernize the genre. With Poseidon, it was making a ship disaster flick look modern. With Cloverfield, it was likewise taking a monster movie flick and modernizing it. Cloverfield was in no way cheesy like Godzilla though.You have to be able to tolerate the hand held camera shots for the entire film. I do not think it was very slick of the director to show a skyscraper in New York falling straight down and sending a huge plume of dust flying through the streets. It hit a little to close to home and residents of NY, if they didn't already have a complex, probably will after seeing that. Yes, I know its just a movie, and I'm probably overreacting over one single scene, but come on, we can see a monster ravish the city without being shown a nearly identical shot of WTC tower collapse.I don't know exactly what I was expecting from this movie but I will say that whatever it was it succeeded and disappointed. Not very helpful I know. I guess I liked all the action and scary dark tunnel moments (I especially like the going from one tower that is fine to one that is perched precariously at an angle against the good one). On the other hand I wanted more explanation of the monster and to see a shot of the city when it was all over. All in all it was a good movie that I would recommend to disaster/monster/alien movie fans. However, I would probably rank War of the Worlds, Signs, and even The Mist ahead of this one.Like during the last movie I reviewed (The Mist) I had ""America's most immature"" sitting in the row right behind me (just lucky I guess)...laughing when something serious is happening and TALKING during the movie. I'm seriously gonna start going to early afternoon shows or the midnight shows (you know, the ones where you're just about the only one in the theater). Please movie goers, when they say no talking before the movie they don't say it in French, German, or Chinese so it should be easy for the average English speaking person to understand. Okay, I'm off my soapbox now. Usually I'm a much more cheerful reviewer but that kind of stuff just bugs the crap out of me.",Cloverfield
900,skluczkiewicz,Lost it's appeal,6,19 January 2008,"I was never completely hyped up to see this movie. I looked at it as a ""down on the streets"" point of view of a Godzilla type movie and that's pretty much what it was. Unfortunately that point of view wore thin on me.I didn't mind the set up at the beginning to get you interested in the characters you were going to follow around. I didn't mind a group of 20 somethings acting... well like 20 somethings. It all gave it a bit of realism. I had no issue with the camera being shaky (although I had to look away at one point when I started feeling some nausea). I even liked a lot of the aspects of the attack in Manhattan.My issue was at some point in the movie, probably in the last fifteen to twenty minutes, I didn't care about it anymore. The whole thing just seemed to go on too long. I didn't care about the people we were seeing on the film anymore. I didn't care if they survived or not. I just wanted it to end.I also, for the first time I can remember in the past few years, felt like I wanted my money back after seeing Cloverfield. That is a bit strong of a statement considering there were aspects of the movie I did like- the creature in this has a very cool design and let's just say the ""in the street"" fighting really feels like you're right there in the action. It's just that by the end of the movie I felt like ""yeah been there done that"" a thousand times in other Godzilla type movies. That's all it was in the end.Maybe it's just me as the other two people I saw it with really enjoyed the movie. It's just my opinion so take it for what it's worth.",Cloverfield
901,raycja89,One word to describe it all...AMAZING.,10,18 January 2008,"So let's get one thing straight, a movie with a hand held camera theme is going to make you nauseous, it's a given. So get over it people.Okay on to my comment. The movie is, as I see it, a masterpiece. Sure I'll give it to most, the ending wasn't the best but I'm not going to spoil it for you guys and gals out there that have yet to see this monster of a movie. This movie not only delivered the scares, but it delivers in nearly every other emotion as well. The comedic relief was genius, the sad moments were tear jerking, the action-y moments where suspenseful unlike any other movie I've seen in a long long time. I just wish it was longer, with a run time barely under an hour and a half, it had me sitting in my seat wanting more every second that passed. The monster was absolutely brilliant and the acting in the movie is some of the best I've seen in a long time especially from a cast of really young actors.Overall this movie was a wonderful experience and I hope Hollywood comes out with more like this. Maybe not so much hand-held cam but maybe a little more interesting and fun like ""Cloverfield"". I'm sure anyone who watches this will agree and say it is one of the best monster movies ever made, quite possibly the best.",Cloverfield
902,paulwzhao,It must be my fault that I hated this movie,5,21 January 2008,"First off, this movie has to be the most talked about and controversial movie of all time judging by the astronomical amount of buzz and comments it generated before and after its release. So far, most of them have been positive but nevertheless, it is undeniably one of those movies that you either hate or love.Originally, I plan to give it a zero. But after some soul searching, I thought a 5 would be more appropriate if I put aside my personal grudge and disappointment due to false hope and misguided expectation.It is unquestionably a brainchild of digital age. This movie would not be the least bit relevant and effective if we are not in the prime age of camera phone, youtube and digicam. In the time of prime media being flooded with low quality captures of real life events, this movie had hit home and heart of many audiences, as it was cleverly packaged, devised, staged and deployed to make you believe. Without the sense of realism, this movie is reduced to nothing but failed, pretentious, crude and vomit inducing piece of eyesore. The biggest problem that I have is that: IT DIDN'T MAKE ME BELIEVE! Hence my title of this review: it must be my fault that I hated this movie.My fault number 1: I didn't know that it's going to be shot entirely on handy cam. (I guess I just wasn't that much on the vibe of current events) It thus to my shock, amazement and disbelieve that 40 minutes into the movie, the guy is still holding the damn camera though common sense would tell us that any sane and normal human being would have ditched the camera by now.This factor alone had cracked a big hole for me in the credibility and authenticity of this movie.My fault number 2: I'm just too critical and analytical for my own good, thus deprived me the joy of being immersed into the experience. There are time and time again that it seems extremely inappropriate for them to keep recording when they actually need to run for their life. A guy who had never dealt much with camera in his entire life all of a sudden just turned into this obsessive camera nut who insist on filming in the most inopportune moment of his life when he supposed to cover his friends and his own ass. This just takes away more credibility and simply became a distraction.My fault number 3: I actually noticed all the ploy, tricks and gimmicks of tension building 5 minutes into the movie. Many here have asked the purpose of first 20 minutes of mind numbing footage of some guys and some girls and some farewell party. I actually noticed that it's there to make it real for you and prepare your mind for a shock. The problem is that there's no shock for me as I know it's a trick to lay the tone for it to be some mundane home movie and then all of a sudden just hit you with a monster. Well duh, the movie poster and trailer show liberty statue's head got ripped off, so I was expecting a monster and I knew the director was priming me for a shock. Only that it didn't shock me. Instead, I kept asking: when are you going to cut the chase and show us the damn monster already? You spent 20 minutes trying to tell me that it's just a normal day for normal people. I got it already!!! My fault number 4: I'm just not that romantic. The story centers around a guy for some reason, during a life threatening apocalyptic event, all of sudden became desperately romantic and heroic and dead bent on saving a girl (who already had a boyfriend) he had one night stand with. It sort of makes sense since it may be his last chance because he's going to Japan. Also it might add to the effect that they are all about to die any minute. Riiiiight Am I the only who see the glaring gaping hole in logic here? Just for the convenience of recording the whole event for our viewing enjoyment, his friends decided to tag along, one of them is a girl who had only met him 3 times in her whole life and was apparently drunk every time. Another one is our camera man who apparently wasn't that tight with him but somehow determined to risk his life and follow him and managed to record the whole event. THEY HARDLY SEEM TO BE HIS FRIEND IF YOU ASK ME! But I'm just thinking too much.My fault number 5: I thought movies, like music, are supposed to be appealing to our sensory organs. I guess I'm wrong. This movie is as visually appealing as having someone grab your feet and lift you upside down and start violently shaking you for pocket changes  FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS! There are times that I literally hope the fat guy behind the camera just die so all of this visual abuse would stop. Defies all logic, he survived many odds while managing to keep the camera rolling. In the end, the biggest tragedy is not death, but headache. At least that's the case for me.My fault number 6: I miserably failed to make the connection between this movie and 9/11. I never sense the urgency of national defense crisis that got some of the viewers here so worked up. All I got out of this movie is an ill attempt to present a far fetched concept in a realistic package.If it not for me being a stubborn, cynical, judgmental and overly analyzing SOB, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Instead, I felt like this is an overly elaborated youtube hoax.",Cloverfield
903,eniac-11,Hand-held sucks,2,6 February 2008,"If the camera hadn't been hand-held shaking through the whole movie it might have been at least an 8, but the filming made me quite dizzy and though the idea was quite good, it ruined the movie because there was no ""real"" steady filming at all.Also this hand-held filming took out any excitement and shock-effects.If the same movie was made with proper filming i might actually consider go seeing it again! The sequel won't get my money if it is made the same way as the first.It's the first time i actually wanted to leave the cinema before the credits.",Cloverfield
904,horrorforpresident,Too much hype to live up to,7,20 February 2008,"As many of us know, Cloverfeild was supposed to be the next great monster movie, an instant classic. Well, it did fall a little bit short. The trailer was much better than the movie. In the trailer, we see NYC as a killing ground for some kind of a huge creature, and the group of characters is seeing the battle against the creature while trying to leave NYC. We see what they see via video camera. Now don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the use of video cameras in movies, I love The Blair Witch Project, and i think that the idea is a cool way to film a movie. Yes, it can get a little annoying, but the angles in The Blair Witch Project were much worse. Also, too much hype to live up too. And with as much hype that this film got, i don't think any film could ever even come close to living up to it.I liked most of the movie, and thought that the lines were really believable, and the acting decent. But again, too much hype, especially for a monster movie of this nature.The main point of the film was that there was a party going on in NYC, and a friend of the person the party was being thrown for was filming a video, and thus we have the video camera. Once the monster hits and everyone realizes what is going on, the ""awesome"" party turns into an extreme race to get out of the city, and save a friend.A good film, but the hype can really kill it. Let's just say it would have gotten 8.5 stars instead of 7. If you like basically any monster movie, or you loved The Blair Witch Project, you should enjoy yourself. Overall, an almost great monster movie that could not live up to it's own hype.",Cloverfield

907,christinekay,Cloverfield - not your average monster movie,9,16 February 2008,"""Cloverfield"" features a gigantic monster that terrorises New York, and the military seem powerless to prevent it rampaging through the streets. If this seems a familiar plot, then it is - it is a basic horror/fantasy theme that has featured in ""King Kong"", ""Godzilla"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", and no doubt countless other productions.However, a look at the film will show that this takes a different stance: with the use of the hand-held camera throughout, this is, as far as I know, the first to show what it would actually be like to be caught up in an attack by such a creature. Most monster films have a buildup that shows the monster beforehand (ie Kong in his natural habitat before his capture and arrival in NYC, or the creation of the various dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park""). As frightening as these films are, we are at least prepared for what we are going to see: we can find some comfort in knowing what these monsters are, and we are not exactly surprised when they go on the rampage. ""Cloverfield"" takes a different stance. We are watching what seems a rather tedious party, when we hear noises - are they explosions? Fireworks? Gunfire? We don't know and are as puzzled as the actors themselves. We feel unnerved, and are glad to have our curiosity at least partly satisfied when someone turns on the TV (our source of immediate information) and find the news that a tanker has gone down in NY harbour. At least we now know what has happened .... or do we? When the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the street, then we realise that this is something far worse than an accident . We are as helpless as the partygoers: what to do? Stay in the apartment or get out? Eventually, there is the sighting of something so awful, we cannot describe it. Our instinct is to flee to a safe place, of course, but this is not your normal emergency. There is the obvious panic and hysteria, and sheer inability to comprehend what is happening, and it is the fear of not knowing what to do, of being in a totally alien world, that scares us, for we the audience, are right there with those involved.""Cloverfield"" has been criticised by some critics for not giving enough definition to the leading characters, yet I do not feel this is entirely fair. We do care about them - after all, if they feel safe, we feel safe. It's also important to remember that they are characters following a very basic human need: that of keeping themselves alive at all costs. You cannot expect wisecracks or eloquent speeches on the future of mankind in a situation like this - your focus will be on finding that elusive place of safety.Many have also made reference to the film and its parallels with 9/11 - the unknown enemy that threatens us. This is certainly a valid point, and yet I feel that the film would still have succeeded in its aims even without that analogy. ""Cloverfield"" shows us the human race in danger from the unknown, be it flying saucers from the 1950's, or the Spanish flu epidemic of the 1910's, or the atom bombs of the Cold War. There is always something out there to scare us and it is up to us to confront it.",Cloverfield
908,m_chubbs,It'll take some time for another monster movie like Cloverfield to come,10,21 June 2008,"I saw this after most people had, so my expectations we're high. After watching it, I had realised I never had so fun much fun watching a monster movie. I used to love Godzilla movies but after a while, the fun just was sucked away as I grew up.Then, I went to see this. It was so adult and so personal, it packs a heavy emotional punch. It had me thinking what I would do in a situation like that, how I would react with my friends dieing around me while being stalked by a creature in one of the largest cities in the world.The beginning makes you show compassion towards the characters, it shows their personal lives and drama's we've all faced at one point in our life, then, it all gets turned upside down. The hand-held camera doesn't catch everything so it's like your watching from a first person perspective so you see what the characters are seeing from there perspective like when the army roll down the streets and Hud the cameraman ducks behind the cars as you hear the monster roaring, it adds that fear and terror as you feel like you hiding with him.Then there is the monster. The monster is the most important part of a monster film, of course, and the production team have really made a monster to be scared of. Also, the idea of it shedding off little parasite creatures adds to the fear and terror and confusion that the characters on screen feel.A must see, but is best viewed in a cinema if you caught it or with a home cinema system for the effect.A brilliant masterpiece of monster film making without the tacky cheesiness of a B-movie.",Cloverfield
909,Seven_Thunders,Succeeds beyond the hype,8,21 January 2008,"What a trip. The movie that was the hype-fest of 2007 has finally hit screens, and after the first viewing it left me wanting to see it again. For those of you who aren't quite sure what this movie is trying to do, it is a monster attack from the POV of the man on the street. 'Cloverfield' is the military codename for the event in the area formerly known as Central Park. It follows a group of young people as they are caught in the middle of this disaster, all caught on a camcorder. It feels like you are there. This is not a movie with your traditional plot, nor is it trying to be artful or dodgy. If the movie had a plot, it would have been ruined. Thus, being done as it is, it's immersive (if you don't mind the shakiness at times), intense and, dare I say, realistic.Though it starts off a bit on the slow side, it gets in your face from the moment the city shakes from its arrival. People die in brutal ways, and their emotion is so real and guttural at times that you wish you could take a nuke to that beast to end their suffering.The direction of this movie is done incredibly well for the chaotic scenario that it is. It doesn't feel directed at all, with the possible exception of the character ""Hud"", who is the guy with the camera. Though almost all of his interactions are behind the lens, he still has a great amount of character. His personality comes through even with the movement of the camera. He is comic relief, but you love him all the more for it.You may be wondering how much of the monster you actually see. Well, I'm not going to spoil anything. But you won't be disappointed in this regard. Go see the film, who cares what people are saying about it, and make your own judgment. Cloverfield is the best monster attack movie ever. It leaves you wanting more.Great job, Drew Goddard and Matt Reeves. Here's to hoping we see more out of you two.",Cloverfield

When I went to the theaters to see this film, I was so excited, and am glad to say it lived up to what I was looking for. The plot was good, and we see a group of characters that are likable and relatable to try and escape a horrificbattack on New York. The slow revealing of the monster throughout the film, leading up to the creatures close-up towards the end of the film, was expertly performed. The handy-cam work provided a realness not many films include, and really makes you feel as if you are in the film, catching glimpses of the monster slowly throughout the entire film.

OK maybe the creature should be better but it grows on you. The camera usage was a bit strange at the beginning but you get used to it.When the movie started I think the party goes to long, did expect something around 13 minutes and felt a bit tired but you kind forget that later.I wish the director and cast go all an reboot War of the Worlds just keeping he effect of Spielberg. This guys performed better than any 80s fake or blonde little girl who great directors try to promote along with they whole families.This movie did very well, the army had a strong presence and the whole set was great.

The plot was... interesting.What disappointed me the most about the movie was the monster!!! What the ?? I had seen this drawing of the Cloverfield monster (Spectacular, creepy, impressive whale-thing with bugs all over it), then I was told it was a fake, but then I assumed the real monster would be even more impressive, given the dimensions of the destruction (skycrapers falling, explosions, the noise, etc.).Instead, we are treated to this anorexic version of the Harry Potter troll!! only thing missing was the log in his hand.So when you see this effeminate monster strutting its Naomi Campbell legs all over Manhattan, with a head made of poop, you think again... can this flaming monster cause so much destruction? It didn't even look big enough.That was my pet peeve with the movie.",Cloverfield
913,cgsoldier22,Recognize what Abrams goal was in this movie,8,5 January 2012,"People are complaining that this movie was shaky and bad effects and story did not tell you much. That was Abram's goal! There have been hundreds of monster movies out there, but they are all showed like a real movie with usually a happy ending. But we have never really seen a monster movie from the point of a view of one group of people. That is what makes this movie original. Most monster movies show you the heroes and army fighting the monster, but what about all the civilians who are trying to stay alive while these events unfold? That is what we got with Cloverfield.What would you have done if you were in the situation? If you call the characters stupid, then you put yourself in the situation and try and say that again. They were scared and shocked, its not everyday your city gets attacked by a giant monster and the Statue of Liberty's head flies onto your street.And for all of you who are complaining of not getting answers...that is what makes the movie more exciting and scary. The feeling of not knowing is even scarier. Abrams could have made some cliché explanation like it was an alien or something buried underground, but he did not. He left that for us to figure out, and I doubt everybody in that city was getting an explanation of what it was. They were too busy surviving. The point of this movie was to put you in the situation of an attack on the city. Also watch the ending and see something fall into the ocean. Love the mysterious feel of the movie. Great Marketing campaign, exciting, thrilling, and original. Recommend it for a fun movie to watch with your friends.",Cloverfield
914,BigDom2786,Believe the hype...but don't expect too much....,7,19 January 2008,"When I walked out of this film I have two emotions: happiness and disappointment. I was happy because I got the film I wanted: a monster movie that didn't explain everything, but had enough for me to understand what the hell was going on. The main problem with Godzilla(98) is that it force-fed the audience what the monster is or where it came from. This movie leaves it up to your imagination, and I'm glad it did. I'm disappointed the film felt too short for a monster movie and too long for a love story. As much I appreciated an actual attempt at story, it distracted what was basically 65 minutes of monster madness( and 5 minutes of light humor). Though, if it wasn't for this love story, the movie would've been the length of a TV show.Basically, the characters( no matter how annoying they were sometimes) were well acted, the monster looked pretty awesome( I think JJ Abrams need to thank the Half Life creators for some inspiration ) and it ended the way I wanted to end ( even though it could've been better).So I say go see this film, u wouldn't regret it. Just don't come in expecting this to be the greatest movie ever made. It's just a great way to spend a Saturday night with your friends. Oh and word of advice: don't watch this film at least in the first 5-10 rows.....u will get motion sickness from the shaky cam.",Cloverfield

916,phil-592,"Nice effect, great cast but a lack-luster script",1,1 February 2008,"Three of us went to see this film and after 45 minutes I left due to feeling sick at the camera work, I know what effect they were going for but frankly it just got annoying after 10 minutes.Super teleporting characters, able to move around NY at incredible speeds, jumping 10+ blocks at a time and then managing to climb 40+ floors to rescue people, Christ this lot should be in the fantastic 4.A collective judgement (as I had to leave early) of 1/10. Frankly I and the other two who were with me feel robbed of our ticket fee.Some promising actors in the movie though and I hope to see them in actually GOOD movies in the future, not drivel like this.",Cloverfield
917,veetoo,One kick ass popcorn movie,9,2 February 2008,"Being somewhat long in the tooth, it takes something very unique to capture this particular individuals attention. Cloverfeld did it for me with it's totally original visual style (video diary) and CGI the likes of which I have never before seen. The only drawback for me (and to be honest it was minor, on this occasion) was the total lack of character back-story (apart from flashbacks going back some months of two of the main protagonists). Although the film was cast with the obligatory 'beautiful people' their acting skills were pretty damn sharp. In summation .. the best popcorn movie I have ever seen. The Making of DVD is at the top of my most wanted.",Cloverfield
918,Markbruinekreeft,I can't believe so many people hated it....,9,8 February 2008,"Okay, so the whole ""seen through the camera of some regular Joe"" thing isn't exactly new. But you have to admit that applying the principle to a monster movie was a pretty neat idea. Cloverfield is an awesome film. I can be a horrible nitpicker at times, and films that can truly captivate me are few and far between. Cloverfield, however, kept me firmly pinned to my seat during the entire film. It blew me away. I have almost no nits to pick at all!-------------------------Spoilers forthcoming--------------------------The fact that a choppy, quasi-amateurish ""Blair Witch"" approach is used, combined with the fact that almost no solid answers are given about what the monster is, where it comes from and why it is attacking the city, gives an outlandish concept like a giant monster attack a terrifying and nightmarish realism. We, the audience, know little more than the main characters do, which results in a sense of loss of control, bewilderment and of utter helplessness. This is further expanded upon by the fact that none of said characters is a larger-than-life, cliché Hollywood-style hero. Presumably, there is some ex-Navy Seal guy with a rocket launcher running around somewhere, with a girl in a torn tank-top and a wisecracking ethnic-minority sidekick in tow. But this is not his story. This is about a random group of people, who suddenly find themselves in a terrifying and unreal situation. Granted, few people get to be vice-president of something in Japan while still only in their mid- to late twenties, but basically, it COULD be you out there. Running for your life with a running camera in your hand. Seeing your friends and relatives die in horrible and shockingly random ways. There are a FEW nits to pick, of course. Such as the convenient fact that the main protagonists keep blundering into the most spectacular disasters taking place during the attack. Or the introductory holiday/party scene that was exactly long enough to become boring. But most of these are largely either excusable oversights or necessary compromises to the film's ""Blair Witch"" style. All in all, this is a gripping, terrifying and even quite original film. Those who can enjoy a thriller/horror film that dares to deviate from the mainstream (even if only a little) and who can live with not getting all the answers at the end will enjoy this flick tremendously.However, those people who prefer more ""traditional"" monster movies, in the mold of the classic Godzilla or Alien films, will most likely hate it. As will people who simply don't like the Blair Witch-like ""one single, shaky home camera"" style used in this film.",Cloverfield
919,steve-27-258783,Completely Terrible,1,21 December 2015,"1 dimensional script, I had no empathy for anyone in this movie.Lacks any logic or realism within its own context.Poor acting, there was more annoying screaming from the guy freaking out than the girl when she we impaled. As mentioned totally unrealistic within its own context.The camera work is terrible, hand held has its place, but not to this extreme and for the entirety of the movie.Feels like a student film with a rented camera.While the fact that prices for decent cinema cameras have come down, is a good, thing, on the flip side you end up with movies like this.Sorry, but the move was completely terrible in every aspect.Some like it, but then again some like Donald Trump. It's a poor reflection on society.",Cloverfield
920,kryptonarie-01794,Cloverfield is an experience...,9,8 March 2021,"Cloverfield still in 2021 is one of the best handheld camera/found footage horror films: the action and tension are over the top, the acting is good and the monsters are insane! Even after 13 years Cloverfield is still one of the best made creature features - one doesn't just watch Cloverfield, you experience it! The visuals are done so well they rival anything being produced today, so take the ride, you won't regret it! And that's all I have to say about my third watch since this gem was released in 2008!",Cloverfield
921,dneunabe,Very hard to care about the characters....,3,4 May 2008,"I'm sorry for such a low [3/10] rating, but for me this movie failed at the most basic level---I was not able to care about characters. I really, really wanted to like this movie. I love giant alien movies in general--like Aliens, Predator, or even The Mist. I was always aware that I was watching a movie that was trying {and not very successfully] to be a home made documentary about an alien attack. Not once in the movie did I achieve the ""suspension of belief"" needed to draw me in. The special effects were great--it would have been a much better movie if they had picked up guns and started fighting the aliens rather than pursuing an insane and very implausible search for the main character's girlfriend. They would have been better off filling the movie with special effects and battle scenes. I also couldn't suspend belief about the basic premise of the film, videotaping an alien attack on New York---no way would I have kept a video cam walking through a dark tunnel with alien spiders chasing me, climbing into a crumbling high rise apartment, climbing into a helicopter, etc. You get the picture. I can't recall I movie I've liked less. I was actually glad it ended. I hope someone re-makes the movie someday. It is a great premise, but poorly done by this film maker.",Cloverfield
922,zaethermind,Unwatchable,1,18 June 2017,"Sorry, but this was not a movie. More likely a bunch of moves left and right, up and down with a camera in your hand. UNWATCHABLE. In fact, I hate this kind of movies made like this, from the point of view of an amateur handling a camera.Very disappointed with my time lost for this non movie.",Cloverfield
923,won-55372,Why did I keep watching,1,14 October 2020,"This must be one of the most lame movies I've watched in years. I'm shocked score was higher than 2.5It wasn't even a movie, it was just a bunch of cam corder drivel with cool special effects, sort of.",Cloverfield
924,ramificating,The Blair Witch Project + War of the Worlds = CLOVERFIELD,9,16 January 2008,"This film is one of those rare few where the plot really doesn't matter, your just completely blown away by the stunning visuals and realism of each shot of the movie. Just like Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez's Blair Witch Project, the film captures every scene on a typical handy cam in the hands of the 6 protagonists of the film, trying to escape the inevitable doom thats wrecking havoc in the city of New York. The plot overall is just like War of the Worlds, much closer to Steven Spielberg's version. It really has no backbone of any such, most of you will even question the protagonist's choices in the film that build the story, always choosing the worst solution over the best and ultimately showing us what we came to see. The story never feels like it is telling the audience much of whats going on, you learn everything the same way as you would in real life if such a situation could occur, on the news. However, If you think the film will be a cheesy action film then your sadly mistaken. The film really speaks to you through that camera as you are shown the spectacular special effects of building's collapsing, the explosions and the onslaught of damage by both the army and the monster. Certain scene's definitely reflect 9/11 and make you believe its almost real. You can honestly feel like being there, as their are no 2nd or 3rd person views, the camera definitely adds authenticity to the quality of the film, really acting out as a documentary than a pop corn flick.The antagonist of the movie, the monster, was much more amazing than expected, you won't be disappointed, it truly doesn't keep you unsatisfied it definitely has a place among King Kong and Godzilla as a great sci-fi villain. As an unbeatable force, it truly has no weakness or match and completely leaves you wondering if it can even be stopped. You really do get to see it quite a bit in the film, enough to satisfy almost anyone wanting to see it.I would suggest it to almost all ages, you will definitely feel like your on a roller coaster for some of the scenes and when you step out of the cinema you will probably hesitate to believe everything that you just saw was a movie and not real.",Cloverfield
925,pearl18,A Good Thrill,6,13 August 2008,"I had absolutely no expectations about this film since I knew nothing about it. This is not a film for analysis and intellectual criticism. It held my interest by the unexpected turn of the plot and the action. I agree that the party scene seems superfluous at first, but it sets the mood for a care-free hedonistic atmosphere of young people in Manhattan who are suddenly faced with death and destruction. OK, let's just say it, this film plays on our 9/11 sensitivity, and frankly, if I was a new yorker, it might have offended me. I should feel guilty for not having turned it off, but I could not. The film speaks for itself in that it reminds us not to take anything for granted as well as how fleeting and ephemeral a carefree existence can be. The sci-fi aspect is not the point. Although it is quite terrifying. The symbolism of the decapitation of the statue of liberty is chilling in view of what has happened in the past 7 years. This film is a new twist on the 1950's sci-fi films which were sublimating the fear of a communist takeover, although here it is terrorism. I agree with other reviewers on the lack of coherence and the been-there-done-that camcorder (Blair Witch) thing. However, the malaise and lack of a happy resolution make this film a cut above the ""War of the Worlds"" and other similar flics. The acting is as good as can be expected in this type of film and the effects are terrifying. I just have one question: who would ever have held on to their camcorder and filmed all of that while going through complete terror? But, like I said, one should not ask too many questions. Just go with it.",Cloverfield
926,DreamScapeSev7n,Meh,5,23 January 2019,"I think this is actually one of the more interesting and creative found footage movies out there, but the characters were pretty boring and I didn't feel the tension due to not caring about what happened to them.",Cloverfield
927,ozan-uen,Impressive,8,8 September 2008,"I watched this movie just yesterday and last night, when I closed my eyes I saw high buildings crashing. The director just fulfilled his idea. You feel like you found an amateur tape. This is one of the best monster movies. You don't see funny stuff, you don't see extra dramatic scenes and you don't really have music. It feels just real. You don't know where the monster came from and it's not important. You keep watching and feel the tribe. Nice directing, great acting and realistic story. Could have been more, but this is enough for a great monster movie. Get your room dark, sit back and enjoy.If you have the DVD watch the making of and the alternate endings. It is amazing what you can do with computers... All you need is imagination. You always can go as far as you can imagine. Forget Godzilla or The hostel. This is the new monster everyone was waiting for.",Cloverfield
928,JeffG-4,My Head is Still Pounding,1,25 February 2008,"If you can past the headache-inducing camera effect, you then can try to sort out the rest of this mess they are calling a ""film"". Beside it's rather cheesy FX, it's plot is totally without meaning. There is absolutely no explanation for anything that occurs in this movie. Where did the monster come from? What brought it here? Why New York? When the military opted for the last resort, how much of the city did the implied nuke attack take out? Did the nuke kill the monster(s)? Etc, etc, ad nauseum. If they expected true SF fans to warm-up to this one, they were sadly mistaken. It's been over 48-hrs since I went to see it and my head is still pounding. Ouch.",Cloverfield
929,alntv,Seriously...have you seen Godzilla (1998)???,10,25 January 2008,"I can't believe the negative reviews that I've been reading about this film. It seems that you either really love it or really hate it. Well...I loved it. And I gotta be honest, I don't see (other than if you get motion sickness) how anyone who likes scary, sci-fi flicks wouldn't really like this film. It gives you characters to care about, it's got a monster that is trashing New York, and it's got great special effects. What more can you want? Oh yeah...maybe someone strapped to a chair being tortured to death? Or possibly we should have SEEN all of the victims being eaten by the monsters. Oh yeah...that would have made it better. Oh...and what about the female leads? No nudity? No sex scenes? C'mon...how COULD you like something like this film with no big name actors and a small (by Hollywood standards) budget? I guess there is so much garbage out there today that when something creative and new comes along, it throws a lot of people out of whack.But let me tell you this, I stand in the ""Cloverfield"" corner and I will go out on a limb and say there hasn't been an sci-fi film like this since ""Aliens"" many years ago. I had a lot of fun watching this film (twice as of this writing) and I will enjoy it for many years to come. Thanks J.J. Abrams for allowing me to enjoy not only the movie, but the hype leading up to it. The way this movie was promoted, starting with the trailer preceding ""Transformers"" to the internet sites and gimmicks, was fun to follow and I loved the film. Excellent job. Can't wait to see what you do with Star Trek!",Cloverfield
930,idrow,Very Disappointing,7,21 January 2008,"I'm a huge fan of monster, apocalyptic, and doomsday movies, so naturally I was very excited to see this one. To summarize in one word: Meh. This movie with such a huge premise was exactly 1 hour and 13 minutes long. WTF? With such a short movie, the writers choose to spend the first 20 minutes on literally nothing of interest. You're taken to a going away party for someone with an irritating personality. A party I would have left after 10 minutes if I was actually there. So, after a quarter of the movie is wasted here, an alarm goes off and everyone starts running. The shaky camera work at the party is annoying, and it just gets worse...and worse...and worse, and my annoyance just kept growing.So much could have been done with this story, but the writers and director had it out for the audience and gave everyone a big F.U. There was about two minutes collectively where the movie was cool, but that's only if you're into special effects. If you're into extremely shaky film footage where you have to strain to see anything, then you'll love this one. This was ten times shakier than the Blair Witch Project.I bet this movie was made for less than 100k, and most of that was spent on CGI, because the actors shouldn't have been paid more than 5k apiece. This movie jumped from totally boring to chaos without any explanations. Where did the monster come from? Why, after seeing it blown up, did it show up again unscathed? Where did it go at the end and what the hell happened? Why were buildings being blown up? Could the monster shoot fire balls out of it's ass or something? We never find out.Apparently, the budget ran out because the movie just ended abruptly. No resolution or answers whatsoever. The characters were so weak that I didn't even care when they died. This may be a candidate for a Raspberry award. Very, very disappointing.",Cloverfield
931,campbellhowell,Great film with a very unique filming style,9,2 May 2019,Wow I just watched this movie last night with my mom and I was on toes for the entire time. It was very very interesting for about the entire movie. This movie was very good definitely watch. If you have prime on amazon you can watch it for free.The movie was pretty funny considering it is an intense apocalyptic movie probably because of Hud. I thought it was a pretty unique tense movie for a monster film. I loved the ending because it was very uncalled for when everyone dies (Lily might've survived never told us).Overall good movie and pretty crappy review definitely recommend it,Cloverfield
932,frankjames,Terrible.,4,18 January 2008,"I don't know what movie that other people saw. But 'Cloverfield' was a joke. Is it a good sign when your suspense or horror movie has people laughing in the theaters? And there are no jokes at all. I wish someone would pay me millions of dollars to combine 'The Blair Witch Project' and scenes that look like 9/11 re-enactments. No spoiler here but you do get to see 'Cloverfield'. That is not what people were laughing at, but the movie was a rip-off. I should have seen Juno instead of this Godzilla remake. Movies is very short. After watching it today i called my brother to let him know don't waste your time or money on this. Not the worst movie I have ever seen but a total disappointment.",Cloverfield
