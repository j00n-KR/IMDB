0,Leofwine_draca,Autopilot,4,10 May 2021,"HONEST THIEF is another crime thriller that sees Liam Neeson on autopilot. He gives a performance so laidback and disinterested in the proceedings that this feels like a recent Bruce Willis movie. Neeson's aged thief decides to give himself up and turn in his loot, only to be double-crossed by a pair of corrupt FBI agents. What follows is oh-so-slow and oh-so-predictable, with character deaths you see coming a mile off and a bare minimum of action just to satisfy the correct quota. The acting is sub-par, the direction quite dull, and the whole thing just lacks energy and momentum.",Honest Thief
1,SnoopyStyle,Taking Neeson,5,9 December 2020,"Tom Dolan (Liam Neeson) is the In-and-Out-Bandit. Over the years, he has stolen $9 million from banks while they are closed on long weekend holidays. He has fallen in love with Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh) and wants to confess for a reduced sentence. He calls FBI agent Samuel Baker (Robert Patrick) who is not convinced. Baker sends subordinates John Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Ramon Hall (Anthony Ramos) to interview him. He tells them the location of the money and they end up stealing it. It goes badly and FBI agent Sean Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan) struggles to put the pieces together.Liam Neeson keeps doing this character and he's good at it. He makes this unlikely story somewhat reasonable. It's still unreasonable. Dolan is a smart man and he would never surrender in such a haphazard way. He would get the insurance companies to put some pressure on a deal. He could contact the FBI without revealing his identity. He could authenticate his work by listing some of the more questionable sequential bills. All of this is predicated on Dolan being a smart man.Even if one accepts the premise as a cost of doing the movie business, the characters continue to do dumb things. That's all the characters. I thought Annie was asking all those questions to catch the guys on a lie. Instead, she's just talking. Dumb and why add it to the movie? It doesn't change the movie one bit if she never talks to them at that time. Nivens doesn't need to kill anyone if he simply talks to Dolan like a reasonable thief. Dolan is absolved of his crimes without having to do any time. In fact, it would be a great premise if Nivens isn't a clueless evil agent. I won't even get into all the bombs in the last act. This Neeson Taken requires the audience to turn off their brains and if that's possible, this is a good popcorn flick.",Honest Thief
2,boblipton,Just What You Expect,6,31 December 2020,"Liam Neeson goes to rent a storage locker and falls in love instantly with clerk Kate Walsh. Soon they are living together. He never tells her what he does, but one day he decides to put everything behind him, so he calls the FBI and tells them he's the ""In and Out Bandit"" who has stolen about $12,000,000 over the last year. He wants to surrender and return all the money in return for a lighter sentence, so he can spend the rest of his life with Miss Walsh.This being a Liam Neeson action movie -- which he said he was never going to make another -- the agent he speaks to, and the agent's partner take the money for themselves and put Neeson and Miss Walsh on the run. But, as usual, Neeson has mad skilz; he's an ex-Marine bomb disposal expert, which means he can build them too. So it's explosions and chase, with Neeson driving an SUV, making this a fine Dad Movie. For a man who's 68, Neeson looks like he's 15 years younger. It's certainly not a great work of cinema art, but as long as he keeps making them, I'll keep watching them",Honest Thief

5,kosmasp,In and out ...,6,28 May 2021,"... of your brain. Very likely that this will not be anyones favorite film of the year, let alone favorite film ever ... This is quite by the numbers and while it is a decent movie to watch, it also is quite predictable and maybe even dull to some. The actors do elevate it, but that doesn't mean you won't know the outcome or the general direction this is heading ... I almost screamed at the screen ""come on"" - because the character should have known better.Coincidences and other inci- and accidents aside, this still can be ""fun"" and enteratining to watch. At least they kept the Liam Neeson running to a minimum - that did not look good in Taken 3 for example. You still may be wondering how he climbed/jumped a fence - but you would do yourself a favor if you didn't think too much about ... well anything. Just take the ride for what it is ... a decent thriller.",Honest Thief
6,paul_haakonsen,"Entertaining crime drama, albeit somewhat generic...",6,6 December 2020,"Well, Liam Neeson does what Liam Neeson does, for better or worse. The good part is that you know what kind of entertainment you are in for when you sit down to watch the 2020 movie ""Honest Thief"". The bad part is it is something you've seen Liam Neeson do countless times already.Now, don't get me wrong here, because ""Honest Thief"" from writers Steve Allrich and Mark Williams is entertaining and enjoyable. However, it just suffers from being a generic crime drama; one that follows the how-to-make-a-crime-drama blueprint to the letter. So on that point, the movie is somewhat generic and predictable.While ""Honest Thief"" turned out to be yet another generic archetypical Liam Neeson crime drama, then it was actually an enjoyable one. It was partly because of the storyline, but most certainly also because of the cast and the performances they individually put on.If you enjoy crime dramas, then you definitely should also watch the 2020 ""Honest Thief"" from director Mark Williams.I found it to be entertaining enough for what it was, and my rating of ""Honest Thief"" lands on a six out of ten stars. This is a good enough movie for what it was, but it is hardly ranking among the best of Liam Neeson movies, nor is it hardly a movie that you will come to think of whenever someone mention his name.",Honest Thief

8,CinemaSerf,Solid crime caper from Liam Neeson.,6,23 October 2020,"Liam Neeson has a voice that could melt chocolate - but that really isn't enough to overcome the fairly fundamental plot holes in this Swiss cheese of a film. Having successfully robbed provincial American banks of some $9m, he goes to a storage facility to rent some space to store his ill-gotten gains whereupon he falls for the rather feisty Kate Walsh (""Annie"") who runs the establishment. Skip forward a year and he determines to buy a home and settle down with her. To ensure a clean start, he calls the FBI to own up to his criminal past, return the money and to do a deal. When he eventually manages to convince them he isn't a crank, he discovers that the calibre of the agents sent to treat with him are less than J. Edgar might have required, and soon he and his girlfriend are on the run from agents Jai Courtney and Anthony Ramos who have other plans for his loot. It's a fairly bog-standard action adventure with little in the way of jeopardy - of course Neeson is an ex-Marine with loads of ninja skills that actually make you wonder just how many ordinary American citizens have a better military training than those who actually wear an uniform! Courtney always seems to appear to have been poured into his clothes, and whilst easy enough on the eye he is a terrible actor and his conscious-troubled sidekick Ramos adds little to this either. I still quite enjoyed it - just don't ask me what it was all about next month.",Honest Thief
9,zardoz-13,Neeson At His Most Charismatic,5,27 October 2020,"The contemporary Liam Neeson crime thriller ""Honest Thief"" lives up to its oxymoronic title. As the protagonist, Neeson plays Tom Dolan, a resourceful but sympathetic bank robber who pulled a hitch in the Marine Corps as a demolition expert. One day, quite by accident, Dolan discovers the lady of this dreams and later decides to turn himself in for his crimes. He cannot marry Annie (Kate Walsh of ""Legion"") with a guilty conscience and lie to her about his past, so he contacts the FBI. Nicknamed the ""In and Out Bandit,"" Dolan has amassed $9 million in currency from twelve banks that he knocked over in seven states. Mind you, Dolan expects to draw jail time. Nevertheless, he hopes he can cut a deal with federal prosecutors for a reduced sentence. Furthermore, he prefers to do his time in a facility near his future wife, so she can pay him regular visits.Clearly, Dolan approaches the proposition of negotiating such a saccharine deal with outlandish optimism. Indeed, this makes Neeson's morally compromised hero seem commendably honorable in an era when honor gets little respect. Dolan wants to do the right thing. Meanwhile, Annie believes and supports him 100 percent. She knows what Dolan has done but stands by him, even when her own life hangs in jeopardy. Incidentally, no spring chicken herself, Annie has weathered her own stormy divorce. Dolan has seen a lot of tragedy in his life and witnessed first-hand some illegal monetary skullduggery. His father lost a pension through no fault of his own when an unscrupulous CEO looted the company fund and prompted his dad to commit suicide. This skullduggery induced Dolan to utilize his special set of skills to loot the CEO's bank account where he had stashed the stolen money.
Essentially, ""Honest Thief"" is a tolerable but pedestrian character-driven drama about an amiable crook, and Liam Neeson radiates charisma galore. Incidentally, Dolan abhors the ""In and Out Bandit"" moniker. After offering to return the loot and face prosecution, Dolan tangles with two young, unethical FBI agents. They plan to discredit his story and then secretly confiscate his millions for their personal use. Happily, Dolan has prepared himself for just such a contingency, and it takes him about 75 minutes in terms of movie time to turn the tables on these greedy FBI agents, keep himself and Annie alive, and arrange a legitimate deal with the Bureau. ""Suicide Squad"" actor Jai Courtney is cast as rapacious FBI agent John Nivens, while Anthony Ramos of ""Hamilton"" plays Agent Hall. Comparatively, Nivens is single, while Hall has a wife and two newborn sons. Their FBI superior has ordered them to verify Dolan's claim about being the ""In and Out Bandit.""Meantime, several crackpots have tried to confess to Dolan's crimes, but the Bureau never found sufficient evidence to verify those claims. When Nivens and Hall ask him for incriminating evidence to confirm his identity, Dolan explains his bank robbery methods. First, he robs banks only during holiday weekends when everybody has Monday off. Second, the building next door to the bank must be vacant. Entering through this empty building, Dolan breaks into the bank, deploys his equipment to drill into the safe. Sometimes, he has to use small amounts of explosives to open stubborn safes. After he cleans out the vault, Dolan tidies up after himself and leaves the fewest clues about his presence. Ultimately, he hands Agent Nivens his storage unit key and assures them, they will find $3 million in banknotes. Unfortunately, Dolan's best-laid plans go awry. Nivens plans to steal the $3 million. Initially, Hall refuses to act as an accomplice. Nevertheless, Nivens convinces his partner he would be throwing away the opportunity of a lifetime to provide for the future of his family.Best known for writing Ben Affleck's provocative bullet-riddled thriller ""The Accountant"" (2016) and executive producing Netflix's cartel series ""Ozark,"" ""Family Man"" director Mark Williams sticks to procedural basics. He doesn't clutter up the largely straightforward action with frivolous subplots and characters. Everybody comes with some form of motivation that puts them either on the right or the wrong side of the law. Williams doesn't let the romance between Tom and Annie interfere with the action, except when the villains recognize Annie as a bargaining chip in their negotiations. Characterization is kept to a bare minimum. The only extraneous element that isn't developed either for comic relief or dramatic revelations is the adorable dog that good guy FBI agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan of ""Shot Caller"") carries around with him. No, this cute, little pooch neither urinates in Meyer's agency car nor latches onto Dolan's ankle during a sudden plot twist.
Meantime, Williams relies on every cliché you can imagine to keep the characters vaulting over obstacles. Literally, you can guess everything that unfolds in ""Honest Thief"" before either co-scenarist Steve Allrich of ""The Timber"" or Williams set it up and pull it off. Just as there are two corrupt FBI agents, two incorruptible FBI agents have their eyes on their devious colleagues. ""Terminator 2"" star Robert Patrick plays Agent Sam Baker who assigned Nivens and Hall to Dolan's case. The other straight-arrow agent is Meyers. He has survived his own divorce and wound up with his ex-wife's dog instead of his house. He investigates Nivens and Hall after Baker's murder. The suspicious Meyers doesn't understand why Nivens and Hall have implicated Dolan for Baker's murder when Dolan had contacted Baker initially to give himself up. Inevitably, Meyers and Dolan run afoul of each other, and Dolan delivers irrefutable proof that Nivens and Hall have framed him for Baker's murder.The gritty on-location lensing in Massachusetts creates a palatable sense of atmosphere and urgency, and the strong cast gives this formulaic fodder a modicum of credibility. ""Honest Thief"" amounts to a polished looking potboiler. Compared with Neeson's previous outing, the exciting and suspenseful ""Cold Pursuit,"" ""Honest Thief"" qualifies as a low stakes crime thriller with nominal surprises.",Honest Thief
10,Wizard-8,"Honestly, it isn't that good",4,27 March 2021,"I'm a bit perplexed as to why someone like Liam Neeson would agree to do a movie like this. Granted, someone who is his age (nearly 70) would find it harder than your typical male movie star to be chosen for plum roles, so it's possible that this was the best project available for him at the time... which makes you wonder about the quality of the other projects that were being offered to him at the time this screenplay fell on his lap. Anyway, the movie is a disappointment, mainly because it is extremely predictable. You'll be one (or more) steps ahead of the characters at every point in the movie, because you'll have seen the various plot terms in many other movies before. Making matters worse is that some of the plot turns (mainly in the last 30 minutes) are either downright stupid or not properly explained. The movie may have worked had it been directed in a gritty or pulse-pounding fashion, but instead the story unfolds in a really slow and leisurely manner; you never think that anyone is in danger. Some viewers may also object that the movie was obviously done on more of a limited budget than usual, often making it look like a straight to DVD ""B"" movie. I don't object to low budgets and predictable plotting as long as a movie compensates in other areas - some straight to DVD ""B"" movies manage to do this so that I end up enjoying them a lot despite any shortcomings - but even while I admit that I was not bored at any moment watching this movie, I really can't see this movie offering enough to any particular viewer, save for die hard fans who want to see their now senior citizen-aged idol still managing to find work.",Honest Thief
11,bombersflyup,Not worthwhile.,3,8 December 2020,"Had low expectations coming into Honest Thief, but it was still a disappointment.It's ludicrous, unnecessary and unconvincing, with one of the stupidest premises of all time. I don't even buy Liam Neeson being a bank thief at this point, not unless he's doing it to help someone. Tom says he did it because his father got screwed over and it provided a thrill, but he didn't even spend any. I also don't buy this romance or how they got together. The FBI agent and his new companion are more compelling. Why does Jai Courtney keep getting roles, he's awful.",Honest Thief
12,deloudelouvain,With Neeson you know what you get so don't expect to be surprised.,7,1 January 2021,"The positive thing about movies with Liam Neeson is that you know exactly what you're going to get, no surprises as the plot is basically the same everytime. The negative thing about movies with Liam Neeson is the same, you know exactly what is going to happen, no surprises as the plot is basically the same everytime. Now if you like that kind of mindless action movies you will like this one again. Neeson wants to be a citizen model, somebody pisses him off, he gets angry and payback is the only solution. Every movie is like that so it's not even spoiling unless you never heard of Neeson or watched a movie with him. I like it, so no complains from me. Sometimes you just need an easy action movie and this one is another perfect example for that. Good images, decent action and actors that know what they're doing, what else can we ask for?",Honest Thief

15,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Standard action flick to switch off to,4,15 February 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningTom Dolan (Liam Neeson) is a master thief, who's evaded capture for quite a while. He meets Annie (Kate Walsh) at a storage depot centre, falls in love and vows to start a new life with her, without informing her of his past. He reveals where his ill gotten gains are, and Agents Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Hall (Anthony Ramos) are sent to collect them, only for Agent Baker (Robert Patrick) to wind up dead, Dolan fingered as the suspect and him and Annie find themselves plunged in to a desperate race for survival.Consider Liam Neeson. A former Academy Award nominee, for his stirring, unforgettable performance as Oskar Schindler in 1993's Schindler's List. A fine dramatic thespian, capable of delivering in any format or genre. Yet, in the Autumn of his life and career, after becoming a cult figure in the nonsensical, overrated Taken, his name has become attached to a string of off cut, similar takes on that film, of the sort that would be heading straight to DVD for a name with any less star power, and which this effort, from A Family Man director Mark Williams, is the latest.It doesn't even pretend to be anything other than the formulaic, predictable time waster that it is, ticking off every cliche as it goes along, in as generic a fashion as possible. There's a little bit of social commentary, when Neeson reveals his motivation to his beleaguered other half for his life of crime, hence his framing as an 'honest thief' in contrast to the bank he ripped off on his first job, but other than that, there's pretty much nothing to set it apart.If you want something undemanding to doze off to, it'll do fine, but no better or worse than the half dozen other such low rent titles lying around. How an actor of Neeson's stature became associated with such mundanity is beyond me. **",Honest Thief
16,The-Sarkologist,Another Neeson Film,6,19 November 2020,"Okay, he is another film where Liam Neeson doesn't kill anybody, but then again that is probably something to do with his character, namely that he has met this really nice woman so he has decided that he will give up his life of crime and go straight. Yeah, he's a bank robber, but one that sneaks in, blows the safe, takes all the money, and then leaves without anybody knowing that he was there. However, because he has met this really nice woman, he realises that it is time to go straight and decides to hand himself in.Well, that's actually the problem because it seems like he isn't the only person who is trying to claim to be this particular bandit, and the FBI really doesn't seem to be all that interested in following this lead up, so the guys in charge of the case send it to a couple of underlings to deal with. What ends up happening, when they discover that he's telling the truth, and that he actually has all of the money, they decide to keep it for themselves, and when it looks like they are going to get busted, they basically shoot the agent in charge.This movie was okay, but it really wasn't anything that stood out. Then again, it probably had more to do with it dealing with this FBI agent that decided that he would take some money and run, and then started realising that he had got way over his head, and pretty much had to keep on covering his tracks, and the more he tries to cover his tracks, the deeper the hole he ends up digging for himself.Look, if it was anybody other than Liam Neeson's character, he would have probably gotten away with it, but then again he probably wouldn't have gotten that much money either. However, it sort of does touch on the idea that it is difficult to commit a crime and get away with it, though I guess that is sort of wishful thinking considering that there are a lot of people out there that do seem to get away with some pretty dodgy stuff (the protagonist included, who has pretty much got away with all of his bank robberies, until he decides to turn himself in).There is also a suggestion here about the adrenaline rush that comes about through war, which is one of the reasons why he is a bank robber - it gives him a rush. This is why he also hasn't actually spent any of the money. In fact, he simply leaves it sitting in crates in a storage facility (though where he got all of his other money from is a bit of a mystery, though he does say that he saved up some money from his time in the military).Look, it isn't too bad, and it is something of a touchy feely film as well, but on the other hand, it is sort of average. Still, I liked it though.",Honest Thief
17,cruise01,Decent action thriller,6,17 October 2020,"3 out of 5 stars.Honest Thief is a fair action thriller film about a professional thief Tom (Liam Neeson) who robbed several banks and has several million dollars stored. Until he falls in love and wants to give up his criminal past. By turning himself in. Only for two detectives played by Jai Courtney and Anthony Ramos to set him up by murdering another detective and walking with the stolen money. Tom will have to do whatever it takes to prove his innocence.The plot is nothing special and decent. Kind of feels like almost all Liam Neeson movies with him needing to prove his innocence. It is nonetheless entertaining.The action sequences is okay. Nothing top notch or dull. The script did lacked in story. Besides giving Jeffrey Donovan playing a detective who is left with his ex wifes dog.The acting is tedious with the cast. Jai Courtney playing the bad guy.

In this film, it shows that Liam has aged quite since then as this film isn't nearly as intriguing or clever as intended.

It is rather tame, given its PG-13 rather.There were no twists or turns and everything which was presented to us was obvious and predictable.

23,paul-allaer,Okay (but just okay) action-thriller starring Liam Neeson,5,8 December 2020,"""Honest Thief"" (2020 release; 99 min.) brings the story of Tom. As the movie opens, Tom is seen robbing a Boston bank by blowing up the bank's massive vault. Afterwards Tom goes to a self-storage outfit to rent a unit, where he meets Annie and the chemistry is immediate and obvious. We then swith to ""One Year Later"", as Tom and Annie are eyeing a house to movie into in suburban Boston. In a parallel story line, we get to know a couple of FBI Special Agents. In a bold move, Tom decides to turn himself in to come clean with his past as the ""In-and-Out Bandit"" once and for all... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second film from director and co-writer Mark Williams. Here he brings the all too familiar tale of a bank robber wanting to make amends for his past actions. The opening scene of the film immediately reminded me of Michael Mann's excellent 1981 film ""Thief"" (starrning James Caan), and I thought we might be in for a similar experience. Alas, it was not the case. Instead, we get latter-day action movie superstar Liam Neeson doing his umpteenth ""I must prove my innocence"" routine. And yet, per the usual, Neeson has a certain charm about him. Neeson, who is now a crisp 68 yrs. young, could do this role in his sleep, but he still manages to put some vigor into it. The same cannot be said about some of the other supporting cast. ""Dirty"" FBI agent Nivens, played by Jai Courney, is about as subtle and sophisticated as a bull in a China shop. Tom's romantic interest Annie is played aptly by Kate Walsh. The biggest problem is that everything we see and experience in this film has been done before, and done better. Apart from Michael Mann's ""Thief"", the otehr film that came to mind is Benn Affleck's directing debut ""This Town"" (and not just because it is also set in Boston). ""Honest Thief"" is just nowhere near as good. The action scenes are, like eveything else in this fim, okay but just okay. Nothing that will have you at the egde of your seat. Does this make it a 'bad' fim? No, it doesn't. It entertains, bit it does it in a predictable and familiar way, and the film benefits generously from Liam Neeson's always chariming performance.The release of ""Honest Thief"" was repeatedtly delayed resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. It finally started playing in theaters in mid-October. Since then, the coronavirus has gotten worse, much worse, and all ""big"" studio releases (including the new James Bond and other such blockbusters) have been pushed back indefinitely. In this dearth of new studio releases, ""Honest Thief"" continues to play in theaters, now almost 2 months later. The Monday evening screening where I saw this at this week was attended by exactly 5 people, including myself, which sadly is better than average in my experience of seeing movies in the theater the last 3 months or so. If you are in the mood for a mindless action-thriller that is okay ut just okay or are simply a fan of Liam Neeson the action movie superstar, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Honest Thief

This is a Liam Neeson action movie that is not quite as good as the Taken movies but it will do in a pinch-given the cinematic choices we have at the moment. Liam plays a former Marine turned experienced bank robber-he has never been caught-that has acquired $9 million and the nick name, 'The In_And_Out_Bandit'. But for some reason, he is just not happy-I think I would find a way to make myself happy for $9 million. That is, until he meets Kate. Liam decides that it is time to make a clean slate of his life and calls the FBI to make a deal for a reduced sentence in exchange for returning the money-he hasn't spent a penny of it. He just wants to settle down with Kate and forget about his past. Jeffrey & Jai are 2 of the FBI agents involved in the money return and one of them decides to double cross Liam and just take the money. And, as you know, Liam does not like it when you take something from him.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.

31,robfollower,Honest Thief(2020),7,30 May 2021,"In separating itself - or at least attempting to - from other ""Liam Neeson punches people"" movies, Honest Thief uses a snarky, even cynical tone. Neeson plays a former bank robber trying to turn himself in, but keeps being thwarted by uncaring, totally indifferent FBI agents. They assume it's a hoax.Then things take a serious turn. Innocent victims end up dead. There's a varied morality play underneath a typical, played-to-type action thriller: A corrupt FBI goon on the bottom, Neeson somewhere in the middle, and the greater federal hierarchy turned to heroes. Honest Thief carefully balances itself, challenging acceptable behavior, and choosing to ignore the concept of a perfect hero. At each tier, there are flawed choices and personalities.Neeson's ex-Marine justifies his past actions. While retired (and in love), he only broke into banks because his father's end came because of greedy CEOs. It's almost a modern Robin Hood, except Neeson never did anything with the money; he just kept it to make sure those undeserving didn't have access. Honest Thief finds empathy in those actions, this while Neeson chases down others willing to kill for a quick getaway.The character complexity, insofar as such a movie is complex, gives Honest Thief momentum. In the back half, energy derives from shootouts and car chases, competently done, if unremarkable. What matters is whether Neeson can make right, determined to out those who wronged him because they choose crime to benefit only themselves. Neeson sees this as safe-cracking social justice for all. That gives the gunplay stakes beyond good/evil colliding.While Honest Thief isn't inherently memorable, the 90-minute blitz entertains in the moment. Nicely contained, there's no sequel or franchise due in the future; Honest Thief completes these characters in full, their futures known, their decisions reasonable. Consider this movie-going comfort food without the caloric downside.",Honest Thief
32,alindsay-al,A Poor film that has been seen plenty of times before,3,21 December 2020,"With the cinemas finally reopening in the UK it means some films that came out around October are now being shown and Honest Thief is one of those and I saw it today so here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a former Bank robber attempt to turn himself in, when he is caught up in a plot involving the police department.Main Character
Liam Neeson plays the main character here and I mean what is there to say other then that ever since he played Brian Mills in the first Taken he has been doing this role and he could do it in his sleep. He is functional and will always have a paycheck but there is nothing new or exciting here, he phones it in and does the minimum which is good enough for only an okay character.Supporting Characters
Kate Walsh plays his love interest and I thought they actually had pretty decent and likeable chemistry together, I mean her character has nothing too her but I thought she did a fine job with what she was given. Jai Courtenay is an actor who has an interesting career and I actually think he does a decent job here, he is an egotistical bad guy but he plays it pretty well and he is a guy you just won't like which means he is playing the role well. But the rest of the cast offer nothing, the great Robert Patrick is completely wasted and given nothing to so which makes you wonder why even bother getting him here for this role. Jeffery Donovan plays a cop and this guy was laughably bad, he is such a cliché and just does nothing here for anybody to care about, not even his mum.Story
The story though did very little for me, there is not a unique and new bone in this film's body and it needs to be called out for that. I didn't really believe in Neeson's character and his backstory and the film does nothing to interest you and make you care. The motivations are paper thin and despite some decent performances it is hampered by a weak plot and one that ends with pretty much no resolution to it.Script
The script is also very generic and does nothing to it and is probably the biggest thing to blame for the lack of interest given to this film. Again the actors do a better job with pretty poor material and similar to Neeson the people writing these films have an easy job and don't do anything to try and innovate and become interesting.Style
The film has some decent action sequences and chase scenes that at least kept my attention for a little bit more then the rest of the film but there isn't enough. This is a criticism I have with quite a few of these films of Neeson that it takes way too long to actually get to the action and takes ages to build and by the time you get to the action you just don't care.Overall
Overall, this is a poor lazy film that will rank low on these Neeson action films for sure. Unless you are a die hard fan of Liam Neeson avoid this film and do something else for 90 mins.",Honest Thief
33,henry8-3,Honest Thief,3,13 May 2021,"Neeson plays a successful bank robber who, after falling in love and wishing to settle down, decides to turn himself in for a reduced sentence. The 2 cops assigned to him are though corrupt, steal the money and frame Neeson for murder. He has to then prove his innocence.Whilst this is a perfectly adequately made thriller and Neeson is always good company, this has a plot and script so derivative of hundreds of other such thrillers - bad guy turned good, a good cop who'll listen, an understanding girlfriend (?) and the 2 bad cops are just cliched and completely unbelievable.

36,kirbylee70-599-526179,CRIMINAL CORRUPTION,8,19 April 2021,"Liam Neeson has had an interesting career. Where most actors go from action films to more dramatic roles he's taken the opposite path. Early on he was in THE BOUNTY, SUSPECT and SCHINDLER'S LIST. Then in 2008 he made TAKEN. That was followed by two sequels. From there most of his movies have been action adventure films. That holds true with his latest effort HONEST THIEF.Neeson plays Tom Dolan, a professional bank thief with the nickname the ""In-and-Out Bandit"" because of the stealth with which he's been able to rob a number of banks without leaving a clue behind. One day he walks into a storage facility to rent one and meets the manager, Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh). A year passes and he realizes she means something more to him. He buys a house for the two of them but before he can move in with her he needs to set things straight. He needs to atone for his past deeds.Dolan contacts the FBI and reaches Agent Samuel Baker (Robert Patrick) and his right hand man Agent Sean Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan). He tells them he is the bank thief they've been looking for and wants to turn himself in under certain conditions. The two agents having been inundated with numerous people confessing blow it off and Baker passes the job of interviewing him off to two lower agents, Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Hall (Anthony Ramos).The pair show up to the hotel room Dolan is in, talk to him and then cuff him there after he gives them the key to his storage locker. At first they find nothing but then find a duffel bag filled with money. Rather than turn it in Nivens suggest that they take the money for themselves. At first disagreeing with his partner Hall eventually comes around. As the pack the bad into their car, Annie walks out and talks to them. They tell her they're friends with Tom and leave.Once back at the hotel Nivens doesn't want any witnesses and plans on killing Dolan. Dolan tells him that this was only $3 million of his stolen cash and another $9 million is still out here. Before they can do anything Agent Baker shows up. Nivens kills him using the shooting to frame Dolan but before he can kill him a scuffle ensues and Dolan gets away taking Hall's gun with him by tackling Nivens and the two falling out of the window. Nivens is stunned and Dolan runs, bumping into Annie who was coming to see him. The pair barely escape and are now on the run from the two corrupt officers.From here on out the movie is a series of running and near misses as the pair of corrupt agents frame Dolan and Agent Meyer jumps into the chase to capture the alleged killer of his partner. Several times it seems there is hope for Dolan and Annie but things consistently get in their way. But like the TAKEN films Neeson's character has a certain set of skills that help him avoid the agents and work towards the chance to reclaim his life.At age 68 let's face it, there is definitely a stand in doing Neeson's stunt work here. Yes, he is 68 years old, hard to believe. But he does such a great job of making his characters believable that you never notice nor care. Dolan is a sympathetic character here and when you learn why he stole the money that he did you feel even more for him. Walsh is most familiar to people from the series GREY'S ANATOMY but she holds her own with Neeson not so much a female in peril as a woman in love and trying to help. Courtney makes the perfect villain and has done so before. Ramos is great as the agent with his conscience nagging at him. And Donovan is solid here which makes you wonder why we don't see more of him.The end result that we have here is a movie that offers a solid story with plenty of action that fans of Neeson and those unfamiliar with him will certainly enjoy. There is plenty to keep you on the edge of your seat and enough of a love story to pull the heartstrings at the same time. I don't know how long Neeson can keep up roles like this but as long as he does I for one will be watching.",Honest Thief

39,kluseba,Typecast but still convincing,8,12 October 2020,"As soon as I learned that my city would be locked down again and that arenas, bars, museums, restaurants, theatres and similar places would close for several weeks, I went to the cinema to enjoy watching some new movies for the last time in quite a while. The first film I gave a try was Honest Thief and I certainly don't regret my choice. This emotional, pacey and suspenseful drama stars excellent actors like Jai Courtney, Jeffrey Donovan and obviously Liam Neeson. The story revolves around a thief who wants to come clean and give back all the money he has stolen to serve a reduced prison sentence and then marry the woman of his dreams. He calls the Federal Bureau of Investigation that sends two rookies who are doubtful at first. When the thief shows them a third of the money, one of the investigators sees this opportunity as a chance to get rich and convinces his nervous partner to follow his plan through. Just as they are about to murder the honest thief and make the money disappear, their superior shows up and gets shot in an escalating confrontation. The thief knocks out the two investigators and manages to flee with his girlfriend. The two investigators predictably accuse the thief of murdering their superior and the fugitive now needs to clear his name while protecting his girlfriend.This movie convinces on numerous levels. The action scenes are short but intense and focus on realistic settings rather than artificial special effects. The story is suspenseful from start to finish. The film has some strong dramatic elements due to the convincing love story. The characters are intriguing with a remorseful thief, a ruthless investigator and his nervous partner and a reliable veteran agent looking for the truth. The movie also includes a few funny scenes such as every moment involving the veteran agent's dog and the memorable car bomb scene.On the negative side, Liam Neeson seems to be typecast for emotional action films and isn't given the occasion to unfold his full potential in this film. The story is predictable and by the numbers and therefore not really memorable.However, the film is produced with care, energy and professionalism that make you forget about the minor flaws as it offers one hour and a half of gripping entertainment. Fans of action films, dramas and even thrillers should enjoy this film alike. Anyone who appreciates Liam Neeson should also admire this movie even though it can't compete with his career highlights such as Cold Pursuit, Schindler's List or Taken. The fact that the veteran actor manages to play an action film so credibly despite being sixty-eight years old certainly deserves attention, recognition and respect as well. Even though Liam Neeson has been typecast for more than a decade now, that isn't a problem as long as the final products remain as convincing as Honest Thief. Enjoy this movie at your local cinema while you still can and support local businesses while doing so.",Honest Thief
40,masonfisk,NEESON STRUGGLES W/PLOT PROBLEMS...!,5,19 January 2021,"Liam Neeson's latest is another in his variation of his Taken persona, this time playing a professional thief who decides to mend his ways after meeting the love of his life, played by Kate Walsh. Being successful in his previous line of work, he has accumulated millions which he decides to return, using the FBI as his middle men, when he contacts a couple of senior agents played by Robert Patrick & Burn Notice's Jeffrey Donovan. Thinking Neeson's claims are ludicrous, they finally send a couple of agents (after Neeson continues to harangue the FBI for not taking him seriously) to seek him out. Arriving at his hotel room's door, two agents, played by Jack Reacher's Jai Courtney & Hamilton's Anthony Ramos, listen to Neeson lay out the circumstances of his turnabout life decision before directing them to a storage unit (the same facility where he met Walsh where she works) to show them the money. All's well but the agents decide to rip off Neeson (& then kill him) but as these kind of movies go Neeson gets the best of them & then goes on the run evading the corrupt agents at every turn & having to fess up to Walsh about the truth of his past. When Courtney finally catches up w/Walsh (she has a thumbnail drive recording of him & Ramos taking Neeson's money out of his unit) he nearly kills her putting her in the hospital. All bets are off as Neeson decides to wage war on the agents (against Donovan's pleas of restraint since his agents' story doesn't add up) setting up a rather flaccid finale. Not a quite a case of a few steps back but more of a lateral, diagonal movement for Neeson's oeuvre while this story is fine & all but a lot of the mechanics of character & plot go on autopilot or assume Neeson is dumber than he really is but if you need a time filler before a better Neeson outing comes along, you can do worse.",Honest Thief
41,aidanratesmovies,"See this one in theaters, Neeson is back",9,17 October 2020,"An entertaining thrill ride through and through, Honest Thief may look like a generic action flick at first glance, but surprisingly- due to Neeson's terrific performance and a decent script, this film actually has some heart. I am not a huge Liam Neeson fan, I have absolutely nothing against him, I have just never been one for his type of movies. Thus, I ended up seeing this flick due to lack of options, and surprisingly I was very amused, and very delighted to see how truly good and charismatic Neeson can be on screen. He's, for lack of better words, a total bada** on screen- and I find his performance as well as several others throughout the film, a large driving force in what makes it so good. Kate Walsh also provides a good performance, as well as Jai Courtney, and Jeffrey Donovan. The action scenes are very well choreographed, none of that shaky cam crap that makes me anxious to even think about, and the cinematography in general is very grounded- which is a nice change of pace for this kind of film. The script certainly has some familiar, or even generic elements to it, but once you continue to follow this story, you truly start to feel for the characters and the situations they are involved in. It isn't just well written do its rounded characters, but it is truly made with passion and heart, which I adore in any film, especially in one with such dire circumstances as this one. In the end, Honest Thief is more than an enjoyable way to spend your time at the movies. Go see it if you can, its at least one of the better films out right now, and please support your local theaters. Luckily my showing of the film had quite a few people in it, theaters really need the help, and may soon go extinct without help, and Liam Neeson seems like a good way as any to help save them

42,AudioFileZ,Another One In A Line of Liam's Standard Character,7,8 January 2021,"First, I think this one is less bombastic than some of the earlier installments of Liam's aged seemingly everyman Terminator. It is a straightforward story with many elements that could be. Liam, always low key under normal circumstances plays it that way also when he shifts into Terminator mode. That's for the better. Sure it's not an imaginative story and is entirely predictable, but it works mostly quite well. An action movie that doesn't insult your intelligence or require constant suspension of belief. Good to see Jeffrey Donovan on the big screen in a role that he also plays low key. Thiw iw q 6.5.",Honest Thief
43,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Honest Thief,6,29 December 2020,"""No one knows who I am"". I do. You're Liam Neeson, one of my acting heroes. You love to talk intensely on the phone, you love to move like a 40-year-old, you love to evade the po-po, and you love to punch people in the chest (natch).Anyhow, Neeson stars in 2020's Honest Thief (my latest review). ""Thief"" was released in October and was filmed just outside of Boston (that would be Worcester, MA). In truth, Honest Thief is never boring and moves at a relentless clip. There are car chases, wrongful murders, and an underused Robert Patrick (that stinks).Featuring Neeson, a miscast Kate Walsh, and a nasty antagonist in Jai Courtney (doesn't he always play the creep-o?), ""Thief"" runs a scatterbrained 99 minutes. There are too many side characters, too many revelations, and one annoying dog (don't ask). Neeson's 2015 vehicle Run All Night is similar in scope to ""Thief"". If only the latter measured up.So yeah, Honest Thief is too self-serious with its personas feeling the need to completely explain themselves. Second-time director Mark Williams needed a better editor to sift through this intention-ed mess. Added to that, Jai Courtney (mentioned earlier) plays a psychotic FBI dude who goes off the rails rather quickly. You wonder why the feds would even bother to let this sicko be in the field in the first place.Honest Thief is about a bank robber named Tom Dolan (Neeson). He confesses to the FBI in order to get a reduced sentence. Tom is doing this because he wants to come clean to his loving girlfriend. Here's the kicker: A couple of the FBI agents are dirty and want to collect the bank robber's money amassed over the past few years. We're talking $9 million in cash.""Thief"" is worth a rental but know this: It's basically Neeson reheated leftovers. Liam at 68 can still carry a thriller but you'd like him to carry one that's more ""honest"".",Honest Thief
44,rannynm,"Fast paced, doesn't drag but a big disappointing. Feels like so many other films of its genre",4,22 October 2020,"Honest Thief is the ""average Joe"" of current film releases. It's a movie with very few characteristics that make it stand out from other action/drama. In the film, Tom Carter (Liam Neeson) tries to give up $9 million in stolen money to live an honest life with the woman he loves. But as he attempts to turn himself in, two corrupt Feds, Ramon (Anthony Ramos) and John (Jai Courtney) take advantage of the stolen money. Now he must clear his name for a murder he never committed all in the name of love.I feel like I have watched Honest Thief many times before. Many action/drama films have the same feel to the plot, action and dialogue - and the writing here feels a bit lazy. It is as if Honest Thief cut and pasted elements from cliché lines from classic action films and put them into scenes that were supposed to be suspenseful and dramatic. I have heard the lines ""I am coming for you"" in too many films to count, and the effect of using these lines too much is disappointing.I like that Honest Thief is fast-paced and scenes don't drag out. There are ""good old"" car chases, people being knocked out and being swung around like ragdolls. The use of comedy is sparse and feels thrown in the movie for the sake of comedic relief. Honest Thief is serious in tone so the comedy feels awkward and out of place, especially since there is so little of it.I can usually enjoy any kind of film for what it is, but something rubbed me the wrong way about the character of Annie (Kate Walsh), Tom's wife. Her role, even her designation as a grad student, feels instrumental only for the progression of Tom's character. Tom believes he can turn himself in, delete his past, and that Annie will stay with him even after finding he's a professional bank robber. I am disappointed in the stereotypical and outdated use of women as the motivation for everything a man does -as well as not happy with the lack of female representation here. If we use the Bechdel test for female representation and ask, ""Does the film have two named female characters that talk to each other about something other than men?"" Unfortunately Honest Thief fails this test.This film has action, violence and some strong language. I am able to empathize with Ramon as he struggles about whether to go along with John and steal the money for the future or do what is morally right. Even in Tom's case, as we learn about his motivation for robbing banks, we realize that not everyone is what they seem at surface level and good people can do bad things.I give Honest Thief 2 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 12 to 18.

If you watch the trailer you get the whole gist of the film with no twists. Some good action scenes but our main villain proves to be very one dimensional.

46,vengeance20,Decent Enough Action Film,8,24 October 2020,"Just come back from a screening of this & to be fair it was a good film, interesting story-line & enough action to keep you interested.The film follows a man named Tom Carter who after robbing banks for years decides he wants to turn himself after meeting the love of his life one day at a storage center. Not wanting to live a life with a guilty conscience with his fiance he calls the police & says he'll return the 9 Million Dollars in exchange for a lighter prison sentence. However 2 corrupt police officers are assigned to the case & steal the money from the storage & frame Tom for the murder of another agent they killed themselves. Tom goes on the run while trying to find a way to clear his name & make sure the money doesn't end up in the wrong hands.I found the film to be pretty good, not amazing but pretty good. The story & film moves at a fast pace & there's a couple of fight scenes, car chases & shoot outs. However I felt the film could've more beefed up & had a little more too it, that's my only critiques of this flick. That & the characters could've had more depth to them as their backgrounds etc felt thin to non existent.Overall it's a decent action film. 8/10",Honest Thief

But the story is psychologically moving. A bank robber who had robbed more than a dozen banks in small towns without being ever caught or identified falls in love with a woman he eventually met and turned out to be the his life's love who corresponded fully to his love. He decides then to abandon his illegal behaviour and proposes to the police to give back all thr robbed mony which means several millions of dollars against a deal leading to a no more than a penalty of two prison years. It happened however that he was double crossed by two corrupt police agents who wanted to keep the money for themselves. All the rest of the movie shows the scenes of this plot and the attempts of the ex-robber (Liam Neeson) to fight these corrupt agents and lead a happy love relationship with the woman he loved which he manages in succeding in the end after a lot of intricated episodes good to follow and much entertaining.,Honest Thief
49,arungeorge13,Another watchable actioner in the long list of Liam Neeson actioners! [+50%],5,6 December 2020,"Honest Thief is the standard Liam Neeson actioner with no major takeaways, but easy to sit through. With more than half the film featuring phone calls between Neeson's protagonist and the rest of the cast, the script is threadbare and built on a one-line plot that's predictable from start to finish. Honest Thief never really kicks into the high gear that one might expect it to. And for an action flick, that's something of a bother. While it's difficult to hate Neeson, he has, at this point, turned into this generic action movie character who tracks people down, gets into unimaginative fistfights, and mouths ""you have it coming, my friend"" kinda lines.

Bank robber wants to turn himself in because he's in love. How nauseating. Good cop/bad cops, and I'm guessing there is a big shootout at the end. I'm guessing the Liam makes it out OK so that he can go on to make more 1-star movies.Yet another revenge movie. Isn't revenge a dish better served cold?

52,antoniotierno,Banal,6,24 April 2021,"A Film deal that doesn't exactly meet the customary action requirements, so Carter is pretty quickly double-crossed by corrupt agents, forcing him to go on the run and defend himself. In pursuit are FBI agents harboring different objectives, the most prominent being Agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan), who spending his spare time cooing at his dog, and a pair of younger agents under his supervision. Really too predictable and too filled with cliches. It's an excuse for Neeson to say things like ""I'm comin' for you"" as only he can, and eventually marshal his thieving/safecracking talents against those pursuing him. Barely decent but nothing more.",Honest Thief
53,Prashast_Singh,An easily enjoyable action flick if you're a Liam Neeson fan.,10,30 December 2020,"I don't need to repeat myself but I've always been a huge fan of Liam Neeson's action movies. It's really good to see him play these similar yet intriguing action roles even at this age with brilliance. Honest Thief is no different; he's back again with his ""particular set of skills"" and you know that already. There's plenty of exciting action to keep you engaged, and by weaving the plot entirely around those set pieces, the makers have made a simple, maybe routine but still an easily enjoyable action flick that won't bore you for a second. Also having some resonant emotional undercurrents, it's undoubtedly a treat for fans of Neeson and the genre. I personally found the 90 minutes flying by real quick. It ends up succeeding in doing what most movies are meant to do: to immerse you in the ride and make you forget all your worries. Go ahead, give it a watch if any of the aforementioned positives tick all the boxes for you.",Honest Thief
54,NijazBaBs,"too amateur, but honest and real",5,25 October 2020,"Neither good nor bad. I liked it at least for it's honesty, showing us how people are in real life, thier jobs, relationships, behaviors. Although nothing special, it looks like honest real life events. But bad is that the movie is too amateur, meaning amateur graphics and events. Nothing special or extreme to see, so much that it is boring. I expected, not more unreal or extreme stuff, but more mystery, details, science. The science and intro part are not deep or detailed enough. Emotions are too shallow too. Movie can't be compared to some of Liam's best movies like Taken or Non-Stop. Neutral rating.",Honest Thief
55,IonicBreezeMachine,"Like the Neeson's character, Honest Thief is quick, clean, and precise.",6,1 January 2021,"Tom Dolan (Liam Neeson) is a former IED specialist turned career thief known by law enforcement and the media as the ""In and Out Bandit"". After years of doing precision jobs across the united states, a chance encounter with storage unit manager/graduate student Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh) leads a romance between the two. After a year together Dolan wants a chance at a normal honest life and arranges to turn himself and his stolen $9 Million to the FBI. However when corrupt agents Nivens and Hall (Jai Courtney and Anthony Ramos respectively) decide to keep the money and frame Dolan for the murder of another agent (Robert Patrick), Dolan must find a way to clear his name and protect his girlfriend.Directed by Mark Williams (Creator of Netflix's Ozark) and co-written by Williams and Steve Allrich, Honest Thief marks yet another action thriller in Neeson's post Taken filmography an like others it doesn't break any new ground, but it's an effective and engaging thriller that elevates itself with some good supporting work and nice chemistry between Walsh and Neeson.The movie's filled with charming exchanges between the cast in the first act as Walsh and Neeson have some really nice scenes and are believable as a couple. Equally good are exchanges between Robert Patrick and Jeffrey Donovan as the FBI agents Dolan initially corresponds with as they have some entertaining banter and are genuinely likable. The movie also takes a different approach to Neeson's action persona as in Honest Thief he only uses a firearm once and more often than not must rely on his cunning and technical expertise to get him through scrapes.Other elements of the movie are more mixed. Jai Courtney has shown himself he can be an engaging presence such as his performance as Captain Boomerang in Suicide Squad, but unfortunately Courtney is once again relegated to an unengaging villain presence playing the corrupt agent chasing Neeson. He's not all that intimidating or memorable and in comparison to the rest of the cast isn't developed nearly enough. Anthony Ramos is slightly more developed, but even with his added character he's still lacking in terms of being a compelling antagonist. In many ways Honest Thief feels at odds with the action elements in the second half of the story. There are some good moments and characters in the movie, but the action elements are very standard. The action isn't bad by any means but it just feels like it's there for the sake of being there. Honest Thief probably would've worked better as a love story/ character based affair with some humorous elements rather than the action thriller that it is.Honest Thief is a serviceable and engaging thriller thanks a talented cast and tight direction from Mark Williams. While the movie lacks an engaging villain, the movie has sincerity to it that makes it an enjoyable sit for fans of the genre.",Honest Thief

They try to kill Walsh, Annie, and Neesom. Jeff Donovan FBI gets the scoop and puts everything right. Mark Williams wrote this and directed. I cannot believe Neeson is so strong and handsome at 68. Go Neesom!Of course when Annie saw two strangers taking boxes out of Neesom's storage a red flag should have gone up. Still the plot works well and an honest thief who had stolen 9 million could fall in love and give it all to the FBI. More believable is the FBI taking the stolen money and killing for more.",Honest Thief

58,bob-the-movie-man,Honest Thief proves that unpredictability is highly overrated,6,3 December 2020,"As discussed in my One Mann's Movies review of ""Cold Pursuit"", Liam Neeson has had a rather rocky PR road of late. But - unlike Kevin Spacey - he is clearly not being put on the naughty step by Hollywood, since he is filming/announced for five other features at the time of writing. His latest release - ""Honest Thief"" - has Mark Williams directing and co-writing (with Steve Allrich), and sees Neeson back on VERY familiar territory in an exciting and sometimes violent thriller.The nice concept behind the story sees Tom (Liam Neeson) as a hugely successful bank robber meeting the love of his life in Annie (Kate Walsh) and committing to jack it all in for love. Furthermore, not wishing to have to live with the deception and guilt of his hidden life, he determines to hand himself over to the FBI, along with the $9 million stolen cash, in return for a lenient sentence.There's a problem though: he's about the fifteenth person calling the FBI claiming to be the ""In and Out burgler"", so no-one wants to take him seriously. Boston area chief Sam Baker (Robert Patrick - the ""Terminator"" cop!) and his deputy Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan) casually put it on the ""to-do"" pile of agents Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Hall (Anthony Ramos).The best laid plans run off the rails in a big way though when Nivens and Hall investigate and find that Tom is the real deal.The concept here works nicely for a thriller, but the rest of the script is so formulaic that it's fairly and squarely a 'park your brain in the foyer' movie. For several of the actions and motives going on here, suspension of disbelief was required . Even given the limited competition in 2020, the script is in no way going to trouble the Academy.All that being said, Mark Williams has put together a tight and well-executed movie, not outstaying its welcome at only 99 minutes long. Even with the 15 year age difference, Neeson and Walsh make a believable couple (given that Neeson looks pretty good for his 68 years) and the chemistry between them is great. And for a pretty 'small' movie, the supporting cast is pretty impressive.Another standout for me was the cinematography by Shelly Johnson (whose had a busy year with the latest ""Bill and Ted"" and ""Greyhound"" under his belt). Boston - always a great movie location - looks spectacular, and the framing of the car chase action impressed me.For me, there was only one really dodgy element of the movie: the special effects used in a house explosion/fire. The budget clearly didn't stretch to using practical effects! More work on Adobe ""After Effects"" (or similar) was required here!Is Honest Thief worth seeing? - My expectations for this movie were pretty low. But I'm pleased to say that they were exceeded. Is it a masterpiece? No. Will I readily remember much about it in six month's time? No. But in rather a desert of new releases, this one was at least entertaining and I think it's worth the ticket price for a long overdue night out at the flicks. I'm willing to guess that my feelings were partially influenced by the sheer joy of being back in a cinema again... so I will temper my rating perhaps by a star here.(For the full graphical review, please check out bob-the-movie-man on the web or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)",Honest Thief
59,Sir_AmirSyarif,"Another variation of Liam Neeson's ""I will look for you, I will find you, I will kill you"" movies",6,28 March 2021,"Liam Neeson's latest action flick, 'Honest Thief' directed by Mark Williams, serves as a decent entertainment with enough action to be mindlessly fun but a plot that is nearly indistinguishable from anything else the actor has done. Neeson, as usual, is a reliable action hero but most of the talented performers in the ensemble, like Robert Patrick, Kate Walsh, and Jeffrey Donovan, are massively underused. Passable.",Honest Thief
60,RonellSowes,"No skill,no logic and no entertainment",2,2 January 2021,"Remember when Liam Neeson acted in a variety of roles in quality movies ? Well those days ended long ago with Taken. Now that's not to disparage Taken,which is an above average action flick,or Neeson as an action star because he's pretty good at these roles. However,since 2008 he's only done similar action films,ranging from mediocre to atrocious as in Honest Thief.It's hard to tell if this film did anything right at all. Aside from Liam Neeson the cast is very replaceable,the director is only noteworthy because of his ineptitude and those writers !(it takes two minds to come up with something like-this one being our fabulous director). You might be able to look pass the terrible dialouge if the action was entertaining or there was some hint of logic present or we didn't have to deal with all the romantic storyline and justifiable reasoning to his actions and all that 'character' stuff. But all of it ? That is something I cannot forgive.So if you are a fan of Liam Neeson and are willing to overlook some appalling filmmaking,lack of any verisimilitude and everything that a picture doesn't need...then I suppose Honest Thief is for you.",Honest Thief
61,vampire_hounddog,"It even has a ""I will find you, and I will kill you"" moment.",6,15 December 2020,"A slick thief (Liam Neeson) has been robbing safes for years in the Boston area and has become known as the 'In-out bandit'. He decides to go straight and hand himself in and give all the loot back after he meets and falls in love with a woman (Kate Walsh) who runs the lock-up where he keeps his loot. He calls the FBI and a couple of crooked agents (Jai Courtenay and Anthony Ramos) who decide to keep the money for themselves and set him up, putting him and his gal in danger, but he goes to ground and after them.Another standard TAKEN type of action film for Neeson following the likes of UNKNOWN (2011), RUN ALL NIGHT (2014), THE COMMUTER (2018), as well as two TAKEN sequels. It is slickly enough made to get away with it, but also feels a bit cut and paste from those previous films. As such it provides some reliable and exciting action and enough violence to be a guilty pleasure. However, the central relationship doesn't have enough chemistry to be convincing, despite a decent performance from Walsh.",Honest Thief
62,kjproulx,"A Fun, Typical Drama/Action Flick",6,20 October 2020,"Although Liam Neeson is a great actor overall, he seems to take roles like this quite often, regardless of how good or bad the script may be. From Taken to Non-Stop, his string of passable action flicks has actually gotten to be a little much for me. Sure, he's a likeable actor and if a decent director is on board, the movie itself can be fun, but I just want to see him do more films like Widows or Silence. He has incredible range but doesn't choose to show it in films like this. Now playing in theatres, Honest Thief is his latest outing in this genre and just like many of his other films, it's a fun, passable drama/action flick. Here's why it may be worth a watch, but easily skippable in theatres.After spending many years bank robbing and stealing millions of dollars, Tom (Liam Neeson) has decided to live a normal life with his newfound love in Annie (Kate Walsh). Being double-crossed by two officers as he is about to confess and do his time, he is sprung back into action. Needing to both protect himself, his girlfriend, and anyone else who may be in the line of fire, he will stop at nothing to turn himself in, while also taking down who needs to be stopped. Sadly, that description sounds more exciting than the actual film ended up being. There are a few moments of excitement, but Honest Thief is much more of a drama than an action film.I appreciated the fact that director Mark Williams had a very gentle hand in making some emotional scenes, but there were a little too many of them, making the movie as a whole feel slightly too sentimental. The mannerisms of the character of Tom felt like Neeson's performance in Taken, but he is a much calmer character here, which didn't really fit the movie. What I will commend is the fact that I actually bought into the chemistry between Neeson and Walsh, which at least had me caring whether or not they lived or died. Other than these few positives, this movie does drag on its very thin premise. There were many times where I found the movie losing sight of the direction it was going in.I normally don't like to put suggestions for how a film could've been improved in a review, but Tom is a character who had served in the army and never once was there a flashback to those days. Flashbacks are absolutely not necessary to a film by any means, but I found myself wishing I could've appreciated how he was able to accomplish certain things, presently. It's possible that Steve Allrich and Mark Williams' screenplay meant to keep audiences in the dark on certain things, but I feel that the excessive amount of explanatory dialogue in certain scenes was much weaker than if they had shown what he was saying about his past. That's a personal suggestion and nitpick, so many viewers probably won't feel that way, but it's how I was seeing each and every one of the expository scenes.In the end, Honest Thief cares about the core characters and the performances by Neeson and Walsh are both fun to watch. I haven't seen Jeffrey Donovan on the big screen in a while and I particularly liked his portrayal as one of the officers. His character added a needed layer of depth to the film. There's absolutely nothing memorable about this film in terms of praise or recommendation, but I have to admit that I enjoyed myself in the theatre. It's a fun little drama with a few spurts of action. If that sounds like something you can sit back and enjoy, I say check it out. Just know that it's nothing that's worth writing home about.",Honest Thief

Well you have to really suspend belief on this one. No chemistry at all between him and Annie( felt more like a daughter). The FBI is full of idiots. They don't want to look into his confession even tho he has names of banks dates and tells them exactly how. The movie would have been over in 15 minutes had he sent the FBI to the body and told them about the corrupt officers but no he instead runs. Just the same mindless stuff Hollywood's been churning out forever( hence why I mostly watch UK stuff). Liam did his best( why liam did you take this role?) But he could not save it.

I was in a bad mood prior to sitting down to Honest Thief - and now feel way better.This had characters to root for and a villain to truly hate. It was surprisingly quite heartwarming - an element which would make it a good film to watch with your significant other (particularly if they don't typically like action).The backstory behind Liam Neeson's ""Tom Carter"" character was really good. I also didn't expect to laugh as much as I did. Some car chases, explosions and shoot-outs keep the film moving fast. The romantic storyline added a big heart to proceedings.I truly feel I watched a different film to some. Honest Thief was enjoyable escapism at its very best and made me smile when I otherwise hadn't been.Special mention goes to the FBI agent's adorable dog, Tazzie.Highly recommend to Neeson fans.",Honest Thief
67,apryla-58795,I would rather listen to Liam Neeson read a telephone book than see another movie like this,5,27 May 2021,"LN plays a retired ex marine who starts robbing banks due to an event that happened with his Dad many years ago. He meets KW and decides he wants to go ""straight"" however in order to come clean he feels he must turn himself in to the FBI. He knows he will do time but he wants to broker a deal. They don't believe him but send two FBI dudes to check out his story to cover their bases. He gives them keys to his storage unit to prove he stole the money. They go to check it out - see that he is for real and then make the decision to steal the money. They go back to see LN to kill him but ""Terminator Dude"" arrives while this is happening and the one FBI agent shoots and kills him. LN gets into a fight with the agents and manages to get away BUT now he knows he will be blamed for everything so he decides to clear his name...things get ridiculous...the end.Bad is a relative term...someone might think that Lifetime movies are great...BUT I think they're terrible. Same type of thing applies here - I have seen some bad films in my life and this doesn't come close to being bad in comparison. I think the reason reviewers are rating this so low is because they are comparing it to other Liam Neeson films. Let's be ""honest"" his action films aren't Oscar worthy to begin with - they aren't meant to get too deep. So saying this is bad is subjective.Liam Neeson is an excellent actor and so watchable - he is capable of doing better quality films but I guess once they started backing up dump trucks full of money to his house he chose to take the money rather than choose films of a higher caliber. And c'mon even if the films aren't great HE is the main star and that's the goal for most actors. I can't fault him but I hate to see him become a punchline because he really does have incredible talent. Just watch Rob Roy, Michael Collins, Schindler's List etc...the man has an impressive body of work. He's pushing 70 and still churning out these action films - that's impressive by itself. So although Honest Thief is a misstep it's not due to his failure as an actor - the material was just very poor. SOOOO many things throughout that are just unbelievable and ridiculous.Jeffrey Donovan is a good actor as well but he was reduced to being a very small bit player in this as was ""Terminator Dude"". Kate Walsh was a weird choice for this - she looked more like LN's daughter than a romantic partner.Liam is older now so he moves a bit slower and he did seem to be sleepwalking though this. It's like he KNEW this was poor material so no need to go all in. Anthony Ramos made no impact on this film. I have to say that even though I don't personally care for Jai Courtney - this was his film. He gave a very strong performance.So although I don't feel this is a ""bad"" film I do think it is a very weak film and doesn't hold up well against some of LN's other body of work.This is very forgettable so I would say you could pass on this.

It's an unpretentious action-thriller, nothing more, perfect entertainment for a rainy afternoon. Maybe it starts up a bit slow, and in between the action-scenes there may be a bit too much talking, especially between the honest thief (Liam Neeson) and his love-interest (Kate Walsh). And maybe the premise of an uncatchable bank-robber who doesn't use one single dollar of the 9 millions that he so far has laid his hands on, is a bit far-fetched and unrealistic. As is his motivation for robbing banks anyway, which almost makes him look angelic. But it at least does make for an original story and when the action kicks in, with lots of car-chasing and explosions, it's pretty exciting.Liam Neeson does his usual fine job, and they've adjusted the physical exertions of the fighting-scenes to his age (meanwhile over 65), so it stays believable. I only became a bit weary of his raspy grunting voice, I kept wondering if he deliberately creates this for the supposed effect or if there's something wrong in his throat.

Go down to the station and prove that you're the In & Out Bandit. Then make a deal before you return the money. Would of saved a lot of trouble. Rather than going to the station he calls the FBI and says he wants to confess. Instead of the FBI asking him to come in, they send two agents to meet him at his hotel room. After clearly proving himself to be the theif. Without a legit deal he then sends the agents to grab the money from his storage locker. That made no sense to me. Anyways, the agents find the money and decide to keep it for themselves. I don't know what these agents were thinking but then again this is a Liam Neeson film. The agents then go back to the hotel room and attempt to murder the honest thief. Right before they're about to shoot him, another agent knocks on the door. They let the agent in and then murder him. Super unrealistic but ok. Then Liam Neeson does what Liam Neeson does in every Liam Neeson film. He beats everyone up and gets away. Now here's where I get lost. When the investigating officer asks the agents what happened. They say they walked into the room and the agent was already dead. Did this hotel not have cameras? Did the investigator not care what the suspect looked like? In real life the FBI is definitely asking for surveillance footage. It would of also clearly proved that the agents were in the hotel room at the time of the murder. At this point I'm blown away by how foolish the plot is becoming. I could go on and on how unrealistic this film is. In the end this movie wasn't terrible. It had some good action scenes and Liam Neeson was a total badass as usual.

Well, at least it was not packed of nonsense explosions.Liam Neeson does his best, but he's also almost 70 years old and his movements are slow and not credible at all. How he manages to always prevail against people that are way younger and stronger than him is a mistery. Some fights are too slow and they have tried to avoid physical violence as much as possible, prioritizing car chases or simple uninspired and impossible shootouts. In this movie guns have 30+ bullets in their mag, you almost never see characters reload the pistol. I mean guys we are in 2020, these details shouldn't be overlooked.The romantic storyline perfectly fit in the contest of the movie and is not too invasive. Cast did overall a nice job, really appreciated Liam Neeson, Jai Courtney and Jeffrey Donovan performances, they were able to keep the movie afloat. This is one of those movies that you can watch with your family or friends, without paying too much attention, so if you just want to chill this can be a nice choice, but there are for sure better action movies, with better stunts scenes. I don't think that I will watch it again, and it will be soon forgotten.",Honest Thief

Director: Mark Williams
Starring: Liam Neeson, Kate Walsh, Jai Courtney, Jeffrey Donovan, Anthony Ramos,Overall rating 87/100Honest thief is about a former bank robber called Tom (Liam Neeson) who turns himself in to the FBI only for two agents to go rougue and target him for crimes he didn't commit, I really enjoyed and I was entertained from start to finish so let's get started.First of all, the movie had likeable characters, great performances, a charming tone and an interesting concept. The movie had a whole range of likeable easy to connect with characters which was great, they managed to balance the obvious criminal past of the main character but also humanise him and make you connect and understand him which was excellent. The performances were also good, the performances from the villains were slightly campy but they made it work, but Liam Neeson and Kate Walsh were great, they both had instant charm on screen and had good on screen chemistry with each other, the movie also had a very charming tone, the movie despite having it's fun generic action movie moments always at least to me served purpose and the more grounded approach to the character relationships was really charming for me and not usually done with this kind of attention in other movies like this, due to this the whole concept was very interesting especially with the main character and his motivations and actions.My next few positives would be the action, humour and cinematography. The movie had very good and tense action sequences that worked really well in terms of keeping you on the edge of your seat and me genuinely not knowing who was going to make it out alive, the action wasn't constant or overused which for this kind of movie it kept the balance of the heart of the characters but also keeping you entertained, the movie was also surprisingly funny in places. The movie had a lot of running gags that actually worked which is very rare for this kind of movie, but the humour actually added to the story and made it more fun and entertaining to watch instead of bringing the movie down like it does in a lot of action movies similar to this. The movie also had great cinematography and set pieces, the big city landscape was an effective set piece for the scope of the movie as well as the different action sequences and was well explored for a visually pleasing movie as well, with clever shots and great uses of editing.My only few negatives for the movie would be the generic script, how predictable the movie was and it's old fashioned role for the female character. The script was very generic in terms of very similar dialogue to previous action movies like this and there was a lot of corny lines and recycled formulas that bought the movie down just slightly, the movie was also fairly predictable, you could tell what was going to happen most of the time before it happened, despite it still being fun to watch it would have been nice to be more surprised instead of deliberately setting up a characters actions and expecting people to forget about it until it's revealed. I also found that the role for the female character in here was very old fashioned, she was only really a plot device and a character motivation for Liam Neesons character, she never felt like her own character and for me this was very old fashioned and a backwards way of thinking for female roles.My final few positives would be the villains, character depth and ending. I thought they did a very good job with the villains, they actually felt like threats to the characters and their actions made you despise them even more Jai Courtney despite a slightly campy and over the top performance did a good job and I like that they contrasted with Anthony Ramose's character. There was also a good amount of character depth to the main character, I liked how in depth the movie went into explaining the reasoning behind the main character actions, learning why he did the things he did made you connect to his character more and understand why he did the things he did. I also thought the ending was great, the character arcs were satisfying and I loved that we always knew that the main character was going to jail and that wasn't going to change which was more realistic and more of a satisfying ending for the character.Overall despite needing better roles for women and being slightly formulaic, Honest Thief is an entertaining movie from start to finish with a surprising amount of heart and characters to connect with rarely seen in a movie like this.",Honest Thief

83,thebricks,Turn your brain on and this is a 1 star movie,8,16 October 2020,"So, the world's dumbest bank robber, Tom decides one day that to impress a woman he wants to start a new life with, he's going to confess to the FBI and use his money as leverage to work out a deal. He feels guilty about stealing from banks even though it's revealed he did it to seek revenge against a CEO who ripped off his dad's pension. So by confessing, he's essentially giving that evil CEO back his money? Wut? Ok, I know he's just giving it back to the Feds, but still...The Feds don't believe Tom and finally decide to send agents after a few days. They actually think he's insane and search through his storage locker, digging through trash and almost missing the loot until Agent Hall finally finds it in a random box. Agent Nivens gets the bright idea to steal the money, even though they're on record just about everywhere dealing with this guy, on camera everywhere. Clearly the FBI only hires millennials who haven't walked into Best Buy in the last twenty years. Just ludicrous.Clearly now, they were setting everything up for a plot twist with Jeffrey Donovan's character as the newly divorced agent who lost almost everything in the divorce. I'm sure we all kept waiting for the big reveal. Maybe it was supposed to happen in the parking lot at the end when he just lets Tom go for everything. For whatever reason, they resisted the urge to do that, which is refreshing, yet, since this obviously isn't an Oscar award winning drama, they might as well have done that for some excitement. Shame.I actually enjoyed this. I probably won't watch it again, but...it's original! It could have been done better. The potential is there. That's the one upside of the pandemic, big blockbuster films are being delayed and B-movie films like this that are somewhat original are getting a chance. I like it.",Honest Thief
84,gustheaffen,A very stupid plot,2,19 May 2021,They just push these out like James Patterson books to make money and the plots of Liam's movies just get dumber and dumber. Completely unrealistic and ridiculous plot on so many levels. The FBI ignores when you confess to a crime. Then he is supposed to be so smart but makes so many completely stupid decisions. After setting himself up suddenly he is invincible! Waste of time. I enjoyed the dog.,Honest Thief
85,ginocox-206-336968,A weak script made worse by indifferent execution,2,9 December 2020,"Honest Thief (2020) has a few redeeming qualities, but numerous flaws, some of which are merely distracting, while others are fundamental and compounded by other flaws.On the positive side, Liam Neeson seems incapable of delivering a poor performance. Robert Patrick is credible in a minor role and Jeffrey Donovan brings dimension to a role that is underdeveloped in the script. The ""la vengeance est un met que l'on doit manger froid"" twist is well conceived, although indifferently executed.The script is egregious, to put it mildly. The basic concept lacks appeal: A master thief falls in love and decides to come clean and return his ill-gotten lucre, but things go sideways. We all need banks and recognize their importance, but people don't like banks. Bonnie and Clyde, and John Dillinger were celebrated folk heroes. We applaud when the Joker burns pallets of cash stolen from banks. Action movie fans don't want Tom Dolan (Liam Neeson) to give the money back or to be incarcerated for committing perfect crimes. It might be better if he were to repay his debt to society in some creative way of his own design or use the money to expose unethical bank practices; but it's not dramatically satisfying to watch a heroic figure declare himself a scoundrel. Beyond that, the film needs an inciting incident. We need to see that Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh) is a transformative force in Tom's life, and somebody worth the consequences. And we need to see something happen that convinces Tom that honesty is essential in the relationship he envisions with Annie. Instead, we see him brooding in an empty hotel room and making a life-changing decision without consulting Annie.Liam Neeson brings stature and gravitas to every role, from Love, Actually to Ted 2, to the Taken franchise. But most of the characters in Honest Thief, Tom included, struggle to seem even two-dimensional. Annie needs to be somebody truly extraordinary. We're told repeatedly that she is, but we don't see her doing volunteer work at a pediatric oncology ward, or pursuing an intriguing hobby, like restoring antique clocks. She doesn't teach Tom a strategy in Go that he realizes could be used to defeat his current adversaries, or engage in profound discussions. She looks and behaves like a soccer mom. She smiles a lot, recovers from injuries quickly, and is unwaveringly supportive, but she's no Bond girl. Her waist seems fuller than an average girl's bustline. Corrupt cop Nivens (Jai Courtney) seems more doofus than amoral corrupt cop. Compared with Michael Shannon's performance in Premium Rush (2012), the character is a pussycat, albeit
remorseless.The often perfunctory settings give the film a direct-to-video feel. The FBI offices don't seem real. A stock image of a safe with a rectangular door leaves the viewer wondering how the bank managed to get insurance. Police procedures are risible. Characters are given idiosyncrasies but obscure motivations and flat arcs.The creative freedom can result in brilliant works that would never survive the compromises of a committee, as with Citizen Kane, Blazing Saddles, and Inception. But in this case, the writer/director/producer might have benefited from additional creative energies.",Honest Thief
86,Brooklynsmagicmike,"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Definitely one of the weaker Liam Neeson films I've seen.",5,21 December 2020,"When I saw the trailer for this film I got super excited instantly. I'm a huge Liam Neeson fan and catch almost all his movies. However at the conclusion of this film while I thought it was ok in my opinion, I was left dissapointed.First off this film doesn't have alot action in it by any means. So if you're expecting one of his Taken-esque time films you'll be quite surprised. Even in the parts there is some, its uneventful and by the numbers.The acting was average for the most part although I felt Jai Courtney in his role as the antagonist was bit lackluster and cheesy.The pacing of the movie was good and it doesn't feel like a long watch by any means. It did keep me engaged enough to finish the film.Would I watch the movie again? Absolutely not. Would I recommend it? Probably not. But it doesn't make it a horrible watch. I just think at this point I expected more out of a Liam Neeson film.",Honest Thief
87,movieman6-413-929510,Starting director and screenwriter create an entertaining but somewhat simple action thriller.,5,10 October 2020,"Honest Thief is a new action thriller directed, written and produced in part by Mark Williams, the director of A Family Man.In the film, bank robber Tom Carter (Liam Neeson) wants to end his crime career. He does this because he has encountered Annie (Kate Walsh) the love of his life. He doesn't want to risk his relationship with her with lies and dangers from his criminal life. Because of this, he turns himself in to the FBI and promises to return the stolen nine million in exchange for a lesser sentence. Unfortunately for Tom, two corrupt cops are put on his case. They try to cheat Tom and run off with all the stolen money themselves. For example, Tom himself must ensure that the money ends up in the right hands and he must clear his name.The fact that director Mark Williams and his co-script writer Steve Allrich are on the starting side of their film career is reflected in the simple and sometimes somewhat stupid far-fetched actions in their film. Thus the film quickly becomes predictable and somewhat unbelievable. If they had written some events in their film a bit smarter and worked it out better, the film could have been a lot better. There are a few entertaining action scenes in the movie, but these scenes lack real tension.Thanks to the simple script, the cast of the movie doesn't really have much to work with either. Liam Neeson puts the best acting as the lead, because his character is also the most fleshed out in the film. The other characters are not really worked out in the film, so you as a viewer care less about them. Sometimes some of their storylines also end a little messy.",Honest Thief
88,jb_campo,Capable but nothing special flick,6,13 June 2021,"I watched Honest Thief free on Amazon Prime. It's a 2020 film made during a pandemic so perhaps we can use that as an excuse. The film survives because of Liam Neeson's name, but the film falls short on many levels.Neeson plays Tom, an ex-military guy with a background story that eventually gets revealed. He plays a thief who robbed banks and is now in Boston. He meets Annie played by Kate Walsh, who manages a storage place where he stores his loot. The story gets a little hokey. They fall in love apparently, though we don't see much of that. Again, the pandemic probably prohibited them from kissing because no, they didn't kiss once the entire movie, just hugs and I love you's.Neeson wants to make amends for his thievery but turns himself into the FBI who happen to be guys who are not too honest. Then the cat n mouse game begins with car chases and people getting shot and beaten up. That's about it.The plot was pretty thin except for Neeson's background, which finally puts some action into the film late in the game. The acting was pretty stiff - definitely not Neeson's best by far. I liked the hero cop with a dog who is played pretty well and adds some honesty to the cop side. His interaction with Neeson and Annie works well.Otherwise, you end up hating the bad guy, disliking the other bad guy, cheering for the good guys, and knowing how it will all wrap up neatly in the end. The movie was like 1 hr 50 mins so you won't spend too much time. There are some small plot twists. Overall, capable but nothing special. Always Good to see Neeson always in films tho he seems to be getting a little old for these roles. Maybe he will next appear in Expendables #20.Enjoy.",Honest Thief

Cliché plot devices, cliché no one hears bullets in populated neighborhoods, or hotel rooms, cliché car chases that left five minutes apart but somehow right behind each other, cliché no security at places that are usually heavily guarded and on and on.

97,darkreignn,Oof.,5,15 November 2020,"I'm a big fan of Liam Neeson. I think he's a fine actor, and a kick-ass action hero. Unfortunately, with titles such as ""Taken 3"" and ""Cold Pursuit"" lining his resume, he has been in a slew of mediocre thrillers lately. And you can add ""Honest Thief"" to that list.""Honest Thief"" is not a good film. Perhaps you may enjoy it, and I hope you do. However, I found this movie extremely boring, and relentlessly mediocre, in every aspect. Let's talk about the action. Practically nonexistent. There are maybe two or three action scenes in this film - what I mean by that is, there are only two or three scenes where fists are thrown, or guns are fired. But when the action hits, it hits like a pillow fight. It isn't necessarily poorly filmed, but the violence lacks momentum. At points Liam Neeson seems to move in slow motion, and it's a wonder that his enemies aren't able to quickly overpower him. At some points, people will just stand in place as he runs toward them, not putting up any semblance of a fight; whether this is due to bad choreography, bad direction, or both, only God knows. As a whole, the action just feels extremely sanitized, and unfortunately, it seems that Liam's age is catching up to him. At one point he yells at someone to run from the inevitable danger, while he himself is running at the pace of a slow jog.While all of the actors in this movie are good, you would not be able to know if this was the first film you've seen with them in it. In between the action you'll find extremely bland drama that is filled to the brim with wooden dialogue and stilted acting; actors sound like they're reading lines directly off the script. Jai Courtney, who I've loved in ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"" was out of his element here, but I don't blame him; the horrendous writing and awkward dialogue he was forced to speak are to blame. And every actor suffers from the lackluster script writing.Ultimately, ""Honest Thief"" is forgettable. It feels like a movie you'd find by scrolling through TV channels late at night. There is some mildly entertaining action scattered throughout, but in the end, this movie is definitely not a theatre experience, and is one you can skip and not feel bad about missing.",Honest Thief

There are many movies that are like this, but this one doesn't work as well, partly because the pacing is all over the place, and partly you have play really really dumb to not notice the plot holes.Like for example, that Storage Facility where Liam's character Tom meets Annie Wilkins. Apparently she's the ONLY person working there. It's not clear, does she own the place, does she just work there? If she owned the place, why was she studying for college Psychology course? LOL.Then you have the keystone cops. You could figure out a mile away that something was going to go wrong when Robert Patrick was suddenly unavailable to deal with the In and Out Bandit, so a couple of other guys are sent in his place. These two guys honestly took boxes, without confirming there was even all the money there? And didn't notice any cameras filming them? Or that lady seeing them emptying out the storage locker?Then they frame Tom with the murder of Robert Patrick's character, but their timeline of when they got there would have already been destroyed by witnesses at the front desk of the hotel, not to mention surveillance cameras at the hotel.The movie has a lot of really slow parts, completely drives the energy DOOOWN, not even the kind of breaks action movies usually need. Just draining.The last act of the movie gets really dumb. Okay, so how did Tom find Nivens house. And how did he get INTO Nivens house, and then blow it up assuming no one else was in there?! I guess after Nivens kills his partner, and then Tom lifts his shirt knowing about the recording device, that the two of them were working together to take down Nivens. Nobody even seems broken up at the end of the film about the death of that FBI agent lol. Completely forgotten. I also knew the bomb in the car would be a dud, so predictable. No way Tom would blow up 3 million, because that all had to be returned.Oh yeah, and why is everyone, including the FBI agents, shooting their guns sideways? This isn't a 90s street gang film. It's already known that doing that will jam your gun. But they were doing it 70% of the time in this film, for no reason.The movie ends with Tom turning himself in. I bet while he's in prison, that WeBoy FBI agent Meyers would probably hook up with Tom's girlfriend. They seemed to be flirting at the storage facility, and he spent a lot of time in the hospital with her. Meyers for the win lol. He better make sure Tom doesn't try to blow him up real good when he gets out..",Honest Thief

So he tries to surrender and return all the stolen money, every single penny he robbed in exchange for having a reduced penalty and being able to receive visits in prison every day. Unfortunately, he's dealing with greedy officers who want to keep the money for themselves and murder him. And then the hunt begins. The film is quite gentle, without much tension or action, and Neeson really acts like an intelligent gentleman and not a criminal or action hero throughout the film.

A lot of focus on the romance plot but they mistakenly messed this up by wrapping up the film much too quickly. leaving out a ton of desired scenes other films definitely would have. The acting is decent overall but nothing fantastic. It was great to see Donovan and he gives a good performance but his role was very underutilized. There are a few odd plot holes, especially it having FBI they miss some marks. If anything I wouldn't have rated this movie as low if they didn't wrap up the finale as fast as they did, this was a major letdown and others I was with also kinda gasped the moment the camera panned out and the credits rolled in. They really messed up there. Also there is a scene with a odd cut, that felt very rushed, you will definitely notice it (people in front of me certainly did). The VFX were also lackluster, and imo in 2020 you can't have stuff like fire/explosions look so ''greenscreen-y'' anymore. Just some really poor fire fx as well, cheap looking, not well color corrected. The action scenes were decent, not heavy on cuts or shaky cam, a little but not annoyingly.All in all it's just about alright, just not worth a ticked imo. 5/10",Honest Thief

Were they drinking that day at the table read and then just said, hey we need a paycheck so who's gonna notice. Basically it's a 'b' movie wrapped in an 'a' production and everybody is just going thru the motions milking their images, particularly liam neeson who's a far cry from 'lamb' which I just watched the other day by chance. Now he seems to have gone the nicholas cage career route. Crank out as many of these formula pictures as he can until the box office retires him. Must be really hard up for money stooping as low as the latest films that he's done.

All other supporting roles are also good but not Oscar winning. although there are quite a few cheesy lines and really questionable choices at times that make you shake your head.The story was the best part imo. It has good twists in it is interesting enough to follow. I love the relationship between the main duo and the cat and mouse chase it has. I will say that him giving away 9m, the woman not getting the tape in time and the fact that he had to give himself up even though there was no evidence of who did the crime is extremely poor writing and is what is holding back this film.Overall I would suggest this as it was a fun watch that has a nice love story and villains.

Everyone is either half bothered or just lacking in skill. It's just not good casting. It's all too simple and there's too much undue excess and not enough intensity. I prefer Liam Neeson playing in roles where the movie isn't tacky and rushed. I prefer him to roles like Taken when it's a serious film.

These people get paid millions of dollars to crank out garbage films like this one. Spoiler alert! 10 star reviews are fake.Just another Neeson movie with nothing new to offer, other than bad dialogue and an old actor trying to play young. I don't even think I can call what he does in this film ""acting."" It's like he is reading lines while half asleep. It could be his age catching up with him. The FBI agents' decisions throughout the film make zero sense. The love interest reaction to all of this is utterly ridiculous coupled with extremely lousy acting.Also this 50+ year old love interest dresses like a high school senior most of the time and looks utterly ridiculous when doing so. Sorry old people, 50 is not the new 20. Get over it. Had she dressed more appropriately for her age she would have been more attractive IMHO. Possibly dress at least 40ish??? IDK.There is also an ""action"" scene where old man Neeson is ""running"" across a street while being chased. He looked ridiculous and could barely lift his feet off of the ground. He looked like he was speed walking inside a mall, versus running.. Then he approached an eight-to-ten feet tall fence. The scene cuts with him grabbing the fence as though he is going to climb over it. Suddenly he is on the ground on the other side, facing the fence as though he climbed down. The scene looked so fake (ROFL)! Simply put he was too old and out of shape to actually do it. He looked like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons (ROFL). ""Smithers."" ""Yes Mr. Burns?"" ""Climb over that fence, but make it look like I did it.""45 minutes into the film you realize up to that point every scene is filled with bad acting and ridiculous dialogue. Look at the expression on their faces. It's like they would rather be fishing. Also, what's with the dog? I saw absolutely nothing added by having that dog in the film? Other than people with disabilities, who can take a dog to work everyday? Just more unnecessary nonsense.Neeson has devolved into a one trick pony. I can envision him ten years from now making Taken 8. The bad guys take his last box of Depends and he goes on a mission inside the retirement home to get them back. (LOL)There's nothing wrong with growing old when you don't live in denial. Neeson needs to let go of these so-called action roles before he falls and can't get up. He should be playing the police chief or head of a regional FBI division in these types of films versus trying to beat up everyone with his brittle bones.

He really shows his age in this movie with his body language and posture. I also notice some clever editing where shots are cut to show him just landing on the ground to give the impression that he just 'climbed a 10ft fence'. It reminds me of the day I watched 'Skiptrace' and realised that Jackie Chan's action days were over too.Even though it was nice to see a new Liam Neeson film that wasn't just a copy and paste of 'Taken', this film was very underwhelming. Nothing new, or original. Overused storyline of 'man tries to clear his name/crooked cops'.Acting was good though.One thing I didn't understand was what kind of neighbourhoods don't bat an eyelid when a bomb goes off in one house...and there's a 2 minute gunfight in another? Absolutely NOBODY came out, or even looked outside to see what all the noise was.

134,garethvk,Neesons Delivers What Fans Have Come To Expect,7,13 October 2020,"Tom (Liam Neeson) is a long-time bank robber eager to put his past behind him in the new film ""Honest Thief"". A circumstance forced Tom to decide to strike back at the establishment following a career in ordinance in the military and has found he has a real talent for blowing safes and making away with millions of dollars over several years.The Feds have been unable to stop him and regularly field numerous calls from people claiming to be responsible in order to gain attention. So when Tom calls Agent Sam Baker (Robert Patrick) and his partner Agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan); his claims are met with skepticism.Tom has fallen in love with an aspiring Psychologist he met while renting a storage facility and he is eager to start a new and honest life with Annie (Kate Walsh). Tom offers to return all nine million dollars that he has stolen in term for a light sentence at a minimum security locale near Boston so Annie can visit him frequently.Unwilling to accept that Tom is who he says he is, the agents dispatch Agents Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Agent Hall (Anthony Ramos); to interview Tom and check out his story. Tom offers to tell them where the money is in order to prove his claims. When several boxes of cash are discovered in storage; Nivens decides to take the money and pressures Hall into going along with it despite his reservations.Nivens them attempts to eliminate Tom but in doing so kills Agent Baker who has shown up unexpectedly. Tom is now framed for a murder he did not commit and forced to flee in order to try to clear his name and make good on his initial offer to turn himself in.Nivens is not willing to stop there and escalates his level of corruption and danger including threats on Hall and his family to ensure his compliance and silence.As anyone who has ever seen a Liam Neeson film in the last ten years or so can deduce his character is motivated by events that follows and with his expert knowledge of explosives looks to strike back at Nivens and ensure justice is served.While the film may be a bit slower paced in some areas than fans of Neeson may expect; he turns in a satisfying performance as a sort of modern day Robin Hood.Tom is a man who does not make excuses for his actions and is willing to pay the price for them but believes he was justified in what he did and the reasons behind them.The supporting cast is solid and while the film does have some real gaps in logic which must be suspended to make the story work; it does entertain.In the end ""Honest Thief"" provides enough enjoyment to make it worth your time and shows that Neeson still can deliver what fans have come to expect from him.3.5 stars out of 5",Honest Thief

He is a good actor, he has a lot of good and fun movies, I'm just not sure this deserves to be in that group of movies.It wasn't all that bad, just to predictable in a boring kind of way and with less bodies than you might hope for.

Some action, especially the last part, is half headless, and then in some places it is filmed so ugly that it looks like a green screen. The relationship between Tom and Annie does not go down well either, especially due to the clear age difference. This is really annoying as it should be the heart of the whole movie.

143,MovieWarfare,There was potential but it ends up being a visually boring action movie,4,20 December 2020,"Honestly, I am a sucker for Liam Neeson action flicks. Yeah, they are dumb or over the top but at least it is entertaining with its ridiculous action set pieces. Honest Thief is the next in the list of Liam Neeson's action movie résumé. The premise is ""Hoping to cut a deal, a professional bank robber agrees to return all the money he stole in exchange for a reduced sentence. But when two FBI agents set him up for murder, he must now go on the run to clear his name and bring them to justice"". Does this movie hit the mark or did it steal my time that I won't get back?Firstly, Liam Neeson is still great to watch with his gravelly voice and the fact that despite his age he is still throwing convincing punches. Tom Dolan (Liam Neeson) is the centre of this movie and for the most part, is a decent character to watch. Annie Wilkins (Kate Walsh) who is Tom's love interest and the girl that makes him give up robbing banks is okay as well. The moments between the two are quite sweet to watch and there is some chemistry there that we the audience can invest in.The premise is also mildly interesting despite being kind of cliche. It's another action movie where someone is framed for something they didn't do and they have to prove themselves. Ironically, Liam Neeson has done movies like this already such as ""Non-stop"" and ""The Commuter"". However, there are some bits and pieces in there that could make the movie interesting such as him being framed by corrupt cops and that he Tom isn't a badass murderer. The first half of the movie is also pretty enjoyable because it spends time on its characters. It develops the backstory of the characters, their relationships and individual quirks. The movie doesn't just develop the main leads but also the veteran cops and the corrupt cops as well. It is quite refreshing to see. There is also this running gag with wisecracking veteran agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan) and the adorable scruffy dog he inherited from his recent divorce.It's a shame the second half decides to abandon all of the interest in the characters. The movie becomes a more generic action movie with boring car chases, not spectacular fistfights and some mediocre shoot outs. What could have been complicated characters, become just generic and one-note characters. An example is one of the corrupt cops Nivens (Jai Courtney) who makes a good point about taking the money that the audience might agree with but then becomes generic evil greedy dude.The movie is just incredibly predictable and all the suspenseful moments such as the shady dealings aren't as impactful as it should be. I would have probably liked the movie more if the action scenes were at least visually pleasing to watch but it isn't. Additionally, there some are weird choices made by characters that are just really silly and can take you out of the movie. For example, a character has been shot repeatedly which the main character Tom saw. Instead of checking if he is still okay or calling a hospital he instead decides to do a phone call first right next to a dying or dead person. It's a weird director decision and it just makes the character seem weird.Overall, the movie is just very mediocre. There is something interesting buried within this movie with characters dealing with guilt and personal responsibility but they are unfortunately not explored. Furthermore, the action scenes are boring and not that exciting. This is what makes the movie disappointing as the pieces for a stronger movie are there but not utilised. If you like Liam Neeson then there is worth watching it for him alone but you want a fun action movie then this isn't it.",Honest Thief

If you ask me she wasn't worth handing yourself in for in the first place but that was the story. Talking of story it is very poor, hastily thrown together with no time to see what makes them a couple, just a meeting at a storage rental then that's them happily together. The one standout was the agent with the dog and the scenes with him stood out more than the others, not great but better than the rest. Everything else is your typical Liam Neeson action flick, same action scenes, all be it a slower slightly older Liam neeson since you last saw him.

146,RetroRick,Liam Neeson in what is probably a kind of personal film for him,8,14 December 2020,"Great movie. No massive surprises, but consistently engaging, well-acted & genial all-round. Moreover within the terms it sets itself it's very believable. As for those complaining about the fact the movie is framed as a romance, I completely fail to see how this detracts in an way: Liam Neeson always plays Liam Neeson - he's not a character actor, he's Liam Neeson. Now that might seem to be stating the obvious, but Liam lost his beloved wife in a terrible accident (a skiing accident as I recall). There is a scene where his ladyfriend (as he refers to her) suffers a head injury. His wife died of a head injury. That is clearly not a coincidence. This Liam Neeson, playing a character with a very personal motivation, and it shows. It's as though he's saying he would give everything up to have her back. He's a sweet guy Liam Neeson, & he's still grieving by the sounds of itAnother thing to note, is all the actors are great, particularly the lead FBI man, who has a lot of character.

147,PerryAtTheMovies,Nothing Spectacular,4,14 October 2020,"This is an ""ok"" action movie, but since I've seen the ""Taken"" series, it's hard to not see Liam Neeson as anything other than a rogue going after some bad guys. There's lulls that offer the opportunity to understand the story, and background, of the characters. There's also a good amount of action that has you wanting more, but at the end of the day, 90 minutes doesn't give you the full meal. As cheesy as this movie is compared to ""Taken"" it would've been nice to have a little more oomph added. The one good quality I liked about the film is the relationship between Tom and Annie. It was a true, and through hardship, trusted relationship.The overall to this film, for me, is if you've seen ""Taken"", ""Non-Stop"", or ""The Commuter"". Than you've pretty much seen this film.

151,Marc_Action,Brainless Plot,4,28 March 2021,"First off, there is zero chemistry between Neeson and Kate Walsh. It doesn't help that a good portion of the dialogue spoken between the two during scenes intended to be intense, is delivered with all the enthusiasm of reading the Sunday obituaries. Neeson, in particular, just doesn't seem invested. Oddly enough, Jai Courtney gives the most thrilling performance here as an FBI agent gone rogue in an attempt to steal the $9 million that Neeson's character, Tom Dolan, dubbed the In-and-Out Bandit, stole over a decade of performing solo bank heists. So, yeah, when Jai Courtney gives one of the better performances in a film, that's pretty sad.As heist movies go, or really any movie, scriptwriters here must think audience members are pretty braindead because the plot of this movie is so asinine and cringeworthy, Honest Thief isn't very watchable. Plus, not much of what the characters do make any damn sense in real life.This movie's problems are numerous. First off, Dolan robbed twelve banks over an extended number of years and authorities and the media obviously knew his modus operandi enough to dub him the In-and Out Bandit. So, why wasn't he caught sooner? I ask because Dolan's requirements for which bank he would target are so specific there's no way he wouldn't have been caught prior to robbing twelve banks. He always selects banks in small towns with a specific, older type of vault that is easier to crack than modern vaults and the banks ALWAYS have an adjoining vacant building through which he gains access to the bank. In addition, Dolan only does the heists during a 3-day weekend. Question: How often would such specific opportunities come together for Dolan to pull off the perfect heist? Answer: Very rarely. So, the FBI would have been all over this and figured out he was using adjoining vacant buildings to gain access to banks after, like, his third or forth successful robbery. They would have issued a memo to all older banks in small towns to inform the FBI when adjoining buildings go vacant and those banks would have been under heavy surveillance during every 3-day holiday. Dolan would have long ago been caught.But what's worse about this plot is that Dolan claims he plasters the walls and paints after the heist so that authorities don't know how he got into the bank. Well, duh, it still wouldn't take long to figure out he got in via the vacant adjoining building! Also, even if he could plaster/patch the wall (and match the paint color perfectly) on the vacant building's side of the hole in the wall, how did he do the same on the bank's side of the wall? The answer is he would not be able to plaster, patch, and paint the hole on the bank's side of the wall and so, authorities would have known from day one how he got ""in and out"" of the bank (pun intended).As for Dolan's motive for robbing banks? He did it initially to get back at the corrupt CEO who made off with his dead father's pension. Yes, this is pretty stupid. Because even if you rob a bank where the CEO of the company your dad worked for keeps his money, you're not taking the CEO's money directly, you're taking the bank's money. Any money you steal from the bank will likely be replace via the bank's blanket bond or some other form of insurance. What did Dolan think? The bank would have a vault just for the CEO with his name on it where he keeps hard cash? LMAO. NO! Plus would a CEO, even an unscrupulous one, keep all his money in a small town bank in the first place? Wouldn't he diversify his money in various investments instead or bank at a private bank for high-net-worth individuals which is not likely to have a branch in a small town? How stupid do the writers of this film think the average viewer is? Honestly?Also, why would you attempt to turn yourself in from a hotel? If you're trying to work out a deal in return for giving back the entire $9 million, doing it from a hotel gives you no better advantage than doing it from the FBI facility. Those low-level FBI agents wouldn't be the ones that could broker him a deal anyway. Has this guy Dolan ever watched any legal drama or crime drama series on TV? SMH. It's the prosecutor and your criminal defense lawyer who would do that, and, hello, you're no where near that step yet when just turning yourself in!Also, if you're a crooked FBI agent planning to steal the $9 million your suspect is leading you to in a nearby storage facility, why wouldn't you bring him along when he said he's turning himself in if your ultimate goal is to kill the suspect? You've already had twelve individuals falsely claim to be the In-and-Out Bandit and your superiors clearly believe this to be another dead-end lead. You cuff him and take him with you so that he's easier to dispose of once you get the loot. You don't leave him at the hotel. He might change his mind and flee while you're at the storage facility.Also, writers want us to believe this guy stole $9 million over several years and never spent even one penny of it? LMAO. This, much like the plot of Blood Brother (2018), is probably the most farcical and insulting aspect of the entire dumb plot.",Honest Thief

The Radio Show All About The Movies:Liam Neeson is back again following the same formula movie he is constantly cast in. ""Piss me off.. I WILL hunt you down.. and I WILL make your life miserable in some way"".The premise is a ""not-so-bad"" thief who robs banks meets a girl and decides to come clean to the FBI in exchange for a lite sentence. Unfortunately the FBI agents that see the $9M decide they'd rather take the money and be crooked cops. That's when Neeson falls into his routine movie.This isn't a bad movie at all.. but it's pretty ""cookie cutter"" for Neeson. It was worth seeing because (honestly) there isn't a LOT out there to see at the moment. His ""Taken"" movies were better.I'd give it about a 5.5 out of 10. Good mindless fun... but nothing new or even ""creative"" (as it comes to story lines). Neeson is doing a role he's done a dozen times before.

Oddly enough Honest Thief was released here in Canada last week but the Americans had to wait an extra week. I seen the film today since I had another free pass. Honest Thief was okay as expected.The acting was good including Jai Courtney whom plays the villain. Neeson was good but some people may feel he phoned it in. The characterization was fine, you know enough to be invested.The plot is generic, you know what's going to happen from beginning to end. There's nothing surprising or clever. It's like the writers are rookies. The film is briskly paced, it's not slow like the Ryan Gosling movie Drive although it's better.Keep in mind Honest Thief isn't a straight up action movie like the Taken movies. The action scenes are fine, they're not boring. They were shot and edited normally. The director is a rookie for action so he could improve.Honest Thief was okay, it's another generic thriller.

161,lakings97,Another version of Taken!,7,6 July 2021,Honest Thief is an Amazon Prime flick produced by ten production companies that's stars Liam Neeson as a thief that sold over ten million dollars from various banks over several years time. Liam wanting to lead an honest life for the name of love after meeting Kate Walsh decides to turn in the money for a reduced sentence only to be double crossed by two FBI agents played by Anthony Ramos and Jai Courtney. They call him the In-n-out bandit who leaves without a trace and never gets caught. The two agents steal his money for themselves and end up killing their chief played by Robert Patrick and second in command Jeffrey Donovan. Although the story the compelling I just don't understand why he would ever turn in the money. This was another version of Taken with a twist. It was ok with watch once especially for someone over the age of 65 who seems to always end up in the same situation.,Honest Thief

163,tiffanytallent1981,I'll Definitely Watch This Again!,8,28 May 2021,"I perused the other reviews for this movie and was shocked by how many people didn't like it. Everyone has different opinions I suppose. I just know that really enjoyed it! I took off a couple stars because one guy died that I wanted to live AND I wanted there to be a fast forward at the end. You know, like two years later or something?The basics of this movie are as follows. Tom robs numerous banks over several years. You'll find out later why. He always did it at night, so no one was in any danger. Tom goes to a self storage lot to hide his millions and hits it off with Annie, who runs the place. They date for a year and Tom falls hard for her. He wants to be a better man for her. In his mind, the only true way to redemption is to turn himself in and give the money back. So, Tom calls the FBI and confesses, but the agents are skeptical because they've received over a dozen false confessions thus far. He had to keep calling them until finally two agents (John and Ramon) come to his hotel room. Tom gives details of his crimes, but the agents are still unsure without the physical money evidence. So Tom gives them a key to his storage locker and the two agents find $3 million. But instead of turning it in, they decide to keep it. Ramon is uncertain but goes along with the plan anyway. They return to Tom's hotel room and are going to kill him, but he says that there is still $6 million hidden away. About this time, one of the head agents comes to the hotel room and is murdered by John, once he figures out something is off. Then Tom fights John and Ramon, falling out of the window with one of them. Annie happens to be coming to the hotel and witnesses the fall. They take off and Tom has to finally explain what is happening. And now the the FBI is coming after him for murder, even though John is responsible. There is quite a bit of action after this, including John beating up Annie, Ramon being shot by John, car chases, shootouts, John's house being blown up, and more. Luckily, another FBI agent, Sean, starts to believe Tom's version and eventually is able to arrest John.You have to suspend belief during some of this movie, but isn't it like that with most? That's why films are made! We get to leave our lives and jump into another for a bit. My favorites: Annie's reaction to Tom blowing up John's house, the blow up itself, how Tom got John arrested, the fact that Tom never killed anyone or tried to, Agent Sean and his dog, and the relationship between Annie and Tom. My least favorites: The death of Ramon and the nonchalant attitude of the FBI.",Honest Thief

The part where he wants to surrender while he's nowhere near getting caught is a bit hard to understand. I do appreciate that the character wants to turn over a new leaf and not wanting to feel the guilt anymore. He could have just stopped robbing banks like he did and donate the money to the poor if he doesn't want to do anything with the money. They could use it a lot more than the banks. Banks have insurance yes? The choice does not sound logical. Anyway, I enjoy watching it just the same.

It could actually have been a quite realistic story without much action and killing, but enjoyable. Too bad they felt they had to do more and turn it into the mess I expected it too be before watching. Sometimes less is more!

Seriously, Neeson's agent needs to find him some projects with more diverse characters for him to play.Story lacked character development and we didn't understand why two cops (1 cop) went bad. No idea for their motivation.Neeson's character of a bank robber who robs 12 banks but doesn't spend any of the money, doesn't make sense. Even his reasoning for robbing the banks doesn't make sense.It's getting to the point where it seems studios want to make a quick buck by remaking ever decreasing in quality versions of Taken, with Neeson as a drunk in the snow, Neeson who lives in the desert, Neeson as a kind criminal. Neeson as a kind criminal again. It's not even worth a watch.Parts of the movie - I could not suspend my disbelief. Neeson is able to just waltz out of a hospital with a patient and rather than try to untangle that mess, it just cuts to Neeson tucking her in at home, still in her hospital gown.Seriously, expand the characters you play or retire.

Not as much tension as the Taken series because the two bad FBI agents gone bad were the only antagonists portrayed, and one of the two has a moral opposition to the other, totally committed FBI agent, creating its own whirlwind of suspense, regret and final reversal by betraying him.

Very entertaining even though the script does not lend itself to a broader set antagonists.",Honest Thief
211,brent-27849,At least it was only 99 cents,1,25 March 2021,"There are just too many things that don't make sense. So Liam wants to turn himself in and go to jail so he can have a relationship with his girlfriend. But he doesn't want to go to jail for very long so he wants to be punished, just not very much. Ok. For starters, wouldn't it probably be a good idea to tell his girlfriend first what he was planning to do? And no, the fact that he tried doesn't count because he was under no time clock, he can turn himself anytime, so he could easily tell his girlfriend first that he was a bank robber and that he was going to turn himself in. What was his plan anyway, even if it went properly - as he's led off in handcuffs by FBI agents, and his girlfriend is standing there, he was going to say what, oh by the way honey, I'm a bank robber and I just turned myself in, see you when I see you, hope you're still around in a couple of years because I'm doing it all for you? Ok. But then why does he even need to turn himself in? It was a victimless crime essentially and he never spent any of the money, so why not just return the money anonymously, clear his conscience and go on with life? Seems fair and reasonable. Again why not discuss it with his girlfriend first? Maybe he would find out she was ok with him being a bank robber, she certainly doesn't seem to mind when he blows up a house, and maybe if her first question was, how much did you steal with a grin on her face, he would know there was really nothing to worry about. Even if she wasn't ok with it, quite likely she would be okay with return the money or give the money to charity or something along those lines. And if he still insists on wanting to be punished, just not too much, maybe she could punish him for being a bad boy. Still he wants to turn himself in. Ok. But doesn't go to a lawyer to see what kind of deal he can cut. Doesn't just go into FBI headquarters, which would make a lot more sense, he would still have the money as leverage, and that way he could really prove who he said he was, maybe bring along one packet of money, good chance they had all the serial numbers. Instead he calls in and asks for a deal. First of all, how is that up to FBI agents to cut him a deal? Is that not something for the prosecutor to decide? And even if the FBI agents agree, just to get him to confess, what, does he really think they would be under any obligation to actually keep the deal? What was he going to say after they arrested him and he was charged with multiple cases of grand larceny, hey, no fair, you said you were going to cut me a deal? Yeah, right. Still he makes the call. And the FBI take it with no reports being made, nothing entered on record, no paper trail being created in effect. Instead Robert Patrick, after assigning it to two other agents, goes to the hotel by himself. At this point, he doesn't know who he's dealing with, Liam might be insane or an actual bank robber - maybe bringing a partner might make sense. But he goes alone and gets smoked. I'll cut ahead a little because there's just too much stupidity to cover, but the point is somehow Liam knows that of the two bad agents, one is a really bad agent, while the other one is only kind of bad. How exactly does he know this? The less bad agent was there when the good agent gets killed and the really bad agent also tries to kill Liam, including a big chase scene in which they're both after him and also Kate Walsh at that point; he's also there when the really bad agent beats up Kate and tries to kill her, but the less bad agent only thinks she's dead (more stupidity - how exactly is someone only maybe dead, either you have a pulse or you don't), and they both leave her for dead anyway; the less bad agent is along for the ride when they find Liam and have a massive shoot out between the car and van (a Marine and a bad FBI agent, yet neither of them can hit the broad side of a barn at close range) - and from this, Liam somehow magically ascertains that one is a really bad agent because he steals money and kills a good agent and tries to kill him and Kate and frame him, while the other agent is only kind of bad because he only steals money, doesn't say anything about the good agent getting killed, leaves Kate for dead and tries to frame him? Ok. Another one, Kate is in the hospital, a material witness involved with a bank robber and the possible killer of a good agent, yet she doesn't get any protection and there aren't like twenty agents standing around, ready to question her as soon as she regains consciousness? Ok. But back to the bad agent, less bad agent. Liam tracks down the less bad agent, the less bad agent says he has the tape of the storage with them loading the boxes into the car - so why doesn't Liam take it right there and then and go to the other good agent with the evidence? What, was it buried in the guy's back yard and the map was an Indiana Jones map on a medallion? And why not just demand that the less bad agent confess to the other good agent of his role and turn State's evidence against the really bad agent and cut a deal? There was never a chance where the less bad agent wasn't going to have to face some kind of punishment so why not just come clean right there? One more about the less bad agent saying that he stole the money because of how much he loved his family - how about the fact that he would never be able to look his kids in the eyes again because he would always know that the good man they thought they were looking at was a liar and a thief? That wouldn't have been more important to him than some ill gotten money? I could probably go on but that's enough. And to think that's in a movie less than a hundred minutes long. Wow.",Honest Thief

We've supposed to believe he robbed twelve banks but each time just put the cash in a box in storage and never spent a penny of it? Seriously? Now he wants to give it all back even though no one knows who he is and he's actually found a good use for the money? It would have been so easy to add a credible reason into this awful writing: have him kill or wound someone in the last robbery and that makes guilt overwhelm him.

Then he meets a woman, fells in love and decides to 'go straight.' Very noble, indeed. But here the stupid, or rather, idiotic part starts: instead of returning the money he robbed or at least giving it to charity while sending an anonymous letter promising that he won't ever do it again, he decides to turn himself in. He realizes that he will have to do time, probably a lot of time in the jail while he's not a 'spring chicken' that is, at his age every year counts. So instead of spending each and every year that remained in his life with the woman he loves, while returning the money and 'doing time' as any other normal person in his position would do, that is, getting involved in the community, doing charity work, etc., he just turns himself in while hoping that the government would appreciate his noble gesture and gives him a reduced sentence. So he comes across two greedy FBI agents who after probably realizing what idiot they are dealing with decide to take his money and kill him. And here the typical action starts. Naturally for this kind of movie, after lot of car chasing and shooting the bad guys are killed or arrested and the 'good' FBI agent receives the stolen money and, as a nice gesture, allows him to hug his girlfriend for the last time before taking him in. Oh, boy..

252,AmigaWolf,Good simple movie,8,21 November 2020,"This is a basic Liam Neeson movie, and i love that, he plays always the same, but for some reason it gets never old, just like all the older Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, he as always play a good guy who have a very particular set of skills, skills he have acquired over a very long career, and yeah you know the rest.If you have seen the trailer and have read the description, then read on....
So it's about a bank robber, who finds the love of his life, and because of her he stops robbing banks, but he feels guilty so he calls the FBI, and then everything goes sideways very fast, great simple action movie with some great fast action car scenes, the only thing that was not so great was the shooting scenes, they are very bad shooters.I would recommend everyone this movie who also liked the other Liam Neeson action movies, it's sometimes slow, but when the action begins it's great.",Honest Thief

So many awful movies out right now due to the anticipated ones being pushed out to 2021, but this one was good & worth the watch!Not super realistic, but it's more about the entertainment of action and good vs bad guy that makes it unique and fun to watch.Great acting of courseI admit I'm used to seeing Liam Neeson with these gentle, tender hearted cheesy ladies who typically play his girlfriend or wife. So, seeing him with Kate Welsh was awesome. I naturally thought they didn't have chemistry because of his past actress counterparts, but I truly enjoyed seeming him with someone who wasn't so dolled up, speaks her mind and is more realistic. Loved seeing her in here.Why is Jai Courtney such a good bad guy???One thing to change is I wish there was more of a climax to the climax. It did seem like it was a great build and decent climax, but I'm used to seeing much more these days. Great action throughout.

The characters portrayal and stereotypes where also off putting, they where all portrayed as fatalistic desperate losers. The tough guy personas was really odd, I will never make eye contact with those actors, in any private area. The production was great, the score was a little above tolerable but it mismatched the odd script. The movie did not give a homogenous feeling or a unified artistic sense.

I will say I do not believe this is his best performance as this movie does not have the action that say Taken does. What I do like is the storyline. The movie is about a thief that wants to turn himself in because he has found love with a young lady played by Kate Walsh. The thief calls the authorities to turn himself in...to authenticate his story he tells the authorities where the money is. Two agents assigned to the case find the money, things change when one of the agents get greedy and go rogue planning to keep the money and convinces his partner to join him in the theft.

While there are movies that are able to build a convicing story around this kafkaesk battle ""man against corruption"" this movie clearly didn't think it through. The corrupt agents ""big plan"" was so amateurish that the viewer never has any doubts that the truth will come out. The writers couldnt even come up with a reason why the FBI should still think that Neeson is the bad guy. So, for most of the movie its just Neeson (ex marine and IQ 300 bankrobber) against one single corrupt dimwhit FBI agent. I wonder who is going to win this...In good ""man against governement"" movies you often times have this single piece of evidence that the main character produces in the last moment and completely turns the ending aorund - thats exciting. This movie couldn't be bothered. In general there was no sense of urgency, Neeson is always ten steps ahead - how does he know where to show up, only the writers know.I can't say the movie is a disaster. Its watchable but its hard to enjoy this combination of bland actors and lazy script. This movie will be forgotten quickly.",Honest Thief

I just got out of the theatre, and this is one of those movies that I think will be reverberating through my mind for a little while. It's not profoundly poetic or anything like that, nor is it anything like a mindless Liam Neeson action flick with a big conspiracy and a big reveal that doesn't do much for the plot or the audience. I'll admit, I only went to see this cuz Liam is my boy and I wanted to go see a movie in theatres and there was nothing else that interested me. I've been on a sci fi kick lately, and I was not really feeling this movie before I went. But from the first scene, my fears of the needlessly overcomplicated conspiracy and cheapness of Liam Neeson's other movies (which I love about them, I just wasn't feeling them today) slowly disappeared as the film went on. There is no mystery here; you're with every character the entire way through. It's so awesome to see them each in their own little zone and hear their backstories that are sprinkled throughout the movie, and we also get to see them grow and change. It's all so subtle, and it's a shame that people probably won't give this movie the time of day. Great characters, compelling motives, awesome performances, and gnarly action make for one dynamite movie!!!!",Honest Thief
290,justinleblanc59,typical story with a twist - but an averagr Liam Neeson flick,6,12 May 2021,"Decided to give this a watch on Netflix.What can I really say, it's an interesting take a thief story wanting turn himself in from the banks that he robbed, and then it gets very Lian Neeson. What I mean by that, is he fights the 'bad' people to do the right thing.I mean I was expecting a film like 'Taken' and for the most part, thats what I got. I mean he tends to play the same role every film, weather he would be an ex-marine, ex-cop, ex-spy agent, he just always plays the same roles, yet i'm not bothered by it. I guess maybe because he's good at it.The Acting - was decent enough, the typical Liam Nieeson lines are there, but not as.that one taken line that was made into a meme, but still decent.I don't necessarily believe the love story between Tom.& Annie, and they kind rushed on his whole point of wanting to be a better guy because of her.They did however go into enough detail on why he did what he did in the past, and I understood it and felt for the character once hearing the story.The Antagonist in the film was well played too.- Jai Coutney did a great job, perhaps I would have liked him to be a bit more psychotic, but I certainly felt his greed.The film isn't ove rthe top, and isn't bad, it's an average okay film, that you might maybe stop and watch if it randomly shows on tv, cause Liam Neeson always seems to have that.watchability factor - perhaps it might be the voice :P.6 / 10 - If You like Liam Nieeon you'll find this movie decent, it's not the best action flick, or the greatest story about second chances, but the story takes a multitude of things that has been done before, and adds a certain kind of twist to it, which makes it less different than other Liam Neeson films.",Honest Thief

When the FBI comes in use what they call.... a suspension of disbelief. Not once but twice Liam gives millions and millions of dollars to two lone guys who might be FBI. Then when they abscond with the money, he gives more millions to a single FBI guy. The entire plot and script is half baked, I think a high school sophomore could have done just as good. don't forget what seems to be required of any action movie these days, 10 minute two-man gun fights.

It's still decent as it does nothing particularly wrong either, so if you would like to just sit back and enjoy a movie you have never seen before but at the same time don't want to experience any new content and are already too stressful to take additional excitement a good action film or thriller could offer then this is definitely your movie!It is absurdly average but you can still spend the 90+ minutes moderately entertained, mostly because you'll see familiar faces on-screen and it will/could somehow make you feel more than the movie can actually offer.",Honest Thief

Neesom plays a bank robber who's motivations for doing so are barely explained but we know even as we see his character doing what he does best that he's not evil at heart because he's, well...Liam Neeson and we know that before the movie is over he will have cleared his name from an attempted framing by a couple of corrupt FBI agents because he's, well, Liam Neesom.

318,twistedwhizz,Good grief.,2,10 October 2021,"Confession - probably shouldn't be either scoring or reviewing this as I only made it about 20 minutes in. But hey ho, I've had to, because so much of streaming is just awful and it needs a discussion. Why can't either Netflix or Amazon create anything worthwhile, especially with regards movies? Their films sit uncomfortably between made for TV cheapness and direct to VHS naffness. This one feels like the script was computer generated. Do Hollywood writers know any other human beings? Do they read books at all? Do they leave their houses ever? The dialogue is just so uniquely awful you'll struggle to believe a real person wrote it. I simply couldn't take much more beyond the hilarious confession to the FBI. If I was drunk I might have got a load of comedy value out of it, but sadly I'd only just started on the Beam. Guys - your writers need to reconnect with other people in order to create art. They need to read some books instead of going around telling people that they are writers. Either that or get better script generating algorithms because this one failed. It's that or get a proper job in a supermarket.",Honest Thief

People also just hating because of the casting, which got nothing to do with anything.

335,dlong-15888,Absolutely awful,1,15 December 2020,This might be the worst movie I've seen all year the plot is cliche and full of holes. Liam Neesons character is bland and boring but hes still the best part of the movie. The female lead has to the most annoying character ever I would rather stick a screwdriver in my ear than lisen to her romantic dialogue with neeson again. I would be giving the nine million just to get rid of her if you watch the film you know what I'm talking about. And the crooked cop is pretty awful aswell like they just seen him at the side of the street and said hey want to be in a Liam Neeson movie. I would recommend finding a different movie to watch as almost anything would be better than this and if you can't find anything paint a wall in your house and watch it dry you'll get more entertainment out of that.,Honest Thief
336,SpoilerReviews,Honest Thief,4,27 June 2021,"When I saw this movie I was disappointed on how similar it is to Michael Mann's ""Thief"". For example the cops in the picture is basically the Mob taking advantage of a thief who is striving for a better life. Although it lacks heist scenes, unlike ""Thief"", I found it eerily similar.This whole review I have been complaining with it being similar to ""Thief"" but not pointing out its own flaws. Well first, it is extremely predictable and clichéd. Containing cliché action movie elements and dosent try to invent anything new. I also predicted some of the turns that the movie offered, being presented in a way we hae seen multiple times over the years in action movies.If I were to be positive, it would be probably over Liam Neeson's performance and some fun action scenes.But after the film was finished I was pretty disappointed.",Honest Thief

340,zipirovich,Lazy screenwriting makes for a terrible movie,2,10 May 2021,"Please don't waste your time on this. I deeply regret watching it, as this is approximately 1 hr 40 min of my life wasted that I'm never getting back. The movie's biggest, but sadly not the only, issue is with the plot. This is one of the laziest script-writing instances ever. The whole plot mainly consists of plot holes (pun intended). These plot holes are so huge you could walk a herd of elephants thru them. And the lazy screenwriters don't even bother with covering their laziness! For example, (spoiler alert) at one point the protagonist decided to secretly get his girlfriend out of the hospital. How is it shown in the movie? He walks into her hospital room, tells her we need to get out of here... and the next scene we see is the two of them in his hotel room. We're supposed to believe that nobody in the entire hospital noticed a patient being ""secretly"" walked out? And why should we believe that that's possible, if even the screenwriters didn't believe it possible themselves, so they quickly cut to the hotel room? And the whole movie is just like that. Terrible, just plain terrible. Even Liam Neeson is terrible in it too, showing the emotional depth of a cardboard box. My only guess is that once he signed the contract and got the money, he decided not to waste any acting on this sad excuse of a movie.",Honest Thief

But it's a Liam Neeson movie so I got mostly what I wanted. Some good action scenes, Liam kicking younger men's asses.

Liam Neeson normally putts down a strong caracter with a heart, like for his daughter in Taken. But in this movie we see his behaviour on steroids in the wrong way. Love, caring and understanding was all over the place, taking the movie to a stop more than once. I know this is a big issue for the movie plot, but we understood this at the first scene, so be done with it. ;-)Also some plotholes where things all happen within the same 5 minutes and people end up in a specific situation, like the hotel room mixup at the beginning and the camera images retrieval which would normally take a few minutes to complete. And also the scene with the police car at the junction, he should have known better to stop in front of the red light.Agent Nivens seem to get from a rookie to a kind of corrupt agent within a matter of minutes. And why would the partner of agent Nivens putt himself into danger at the end. He could have turned himself in, testifying to his partner and all would be done. In both versions he would have received a penalty, but he surely made the wrong choice there.All in total not a bad movie during these harsh movie times, but a little more action and way less romance in your next movie please Mr. Neeson.

It entertains in a thirteen-a-dozen way (6-7 stars for that). But seldom have I seen such poor script-writing, to the extent where it quickly becomes a distraction.Others have already pointed out dozens of plot holes, inconsistencies and actions that are out of character. I'll name just one (but there are many that are worse): Dolan takes the gun of one of the dirty FBI agents; a couple of days later he hands it to the agent's superior, who gives it back to the dirty cop saying ""I believe this belongs to you"" (or something to that effect).

The movie is solid, backed up by an impressive cast that fully buys into the idea, and carry the movie well. The plot is clear, the actions of people are clear and the conflict is clear too. The movie does the job to entertain us and to re-introduce: Jai Courtney as the bad guy that we know that he can be, Jeffrey Donovan who can be a real treat when paired with a good script and a relative new comer in Anthony Ramos, who is yet another Hamilton Original Cast member to keep in mind.

Basically ex Marine Liam Neeson decides to stop living a lie and hand himself in to FBI as the much sought after ""In and Out Bandit"" but when they don't believe it's really him and send in some young amateurs things get messy. Very messy, and Neeson is on the run framed for murder as well as Bank robbery.It reminded me a lot of 1993's The Fugitive. A really fast paced, gripping action movie. Read a review saying it was ""slow""...don't get that at all, it's anything but slow. At only 95 minutes long there's no time to really be slow it gets straight into the action and hardly slows down.Cynically you could say I've seen it before but isn't that just Hollywood in general these days? Just enjoy it for what it is.It was nice to see Robert Patrick in the movie been a big fan if his from his X-Files days and he's a really under rated actor.Enjoy.",Honest Thief

413,markvanderlienden,"Poor script, bad movie",3,12 October 2020,"With Corona, times are hard for movie lovers, especially those who like to visit the cinemas. With honest thief on the playlist I thought to get to see a movie that easily would be better than the average garbage cinemas have to offer in the last few months.
What a turn-off was honest thief. The script was awful, I have noticed so many plot holes and unlikely situations that the writers probably think that viewers don't care for a solid script. The movies that last have something special and give you a reason to overthink the movie afterwards. Not honest thief....
Liam Neeson is always solid and has made quite a few very good movies. This isn't one of them. Agent Niven wants to kill his girlfriend in the hospital but his boss is sitting at her bed? Right.... they didn't see or hear each other? Our honest thief is probably the most wanted man in the city after the murder of an FBI agent. But he can easily drive, phone and walk throughout town. And when there is a car chase or narrow situation he easily escapes and stays in a motel whit out a problem. When he escapes in the beginning he and his girlfriend hide in a car in a parking garage. Of all places in the big city the cops decide to look there, right.... after his house is blown up, agent Niven returns there a little bit later. Just some windows are being blown out but there is no fire damage. That is actually possible because the cgi used in the scene when th house is being blown up is so bad, we just had to laugh.
And the end....... dead cops, car chases through the city, a house blown up and more......, but no further investigation. Liam can life happily ever after with his girlfriend. She is obviously a strong woman. First she was pronounced dead by the agent, then she was alive but needed emergency treatment in the hospital, then she could easily be taken from the hospital and live saving monitory. And within hours she was was fine, up and running!
Go see it, but turn your brain off......",Honest Thief

So why the hell did they put him against some dumb lightweight villains? This was an absolute waste of Liam Neesons very particular set of skills. The villains played by John Mclane's son and Alexander Hamilton's son are the absolute worst lazy villains I've seen in movies. Their motivation is so low stakes and their plan just gets dumber as the movie goes on. Whoever wrote and directed this need to be sent to jail for wasting Liam Neesons time. Its the one rule in action movies. A good if not great villains to faceoff against the hero. If this movie starred some unknown actor than you can get away with weak villains. But if you Liam Neeson than you need to bring your A game people. One more thing. Robert Patrick is in this movie. The T1000 is in this movie. He's not the villain btw.

Thanks to his explosive training in the Marines, he was able to get in and out of banks to blow the vault and steal money. Over the course of nearly a decade he was able to steal 9 million dollars.In the beginning of the movie he runs into a woman who owns a storage unit business and ends up falling in love with her. He loves her so much he turns away from robbing banks and wants to wipe his slate clean and turn himself into the police, return the money, but on his terms and his agreement of a reduced sentence, minimum security, and special visitations within an hour of where he is.The FBI sends a couple agents named Nivens and Hall to speak with Neeson's character Tom to see if he is telling the truth. They do not suspect he is the real ""In and Out Bandit"" (which Tom hates the name by the way) because there is always people calling in claiming to be the bandit. Once they get to the hotel Tom is staying in they talk with him and he tells them a story only the real bandit would now. The agents still don't believe him and Tom offers to take them to where the money is housed. The storage units owned by Tom's love interest Annie. The agents tell him to stay put and they would look and be back. This then turns to the agents going to the storage unit and find boxes upon boxes of money. Hall wants to turn in the money and do his job. Nivens wants to take the money and write Tom off as another ""In and Out Bandit"" imposter and split the money with Hall. Nivens feeds on the fact that Hall is a family man with a wife and kids and tells him how much that money could help him and his family. Hall eventually goes along with it and they go back to the hotel to kill Tom so they can escape with the money.Without giving away too much, this turns into a cat and mouse chase between Tom and the agents. The agents, led by Nivens plans, tries their best to get Tom off their trail and kill him but Tom, being a former marine and explosive expert, is smarter and tougher than they think. They find out their theft of his money doesn't go anything like they planned. You don't steal from a man who wants to be an Honest Thief and start over life with the woman he loves.",Honest Thief

The action scenes are nothing like what you are used to, they're slow, and awkward, there is never any real tension, they just breeze through what could be decent fights like they are two old men wrestling for some old highschool beef.The characters who should evoke some sort of respect or appeal are presented tired and spineless, outside from the villain, who is just a knucklehead unable to really bring Intelligence into the FBI, they are all old and slow.

466,demarkle,5th Class Writers Effort,4,7 December 2020,"Although I usually enjoy Neeson films without fail (you always know what you're getting) I didn't enjoy this one and actually barely hung in for it. The action scenes are stating to show his age with fast cameras turns and angles that accommodate Neeson not really having to do much physically, understandable at 68. The story feels like the writers weren't really up to doing anything more than they really needed to to build out a skeletal story at best. The romantic lines in the movie are cringy and really made you roll your eyes a lot. Had I know how bad it was really going to be I wouldn't have bothered to begin with. Seen it, done it been there in much better action films.",Honest Thief
467,inkon-82292,Not the best of Liam Neeson but still ...,8,16 December 2020,This movie doesn't have as much suspense and action as Taken or The Commuter but it is still interesting and enjoyable.

468,cwitherick,Come on Liam .....your better than this,2,19 December 2020,The action isn't bad but the dialogue is just awful. The entire film is just predictable and it's been done 100 times over. The constant plot holes throughout the film are hilarious. The chemistry between Liam and his girlfriend is stale and robot like. Overall it's not bad if you just want to escape from this current crazy world.Bear,Honest Thief

476,jamescfrobinson-11022,Very weak and illogical plot.,3,27 July 2021,"The fundamental premise is very weak and makes the lead character unlikeable - or at least childishly stupid. Liam Neeson seems to be trapped in a typecasting nightmare. His charisma makes him watchable, but this film is stretching that attribute. It gets 3 stars only because the cast are good actors.",Honest Thief

Just a gigantic waste of time.",Honest Thief
479,aphex-41865,Why Why oh Why Liam.,3,4 April 2021,This movie is just lacking in any form of plausible storyline. It's so bad from the very start that it is impossible to salvage any type of credibility. The only saving grace is that it's Liam Neeson but even he cannot save this movie. There is some good action of course but without a plot to back it up falls way short of the mark. Not one of Liam's best. Will wait for the next one.,Honest Thief

The dialogues in the movie are so bad and cheesy, I genuinely wonder who approved this and recorded. Did they ever play it back before finishing this movie to check how this all sounds?

The whole thing is a giant cliché,
in turn every scene and character is a cliché,

Jai Courtney just comes off like an idiot, even though he can feel really threatening in other roles, so I'd think it's not his fault.Can be watched maybe once, if you feel like viewing a Liam Neeson action movie #34, but go in with low expectations.",Honest Thief

500,kfwvk,Patrick and Neeson should have switched roles,6,11 July 2021,"Decent concept, a bit thin on believability and Liam Neeson was the wrong person for the lead. Why? Because he's 15 years older than Kate Walsh (can't believe Annie would fall for Tom with that age difference) and he's not a believable American character (be can't hide his Irish accent - at least they could have made his character a former UK Marine) and he talks and runs like the 68-year-old that he was when this film was shot.Robert Patrick is a great actor and I liked his role, right up until they offed him at beginning of Act 2. I was sad to see him leave so soon.Also, setting this in Boston seems kind of random since absolutely nobody in the film has a Boston accent (thank God), except Jeffery Donovan as Sean Meyers, who makes a little effort at being Bostonian. This might have made more sense to be in San Francisco, a finance city.Just before the midpoint, Tom is sending Annie away and Annie says, ""Come with me."" And then 10 seconds later, she is resolved to leaving alone and says, ""Prove it, Tom. Prove that you didn't kill that man."" This feels unrealistic especially with the scene that puts Annie with no pules, then in the hospital, and then he's gets to go hard core on the crooked agents with her all better.One thing I did like... Neeson riding around in a '78 F-100 with round '77 headlights.My parting shot: they should have cast Patrick as the sympathetic lead and ex-marine ""Tom Dolan"" (see Patrick in The Unit) and Neeson as the salty FBI agent ""Samuel Baker"" (Neeson plays salty better than bar pretzels). At least Patrick is 6 years younger than Neeson and closer to Walsh's real age, to make the love story more believable.",Honest Thief

Fans of Jeffrey Donovan from BURN NOTICE and Robert Patrick from TERMINATOR 2 and SCORPION, will love seeing them here. Loved the chemistry between Neeson and Kate Walsh. Walsh didn't just play the girlfriend. Her character is the reason that Neeson's bank robber decides to turn himself in to the FBI. The ways that the script had of her character and the other characters interacting with Neeson's character were very satisfying. Writer/Director Mark Williams pares his film down to a sleek 92 minutes or so (not counting the final credits). This was a wise choice. Not a moment in the story is wasted.",Honest Thief
