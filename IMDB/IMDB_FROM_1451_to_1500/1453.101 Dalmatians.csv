0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not as good as the animation, but well worth watching!",7,1 April 2009,"There is a lot to enjoy, especially Glenn Close's near-perfect performance as Cruella DeVil. She was absolutely brilliant here, truly evil, and was clearly having a lot of fun. Hugh Laurie made a memorable appearance as Jasper, and some of his lines are very funny. The scenes in the mansion, were inspired, I think by the Home Alone franchise, and for this sort of film it did work. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are more subdued but deliver very human portrayals of the Dearlys. Joan Plowright was fine also as the nanny. And Michael Kamen's music was lovely. However, I much prefer the animated version to this, and here's why. The dogs were very cute, but nothing they did was particularly interesting. Also the Twilight Bark sequence was lost, and that's what made the animation so poignant. It also isn't as entertaining as the animated version. All in all, an entertaining film, that just lacked the ingredients that made the animated version a masterpiece. 7/10 Bethany Cox",101 Dalmatians
1,Leofwine_draca,Rollocking energy,6,14 September 2021,"A lot better live action Disney film than I was expecting, better than the animated version in fact. Sure, Glenn Close is pure pantotime, but the various British cast members are surprisingly funny and the story has a good rollocking energy to it.",101 Dalmatians
2,SnoopyStyle,needs the animal voices,5,11 December 2014,"Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a struggling American video game designer living in London with his pet dalmatian Pongo. Anita Campbell-Green (Joely Richardson) works for fur-loving fashion designer Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close). Cruella becomes obsessed with Anita's dalmatian prints and designs a fur cape. Pongo sees Perdy the dalmatian and drags Roger to chase down Anita with Perdy. Roger eventually marries Anita. They get pregnant while Pongo and Perdy have 15 puppies. Roger refuses to sell Cruella the puppies and she fires Anita. Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams) are De Vil's criminal henchmen who overpower Nanny (Joan Plowright) and kidnap the puppies.This movie is missing the voices from the animals. That's really half of the charm of the animated movie. This is a lesser remake for no good reason. Making Cruella a fashion designer is a good improvement. It makes more sense to have her as Anita's boss. However, that's the only improvement from the animated version that I can see here. Glenn Close tries hard to be a cartoon villain but I do miss her cool car. A real version isn't the same thing. And the CG is not advanced enough to make the animated dogs real. The kids are better off watching the cartoon.",101 Dalmatians
3,lee_eisenberg,Ms. DeVil's opus,5,10 September 2017,"Prior to 1996, Stephen Herek had directed three of the most dissimilar movies: ""Critters"", ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" (he also directed ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"", which I haven't seen). Therefore, it was a surprise to see him direct a live-action adaptation of ""101 Dalmatians"".Since we already know the plot, the movie itself isn't that much of a treat. Even so, you gotta love Glenn Close's over-the-top performance as the fur-obsessed Cruella DeVil. Close plays her more as a self-aggrandizing megalomaniac than an evil thug. The rest of the cast isn't as impressive in their performances, but we see some good people here. We all know Jeff Daniels. Joely Richardson is the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave; her sister Natasha married Liam Neeson but died in a skiing accident in 2009. Joan Plowright is a classically trained actress who was married to Laurence Olivier from 1961 until his death. Hugh Laurie is best known as TV's Dr. House. Mark Williams is now known as Ron Weasley's dad in the Harry Potter movies. Tim McInnerny is now known for the role of Lord Robett Glover on ""Game of Thrones"".It'll be an OK thing to let the tykes watch if you need to keep them entertained for a brief period. The ""Home Alone""-style mishaps rained upon Jasper and Horace will hold their attention. I doubt that anyone else will enjoy it that much.",101 Dalmatians
4,jboothmillard,101 Dalmatians,6,24 March 2005,"The original Disney animated version is outstanding, as a child I was most excited about a live-action remake, screenplay by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone), directed by Stephen Herek (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure). Basically American video game designer Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) lives in London with his male pet dalmatian Pongo, fashion designer Anita Campbell-Green (Joely Richardson) works as a fashion designer at the House of de Vil, she has a female pet dalmatian named Perdita, or Perdy. Pongo finds love at first sight with Perdy at St. James's Park, and vice versa, both dogs end up chasing each other frantically, Roger and Anita also fall in love after this chance meeting, they get married along with Pongo and Perdy. At the House of de Vil, Anita's boss the pampered and very glamorous Cruella de Vil (Golden Globe nominated Glenn Close) has a huge passion for fur, going so far as to have taxidermist Mr. Skinner (John Shrapnel) skin a white tiger from London Zoo to make into a rug of her own. Anita, inspired by the spotty fur of Perdy, designs a coat made of spotted fur, Cruella is intrigued to create a garment made of actual dalmatians, she finds it amusing that it would be as if she was wearing Anita's dog. Roger and Anita are happy about the news that Anita is pregnant, Nanny (Joan Plowright) recognised the signs, and they also overjoyed when Pongo and Perdita are expecting puppies, Cruella visits them, expressing contempt upon meeting Roger and disgust they are expecting a baby, but she is delighted to hear that puppies are coming as well. Several weeks later, Perdita has a litter of fifteen puppies, Cruella arrives soon after they are born, she offers £7,500 to take the puppies when they are ready to leave Roger and Anita refuse, Cruella angry vows revenge. After a few weeks, Cruella's henchmen Horace (Mark Williams) and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) break into Roger and Anita's home while they and their dogs are out to steal the puppies, they also have eighty-four other dalmatians stolen, making a total of ninety-nine, they are taken to Cruella's ancient country estate, De Vil Mansion, to await Mr. Skinner to kill them and create her coat. Roger and Anita's family are devastated, while they inform the police Pongo uses the Twilight Bark to carry a message via dogs and other animals of England, eventually a dog who witnessed the dog-napping helps animals to locate the missing puppies to the mansion. The witness dog and a number of animals aid the escape of the puppies, Horace and Jasper eventually realise this is happening, Cruella is furious that his henchmen have let the dogs get away, she decides to look for them herself. The puppies are reunited with Pongo and Perdy at the nearby farm where they are hiding, Horace and Jasper attempt to find them, experiencing many mishaps along the way, while Cruella finds the farm, she tries to kill the puppies, only to have the farm animals outwit her, including throwing her into a vat of molasses and into the outside pig pen. In the end, Cruella, Horace and Jasper, and Mr. Skinner are arrested, Pongo, Perdy and their puppies are reunited with Roger and Anita, the police inform them that the eighty-four other puppies have no home to go to, they decide to adopt, Roger designs a successful video game with dalmatians and Cruella as the villain, and they move to a large house in the countryside. Also starring Tim McInnerny as Alonzo, Hugh Fraser as Frederick, Coronation Street's Brian Capron as Television News Reporter and EastEnders' Hilda Braid as Woman on Park Bench. Close is perfectly cast as the rich bitch with the brilliant evil laugh and plan to turn innocent puppies into something to drape around her neck, Daniels and Richardson are fine, and Laurie and Williams are amusing as the bumbling henchmen. The story follows roughly exactly the same format as the original film, only subtle changes, it is a shame the dogs do not speak, they and the other animals are cute to watch, but do not have as vibrant personalities, but you can forgive this for the funny moments and simple story, obviously over-the-top Close steals the show, all the family will be entertained by this fun comedy adventure. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Cruella De Vil was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Good!",101 Dalmatians
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Colorful, Cute & Clichéd",6,1 July 2006,"This is one of those movies that truly is - and I don't mean to use the cliché - entertaining whether you are a kid or an adult. The dalmatians and other animals are a lot of fun to watch.Glenn Close must have had a lot of fun making this film, playing the evil ""Cruela De Vil."" Just as much fun, maybe more, were the two bumbling dog-nappers - Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, I believe - idiots who were genuinely funny in their stupidity. Their dialog was hilarious.There are nice colors in here, too, so a widescreen DVD is good to have if you enjoy this movie. I didn't find the surround sound to be much.Speaking of clichés and such, there are some drawbacks here that were a little annoying to me, like overdoing the intelligence of the dogs, making them almost human-like with their abilities to understand English. In fact, it's taken to the absurd level level of some of the animals being smarter than humans. Please....give me a break! Also, you get the quick ""film romance"" in which two people (Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson) barely meet and already they are in love, getting married in no time. Please....give me a break!Still, recommended if you want a want 103 minutes of a ""cute"" story and don't take any of it the least bit seriously as if anything in here could really happen.",101 Dalmatians
6,moonspinner55,A soggy doggy-bone...but Close gives it some kick,3,14 October 2007,"Recycled comedy from Disney (now infamous for recycling their classic goods) featuring a bland London couple who are frantic after a fur-wearing sadist dog-naps their litter of Dalmatian puppies. John Hughes adapted his script from Dodie Smith's book, which was previously animated by the studio in 1961. Reedy-thin family-oriented nonsense has very few honest laughs, with a story that goes around in circles, culminating in a brainless slapstick chase and rescue. Comparisons to the animated film are useless, even though Glenn Close pulls out all the stops as Cruella De Vil. She's well in the spirit of the piece (aided by terrific make-up and costuming) and gives it a much-needed boost. Otherwise, the film targets easy-laughers who don't mind a soggy Milkbone. Followed by 2000 sequel, ""102 Dalmatians"". *1/2 from ****",101 Dalmatians
7,edwagreen,101 Dalmatians-Home Alone With the Animals **1/2,5,17 October 2009,"The picture is definitely for children. Stars Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson have so little to do after their park meeting with their his and her dogs, brief courtship and marriage.Glenn Close steals the film with her over the top performance as Cruela de Vil, a tyrant of a woman. The character has basically been created out of a mixture of Norma Desmond, Phyllis Diller and Lucille LaVerne. The latter did the voice of the wicked witch in 1936's ""Snow White,"" and was totally memorable as the revolutionary carrying small guillotines with a hearty laugh in ""Tale of 2 Cities,"" the year before.The film really takes off for children when it comes down to Cruela and her stooges taking it on the chin from the variety of animals sounding the alert when the 15 puppies are kidnapped.",101 Dalmatians
8,CinemaSerf,"""A Handbag!!""... and a coat, gloves, wrap, scarf,....",6,28 March 2020,"Unfortunately, this is really just a vehicle for a wonderfully sinister Glenn Close as Dodie Smith's aptly named ""Cruella De Vil"". She has a penchant for fur; and the finer and more rare the better. When she discovers that Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson have a whole 101 Dalmatians, she reckons a new coat beckons and dispatches a couple of her crazily inept henchmen to carry out the simple task of dognapping them. At times it is quite funny, but all in a rather predictable way. A solid British cast help to keep this simmering along but it's really just one for the kids.",101 Dalmatians
9,grantss,"Cute, but very silly at times, and not as good as the original",5,19 May 2015,"Cute, but very silly at times, and not as good as the original.The original 101 Dalmatians, released in 1961, was an animation classic. Adorable characters, nice story, happy ending. Mostly meant for kids but had something in it for adults too. It wasn't perfect though: after a wonderful opening act it did lose some of its charm and substance and degenerated into a caper towards the end. This 1996 remake of 101 Dalmatians takes the same plot, almost to the letter, de-animates it and throws in more silliness. There are a few positive things added, mostly in dialogue in the first few scenes, and I thought the real dogs were quite cute, even compared to the animated ones, but most of the changes are for the worse.One big positive of this remake, however, is Glenn Close's portrayal of Cruella De Vil. Suitably intense and menacing.Overall, very little reason to watch this if you've seen the original. And if you haven't, then watch the original instead...",101 Dalmatians
10,Boba_Fett1138,Great children entertainment.,6,22 October 2005,"""101 Dalmatians"" is perfectly good clean children entertainment. It's has a fun feeling and atmosphere and some great characters.John Hughes his writing style is notable in this movie. The characters and the humor are similar to his other movies such as the well know movie ""Home Alone"". The humor is slapstick like at times (especially with the villains Jasper and Horace) which works very effective for a fun children movie like this one.Of course everything is terribly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie comes as a surprise. It's simple fun and entertainment. The humor is simple but it's good and works effective.Glenn Close is perfectly cast as über-villain Cruella De Vil and portrays a highly memorable character. She truly is the highlight of the movie and steals the show. She also seemed to had lots of fun playing the over-the-top villainous but oh so fun character. Also good are the more slapstick like, stereotypical villains Jasper and Horace played by Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams. Another fun villain role is played by John Shrapnel who is perhaps best known for his role in ""Gladiator"".The fun and perhaps also a bit underrated musical score is done by Michael Kamen. It quite honestly is one of his better works.Children will enjoy watching this movie and I can know, since I actually saw this movie back in the cinema, when I was still a child myself.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",101 Dalmatians
11,view_and_review,"Glenn Close Great, Remake Was Not",6,22 December 2020,"Remaking ""101 Dalmations"" in which the animals don't talk is a big gamble and not a particularly good gamble.

12,anaconda-40658,101 Reasons to Hate It.,2,3 February 2016,"101 Dalmatians (1996): Dir: Stephen Herek / Cast: Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels, Joely Richardson, Joan Plowright, Hugh Laurie: Pathetic live action version of the animated Disney classic is a complete failure with lavish production. It regards quantity as these dogs band together to survive. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson own two Dalmatians that give birth to fifteen pups and the evil Cruella DeVil wishes to make fur coats out of them. The dogs are a disappointment since they do not talk as they did in the animation. One would think that after the success of Babe that this wouldn't be a problem. This film contains none of the suspense or detail of the animated classic, which makes the plot here seem very basic. It was as if the makers thought that making a live version was enough but without those important details of the animation it just comes off as bland with only an effective villain to carry it. Director Stephen Herek doesn't heed details from the animation. This ranks with The Mighty Ducks as among Herek's worst efforts. Glenn Close steals the film with her icy performance as DeVil making her the film's best asset. Daniels and Richardson sleepwalk through bland roles with Joan Plowright as their maid. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams play the idiotic henchmen nabbing the dogs. It is yet another bad adaptation that turns into a big budget dog show. Score: 2 ½ / 10",101 Dalmatians
13,JamesHitchcock,Never likely to replace the original in my affection,7,9 January 2015,"Dodie Smith's 1956 novel ""The Hundred and One Dalmatians"" was made into a very successful Disney cartoon in 1961, but 35 years later the same studio clearly thought it was time for a live-action remake. The cartoon was a great favourite of mine during my childhood, so reviewing this remake, which did not appear until I was in my thirties, is something of a difficult task for me.The plot essentially follows that of the earlier film rather than that of the novel, although there are some departures from both. It restores the original surname of the Dalmatians' owners, Dearly, although Roger here becomes an American, although the film is still set in England. He is also a computer-game designer rather than a composer (as in the cartoon) or a financier (as in the novel). His wife Anita becomes a fashion designer and an employee of Cruella's company rather than her old schoolmate. (Possibly because Glenn Close is eighteen years older than Joely Richardson, so the idea of their having been at school together would have been rather implausible). As in the original, the human characters are all rather overshadowed by the dogs and other animals, with one notable exception The original Cruella de Vil was perhaps Disney's most iconic villainess- indeed, possibly their most iconic villain of either sex- so they needed someone equally charismatic here, and found her in the shape of Glenn Close. This was not her first appearance as a villain; possibly her best-known previous role had been that of the vindictive Alex Forrest in ""Fatal Attraction"", and she had also played the scheming Marquise de Merteuil in ""Dangerous Liaisons"". Those two performances, however, were very different to the one she gives here. In the two earlier films she was concerned to give a realistic psychological portrait of evil; in the case of Alex, moreover, there is an implication that she is almost as much sinned against as sinning. There is nothing psychologically realistic about Cruella. Close plays her as an over-the-top pantomime villain, hamming it up and gleefully overacting- which is exactly what the role calls for. I was surprised to learn that Glenn Close was not the first choice for the part. (That was, apparently, Sigourney Weaver).The main difference between this film and the cartoon is perhaps one of tone. In contrast to the hectic look and garish colours of some Disney cartoons, the original ""101 Dalmatians"" has a surprisingly restrained, elegant visual style, typified by a palette dominated by (appropriately enough) black and white, along with cool blues, greys and purples. Elegance and restraint are qualities quite alien to this remake, which is not surprising given that it was produced and written by John Hughes, a man to whom those qualities are equally alien. (He was also responsible for films like ""Weird Science"", ""Flubber"" and the ""Home Alone"" franchise. Enough said). As one might imagine with Hughes, the film makes great use of slapstick humour, complete with fart jokes, poo jokes, a vat of molasses joke and a skunk joke. (Yes, I know skunks are not native to the British Isles, but Hughes evidently doesn't. That is not his only zoological goof- he also introduces a raccoon to the Suffolk countryside, around 3,000 miles away from its natural habitat, and that woodpecker is of a North American, not European, species).Apart from Close, the film's big selling-point is that real Dalmatians, whether adults or puppies, are even cuter than their animated counterparts. This film, however, is never likely to replace the original in my affections. 7/10",101 Dalmatians
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,Pointless remake,4,8 August 2004,"101 Dalmatians, the ultimate Disney animated classic about none other than PUPPIES! It was clever, sharp, witty and just a wonderful movie and created one of Disney's most memorable and classic villains Cruella DeVil. So when I had heard about the live action version I wasn't too interested, this movie came out when I was 11 years old for goodness's sake, but I just didn't want to see what was already a perfect movie being made into a live action one, but my grandparents had bought it and we watched it together. I remember seeing it and really didn't like it, but as I grew up, it was on TV one day so I figured since I'm a little more grown up to give this another chance and still I'm not too thrilled with this new take on the ""tail"", lol, get it? Eh, my lame jokes, gotta love them.Roger Dearly is an American computer game designer, who shares his home in London with his pet dalmatian, Pongo. One day Roger takes Pongo for a walk, and the dog sets his eyes on a beautiful female Dalmatian named Perdy. After a frantic chase through the streets of London, Roger and Pongo discover Perdy likes Pongo; and Perdy's owner, fashion designer Anita Campbell-Green, is taken with Roger when they meet in St. James Park. Romance blossoms between both human and canine couples and Roger and Anita walk down the aisle. Anita works for Cruella DeVil, a sexy fashion maven with a great love for cigarettes and fur. Anita becomes inspired by her dogs and designs a fur coat made with spotted fur, causing Cruella to leap on the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians. When Cruella learns that Perdy has given birth to fifteen Dalmatian puppies she offers the couple a decent price for the newborn puppies, but the couple refuses. Flying into a maniacal rage, she fires Anita and vows to get even. She has her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, steal the puppies and deliver them to her ancient estate, but the puppies escape and now must find their way home.So I absolutely adore Glenn Close, she's one of my favorite actresses of all time and always delivers very on the key performances, now she was a great choice for Cruella, but I think it was just the whole idea of the movie that dragged her down, the whole cast as a matter of a fact is too good for this movie. It's just not as fun as the original animated classic, I think the reason the animated movie is so much better is because it was just more special and personal as it was hand drawn and a classic for so many kids who grew up with it. Maybe I am being stubborn where I'm just more for the original, but honestly this movie is just kind of pointless and not really for the kids nore the adults. I'd say it's not like it's the most horrible movie in the world, but it's just not worth it to go out of your way to watch it.4/10",101 Dalmatians

16,OllieSuave-007,Silly Disney film with a great villain.,5,14 February 2014,"This is the live-action version of 101 Dalmations, a story where Fashion designer Anita (Joley Richardson) and computer-game writer Roger (Jeff Daniels) meet and got married along with their dalmatians, Perdita and Pongo. The dogs' puppies are later kidnapped by Anita's boss Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close), who is plotting to use their fur for a coat. As a result, Pongo and Perdita set out on a mission to find and rescue all their ninety-nine children from Cruella and her cohorts, Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams).Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did an OK job in their acting and the execution and effects of the dogs were nicely done. However, the plot and story were filmed in the way that the animals were portrayed as ""so cute that they're annoying."" They're just a bunch of animals running around on the set and serving really no purpose or development in the movie, as opposed to the original animated version, where many of the dogs were given his/her own unique personality and charm. As a result, I ended up rooting for the villain. Glenn Close did an amazing job playing Cruella DeVil - crafty, sly and hilariously captivating. She basically stole the stage for me and it is rare that I would be rooting for a villain in a movie, which tells you how corny or annoying the heroes (animals) in this movie were.Overall, it's probably a good one for the little kids, but adults would probably prefer the animated one over this one.Grade C-",101 Dalmatians

18,Bored_Dragon,Animals are awesome :D,7,14 February 2018,"Featured adaptation of ""101 Dalmatians"" resembles of a cult ""Home Alone"", but instead of a forgotten boy, we have a large number of varied animals, who are trying to save the puppies from two clumsy robbers in the service of 
Cruella De Vil. Cast is made mostly of English actors, who perfectly imitate cartoon characters. One of the bandits is Hugh Laurie, a genius Dr. House, and Glenn Close, six times Oscar nominee, perfectly presented the role of Cruella. There is also Joan Plowright, a widow of Laurence Olivier, who definitely deserves to be more famous for her roles than for her late husband. Special recognition must be given to dog handlers who were in charge of the 250 dalmatians used for filming. Movie objectively probably deserves a lower grade, but animals, which, unlike those in the original, can not speak, impressed me so much with their performance, and even brought me to tears on several occasions, that I can not rate it less than a strong seven.

22,filipemanuelneto,A good movie for the whole family.,6,15 May 2017,"This film is a live-action that repeats and updates the story of ""101 Dalmatians"", an animated film that Disney launched in the early sixties. The plot has some minor changes and is brought to our time, but its virtually the same in both films. One of the most drastic changes, however, is that the animals in this film don't speak, even though they demonstrate intelligence and know how to face danger. The human cast has Jeff Daniels, Joely Richardson, Joan Plowright and Hugh Fraser, very experienced British and American actors, but its Glenn Close who stands out, in the iconic role of the villain, Cruella De Vil, giving us one of the most remarkable performances of her career so far, and the best interpretation of what, for many, is Disney's biggest villain. Remarkable! The team that created the costumes of this character also deserves congratulations, combining charm and good taste with Cruella's sinister attraction by genuine fur (of course, in the film they weren't real fur). Situational jokes are the strongest part of the film, thanks to Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, who brought to life the two absolutely stupid thugs who were supposed to keep the dogs under control. They're the main comic element, contrasting with the sweetness of those little puppies. It's a great movie for the whole family to watch together, have a laugh and spend some quality time together.",101 Dalmatians
23,southdavid,Dalmat-shun this film!,2,10 October 2019,"Does any writer have such an ""off the cliff"" plummet as John Hughes? ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty In Pink"", ""Ferris Bueller"" to endless straight to video ""Home Alone"" and ""Beethoven"" sequels. ""101 Dalmatians"" a live action remake of the Disney animation, decades before that was the company's mission statement, was around the start of Hughes's downturn in fortunes. (Critically If not necessarily financially, as inexplicably, this film was a big hit).Freelance video game programmer (...no, really) Roger (Jeff Daniels) and Anita (Joely Richardson) a fashion designer, meet, bond and fall in love primarily as their matching Dalmatian dogs have done the same. Anita designs a coat inspired by the spotted pelts of her dog, which in turn inspires her boss Cruella DeVil (Glenn Close) - noted advocate of using fur and not fussy about where it comes from, to steal 99 puppies, including those belonging to Roger and Anita's pets. Hilarity does not ensue.I'm hoping it's clear from my tone, that I think this film is awful. I'll leave my smug adult retrospectives to the next paragraph and just focus on the fact that the film badly acted, pedestrianly shot and lacking in heart, humour and story. Glenn Close looks like she's having fun, snarling like a pantomime villain and if you like slapstick, which I don't, Mark Williams and Hugh Laurie are bringing all the slapstick. The puppets are occasionally quite good, much better than the CGI, which is painful.Let's get to the observations. First, the police have NOTHING on DeVil at the end, other than the circumstantial evidence that the dogs were found near a village she owns a property in. There's some talk that they found evidence of her plan - but what was that? A three step plan to making a dog coat, 1. Steal Dogs, 2. Kill Dogs, 3. Make Coat. It was Anita that designed the outfit, arrest her! She's rich, she'll have decent lawyers - if she can convince the idiots to keep their mouths shut about her involvement, she definitely walks.ALSO. At one point both Roger and Anita are unemployed yet can afford a house, not only in London, not only in central London, but seemingly one around 100 metres from the Houses Of Parliament. Even in 1996, this house would be worth £5-£6 Million and I find this the most implausible part of the film.

25,lisafordeay,A cute live action movie all about Dalmatians,8,26 October 2010,I have seen this so many times on TV and every time its on I have to watch it again and here is why.101 Dalmatians is a live action Disney movie based on the animated version. The movie is about two Dalmatians who meet in a park along with their owners who both fall for each other and they have 15 puppies. Anita(Joey Richardson) is a fashion designer who works for the evil Cruella De Vil(played by the brilliant Glenn Close who is sporting a Sharon Osbourne do)steals Anita's puppies along with other Dalmatian puppies to make a spotted coat. She hires two dim-witted burglars who helps her get the puppies with hilarious cauos along the way with the other animals that save the puppies from the evil Cruella.I liked this film as it was cute and adorable how we see two Dalmatians falling in love even though they have different owners(Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb & Dumber flick and the late Natasha Richardson's sister Joey Richardson who play the owners who decide to marry so that there dogs could be together). Its kinda hard to explain this film as its all about animals been kidnapped by an evil woman who wants to make a Dalmatian coat.Anyway if you like animals then check it out. Its a really nice film as well as a very funny one too.,101 Dalmatians
26,strong-122-478885,The Biggest Bitch Of Them All,2,4 December 2014,"101 Dalmatians was a bland, inadequate, and completely dissatisfying live-action remake of the charming 1961 animated feature film of the same name - Both from Disney Studios.101 Dalmatians starts its story off as a horribly contrived boy-meets-girl tale where the thing that brings these 2 sappy people together is that each is the proud owner of a dalmatian dog - His is a male - Hers is a female. (Now, isn't that just too corny for words, or what?) 101 Dalmations' biggest and most damaging deficit was actress Glenn Close, as the ruthless fashion-house owner, Cruella De Vil. Close was truly terrible at this sort of Comedy. Her annoying, over-the-top, scenery-chewing antics weren't even in the least bit amusing, only nasty and just plain awful. Her despicable character quickly wore out its welcome within the very first hour of this picture.101 Dalmatians was the sort of story where the animals appear to be more intelligent and resourceful than their human counterparts. It wasn't until this film's last 45 minutes that these mighty clever beasts (dogs, raccoons, horses, and birds, alike) eagerly took their heroic part and ingeniously pulled together in order to help rescue the 99 dalmatian puppies from their deadly confines at Cruella's posh Suffolk estate.Through all of this strife one really had to wonder about the rationality and sanity of the ludicrous Cruella character who wanted more than anything in the whole, wide world - A full-length coat fashioned out of dalmatian puppy pelts. It was really quite unsettling to see what a kick Cruella got out of the thought that once she had her coat of dog hair, she'd actually be wearing her employee's dogs.Now, I ask you - Is that not just too unfunny and demented for words, or what??",101 Dalmatians
27,kevin_robbins,This isn't an all time classic Disney live action film but it is still very good and worth a viewing,8,16 September 2021,"101 Dalmatians (1996) is a movie I recently watched on Disney+ with my daughter. The storyline follows an aspiring fashion designer whose boss, Cruella Deville, loves black and white and is always looking for the newest, latest greatest fashion design. When she sees a jacket by the aspiring designer in black and white and sees a picture of her Dalmatian, Cruella becomes obsessed with using Dalmatian skin to create the designer outfit. The designer will have to do everything in her power to protect Dalmatians from Cruella. This movie is directed by Stephen Herek (Billand Ted's Excellent Adventure) and stars Glen Close (Air Force One), Jeff Daniels (Dumb & Dumber), Joely Richardson (The Patriot) and John Shrapnel (Gladiator). The storyline for this picture isn't as good as the recent Cruella movie but has a very similar approach and primary plot. The fashion in this is awesome and Close was a great Cruella. The cinematography and special effects were also very good. I loved the scenes in the snow and the ending was excellent and very fun. The last 15 minutes was probably my favorite part of the movie. There's also some great comedic aspects intertwined into the story as well, like the electric fence and pig pen sequences. I even liked the video game ending. Overall this isn't an all time classic Disney live action film but it is still very good and worth a viewing. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",101 Dalmatians
28,dwpollar,Enjoyable live-action remake ...,6,10 March 2001,1st watched 9/23/1998 - (Dir-Stephen Herek): Enjoyable live-action remake of Disney classic.

29,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent remake of a pure Disney classic,9,18 January 2006,"101 DALMATIANS, in my opinion, is an excellent remake of a pure Disney classic. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Pongo and Perdita set out on their mission. If you ask me, Cruella (Glenn Close), Horace (Mark Williams), and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) were truly devious. If I were Pongo or Perdita, I'd probably do the same thing they did. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the production design was beautiful, the performances were top-grade, the direction was flawless, and Disney has done it again. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney classic to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",101 Dalmatians
30,davispittman,Close steals the show,7,20 March 2017,"It is very true that Glenn Close steals the show as Cruella DeVil. She talks, looks, and acts exactly like a live action version of her should. The car, the costumes, the house, everything about her character is wonderfully done. It's needless to say that she deserved that golden globe nomination. The set and costume designs are great. Cruella's house and the old wear house where they wanna do the skinning is perfect, and also the fashion house, the house of DeVil. The fur coats and fashion designs are incredible, it's better in 102 Dalmatians but it's still great here, Cruella's clothing in damn near every scene was spot on perfect. Joely Richardson was very good and very fitting for the character of Anita. And so was Rodger. The movie is very reminiscent of the 1961 animated feature, except of course they can't have her henchmen crashing into her car at the end, but other than that it's pretty similar. I would suggest this movie to families everywhere because it really is great family fun. There's no surprises and the characters are very cartoon like, but really you have to expect that with a film like this. 7/10 for 101 Dalmatians (1996).",101 Dalmatians

33,lemon_magic,Live action remake of an animated classic can't quite match the charm of the original,7,23 November 2006,"Considered as a ""stand alone"" story, ""101 Dalmations"" is a pretty good ""gimmick"" film, far better than recent, relatively uninspired fodder in the same vein like ""Racing Strips"" and comparable to a fun romp like ""Cats And Dogs"". But given its pedigree (sorry), the remake is something of a disappointment - almost every 'change' they made to the updated version causes the plot to fall short of the original.In its favor: Yes, Glenn Close was born to play a live version of ""Cruella De Vil"". Critics were all goo-goo eyed about her performance, but they didn't seem to notice that vocally she adds nothing that Betty Lou Gershon didn't have 35 years ago. Still, it's a lot of fun watching her stomp around in those ridiculous outfits and chew the scenery mercilessly. Hugh Laurie gives a spot on performance as one of the bumbling henchman that adds a jolt of energy to the movie whenever he's on camera (and his cohort is quite decent playing a Laurel to his Hardy). In fact, there aren't any ""bad"" performances in '101D', at least not from the human cast.Also in its favor: the screenplay goes to a lot of trouble to keep many of the most memorable elements of the original: the scene where Roger revives Lucky, the Twilight Bark, the puppies escape from the sinister old house while the henchman are watching TV etc. It couldn't have been easy to pull these things off even with CGI and animal trainers.Missing or problematic: Well, the puppies are darned cute, of course, and the scenes where there are massive numbers of little Dalmation puppies swarming down stair cases, across fields, hiding in hay barns, etc, are exactly as adorable and eye-catching as you would expect. But unlike the original, in which 4 or 5 of the puppies had speaking parts, none of the puppies have any personalities (just ""gimmicks""). Similarly, Pongo and Perty don't really come into focus as ""people"" either - they are mostly blank canvases on which you have to project emotions.More importantly, the most intense part of the original plot - where the fleeing dogs manage to sneak onto a moving van under the noses of their pursuers, followed by a thrilling car chase - is tossed aside. Instead, Cruella meets her ""Waterloo"" at the ""hands"" of the animals in the hay-barn in a series of clever pratfalls and the henchmen just sort of stumble around the countryside and do themselves in. Yes, it's fairly funny...but it's just not as satisfying as the original denouement, because the Dalmations just aren't involved in it. And a minor quibble: making Roger a video game designer instead of a songwriter adds absolutely nothing to the movie and is in fact a pretty lame and transparent ploy - a fact the screenplay acknowledges by including the ""Cruella De Vil"" song (which Roger supposedly composed in the original) at the end of the movie in the credits.Anyway, it's still a pretty fair movie with some good strong performances from the human cast and some pleasant puppy based spectacles here and there. I can guarantee that little kids will love it. And I like it too...it's just not a strong as the original.",101 Dalmatians
34,JuguAbraham,Great film in photography and acting departments,6,22 November 2000,"When the film is over, you are complimenting Glenn Close. Those of us who remember the Disney cartoon we will recall the headlights of the vans in the night creating sharp cones--and here we have Adrian Biddle doing just that with his camera. The film is what it is because of Biddle and Close. Watch it again, and you will see Biddle's outstanding angles and output!This is not just a kiddie movie, it's a move adults could love equally. Close is a delight to watch any day.",101 Dalmatians
35,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,I feel bad for the actors...,2,22 December 2014,"I can remember clear as day when I was eight and my sister and I begged my dad to buy this on VHS for us. We were in a ""puppies are so cute"" phase, which long ago faded (I now hate dogs and think they're disgusting, dirty animals). Nevertheless, we watched it and were both shocked at how bad it was! Don't get me wrong, the actors were amazing despite the pathetic storyline. Glenn Close provides an outstanding performance as the antagonistic businesswoman who thrives on conspicuous consumption and adores wearing a variety of fur coats. The soundtrack wasn't bad. But the plot was terrible, it was like watching a twisted romance film, and the crude humor was gross and unnecessary (dogs peeing on magazines, etc). The names of the characters are sort of clever but still unoriginal and it's Disney, so of course it's that hokey ""puppy love"" garbage.As I got older and checked out the movie online, I was surprised to discover that the dogs used in the movie were not treated in compliance with the animal cruelty prevention laws set in place at the time of filming. That's Disney for ya, too cheap to take care of its live animals on-set but rich enough to pay people to shut up.I highly recommend you avoid this one, it's incredibly lame and dorky, not to mention inappropriate for younger children at times. If you're into dog movies, try Beethoven, it's dopey but at least it's funny most of the time.",101 Dalmatians
36,Sirus_the_Virus,"Without Glen Close, this movie would be crap.",7,13 October 2009,"Glenn Close stars as an evil bitch named Cruel Devil in 101 Dalmations. I don't think that is right. She stars as Cruella Devile in 101 Dalmations. Let me just say, that this movie is funny and fun and cute. But to me, this movie would be total crap without Glenn Close because even in a movie like this she is excellent. I have seen the show Damages with her and she is such a bitch, it's great. I guess she was born to play a bitch. I am pretty sure we all know the story. Cruella Devile wants to make a coat with Dalmation fur. So she hears that a couple has just had 101 Dalmations, she tries so anxiously to take the puppies fur. The only problem that I had with this movie is that all of the pets fight back. I just think it's kind of silly. But besides that, I liked the film.It's got a good cast. Including Jeff Daniels, Joley Richardson, and Hugh Laurie as a villain who tries to steal the dogs. Or a henchmen whatever. I know it's not a great movie but you know what, I still give it a thumbs up.101 Dalmations:***/****",101 Dalmatians

38,Beta_Gallinger,Lacks way too much to compete with the 1961 animated version,4,18 February 2010,"Last month, I watched the animated 1967 Disney film, ""The Jungle Book"", for the first time in I don't know how long and maybe for the first time ever from beginning to end. I then watched the live action 1994 Disney flick of the same name, which I also hadn't seen in a long time. This month, I watched the 60's animated Disney version of ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" and then watched this 90's live action version. I first saw the cartoon probably in the early 90's, before the release of this film with the number in the title shown in digits instead of words. I think I first saw this one in 1997, probably not long after it came out on video. I'm not sure exactly what I thought of it, but didn't see it again until this year, and now I think it's pretty dull.Roger is an American video game designer who lives in London, England and owns a male Dalmatian dog named Pongo. Anita is a fashion designer in London who owns a female Dalmatian named Perdy and works for a mean-spirited lunatic named Cruella de Vil who longs for a fur coat made from Dalmatian skin. One day, Pongo and Perdy both happen to be out for a walk with their owners in the park when they see each other and fall in love. They put their owners through mayhem while they chase after each other, but the two humans soon fall in love as well. Roger and Anita get married, so the four of them all live together and Perdy is soon expecting puppies while Anita is expecting a baby. After fifteen Dalmatian puppies are born, Cruella wants them all, but Roger and Anita refuse to sell them to her. She fires Anita and soon sends in two henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to kidnap the puppies for her! The two Dalmatian parents leave the house to try and find their offspring and call upon other animals to help them, while Cruella wants the puppies killed soon before the police find them! During my first viewing, it didn't take me long to realize that this film's version of Cruella de Vil, played by Glenn Close, comes very close (no pun intended) to the animated version of the character, but the Roger in this live action flick, played by Jeff Daniels, is a lot different. However, the problem with this Roger is not that he is different, but he doesn't stand out the way the cartoon Roger does. Daniels can be very funny, but he isn't here, which leads me to the humour, another problem. I never laughed while watching this film recently, and VERY seldom did I even smile, only in scenes such as the ""cup of marriage"" one, and the part where Horace does exactly what Jasper tells him not to do when he meets Skinner. Fairly lame parts include the ""Whizzer"" scene, and Nanny, the human housekeeper, barking in her sleep. The scenes with Jasper and Horace are generally not nearly as funny as the ones in the animated film, even if the actors who play them here, Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, fit their respective roles. Some things are done differently here, including the way the two human/dog pairs meet, with the two dogs suddenly seeing each other in the park and sappy music to go along with this scene, and certain other scenes as well. Apart from some differences, this live action movie follows the same basic plot as the animated one, but seems to drag it out a little. It doesn't help that without any human speech among the animals (unlike the 1961 version), the scenes showing them communicating can be a little tedious.The live action 90's Disney versions of ""The Jungle Book"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" are both less popular and not as good as the 60's animated Disney versions, but after recently watching both of them again, I really think the 1994 ""Jungle Book"" movie is far superior to this 1996 release. That film, though significantly flawed, has some good action, memorable characters, adventure, mild humour, etc. to make it entertaining for the most part, and that's not the case with this one. I know it's more debatable whether the 1994 flick is suitable for kids or not, as this 1996 film doesn't have any gore, unlike that one, but I still stand by my opinion and this is coming from someone who saw the 90's version of ""The Jungle Book"" on the silver screen as a kid. This version of ""101 Dalmatians"" has more in common with the 1961 film than the 1994 version of ""The Jungle Book"" does with the 1967 film, but that's not necessarily a good thing. It might be one of the reasons why this film turned out to be so bland. Other than the occasional mildly amusing moment, a good performance from Glenn Close as the main villain, and just a very tiny bit of suspense, there's not much to give this movie praise for.",101 Dalmatians
39,vip_ebriega,"Great, furry fun.",7,8 May 2007,"Review summary: A good-looking live-action version of the animated classic. Glenn Close steals the show.I remember watching this numerous times as a kid (on a laser disc), and remember liking it so much. I haven't watched it in a while, but I can still remember it's zany fun. I can still remember Glenn Close's excellent performance as Cruella DeVille. I can still remember Michael Kamen's energetic and enjoyable music. I can also remember the funny antics and silly humor. But of course, I wouldn't forget those cute little puppies who wisely avoid all the dangerous obstacles, with the help of a bunch of farm animals. I didn't know it was actually a remake of an animated film until I was a bit older. But then again, didn't care. I'm sure both are as good (I haven't seen the original yet).So for a fondness which I can remember from my childhood, I recommend it to everyone who likes to have fun at the movies, and not take all they see too seriously.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",101 Dalmatians
40,Mister-6,Get yer spots on!,8,29 December 2001,"I've noticed something about John Hughes' movies: he started out writing about adults with child-like tendencies (""Mr. Mom"", ""National Lampoon's Vacation""), went on to actual teenagers (""Sixteen Candles"", The Breakfast Club""), devolved down to pre-teens (""Home Alone"", ""Dennis the Menace"") and then babies (""Baby's Day Out"") and now that he's exhausted all the ages of man (except the elderly - don't give him any ideas) he's moved on to the animal kingdom with ""101 Dalmatians"".You know the basic storyline if you've seen the 1961 Disney animated original - Roger and Anita (Daniels and Richardson) meet and marry then their respective dalmatians Pongo and Perdita have 15 puppies which are coveted by the despicable Cruella DeVil (played con brio by Close) who will have them at any cost to make a puppy fur coat.What's new this time around?  The fact that it's all live action, for one, and the formidable assistance of computers helps create the illusion of dogs and other creatures acting with almost human precision, plus the fact that instead of precocious voices for all the animals they act out voiceless against the human baddies, especially Horace and Jasper (Williams and Laurie), as if the animal kingdom were all channeling Macaulay Culkin.And, of course, since Hughes wrote the script, you know this won't be Shakespeare - slapstick malice is at the forefront with cute but noble good guys, ugly and dumb bad guys and lots of adorable animals. 
But not just dalmatians, mind you: there are all manner of dogs - sheepdogs, bulldogs, terriers, etc.  Not to mention horses, sheep, raccoons, rabbits, chickens, pigs, cows, birds and even a mouse in one instance.  All of them banding together to bring the dalmatians, all 101 of them, together safely.Director Herek brings everything together with assurance and all the actors make sure you know that this is a story that is first and foremost for the kiddies.  Especially Close - complete with claws on her gloves and a different wardrobe for every scene, she not only chews the scenery but nibbles on it with every tooth in her head and savors the taste like a connoisseur.  Bless her.This isn't the kind of movie that can be successfully analyzed.  You either like it or not, depending on what kind of tolerance you have for kiddie slapstick.  I like that, so I liked ""101 Dalmatians"".Seven stars, plus half a star for Close's diabolical work...and a half star more for the donations from the animal world.",101 Dalmatians

43,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,Glenn Close's performance doesn't save the remake's incoherent plot and unfunny humor,4,26 November 2011,"I think this is one of those films from the 90s I saw as a kid, but when years have passed, I took one more view of this film again. Besides I knew it couldn't be possibly worse than the earlier movies that the late John Hughes made in the classic 90s.Boy was I wrong. Never have I been so disappointed in this mediocre remake, but I don't think it's the worst movie ever made. Let me point out the stronger points.The cast is pretty tolerable. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace, I think, but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil.The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London, Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise.The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films, the National Lampoon movies, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and many more, but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace, Baby's Day Out, Just Visiting, the Miracle on 34th Street remake, and Flubber. In here, his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish.The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes, but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made, we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive.If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic, be my guest, but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise, even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor.4/10",101 Dalmatians

In my opinion, it's a cute film, but it offers nothing more to the Dalmatian universe... maybe just a little less.I'm also not sure if this film is for very young children because there are a few 'violent' or powerful scenes in the film. (I believe there was a scene near the end with someone falling over a cliff. I think this scene led to discuss amongst mothers that this film probably shouldn't be seen by young children, which is a drawback because it was marketed at children and slightly revived the 101 Dalmations universe with a new television cartoon following and merchandising.)",101 Dalmatians

If you have sen the original, you know what this is about.However, since it was written by John Hughes, it has a Home Alone slapstick section, which is a lot of fun. Roger Ebert gave this thumbs down for that reason but I like it fine.I mentioned Closes's performance. Another compliment about it is her evil laugh after the puppies are stolen. Best. Laugh. Ever.This is a fun movie everyone in the family can enjoy and should be seen when the chance comes!",101 Dalmatians
56,pkzeewiz,"Excellent villain, mate - again.",3,12 April 2010,"This was one of those times when remakes are a good idea. It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt.Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back.Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing.It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes, some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it, it was good and still true to the original.Glenn close WOW, what a perfect job she did here as Cruella, great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House, and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also, I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie.Not as good as the cartoon, a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers, boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times, which made it hard to accept as an adult, but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars",101 Dalmatians
57,maddiebuggie,101 Dalmatians live action review,6,13 May 2020,"This was a pretty good movie. The movie has great plot, storyline, characters, characters development. I liked the first alive action movie that was done. There was a lot of cute puppy Dalmatians in this movie. The acting was good too. But it no where as good as Dalmatians 102 alive action movie is. But I recommend this movie to all people no matter the age.",101 Dalmatians
58,thisseatofmars,"It's a Home Alone ripoff, but instead of a creepy albino outwitting the thugs it's a bunch of puppies.",4,24 July 2016,"I love Glen Close in this. She's a sexy, stellar actress, and I know it's immoral, but *damn* she looks fine in those furs. I'm more of a cat person, which must mean that I hate dogs, so I was hoping she'd get those puppies at the movie's end. It's too bad she doesn't—it would've been a nice slice of reality for the boomers and man-child kiddies. True fact: after this movie tons of Dalmatians were adopted and then given back to shelters. Ouch, and shame! Should've let Cruella have her way. It's what happens in real life, and we let it.Despite ugly reality, this movie kills me, mostly because I'm so taken with Glen Close. She's an elegant and beautiful woman starring in a bad ""kid's movie,"" so you know she's bound to get her face dragged through the mud. Literally. But Close returns for a bad sequel in which she winds up getting baked into a giant muffin (I think) so I guess Close was getting something out of it (hundreds of thousands of of dollars? Oh, me too, please!!!) Still. Watching someone get debased on screen is hard to watch. If only she was hideous like the guy playing Horace. Ooh. Then we'd want to see her burn. On a semi-side note, kid's movies were at one point superb, like the truly excellent and elegant 1961 original version of 101 Dalmatians. So when did they become all about hitting men in the pills?",101 Dalmatians

60,Cephyran,"Campy, fun, cute...",6,13 September 2004,"This is a cute movie. The original Disney classic set up the story, and this live action version is just as fun and entertaining. Albeit, some details were modified for the sake of live action, but these story elements don't deter from the decency of the movie. Glenn Close is quite literally the perfect actress for the job of Cruella DeVil, and Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are a well-composed couple with decent chemistry. It's always neat to see other actors you recognize in movies you didn't remember them from, like Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams. They're more than entertaining as the bumbling lackeys who are given the responsibility of capturing the dogs. And though there is some violence, it's completely slapstick, so there's really nothing to worry about. I liked it as much as one can like a family movie. It's campy, fun, and appropriate for kids, so I'd recommend it.",101 Dalmatians
61,Mario64,An OK movie.,6,7 May 1999,"Performances of the three leading characters were quite good, especially Glen Close's character. Out side that and some interesting animal dialogue scenes there's not much in this movie. Scenes where human idiots get clobbered weren't funny and reminded me of those overrated Home Alone scenes.

Unlike the prequel Cruella That's just been released, I actually believe in the character cruella to be horrible.The henchmen feel like they should be - henchmen. Not close friends or too clever for their roles.They even used real dogs and all the hardships that carries into it.",101 Dalmatians
63,jvfunn1,Excellent Movie.,10,28 December 2010,I remember going and seeing this with my Kindergarden class when this came out and I must say I really enjoyed it. Glenn Close gave a wonderful performance as Cruella De Vil and I don't think that Disney could of casted a better actress. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels both gave good performances as Anita and Roger and I also thought that Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams gave good performances as Jasper and Horace. The plot was really good and seemed to live up to the original 1961 cartoon. I liked that they made Roger a video game designer and that he designed Cruella as the villain for his new video game at the end. There were lots of funny scenes from both the dogs and some other animals that appeared in the film. In all a good film that the whole family can enjoy and John Hughes did a good job writing the screenplay just like he did for some other of his films such as Home Alone. All in all 101 Dalmatians is a great family movie that anyone can love. 10 out of 10.,101 Dalmatians

I always think it's great how actors do these family films... Glenn Close is great as the villain, and I was surprised to see Mark Williams (of Fast Show fame) in it. Hugh Laurie is good as well. As are all the dogs and other animals for that matter.I haven't seen the Walt Disney version, but I would imagine that's probably more of a classic than this.One for all the family.5/10 (for me).",101 Dalmatians

67,mallard-6,"Fine, fine film. As good as the animated version, but different!",9,1 September 1999,"Incredible as it may seem, this film is every bit the equal of the Disney animated version of the same title. And it is DIFFERENT from the Disney version. This is a rare accomplishment, in a medium where remakes and sequels are so often weak.The film is made by Glen Close, whose appearance as Cruella DeVil is fascinating! She is even more evil than her animated namesake. But the rest of the casting of the film is also incredibly strong. No problems with anyone.The dalmations are most excellently employed. Virtually seamless integration of live action and computer animation. And also, the hosts of animals (live and animated) in the film do NOT talk (a cloying and sentimental habit too often indulged in by Disney Studios et al).The film is an adult's movie that children should also enjoy! The VHS version was good, the DVD version even better.",101 Dalmatians

69,JackReese,See spot run...,5,10 December 2000,"This film lacks something.  I'm thinking originality...it is almost an exact duplicate of the animated version by the same company, and while I understand the story should be the same, I was hoping it would include elements found in the book that were left out of the animated version. Glenn Close, as everyone says was meant for this role, but in the end, it's an excuse to make money as many Disney movies are.  It's clever enough for me to say ""Hey, it's clever..."" but that's about it.  I recommend to see it, and hey it's Disney.",101 Dalmatians

72,Spanner-9,Average film lifted by inspired Close,7,4 July 2000,"Glenn Close is Cruella de Vil. Simple as that. Nothing else about this film is worth much note, save her extravagant costumes. She was wonderfully over the top, despite the weak ""Home Alone"" style storyline that dominated even over her towards the end. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels are NICE, but are reduced to too many scenes of worrying to be of much interest. Cruella's henchmen are exact parallels of Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci in ""Home Alone"". *** out of *****",101 Dalmatians
73,bootderek,Oustanding,10,29 August 2008,"This is a great remake of the original animated classic, and I must say that the dogs used in this film, especially the dalmatians, were incredibly well trained. Kudos to the dog trainers! Glenn Close is unbeatable as Cruella DeVil, and the music was top notch. I watched this film, however, after the debut of the show House, and I was very surprised to see that Hugh Laurie was cast as Jasper, but he was perfectly cast, as well as Mark Williams (from the Harry Potter series) who played Horace. Roger and Anita were perfectly cast as well, and there were intense action sequences. The scenery was beautiful, with all the snow, and Stephen Herek was the perfect director. A character that i found most disturbing however was the man known only as Skinner. since he was not introduced in the original film, i had doubts. Still, one of Disney's best! 10 of 10",101 Dalmatians

76,flarepunk,"You don't want critical analysis, don't read",3,28 May 2013,"So... Disney thought they'd dip into the cash cow and try and rehash the already perfect with no need for modernization movie, 101 Dalmatians. Now with video games, fashion, and modern slapstick humor, this is a wonderfully terrible movie that seems to forget about the stylistic choices and just HOW the original worked. In the original, no one suspects Cruella of doing anything - Anita even states 'She may be eccentric, but she's not a thief.' One of Disney's more downplayed movies, the 1961 original featured wonderful characters, wonderful down to earth animation, wonderful backgrounds, and people you actually cared about. When the dogs go off- on their own - because nobody else saw the sings, it isn't a constant snooze fest of waiting for the off camera crew to have the REAL dogs do what they're supposed to do (in this way, Santa Buddies did it better) but it actually has, (because it was animated) the dogs TALKING. You understand what they want, what needs to happen - because they can speak their minds. Now, we have the police out to get the puppies as well - and Cruella, (whom Glen Close is a good match for) is played up even MORE to the extreme and completely unbelievable as a sane individual that no one would suspect. I enjoyed this movie as a child, but I can't get behind it now. It's too much, too silly, and the original did it right. Sorry.",101 Dalmatians
77,sm0jsm,The cartoon was better!,6,27 December 1998,"Rather pleasant movie but the cartoon version was definitely better. More could have been accomplished with the lovely little puppets - they should have focused on a few of them. Now there were too many puppets all the time.

84,CanadianCinephile,A dog's breakfast of terrible nonsense,1,20 November 2010,"Live action remakes of animated features almost always wind up being risky affairs. Disney's 101 Dalmatians, a live action version of its classic animated feature, goes well beyond risky and straight into idiotic territory. This jumbled mess of a film is only noteworthy for the animal acting and for an over-the-top Glenn Close performance that gets worse by the second. Unfortunately, even those rare elements of slight interest get glossed over by CGI and a ridiculous set of sequences that turns the minimalistic joy of the original into nothing more than chaotic clutter.101 Dalmatians strips all the elements from the animated feature for the sake of laziness, it seems, and what we're left with is a completely unnecessary project that demonstrates Disney's unfortunate unwillingness to fully commit to a film with heart. This Stephen Herek-directed movie ""updates"" the formula and adds a couple of dumb chase sequences to fill time, giving us characters that we don't care about and putting them in situations that cheerlessly mangle the original plot.Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer. He's an obvious update on the song-writing Roger out of the animated version and this proves problematic right away: there's no excuse for the famous and awesome Cruella de Vil song. In any event, Roger has a dog genius named Pongo. Pongo's pretty bright, but we have no idea what's going on in his canine head because there's no internal dog monologue. The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing.Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have. You know the rest.Stunningly, this live action version of Dodie Smith's story was penned and produced by John Hughes. Yes, that John Hughes. How he managed to mangle such a simple story is beyond me, but he sure did a number on this one. For starters, this version sticks the humans squarely in charge of things and then jettisons them for the last act so that we get a musically driven dog's rescue sequence that eliminates the brilliance of the original because we can't hear what they're saying to each other.The best parts of the animated version are, therefore, gone. The barking of the dogs becomes a bunch of noise and the overwhelmingly invasive Michael Kamen score keeps meddling and telling us what we're supposed to feel. As much as I dislike the premise of talking animal movies, Disney's remake could have used a voice or two from the kingdom of the canines.Because the dogs lack voices and because we're focused on the dumb, boring humans, we don't really ever connect when the dogs go missing. The sequences that the animated version used to so lovingly attach us to Pongo and his family are gone, replaced by a grand ""naming of the dogs"" sequence that really only identifies the dogs by physical traits. This is another problem that could have been solved by having the dogs speak.Of course, having animals speak in these sorts of movies usually suffers from the fact that talking animals generally look stupid. But Disney doesn't seem to have any concern of that because they use copious CGI anyway, ""fleshing out"" the actions of the dogs and other animals when the trained canines can't do the trick. The discrepancy here is abundantly and embarrassingly clear, as it's hard to mask the sudden appearance of a CGI puppy heading down a slide into the snow. The large group shots of the puppies also shine with the clumsy computer-assisted stuff.In the end, 101 Dalmatians is a waste of time. While some may find value in the Glenn Close performance and some of the animal stuff, it wasn't enough for me. The movie is amazingly lazy, even by Disney's modern standards. The invasive score, the poor CGI and the bland performances from Daniels and Richardson make this a film to avoid like a creepy canine with rabies. And don't even get me started on the tragic absence of the beloved Sergeant Tibbs!",101 Dalmatians
85,mattbruns15,It's actually better than the animated version,8,25 October 2021,I usually like the original animated version better than the live action remakes but this one is actually better. This is one of the few Disney movies that I like the live action version better than the animated version. Glenn Close did a great job as Cruella. I like Jeff Daniels as roger. Joan Plowright also did good as the Nanny. I recommend this version over the animated version. If families like the original version they should definitely watch this one.,101 Dalmatians
86,caitlinbiwer,Heart-warming Disney classic,7,25 January 2016,"This film has a great storyline, it's suitable for the whole family and is entertaining. This film came out before I was born so I grew up watching these kind of films, and through watching it recently I have found my love for Disney films once more.There is an element of comedy with the names of the Dalmatians being 'dipstick' and 'whizzer' and the villains are fairly funny too, featuring Hugh Laurie from House and Mark Williams from Harry Potter with their name-calling and arguments with one another. With some scarier parts (when you're a child) such as when they kidnap the puppies and 'Mr Skinner' who has a scar on his face.Although, even though it is a children's film there are some very unrealistic parts of them film, such as how are the couple making money and can afford a nanny when they are both not at work or making money, why they marry after only knowing each other briefly and the typical 'scruffy van and tights over your face' cliché bad guys. Yet, this brings the film to the onset of it being very focused for children, and avoids financial worry and darker features.The dogs and their owners are very friendly people and animals, with an unpredictable storyline for children which keeps them engaged within the film. Overall, a very well-balanced film with many light-hearted sections.",101 Dalmatians

88,richard-mcghie,This movie is brilliant!,5,9 December 2007,"This live-action version of ""101 Dalmatians"" is superb. I say the animated film's better than this one, because that one is a classic. I absolutely like Glenn Close's deliciously camp performance as Cruella De Vil. She has taken a cartoon character, one of the most iconic villainesses in film history, and made it all her own. I think it was real good for her to bring such a wicked character to life. Overall, I enjoy this film, enjoy all the slapstick recycled from ""Home Alone"" and it's a real good effort to try and remake the animated film. John Hughes, who wrote the screenplay, did an amazing job, as well as Stephen Herek for his direction. And I must say, those two crooks, Jasper and Horace, played by Mark Williams and Hugh Laurie, were very funny and really acted like the Chuckle brothers or Laurel and Hardy, and I like that about them. And Glenn Close really is the perfect actress to be cast as Cruella in this film, and her costumes, designed by Anthony Powell, are astonishing and fantastic. However, I'm giving it 5/10.",101 Dalmatians
89,tropicalwindxst,38/100,4,28 August 2008,"Characters - 10/30 Glenn Close is of course a wonderful Cruella Deville.

Close hogs the screen time.Story - 15/30 It's classic Disney, but it just doesn't seem as interesting as the original. They could have expanded, done something new, or just plain stuck to the original. As it is, it just seems average and a little like something is missing.Atmosphere - 5/15 Decent transition for Cruella, but the rest is very meh.Effectiveness - 5/15 As a children's movie, excellent.

From the opening of the film with Jeff Daniels being dragged through Trafalgar Square on his bike, having tried to chase Joely Richardons character and Perdita on her traditional Pashley bike. The opening of the film grabs you and sets the tone and in my opinion never lets up. The whole film is enjoyable and you never get bored. Well i am biased ; i did not get bored anyway. Go watch it yourself.",101 Dalmatians
91,LingXiaoyu,Be ready for a shock,5,30 March 2005,"Why does Disney do this to great stories? Sometimes they apparently just have to go on and do this. The visual look of the film is really good, most of the points come from that exactly, the rest of it is just disrespectful. Maybe the youngest kids like this, but for a little older set of kids, this is under estimating them and their intelligence. Plus for the visuality, a huge minus for the intelligence and wit or if you will, the lack of it.Disney had all it all and they could have made this so much better. With just a few little changes, this film could have been fantastic, but it just didn't happen here. A word of an advice for Disney, don't under estimate even the youngest viewers, kids aren't dumb like you seem to think they are.",101 Dalmatians
92,Maddie_Zadvinskis,Needs More Glenn Close,6,4 November 2021,"I saw this movie as a little kid but I didn't really remember anything else other than Glenn Close as Cruella DeVil. She is by far the best thing about this film. She's super eccentric and cartoony just like how her character is in the original animated movie. After watching this movie around fifteen years or so later, it is not as good as I remember it being. This film is riddled with typical 90s slapstick tropes we've seen far too many times. The score is nothing memorable and sounds too similar to other 80s and 90s family/feel good movies. CGI was used in some parts with the puppies and it has aged poorly. Though they did a good job with directing the actual animals in many scenes. I was impressed by that. Disney has always been cynical with their properties and tries to look for any opportunity to sell something. It's a little obvious with the scenes where Roger (Jeff Daniels) is having a kid test out a video game he designed is a product placement for Disney. However, I still don't think it's on the same level of cynicism compared to how Disney is today with their live action remakes. It's far from being the worst out of Disney's lineup of live action remakes, but it doesn't really have anything memorable about it other than Glenn Close's performance. However, this is a fine movie for children and their families to watch. It's entertaining for the most part. I enjoy every single scene with Glenn Close. Her performance alone makes it worth the watch.",101 Dalmatians
93,abbyadams1976,Didn't Keep My Attention,4,18 December 2015,"First of all, I was hoping that they'd give Cruella better motivation since they had the opportunity. But, no such luck. She still just wants to make a Dalmatian fur coat simply because she's obsessed by the idea and doesn't seem to realize or care that she'll just be arrested for stealing and killing puppies.Glenn Close does make a perfect Cruella, and she overplays it even more than the original. It's one thing to see a cartoon screaming about killing puppies, but with a live action human it's just bizarre.Less than halfway through it seems to become a Home Alone clone, with the two bumbling villains being injured in slapsticky ways by determined animals.The animals do not talk in this movie. They probably decided it might make the movie too corny but I don't really think that's possible. It actually makes the movie more boring. A lot of the shots are of dogs barking or running, bunnies running, etc. In other words, animals not really doing a whole lot. The puppies run everywhere en masse but do little otherwise. There are a few named and recognizable pups, but because they don't have voices you can't tell if they really have different characters.Someone called this a pointless remake. I think they could have done a lot better if they'd made it less cartoony. After all, we already have the cartoon.",101 Dalmatians
94,closeharlan-1,Waste Of Glenn Close,3,17 February 2006,"Glenn Close is a very good actor. She was creepy in Fatal Attraction and awesome in Jagged Edge. She is campy and over the top in this live-action of 101 Dalmations and is virtually the only reason to watch this movie. True Jeff Daniels is good, too, but his part required little more than a phone-in.But this movie ""must"" be great for the kids because it has all of the formula elements of kids' movies, these days: 1. Bathroom humor: as when, in the scene when the humans are naming their enormous brood of puppies, they christen one ""wizzer"" because he goes on the floor a lot.2. Sooner or later one or more male characters get thumped in the privates. Normally I love this kind of gag, but this is such a ubiquitous, obligatory scene, that it's charm has gone away.3. The villain or villains get their comeuppance by getting dunked and/or covered in any number of sticky, gooey substances as an apparent homage to Home Alone and Double Dare. This has almost never impressed me. And the fact that it's Glenn Close who has to endure this experience is the biggest waste of her talent. She plays the scene really well, but it is so stupid that it's a waste of a really good actor.",101 Dalmatians
95,joshuahall-31950,Not as charming as The original,4,9 August 2019,"So I just watched DISNEY's original 101 DALMATIONS from 1961. The original movie was me and twin brother's all time favorite childhood movie, to the point where we had bed linen and curtains based on The original movie in our bedroom until we were ten years old. I remember watching The DISNEY Remake in theaters when it came out during The THANKGIVING Holiday season of 1996. And I really loved it at the time. But as I've gotten older I've realised how superior the original still is. Glen Close without a doubt is the BEST thing about The DISNEY Remake. Even if you HATE the remake which I do I can tell that Glen Close had a ball hamming it up as The world's most EVIL fashion designer Cruella De Ville. Huge Laurie and Mark Williams also do a great job playing Cruella De Ville's BRAINLESS henchmen Jasper and Horace. The slapstick involving Jasper and Horace is pretty hilarious even though The movie is a SOULESS CASHGRAB The DISNEY Remake of 101 DALMATIONS is equal part BEETHOVEN and HOME ALONE a good premise but not executed very well Unfortunately this was the start of DISNEY'S of remaking their animated classic films as SOULESS LIVE ACTION AND CGI CASHGRABS",101 Dalmatians
96,halon8,"Awful, waste of a good cast. Stick to the cartoon.",1,17 October 2010,"So I settled down on a Sunday evening to what should have been a pleasant Disney film. Boy, was I disappointed.This live action version takes the basic elements of the original, but strips out all the charm. There's no cat. There's no scene where the puppies disguise themselves as labradors.Cruella is a mean business woman, who's annoyed that one of her employees (Anita Dearly) wants to get married and have children. Because obviously, you can't mix a career and having a family. The undertones of 'career bad, motherhood good' are just unnecessary in a modern children's film. Cruella is more pantomime than actually scary.The lack of original charm isn't replaced with anything else. It's just boring and predictable.This film has an amazingly talented cast, which is completely wasted here. The jokes are just not funny. Most of the film is taken up with lame, unoriginal slapstick. Part of the first sequence has Roger Dearly accidentally trying to steal Perdy because he has mistaken her for Pongo. That's right. He loves his dog so much, he can't even recognise him. The screenwriter obviously has either never had pets or just assumes children are stupid.The dogs are cute, but have no personality. The puppies have very little screen time at all. If you liked the sequels to Home Alone, you might like this movie. If you liked the original cartoon or any recent children's films that actually have a good storyline, you'll be disappointed. I'm afraid most of the reviewers here are giving this movie a pass because 'it's a child's film and you can't expect that much'. Well I do expect better from Disney and I wouldn't subject my children to this film. Try the book instead.",101 Dalmatians
97,notvito,Noble and Heroic,8,25 March 2007,"Based loosely on the writings of French animal-rights activist Jean Latrille, this movie succeeds in revealing the inhumane aspect of the puppy-farm industry, and depicts the heroic efforts of those who are honor-bound to stop it.Brothers Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams) mount a daring raid of a Dalmatian breeding facility, located incongruously in a tony London neighborhood, in an attempt to rescue a group of Dalmatian puppies that are bound for market, where they'll be sold to vicious and uncaring English families. The brothers are aided by their altruistic and devoted cousin, Crue (also, obviously, a heavy-metal fan) who is played by Glen Close.The movie follows the successful rescue attempt as the brothers lead the puppies through the wilds of Great Britain, where they find refuge at a paradisaical English estate. The film continues as a counter-raid, led by the evil agents of the puppy farm and abetted by hundreds of brainwashed animals -both wild and domesticated, is successful in recapturing the group of puppies, along with eighty-six other puppies previously rescued by the brave brothers. Crue is degraded in an inhumane manner, and the brother's vehicle is firebombed.The film ends as the puppies are forced to fend for themselves in the wilds of the English countryside, living off the frozen remains of dead sheep and discarded fish-and-chip wrappers. Later, reverting to their wild traits, the puppies form packs in order to survive. One such pack, led by the strong, dominant male Lucky, survives on the outskirts of London by, ironically, poaching on cats and small family dogs, and soon mount an attack on the very same puppy-farm that owes to their existence, along the way dispatching brainwashed animals, corrupt bobbies, and ego-maniacal video-game designers.Shot in cinema verite by French cinematographer Pierre Latrille (grandson of the original author) this film very aptly captures the idealistic brothers, the beauty of the English wilds, the random hubbub of big city London, and the horrors encountered by a group of animals born in the wrong place, and in the wrong time.",101 Dalmatians
98,burthudson,Watched right after Cruella and just wasn't intrigued,4,4 July 2021,It's really just a very mediocre movie. Glenn Close as Cruella is ok but the character was too one-sided. Jeff Daniels and Joely are normally great actors but this is the worst performance I've seen from either.,101 Dalmatians
99,chafland,"Ok, but not as good as the original.",7,27 March 2020,"101 Dalmatians is a live-action remake of the 1961 original classic One Hundred and One Dalmatians. It does a good job of remaking the classic. Also it adds an extra 24 minutes. Some moments of the film weren't s good as I hoped but still it is fun family film to watch. Disney used good actors including Glenn Close, Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams. It does a good job of showing how animals are as smart as us. Cruella De Vil is a good villain in this movie and you want her to fail. The dogs also have a personality even if they don't speak like they do in the classic.
It has a compeling story and is good in many ways. Pongo and Perdita have a strong personality even if they don't speak.",101 Dalmatians
100,hankman1,Fine movie but ... raccoons in England?,8,26 August 2007,"This is a really minor spoiler. You know about all the animals that help the dogs. Raccoons are among them.There, I said it. This movie is supposed to take place in England. That's where the cartoon took place and that's where most of the live-action characters still get their accents.Raccoons do not live in England. They are a species native to North America. A better British critter, as clever as a raccoon and in the same family, would hail straight out of Wind in the Willows -- the European badger.The movie was fine otherwise, but this kind of thing shows Disney really doesn't care about details. Imagine a movie in which meerkats from The Lion King scampered through American backyards. It's that kind of mistake.",101 Dalmatians
101,saminwigton,"It's Disney, so it's not bad.",6,11 April 2002,"Making a live action film with animals is one of the well known don'ts in entertainment.  That and working with kids.  They also have a habit of being rubbish films (Homeward Bound anyone?).  Anyway, I liked this film, well written, well acted and funny.  6/10.",101 Dalmatians

103,varden_longraf,Suprizingly a good remake,9,19 July 2014,I remember when this came out in theatres I was a little skeptical being a huge fan of the Disney original but after watching it I will say glen close played a spot on version of cruela deville. the movie really followed the storyline of the original quite well and was entertaining by the great cast they used to keep the theme of the original. I actually found myself watching it a few times even with my kids and was happy to see for once that a remake didn't just go with the flow but put some heart in the film that make a realistic remake for once fit the same likability as the original. Definitely one I would watch again and again and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Disney classic!,101 Dalmatians
104,lardycakes,Does not make sense,3,16 October 2021,"I watched the cartoon years ago before PC took over so i assumed the furs Cruella wore were animal fur.I realise it is basically a young child's film but the whole premise of the film does not make sense. How can a woman who is obsessed with real fur even to the extent of wanting to kill puppies to make a fur coat own furs which are all obviously fake. If she was obsessed with fake fur, why would she want to kill puppies to make a coat.I know the actress refused to wear real fur and they obviously bowed to her demands but surely they should have accepted Cruella's love of real fur is what the story is about.",101 Dalmatians
105,since-89780,101 minutes too long,3,30 October 2018,"This movie should have been 1 minute long.
The ending couldn't come soon enough. I could barely stand it. I can not put into words how painful and annoying this was to agonize through.
Would have rated 1 star, but the Skunks butthole at 93:17 saves it.",101 Dalmatians
106,jarreauamann,Pretty good,3,24 March 2021,This movie is very different it is pretty good is funny but problem i see with this movie is way too force on Cruella then puppies to end of movie cruella is more sinister scarier in this version dogs don't r talk in this movie,101 Dalmatians
107,zulmafeliciano,Great film for the family.,7,25 January 2021,It's a sweet film which will surely be of great joy to both kids and parents alike. Recommended.,101 Dalmatians
108,SweetCherry,I prefer this to the animated version,9,19 April 2004,"I liked it, especially with the make-up and all the stunts. The dogs were well trained and Glen Close was excellent as Cruella De Vil. She truly captured the part, actually I couldn't imagine anyone else filling the role as good as she did. The costume designs she wore were fantastic, the entire production was top notch.The supporting cast were very good too, and I can't faulter the set design either. Some scenes were hilarious (to me anyway) I thought Disney did a great job on this. The director and script writer should be congratulated also on transferring from the animated movie to real life. Don't think I didn't like the animated version, I do, but this one definitely stays with me. My rating 9/10 .",101 Dalmatians
