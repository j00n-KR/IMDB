0,TheLittleSongbird,Not that bad at all!,8,27 March 2009,"I liked this movie a lot. Technically, it is beautiful- lovely costumes and sets. The script is also good. Sunny, played by the Hoffmann twins, was what made the film. Everything she said made my whole family laugh. It is perfect for adults and adolescents, but very young kids may find it a little frightening. Emily Browning and Liam Aiken are wonderful as Violet and Klaus. I particularly enjoyed seeing Timothy Spall, Billy Conolly and Meryl Streep light up our screens. Jude Law provided the voice of Lemony Snicket perfectly. I have read the books, and have enjoyed them. However, the film does have a drawback. I was a little disappointed in Jim Carrey's performance. I imagined the character as sinister, and Carrey, being an entertaining actor, came across as rather silly. In conclusion, despite that drawback, this is still a very enjoyable film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",A Series of Unfortunate Events
1,Leofwine_draca,"Boringly routine kid's film, too reliant on poor CGI and ham acting",4,16 December 2015,"Another boring Hollywood adaptation of a kid's book, this one makes less sense and has even less structure than most. The presence of Jude Law as a narrator is a tired sub-plot and just serves to slow things down endlessly - he has no need to be in the film at all other than to pad things out.The story is about a couple of orphaned kids who are sent off to live with an oddball relative, played by an unrecognisable Jim Carrey. Carrey turns out to be a scheming bad guy with plans to bump off the kids for their money, but what follows is just the usual soulless CGI adventure - all effects but little wit or charm to propel it.The one thing this film has to distinguish it is a supporting cast of noted thespians, but the majority of them give hammy performances as if they're in a pantomime (which I suppose is what this is). Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, and Meryl Streep are the three most guilty of this heinous overacting, although I didn't care for Carrey's mannered performance either. The kids are a little better, particularly Emily Browning, who shows some of the warmth that has propelled her into fame as an adult actress.The CGI has dated rather badly in the ten years since this film's release and the constant barrage of falling buildings and approaching trains looks very silly indeed. Even worse is the humour, which isn't very funny. A typically brash, headache-inducing American kid's film, this needed some of the charm of a Roald Dahl story to make it work. You know it's bad when even Tim Burton - who's churned out his fair share of soulless CGI films himself - turned it down.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
2,SnoopyStyle,Cool looking but ...,5,2 August 2014,"Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken) and Sunny Baudelaire (Kara Hoffman) are three clever and reasonably attractive orphans. Violet loves to invent. Klaus loves to read. Sunny enjoys to bite. When their parents die in a fire, they are left an enormous fortune that can't be used until Violet comes of age. They are sent to live with greedy distant relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who tries to steal the fortune for himself. Next they're given to live with Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) and his snakes. When Olaf kills Monty, they're given to fearful Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) next.This has a great look. It has a grim beauty. Even with the makeup, there is no denying that it's pure Jim Carrey. He's really mugging for the camera. It's interesting for a few minutes but it wears terribly thin. There's a little bit of hitting. There's a bit of attempted child killing. He needs to be more concerned about being a villain rather than being a comedian. No adults ever listen to the kids which gets very repetitive and tiresome. In fact, the whole structure of the movie is quite repetitive. All the adults are brain-dead. It's forced to keep stopping after every death. The other characters don't have enough time to develop chemistry. Then the movie goes into child bride territory. It's weird without being quirky and definitely not funny.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
3,claudio_carvalho,The Villain of the Year,9,21 July 2005,"When Klaus, Violet and Sunny Baudelaire loose their parents in a fire in their mansion, the greedy and evil Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) tries to become their guardian to steal their fortune.This movie is a great family entertainment. Jim Carrey is amazing in the role of Count Olaf, in my opinion, the villain of the year. The screenplay of this story of orphans is very original; the make-up of Jim Carrey is spectacular; the very dark cinematography recalls the movies of Tim Burton; the direction is great and the children have excellent performances. There is a light message that children are never listened, no matter whether they have reason or not. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Desventuras em Série"" (""Unfortunate Events in Series"")",A Series of Unfortunate Events
4,gavin6942,Quite Good -- Should Have Had an Immediate Sequel,7,6 June 2012,"Three wealthy children's parents are killed in a fire. When they are sent to a distant relative (Jim Carrey), they find out that he is plotting to kill them and seize their fortune.Although I have not read the books on which this film was based, I sat next to someone who did and was told that while it was condensed, they followed the story fairly well. Regardless, they made a fine film with a decent pace, good humor and nice effects. How such a dark subject could be so light is amazing. The wardrobe department deserved an Oscar for this.Of course, Jim Carrey received top billing and rightfully so. He has had his ups and downs over the years, with many great roles and many less than great. This is definitely among his best, and recalls the peak of his career when his physical comedy was in constant demand. Throw in John Cleese, and you have the epitome of weird just leaping from the screen.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
5,lee_eisenberg,Jim Carrey's roles keep getting more and more interesting,7,2 August 2005,"When ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" begins, we are introduced to a cute little elf. Then, Lemony Snicket (Jude Law) explains that this movie is not about elves; if you are looking for a ""cute"" movie, then avoid this movie at all costs. You see, the Beaudelaire children have just lost their parents in a horrible accident, and they are handed over to leery Count Olof (Jim Carrey). Count Olof proceeds to do everything possible to kill the children, no matter where they go.Jim Carrey sure has come a long way from that goof-ball who butt-talked in the ""Ace Ventura"" movies. He played a dark character in ""The Cable Guy"", but this brings comically dark characters to a whole new level. They never say where the movie happens; it's like an alternate reality, in which a metropolis, the coast, and farmland are within a small radius. This only adds to the occult factor. Good support comes from Meryl Streep as mousy Aunt Josephine, Timothy Spall as oblivious Mr. Poe, and Catherine O'Hara as corrupt Justice Strauss. You will never think the same way about children stories after watching this movie.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
6,jboothmillard,Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,5,12 September 2005,"When I first saw it the cinema I didn't get the complete gist of the story, but seeing it a second time, it is quite a fun film, once in a while. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events was a really popular children's book, I never read it myself, and this is the adaptation from director Brad Silberling (Casper). Basically the Baudelaire children: the inventor Violet (Ghost Ship's Emily Browning), the reader and knowledgeable Klaus (Road to Perdition's Liam Aiken) and the biting toddler Sunny (twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman) have been orphaned after the death of their parents, so they are placed in the care of their closest relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). After a little while the children know that he is pretty evil, and after the large fortune the parents left them, so he is doing everything he can to kill them. The children meanwhile are escaping near deaths and passing other carers and ""relatives"", including Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) and overly paranoid and superstitious Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep), till eventually Olaf gets his hands on them, and has discovered marrying Violet with real minister Justice Strauss (Catherine O'Hara) (looking like it's part of a play) can legally get him the fortune; obviously though his plan is foiled by the wits of the children. Also starring Timothy Spall as Mr. Poe, American Pie's Jennifer Coolidge as White-faced woman, Cedric the Entertainer as Detective, Dustin Hoffman as Critic and Jude Law narrating as Lemony Snicket. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman. It was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Worth watching!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
7,Tweekums,A delightfully dark family film,8,18 January 2016,"This film tells the story of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire; three children who are orphaned when their parents are killed in a house fire. Things go from bad to worse when they are left in the custody of their distant cousin Count Olaf; an actor who has no interest in them but is very interested in the family fortune. It isn't long before the vile Olaf is trying to kill the children! Being intelligent, and rather lucky, they thwart his plans and are soon living with a much nicer relative, herpetologist Dr Montgomery Montgomery, who plans to take them to Peru. Olaf hasn't given up on getting their fortune and after another unfortunate death the children are soon moving onto another guardian. Once again Olaf appears and things start going wrong yet again. Eventually he comes up with his foulest scheme yet; he will force fourteen year old Violet to marry him by threatening Sunny the toddler.This is a delightfully dark film that should appeal to people who are looking for something that is different to the usual saccharine family fare. The tone is dark but it is never too scary. The story is a little episodic but that doesn't matter as it moves along nicely. The cast do a fine job; Jim Carrey impresses as the evil Count Olaf without resorting to the gurning he sometimes does. A young Emily Browning does a great job as Violet, Liam Aiken is good as her younger brother Klaus and Kara and Shelby Hoffman are delightful as Sunny I loved how Sunny's babyish gurgles are subtitled as fairly biting observations. The film looks great with fairly colourless appearance at times with delightful flashes of brightness at just the right moments. The effects might not look quite real but for me that suited the film and added to the creepiness of many of the events. The ending is upbeat but not excessively so anybody hoping that it will be revealed that their parents are really alive will be disappointed. Overall I'd recommend this to viewers looking for something dark but inoffensive enough to be enjoyed by all the family.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
8,moonspinner55,"Eye-popping effects, fatigued modern humor",5,11 May 2007,"Brad Silberling directs this adaptation of Daniel Handler's books as if he just sat through a Tim Burton marathon; using German Expressionism as a visual starting point, Silberling has a fetish for memories in silhouette, and crafty bits of business which don't seem to add up to much at the moment but do stay with you. Story of three orphaned kids (two resourceful older children and their brilliant baby sister) shuffled around to different relatives but dogged by the money-grubbing, demented Count Olaf isn't much of a basis to hang an entire movie on. The episodic structure only allows for each progressing story to be less compelling than the one before--and for star Jim Carrey to adopt different disguises (it turns out Olaf is a self-proclaimed master thespian, able to fool adults but not children). The show-off presentation is often enchanting (it's like being trapped inside a music-box gone mad) and the younger players are quite good, but the incidentals don't have much heart, and as such the outright jokes seem fatigued (who wants to laugh when the filmmakers have hearts of coal?). The special effects are often incredible, but the editing is disappointing (particularly in a sequence where the kids find an encoded letter, as well as the prolonged nick-of-time climax). As for Carrey: he seems to be channeling Jack Lemmon, at times Robin Williams. He's always game (and up for any challenge), but the operations of Olaf's mind are as jumbled as this screenplay. The ground could rip apart and the characters fall to the center of the earth and it would make as much sense as what does happen in ""Lemony Snicket"". ** from ****",A Series of Unfortunate Events

This catapults them into an inane adventure where their distant relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) takes charge of them. Of course, with that name, Olaf is evil. He wants to get rid of the children so that he can gain their inheritance.His disguises like the rest of the film are ridiculous at best.Of all people, Meryl Streep is along for the ride as Aunt Josephine, also victimized by the Count. Is she a victim or does she love the guy?The film is really inane and the baby having her words translated on screen becomes annoying.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
10,Coventry,A series of wonderfully sinister events!,8,1 October 2005,"Please, don't make the same mistake as me and my girlfriend and postpone your viewing of ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" simple because it looks too much like a children's film. Although younger audiences may be the priority target group, this film definitely isn't childish and actually a lot scarier and more sinister than most nowadays horror films! Not gross or violent, of course, but authentically grim and macabre like a real fairy-tale ought to be! Here in Europe, we aren't very familiar with the books of Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket) but, even by judging this film alone, I dare to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than for example Harry Potter or the latest Pixar movies. The story centers on three adorable and gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire. Their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious Count Orlaf (Jim Carrey) who hunts after the Bauedelaires' family fortune. The main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child, namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians. Most fairy-tale don't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea, but ""Lemony Snicket..."" entirely revolves around it. Equally effective are, of course, the ghoulish landscapes, the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters. Most of the time, it feels like you're watching a typical Tim Burton film and that's a giant compliment, since his style is practically unique (sinister, witty and heart-warming all at once!). There's a lot of CGI but it's not annoying for once, since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects (the leeches, Aunt Josephine's seaside-house) contribute to the wonderfully morbid atmosphere. The cast is terrific as well, with Jim Carrey as Count Orlaf in one most memorable performances to date. I have to admit I initially feared that Carrey's performance would be far over-the-top, but he's surprisingly mature and convincing. The Bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep in the most important supportive roles. The great cast is completed with respectable names (Luiz Guzmán, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge...) in small roles. Sublime film, highly recommended for all type of audiences!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
11,michaelRokeefe,Unfortunate events follow three orphaned children.,3,14 May 2005,"A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS is based on a series of popular books by Lemony Snicket, Daniel Handler.

It stars Jim Carrey, with narration by Jude Law and cameos by Catherine O'Hara and Dustin Hoffman. The film tells the story of three orphans who are adopted by a mysterious theater troupe actor named Count Olaf as he attempts to steal their late parents' fortune.Liam Aiken,Emily Browning,Timothy Spall,Billy Connolly,Cedric the Entertainer,Luis Guzman,Jennifer Coolidge and Meryl Streep co-star to play key supporting roles.The film is directed by Brad Silberling.The Baudelaire siblings namely:gadget freak Violet,bookworm Klaus and baby Sunny were living a fairy-tale existence with their parents until they died in a fire that destroyed the family home. With few close relatives and a large fortune the children won't inherit until they reach adulthood, the Baudelaire children are left in the care of the peculiar Count Olaf,an out-of-work actor who would love nothing more than to get his hands on the kids' money. It doesn't take long for the children to figure out that Count Olaf is up to no good, and they try to steer clear of his various murderous schemes with the help of wildly paranoid Aunt Josephine and snake-fancying Uncle Monty.The series has given Carrey one of his better vehicles in his career and he has risen to the occasion so well.The movie is off in terms of direction and screenplay but the rest of the production work is excellent.Added to that,it is a largely amusing and visually engaging film that will certainly entertain and delight the viewer as it wins raves for its set design and a wry comic charm that mitigates some morbid images.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

14,Doylenf,Some Gothic horror and humor in equal doses in Victorian style tale of woe...,7,20 February 2011,"LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS puts the spotlight on two kids who suffer an almost Dickensian fate complete with a villainous uncle, Count Olaf (JIM CARREY) and an eccentric Aunt Josephine (MERYL STREEP). The uncle wants to deprive them of their rightful inheritance and pulls all sorts of schemes to do exactly that, each time confronted by the clever children who are always able to escape his clutches.As the children, LIAM AIKEN and EMILY BROWNING are excellent and believable as they confront their wicked and devious uncle with methods of their own.Carrey is hilarious in his usual over-the-top sort of performance that suits the material and Meryl Streep is equally skillful in an amusing characterization as the aunt who is afraid of just about everything while supposedly taking charge of the three orphans that show up at her doorstep.The humor is cleverly imposed on all of the characters, especially Carrey, Streep and Timothy Spall who has a fine time in another good character role. Costumes, make-up, settings are all way above average with the look of the film closely resembling something Tim Burton would devise.A film that never got its due acclaim, it's well worth your time as a fascinating excursion into another world, both darkly grim and still intentionally humorous in conception.

15,poolandrews,"""Don't you find it strange that we aren't related to any of our relatives?"" Good but could have been better.",6,24 December 2007,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events starts as three young children, Violet (Emily Browning), her brother Klaus (Liam Aiken) & their sister Sunny Beaudelaire (Kara & Shelby Hoffman) are given the bad news that their parents have been killed in a fire which has burnt their house to the ground. They are adopted by a distant relative, the strange actor Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who wants to kill them off to inherit their parents fortune. However the siblings quickly realise what Olaf is up to & must stay alert to outwit him & his attempts on their life as they search for the truth behind their parents death...This American German co-production was directed by Brad Silberling & is an entertaining enough Tim Burton/Grim Brother's dark fairytale type fantasy but I must admit it left me a bit unsatisfied. The script by Robert Gordon was based on the series of popular children's books Daniel Handler, in particular the first three The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room & The Wide Window were used as the basis for the film, straight off the bat one has to say it's a children's film first & foremost although it's one of those children films which will probably appeal to adults as well. It's quite a grim film on occasion, it has some wonderfully spooky & dark production design & the narrator Lemony Snicket keeps telling us of horrible & terrible things that will happen but (disappointingly) it never goes too far. It certainly moves along at a nice pace, it's never boring but it never really excited me that much, it never really grabbed me, it never really got piqued my interest & it never really pulled me into the dark fantasy world that it creates. I didn't think it funny at all, again maybe because I'm an adult but I didn't laugh once. The character's are good enough, Count Olaf obviously stands out as the villain as he disguises himself as several different people to con his way to a fortune, Aunt Josephine is also memorable for her bizarre irrational fears although it's never quite explained who the narrator Lemony Snicket is.Director Silberling does a fine job & shoots the film with lots of neat little visual touches & lots of style, he is obviously helped by some truly wonderful production design from the sets, costumes & props. The designers have gone to town & the film looks great, from foggy beach's with picket fences, Count Olaf's gloomy rundown mansion that looks like something from The Addams Family, Dr. Montgomery's huge reptile sanctuary, Aunt Josephine's impossible house suspended over the edge of a sheer cliff by beams of wood, the speeding train & Count Olaf's sinister hearse looking car to a darkly atmospheric cave & lake. Most of the CGI computer effects are good although the deadly viper snake looks terrible. The violence is minimal so don't worry about that.With a supposed budget of about $140,000,000 this wasn't short of money was it? Most of the money seems to have been spent on a good cast & the sumptuous production design which is nothing short of amazing, unfortunately everything else is somewhat harder to find including a satisfying story. Shot entirely within studios the film also features a dummy start where a film called The Little Elf supposedly begins before Lemony interrupts & starts his own story. The acting is good, Carrey was born for roles like this, Meryl Streep is good & Scottish comedian Billy Connolly has a small role.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a good solid & entertaining children's darkly grim fantasy which serves it's purpose well enough, certainly no classic in my opinion but it's definitely worth a watch all the same & it should keep both young & old alike quiet for 100 odd minutes if nothing else.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Simply its some of the best animation to come out all year.While I can give the end credits a 10 out of 10 I can only give the rest of the film a begrudging 7 out of 10, although it should probably be a 6.5. Certainly this is a fantastically well made movie, that is for the most part very well acted but something is amiss in the tone of the film and so it never really is what it should be.The story of three children who's parents are killed and who are forced from guardian to guardian by the murderous acts of Count Oloff is pretty bleak. And with a title like ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" you really can't expect dancing elves, but the film makers have chosen to add a vein of madcap silliness to the proceedings that works against the rest of the film. It seems as if they were afraid that the material was going to be seen as too dark, which is a shame since its clear from the sequences where they left well enough alone that the film could have stood on its own.Its a good movie, instead of the great one it wants to be.Definitely worth seeing.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
17,grantss,So-so - lacks that spark to make it special,5,21 April 2016,"So-so - lacks that spark to make it special.Three children - Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire - are left orphaned when their house burns down, with their parents in it, in mysterious circumstances. They are left in the custody of a distant relative, Count Olaf (played by Jim Carrey). It is soon apparent that Count Olaf only cares about the children for their large inheritance.Fairly lacklustre, for the most part. Had potential as heartening tale about struggling against adversity and surviving but the plot is mostly a listless, rambling adventure. Conclusion is sweet and reasonably profound but this doesn't make up for the dullness that precedes it.Part of the problem is that Jim Carrey, for all his outlandishness and clowning ability, fails to hit the right note. His performance just feels off, like he's going through the motions.In what might be a first for me, I found the children's performances far more engaging and convincing than the adults. Plus, the baby gets the best lines (another first).Considering that the director, Brad Silberling, and lead actor, Jim Carrey, are the main problems, a Tim Burton-Johnny Depp collaboration would have been a much better combination for this movie. The plot and target audience suits Burton to a T and he would have provided the suitable special effects, edginess mixed with sweetness, dark mixed with light.

It's good entertainment to watch but still the movie leaves a bad aftertaste. It's because the movie has so many missed opportunities and could had been a so much better movie.The sets are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful and so is the make-up. The cinematography is fine and the story is told in a good fast pace, even though the story takes quite some big leaps at times.Jim Carrey obviously had fun playing all those different characters, with make-up on. He plays his roles entertainingly over-the-top which also makes it very fun for us the viewers to watch. Not his best role, but certainly one of his most entertaining ones. The movie also has other fin well known actors in it such as Billy Connolly, Meryl Streep and Timothy Spall, who all seemed to be enjoying themselves while making the movie. But also truly fine were the children actors who really were the heart and main characters of the movie. They were good and believable in their roles and made the movie because of that work.The movie has a wonderful imaginative story, characters and events but none of it ever really grabbed me. The movie didn't handled the emotions really well, which must have been the main reason why the movie didn't really grabbed me. Sure, it was all good fun and beautiful to watch but I missed some depth in it all. A little bit more work on the script would had made the movie so much better to watch. Oh well, children will still love this movie though. It has all the elements in it to make this an entertaining movie to watch for the young ones.Certainly one of the more entertaining movies of 2004 but not the must see I expected it to be.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Series of Unfortunate Events
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Lemonade,7,7 September 2009,"I haven't read a word of any of the novels, this is the first thing helmed by Silberling that I watch, and the two other films I know that Gordon has written are in separate ends of the spectrum(MIIB and Galaxy Quest). Nevertheless, I pretty much knew what to expect of this. The trailer told me. And it didn't lie. So I wasn't terribly surprised to not find this funny. I'm not going to dedicate the rest of this review to tearing the flick apart. You don't have to tell me that there are countless people who do love this... hey, more power to you. It wasn't made for someone like me. If this looks appealing to you, chances are that you will love it. It's well-made, creative and imaginative, with the production values seldom lacking(meanwhile, the CGI looks pretty enough, but there are points where it will not fool anyone). The plot is imaginative enough, and I guess it's supposed to be fairly predictable. Acting is good for what the performers were to do(and hey, the children are actually not particularly irritating, and that's coming from a person who's got a severely low tolerance for such). Every character(save for maybe Klaus and Violet) is a one-note joke, and all adults are evil and/or stupid. The humor is random, silly and goofy. I'm not sure there's particularly any gross-out comedy, which is nice to see in so recent a movie. There is a dark tone to at least some of this. It's no wonder that Burton was attached at one time. The moral isn't bad, if kind of obvious. Cinematography and editing are great. The DVD comes with two director's commentaries(the first of them is him by himself, and is informative, the second one has him joined by the author, Daniel Handler, and I can imagine that fans of the book series will enjoy it), a couple of featurettes(one of them containing a cool mini-ad, and both of them are entertaining and interesting), deleted scenes and outtakes. I recommend this to anyone who finds themselves attracted to it from promotional material. 7/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I have a greater appreciation of the movie now than I did back in '04 or whenever.Watching Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf trying incessantly to capture the Boutlier children was a gas. As good as NPH is, I think Jim Carrey was better. It's nothing huge, it's the subtleties and no doubt the familiarity. Jim Carrey has already done so many comedy hits that his face alone can induce laughter. A Count Olaf character is right in his wheelhouse.I appreciated the Tim Burton-esque scenery, the slightly dark humor, and the overall storyline.

23,neil-476,Perhaps not really my sort of film,7,30 December 2013,"Three children, orphaned when their parents die in a house fire, fall into the clutches of wicked Count Olaf who is after their inheritance.This film, based on popular books which I haven't read, is set in an odd sort of relative of the real world - Victorian / Edwardian / present day, run through a heavy-handed Gothic / Tim Burton filter. This strange otherworldly atmosphere is enhanced by Jim Carrey's extraordinary and over the top performance as Count Olaf. Unrecognisable under an excellent makeup, the character he creates is truly sinister, blackly comic, and very much on a par with his (then) expected overly theatrical thesping, which contrasts with the relatively naturalistic performances from everyone else.I can understand finding this film appealing because there is a lot here to value, especially visually. Unfortunately, I found that there were often things which pulled me out of the movie. The most glaring of these was the dastardly plan towards the end where every Olaf keeps putting up reasons why the kids will be unable to prevent the marriage being effective when, to me, the simplest reason of all is that making someone do something under duress means that it is legally invalid. Oh well, perhaps the laws are different in this alternative world. Although I normally love fantasy, maybe this simply wasn't my sort of film.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
24,evanston_dad,Movie Belongs to Carrey,6,11 October 2005,"I've not read the book series upon which this film is based, but I have a feeling it's just the sort of thing I would have loved when I was a kid: dark, morbid, twisted and funny. The movie benefits from a knock-out production design and a fun performance from Jim Carrey, who appears in an assortment of kooky costumes and identities and is allowed to ham it up as much as he wants. On the negative side, the children who serve as the film's focus are the dreariest kids to ever appear in a children's film; the director can't drag a reaction from them to save his life. Each has one stock facial expression they use to respond to every situation: the boy widens his eyes and the girl purses her lips. The fun in the film is supposed to come from watching them foil Carrey again and again, yet I was rooting for Carrey the whole time.There's a bunch of other big names, some used more than others. Meryl Streep is a dotty aunt who's afraid of everything. Billy Connolly is a reptile expert. Mike Leigh regular Timothy Spall is the attorney in charge of seeing that the children are provided for by their legal guardian. All of these actors have a fair amount to do. However, others, like Dustin Hoffman and Jennifer Coolidge, make appearances that don't really even rate as cameos, and I'm not sure why they're in the film at all. And Jude Law, who has now proved that he was in just about every film released in 2004, does narration duties.So overall ""Lemony Snicket"" is a fun but not especially memorable film. As far as children's films go, think more along the lines of Tim Burton than Walt Disney, but not as good as a Burton movie. And one more thing: this movie has the longest end credits I've ever seen.Grade: B-",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Based on the kids book about trauma and tragedy where two children are sent to live with their scheming uncle Count Olaf when their parents pass away. He is really after their inheritance. The narration indicates that the content is dark but for a film aimed at families this is perhaps too dark. Count Olaf even arranges for the children to be hit by a train, which is disturbing for a film aimed at children. Lame plot becomes one constant pursuit until he tries to marry the eldest daughter in hints of paedophilia. Directed by Brad Silberling who previously made the dreadful Casper. Jim Carrey is a fine comedic talent but Olaf is an idiot that he even he cannot bring grace too. Supporting roles by Liam Aiken and Meryl Streep are too brief and repetitious. Jude Law voices Snicket who is never involving as a personality. The children are presented with as little personality as humanly possible although Emily Browning has potential to go further. The visual effects and art direction are the one area of major compliment but the screenplay is warped beyond repair. It contains a strong theme that exposes greed but in the long run the film itself is one big series of unfortunate events on its own. Score: 4 / 10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
26,HotToastyRag,Visually stunning,6,11 December 2017,"If you watch the preview of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, it's pretty much impossible to resist seeing the full movie. It looks fantastic! Three young children who are recently orphaned are sent to live with their uncle, but he keeps trying to kill them to inherit their fortune. The uncle is played by Jim Carrey, and he's dressed and made up in countless disguises, showing off a mixture of comedic and dramatic talents that's a joy to watch. Among the ""series of unfortunate events"", you'll see many familiar faces, including Meryl Streep, Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, Luis Guzman, Craig Ferguson, Jennifer Coolidge, Catherine O'Hara, Jane Adams, Cedric the Entertainer, Helena Bonham Carter, Amy Brenneman, Dustin Hoffman, Jane Lynch, and Jude Law, who narrates the film.The movie is quite beautiful to watch, in such deep, dark colors, ornate costumes, and surreal landscapes. It makes you think you've entered a world co-designed by Tim Burton and Dr. Seuss, and the result is magical. Jim Carrey fans won't want to miss this tour-de-force, and neither will anyone who appreciates beautiful set designs. While it's not really a movie I like to watch over and over again, it is very visually entertaining.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
27,Wuchakk,"It's, um, creative",7,13 October 2017,"RELEASED IN 2004 and directed by Brad Silberling from the books by Daniel Handler, ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" chronicles events when three children whose parents perished in a dubious fire are delivered to the custody of their strange relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). When it doesn't work out they stay with their snake-loving uncle (Billy Connolly) and, later, their fear-plagued aunt (Meryl Streep). Emily Browning plays the inventive 14 year-old and Liam Aiken her exceptionally intelligent brother. Jude Law is on hand as the narrator Lemony Snicket.This is akin to a modern-day ""Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and is similar in tone to ""Into the Woods"" (2014), albeit without the constant songs. Carrey is effective as the creepy and malevolent Count Olaf. His performance is fittingly over-the-top and amusing in a black humor way. His mansion looks like it was designed & furnished by the Addams Family. Emily Browning shines as the winsome adolescent with an unbelievably cute face. She was 15 during shooting.People have criticized the film on the grounds that the adults repeatedly refuse to believe the children, who are always cognizant of Olaf's diabolical doings, but it smacks of real life. Haven't you ever dealt with a charming, but malignant liar who amazingly charms everyone around him/her (spouse, boss, manager, co-workers, friends, followers), except those wise souls who can see through the (obvious) façade?Overall, the movie's not great, but it's not bad and has some stellar moments.

28,zetes,Ought to be better,6,18 December 2004,"Has great promise, but delivers too little. It's always amusing, but I wish it would be more than just amusing. The production design is absolutely fantastic. It's the selling point of the film. Jim Carrey is very funny, and I like at least two of the three child stars. Emily Browning is sure to be the next Christina Ricci. Liam Aiken is also very good. The third child is just a baby, so who can tell whether she can act or not. What I do know is that the character of Sunny was by far my least favorite thing about the film. I did not like the cheap subtitled joke lines that she delivers constantly. The film would have been much better if that character would have been run over by a dump truck. There is an extraordinary animated sequence during the closing credits. This is, in a way, unfortunate. As soon as the film was over, everybody got up and started walking out. The audience did that thing when, as soon as something interesting appears over the closing credits, they all stop standing up, or try to push those who are still sitting down out of their way. That's horrible, but what's worse is that the three people I was with insisted on going. And the worst of all is that the theater rudely turned on the lights so that they could clean. I was forced out! People worked damn hard on that sequence, probably much harder than the screenwriter or director did. They really ought to have had that open the film, instead of the stupid little clay animation bit that does begin it.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,8,27 February 2005,"The Littlest Elf opens this movie, before being shut off Lemony Snicket's narration (voiceover Jude Law, hey, he's everywhere in 2004!), reminding everyone that this is a movie with a sad beginning and end, and with a series of unfortunate events.We are introduced to the Baudelaire children - Violet, who has a knack of invention using things readily available (and whose pouty lips are comparable to that of Angelina Jolie's), Klaus, who reads loads of books, and remembers everything, and the toddler Sunny, who...err... just bites.The first unfortunate event is the burning of their house / parents inside (not shown). Suddenly they are left orphans, and are bounced from guardian to guardian, comprising of distant and weird relatives, like one who keeps strange reptiles, and another who has a fear of practically everything, but with a nuance for proper grammar.Jim Carrey is Count Olaf, their first guardian, who craves nothing but the children's' inheritance, and schemes to get custody / kill / anything that does the trick to get the children and/or the money. Here, Carrey is on familiar playground, with multiple disguises giving him the opportunity to flex his facial muscles.But the toddler Sunny actually steals the show from Carrey, with her inability to speak, except gagas and googoos, hilarious subtitling thrown in as interpretation, and oh-so-cute actions. Awww.....The storyline and narrative feel is somewhat similar in style to the Harry Potter movies - most times dark, Gothic, sinister, as the kids try and solve who did and why their parents got killed, yet at the same time showcasing and utilizing their unique abilities to get them out of sticky situations. The CGI works perfectly here, and brings to life the excitement of many set action pieces.This film has peaked my interest in the books - let's hope their not written in too childish a manner for me! By the way, I do not know why, but all the audience left when the end credits are shown - they are drawn beautifully with caricatures and silhouettes, and the haunting score just captivates. Stay and appreciate, yeah?",A Series of Unfortunate Events
30,siderite,"Horribly boring, saved only by Jude Law's voice",5,9 June 2005,"I haven't read any Lemony Snickett books and , after this movie, I certainly don't intend to. The premise is this: Three children become orphans after their parents die in a mysterious fire then they are chased around by a failed actor named Count Olaf who wants to take their family fortune. Except the children, all the other characters are certified morons, the situations are absurd and the fact that I gave it a 5 is only because Jude Law is reading in that nice British accent from something that I believe are the original books.How can one consider a movie, even one as bad as this one, that deals with the loss of parents and all nice relatives a comedy is beyond me. Just because Carrey played in it? Jim Carrey could have been a great actor, I think, but he chose comedy to which he is not suited in any circumstance. Well, in this movie he plays a villain that changes voices and appearances very easily, he does a good job, to bad the script was lousy.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Very dark, but that's the way fairy tales are supposed to be",8,3 November 2007,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events was a silent hit of 2004, I remember I wasn't too sure if I wanted to see it or not because it just looked too dark for what I thought it was intended to be, a family film. But I was looking for a movie to watch yesterday and decided to go ahead and give the movie a chance. While I still think it was too dark for a family film, I thought that it was still a great film and the crew did a remarkable job of bringing the story to life. Normally while Jim Carrey can over do his roles that have this type of character, he actually portrayed Count Orlof extremely well and did a terrific job. I'm in some ways surprised that he didn't get more notice for this film. He, Meryl Streep, Billy O'Connelly really brought Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events to life. The sets and costumes were marvelous and the story was a frightening but imaginative one that I'm sure any film fan would enjoy to watch.Three children: Klas, Violet, and Sunny have just lost their parents and home to a horrible fire. They are left in the hands of one of their ""closest"" friends, the scary looking and crazy Count Orlof. The count makes the kids do his chores and makes them cook dinner for him and his friends, but the one thing he does want is the children's inheritance from their parents. After attempting to kill them, they are taken to a safer guardian, but Orlof isn't going to give up so easily, he is going to go through as many guardians as it takes to get back these children.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a terrific film, I was incredibly impressed, I'm glad I decided to give it a chance. It had good comic relief, but also had some thrilling moments, while I don't think it's a good idea to give this film completely to the kids, it's a family thriller type of film that I'm sure could be enjoyed. I know there are a lot of kids that wanna have a more grown up genre they could watch and this might be the film for them. I do recommend it for watch, this film is definitely worth the look. Not to mention, for once it was nice that they didn't over do it with the baby comedy, she was actually cute and funny. You'll see what I mean when you watch it, you'll be happy too, the kids are very likable and so are the rest of the characters.8/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
32,Buddy-51,ghastly excuse for a children's movie,2,11 August 2005,"""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" - a creepy, cringe-inducing hunk of pseudo-Dickensian whimsy - proves, once and for all, that they just don't make good old-fashioned Victorian melodramas the way they used to. Technically speaking, the film isn't actually set in the Victorian Era but rather in a never-never land in which 19th century fashions clash with late 20th Century technology. And, indeed, it is the unique look of the film - achieved through extraordinary art direction and brilliant production and costume design - that is the one element of quality in the movie.The plot is vintage Dickens: three adorable and resourceful youngsters, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, find themselves unexpectedly homeless and orphaned when a mysterious fire kills their parents and incinerates their house. With no last will and testament specifying who is to raise them, the children are carted off to a distant ""relative"" by the name of Mr. Olof, a creepy, sadistic eccentric who lives in a ramshackle mansion across town and hates children with a seething passion. He also plays host to a troupe of ghoulish cretins (ostensibly fellow actors) who look like punk rock rejects from the dance clubs down in Soho. In no time flat, Mr. Olof has turned the three youngsters into his own personal slaves. He even goes so far as to try to rub them out on the notion that he will then inherit their parents' money. The plot involves the children repeatedly escaping from Olof's diabolical clutches into the protective arms of other ""relatives,"" only to have him show up in various disguises, knock off the competition, and re-establish his primacy over the hapless trio.Although ostensibly a comedy, ""Lemony Snicket's"" is, in actuality, an extremely dark, depressing movie, definitely not appropriate for young children, but even adults will be made uncomfortable by its obsessive emphasis on cynicism, sadism and death. The movie reaches its nadir in a truly queasy scene in which the middle-aged Olof attempts to marry his 14 year-old ward as a means of inheriting the money. This is supposed to be funny? Beyond that, the movie is boring and episodic, with little narrative thrust to hold the disparate and repetitive ""events"" (we'll agree that they are quite ""unfortunate"") together.Normally a big fan of Jim Carrey, I found his performance in this film to be repulsive and unwatchable, a new career low for him (well, his Grinch comes pretty close). Even the normally can-do-no-wrong Meryl Streep falls victim to this film.One can only imagine what a master artist like Dickens would have done with this material, how he would have imbued it with wit and heart and a strong statement about human relationships and societal values. ""Lemony Snickets"" could have been an imaginative, delightful story about a crazy but engaging old codger who brings magic and fun into the lives of three hurting children. Instead, it's a dismal tale of a twisted old psychopath who spends two hours killing innocent people and terrorizing youngsters with the same fate if they don't do everything he tells them to. I honestly can't imagine what audience these movie makers thought they were appealing to with this movie.If this film, heaven help us, ever spawns a rash of sequels, we'll have to change the title to ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Movies.""",A Series of Unfortunate Events
33,cherold,"absolutely fascinating, I'd really like to read the books now",8,5 July 2006,"This is one of those movies that inspires an interesting range of reactions among IMDb users. The first review I read said, I haven't read the books but my understanding is they aren't at all like this. I then read a lot of other reviews that said they never read the books and finally one who had and thought the movie quite successful.I haven't read the books, but I may have to now. I had a good feeling about this movie, the idea of dark depressing children's stories appealed to me mightily. Children are, in my experience, dark people, and I think somehow most adults forget that and just take them at face value as those laughing little creatures in the park.Anyway, back to the reviews. Some people have said this movie is too dark to be a comedy. These are, I suspect, people who don't like dark comedies. This isn't the darkest of comedies, but it doesn't pull its punches, and really will bring you down from time to time. But it plays with its depressing nature, sinking into pure depression and then pushing it further into comedy. There are also many moments that are just brilliant, funny and ingenious.I looked at a dozen or so IMDb reviews before wearying of them so now I'll just give mine: excellent cast, Carrey is darkly funny, the writing is excellent, the movie is first rate, and if you read the premise and think it sounds too dark then don't blame the movie when you watch it and find it too dark.Note: a few months after seeing the movie I read the first book and gave up after a few chapters.

34,Robert_duder,Title makes sense,6,4 January 2005,"A series of Unfortunate Events is exactly as it sounds. I have not read, and probably won't read the series of books which quite often only ruins a movie anyways. The previews for this film looked fun which made me want to see it. I wasn't disappointed by the movie nor was I by any means blown away by it. It wasn't epically Harry Potterish as some people tried to say it would be but rather it was it's own unique, outside the box type film.Lemony Snicket: A Series of Unfortunate Events is a story about the Baudelaire siblings, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, who suddenly find themselves orphaned when their parents die in an inexplicable house fire. They are sent to live with their nearest living relative Count Olaf who simply wants them dead so he can claim the Baudelaire fortune. After numerous attempts on the children's' lives they are taken away from him and are sent on a series of random adventures with Olaf close behind them causing the most unfortunate accidents to the nice guardians they meet a long the way.The film is a haven of cameo's and acting ability. Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep, Jude Law as the narrator, Billy Connolly, Castherine O' Hara, Jennifer Coolidge and a brief cameo by the great Dustin Hoffman. Also the newcomers in the children Emily Browning as Violet, Liam Aiken, and The Hoffman twins. All three children (four actors) were amazing. They really were the heart of the film and they even outplayed Jim Carrey. Carrey as Count Olaf was...well it was Carrey. He has been great in many things Truman Show, The Majestic but when he's doing comedy he is always Carrey and it comes through no matter what role he's playing or how much make up he's got on. He did make a decent diabolical bad guy though. The films real draw is it's direction, it's atmosphere, setting and it's tone. For a children's film the tone is very grown up, it's very dark, and brooding. The setting although appearing to be modern times is very old fashion, very cloudy and gritty to set the tone for the film. It's plot of death and unfortunate events might seem harsh for children but it's moral of sticking together to overcome all things and having the children as the heroes makes a difference. Perhaps they will serialize this film as well and I hope they do a decent job and perhaps put some more adventure into the heart of the film as I found it oddly slow paced at times and rather drawn out. It was an average plot with some very nice things to look at throughout. Comic relief goes to Sunny absolutely as her scenes ""biting things"" and her sub titled comments were downright hilarious. It's worth checking out and probably a treasure on DVD. 6.5/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
35,Lejink,Uncle Kracker,7,14 February 2015,"So I'm child-minding for my twelve year old niece again which means it's her choice of movie, which of course means we're in Young Adults territory again. This time though we went back in time to this movie adaptation of the successful children's fantasy book series and with fantastic SFX, numerous entertaining big-name cameos and as the title suggests, a fast-moving episodic narrative I was thoroughly entertained.The story goes where it wants to go as we accompany the three poor Beaudolaire orphans, the creative older sister, bookish middle brother and mischievous baby sister as they court danger and avoid death at every turn, before good naturally triumphs over evil in time-honoured fashion. The afore-mentioned evil is personified in Jim Carrey's pantomime villain Count Elaf, who stands to inherit massively if only he can rid himself of those pesky kids. However, while he manages a pretty good strike rate amongst the children's appointed guardians, Uncle Billy Connolly and Auntie Meryl Streep, the kids stubbornly refuse to die much to the Count's chagrin.As someone once said nothing is real as we enter a sort of Gothic Wonderland, full of the fantastic and the frightening. The C-Gen cinematography I found to be excellent particularly Streep's edge-of-a-cliff rickety old house, while the acting was greatly entertaining. Streep is a hoot as the grammar-loving, over-trusting aunt, Connolly's character is disappointingly, a bit too vanilla, but Carrey is in sparkling form, relishing the opportunity to go over the top of the very top with his crazy accents, facial expressions and rubber-band-man body-language. As usual with him, one suspects a fair bit improv in his dialogue nut the dark humour only adds to the fun.A visual feast, a roller-coaster of a story and funny with it, I'd have to say this was a good pick Erin, it just seems a pity the movie wasn't successful enough on original release to engender any sequels.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
36,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Where's the roast beef?,6,21 July 2021,"Based on the first three titles in Lemony Snickett's book series of the same name, 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events (2004)' follows a trio of recently orphaned siblings who bounce from distant relative to distant relative while being pursued by the always-up-to-no-good Count Olaf, an oddball actor who is in some way related to the children himself. It's actually a rather grim tale, though it presents itself in a generally comedic and, I suppose, 'friendly' sort of way. It's macabre in the same way a Tim Burton movie might be, with moodily gothic designs and tragedy that isn't really intended to make you cry. The tone is a bit weird but it generally works and sets the thing apart from similar fare. For the most part, the picture is entertaining enough even if it isn't all that compelling. It has a somewhat skittish - a word which here means almost akin to a series of skits - structure that sees its heroes go from one relative to the next and undergo a similar set of events. It's repetitive, but not necessarily in a negative way. It does lose some of its underlying plot strands along the way, though, and it also doesn't really feel like a completely cohesive whole. Still, it's successful enough for what it wants to be. It sticks its landing, too, and centres around a bold performance from a delightfully scene-chewing Jim Carrey. 6/10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The 3 kids go to Count Olaf's and the only scene we get of him trying to kill them was with the train. Weren't there more attempts in the book? Then the kids go to stay with the uncle, and then Aunt, but not a lot of entertaining things happen.As for Jim Carrey, it was like he was playing a toned down Ace Venture.

Not so surprising since Dreamworks Studios was involved.It's difficult to know where to start. Perhaps with the design and visual effects. The movie has a very special ""look"" to it...and that contributes to it being ""special"". I particularly liked the color scheme...magical.Then you have a highly amusing and creative story line.And some darned good acting. Emily Browning as the older girl (Violet) is very good here, as is Liam Aiken as the boy (Klaus). Jude Law does well as the narrator (Lemony Snicket). Timothy Spall is very entertaining as the eccentric Mr. Poe. Meryl Streep terrific as Aunt Josephine...in a very different role for her. And yes, that is Cedric the Entertainer as the constable. I'm not sure it's acting, but twin actresses Kara and Shelby Hoffman are very entertaining as the infant who thinks hilarious thoughts. Catherine O'Hara in quite good as Justice Strauss. Craig Ferguson and Dustin Hoffman have cameo roles.I mentioned a caveat. Will you enjoy watching Jim Carrey overact for over 90 minutes...because, make no mistake, that is what he does. But, ironically, it's also what makes the movie work. So, it's a question of balance. I can see some people not being able to get past the overacting. But, Carrey is not Jerry Lewis.

Carrey, almost unrecognizable as Count Olaf, brings the right touch of menacing goofiness to the role of the guardian from hell.

Then the film is a perfect pile and mine of inventive ideas and horrors, frightening animals and horrible situations, from the confrontation to giant serpents and snakes to the fall into some fathomless abyss or bottomless chasm. And beware of giant leeches that jump at your face. It is a real pleasure when they finally learn the truth and use it to escape the last trap of the bad uncle, the Beetlejuicy fake real marriage, and we really feel not sorry but proud for them who were able to prove inventive readers who know how to bite and could isolate themselves into surreal efficacy against criminals. Sherlock Holmes can stay at home nowadays. The younger generations are a lot more effective and direct in their fight against crime that is victimizing them.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",A Series of Unfortunate Events
44,filipemanuelneto,"Confusing, funny but very exaggerated.",4,18 December 2016,"This film tries to adapt an infantile-juvenile story developed in several books, about the Baudelaire Orphans and the way they end up being persecuted by a distant relative, the theatrical Conde Olaf, that tries at all cost to be tutor so that he control the immense fortune that they are sole heirs. The main roles are embodied by Liam Aiken, Emily Browning and Jim Carrey but the supporting cast features Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep, among others. One of the things I noticed is that this film tells a story virtually unknown outside the universe of English literature. I've never heard of these books until I watch the movie, and even today I do not know if they're translated into Portuguese. I also got the feeling that the movie is an ""unfinished work"", in the sense that it was planned to end the story with a sequel that was never made.The film does not seem to make sense, but I do not know if this is intentional and already part of the books, or if it was a conscious (and bad) option of the director and the writer. The truth is that this non-sense makes it difficult to understand, mainly for adult audiences. The film also has another problem, which may also result from an intentional choice by the director: the theatrical interpretation of much of the cast. I do not know if it was meant to play with it, making it an additional joke but it turned out badly. Jim Carrey is the only one who we tolerate these exaggerations because we are already used to his hyperactive way of doing comedy. Emily Browning is the most pleasant surprise. For such a young actress, she did a very professional job, promising a good career if the young woman stayed on the rails and strive. The film bets heavily on the CGI and this ends up being a double-edged sword because, if in a way allowed another type of jokes and scenes, on the other hand it ended up visually saturating the film. One thing I liked very much, though the majority did not care, were the final credits, elaborated in a very funny way.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

46,BaronBl00d,Carey's Performance is a Sham!,8,24 May 2005,"A most enjoyable, dark romp for Jim Carey as an excruciatingly bad actor who is given custody of three children after their parents die in a fire which tragically burns house and all down. Carrey plays the actor Count Olaf in tour-de-force fashion creating three separate roles as the count, and Italian named Stephano, and Captain Sham - all out to kidnap the children/kill the children for the large inheritance they were bequeathed. Robert Gordon takes the popular novels(three I believe) of Daniel Standler and creates a very intriguing script generously infused with subtle humour,not so subtle humour, dark angst, an almost dirge-like atmosphere, and some incredibly quirky characterizations. Nothing normal for this film as the three children are known as ""the inventor(Emily Browning giving a very nice performance),"" ""the reader(cleverly played by aspiring youngster Liam Aiken),"" and ""the biter(young toddler cutely played by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman)."" Other notable performances are given by Billy Connoly as a kindly relative interested in herpetology(?) and Meryl Streep living in a house like a ship worried that everything around her may cause her harm and who loves the perfect spoken/written word. But the key reason Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events is successful is the insightful, visionary direction of Barry Siberling. He creates such a unique dark fantasy world not wholly outside our own world and yet not in our world either. The set designs, costumes, and cinematography all help capture this mood. It is this atmosphere which really gets the ball rolling in the film figuratively speaking. Once it gets going, all the other pieces fall into place and Carey is allowed to be ridiculous AND believable all at the same time. That lends his performance and the film some much needed credibility. There are many great scenes in the film, but I will only mention a couple of favourites. I loved the beginning with the elf and the narration throughout. It set the mood again for the film and what is was going to attempt to do. As for Carey'scenes, his Stephano is an almost perfect characterization of a character playing another character. I did have the chance to see much of the documentaries and deleted scenes on the DVD and was blown away how Carey improvised much of the dialog used in that scene with him talking about his experiences with the marine snake and eel. Just priceless! Two vigorous thumbs up for this film with one slight reservation. Although I enjoyed the comic dark edge to the film, it probably isn't something for very small children - the humour and dark images may not coincide for them.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Quality movie, unless you're a die-hard fan of the books",7,23 December 2004,"I first heard of these books when I saw my younger brother reading  them. I got curious and when I saw they were making a movie was sure to  read the first three before seeing it. Right off the bat, I can tell  you that if you are a completely possessive fan of these books you  might be rather disappointed by this movie. The movie condenses books  ""The Bad Beginning,"" ""The Reptile Room,"" and ""The Wide Window"" by  slicing the first book in half and placing the other two inside of it,  like a sandwich. Of course in order for this to be possible the story  has to change to make it work, so some elements are not factual.  Combine this with Snicket's usually clever details in the book having  to be cut down and very loyal fans are going to be disappointed. The  movie also adds in a subplot that the first three books do not possess,  but that the later ones (according to my brother) do, so I was a bit  bothered by having that element ruined if i choose to read more of the  series.  I, however, understand the difference between books and movies, and  think that on the whole they succeeded in keeping the tone and  uniqueness of this series. Carrey as Olaf is wonderful and adds  something to a character that seems to be rather dry in the books and  the children are believable and easy to sympathize with. While humor  was scarce, the tone of the books is more clever than humorous anyway.  Overall my only issues are plot-wise and how this creates a choppy feel  to the film, but I don't know of a way it could have been done better.  The movie was well done with(as many are saying) excellent scenery,  costumes, etc., yet nothing made this film completely amazing. It is  however, worth the time and money and one should definitely read the  books. ~Steven C",A Series of Unfortunate Events
48,funkyfry,Disappointing dark children's comedy,3,9 November 2005,"Personally I found this film disappointing given the amount of talent involved. I have not read the original books so that does not enter into my thinking. I just found the story didn't draw me in, I didn't really care about the children. The narration was part of that, making me feel distanced from the film instead of drawn more into it, because it was so intrusive.Jim Carrey's performance is the biggest problem. The film-makers seem to have seen it as a bit of an homage to the old Lon Chaney films, specifically ""The Unholy 3"" or ""The Penalty"", the types of films where Chaney would play a malevolent freak with a vendetta or a greedy criminal with odd companions. But although Carrey is a very good actor, he's no Lon Chaney, and seems to be much too far over the top to be believable. The director and the actor seem to have decided to make him both scary and amusing, but it ends up being neither.The sequences with the children's lost Aunt were also totally unconvincing. I don't know the name of the actress but she played the role too high strung. I think this is another case where the director of this film outsmarted himself. Characters can only be clever if the story actually draws you in and makes you interested in them. Otherwise these kind of quirky unrealistic characters are just annoying, like most of this movie.I did greatly enjoy the music and the photography. If only the screenplay had some kind of cohesion and the characters had some kind of focus.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
49,Anonymous_Maxine,A Series of Unfortunate Bits of Celluloid Edited Together Into A Movie.,5,13 January 2005,"Whenever I see a really bad movie, I tend to think about what kinds of things led to such an awful script being put into production. Take some obscure horror movies, like Nightmare Weekend or Graveyard Shift, for example. These movies are so unbelievably bad that it is almost inconceivable to me that someone ever read them and thought, ""Yeah, let's put this into production!"" A Series of Unfortunate Events is not, of course, on the same astounding level of badness as those movies, but its size compared with its quality makes it look like the title refers to the events that took place during pre-production rather than within the story.Before I go on, I should point out that what is probably the first of many Lemony Snicket films is not a complete loss, but it markets itself on one of the brilliant marketing techniques employed by the books, which advise the reader against reading them. The movie starts out by repeatedly referring to itself as dark and dreary and depressing and unhappy, and if you want a cutesy, feel-good movie, ""there is probably plenty of seating left in theater 2."" Incidentally, I was IN theater 2 when I saw the movie, but no matter.The movie is about three children in their hectic search for proper parental care after their parents died in a fire in their home. What follows is a story about three preadolescent adults struggling to find their way in a world populated by fully grown children, but the biggest problem with the movie is the same as the reason that I wanted to see it in the first place  Jim Carrey. Carrey is a massively talented actor, but seems to have misjudged this movie, or at least his target audience. I read an interview with him in Time magazine or Newsweek, where he was asked why children would want to see a movie as dark and unhappy as this one markets itself as. Carrey, a father himself, promptly answered, ""Easy, the leeches!"" This is, of course, a classic Jim Carrey answer, but if there was a single person in the movie that children in the audience would like, it would be Meryl Streep's character, and she gets EATEN by the leeches. Jim Carrey's character, sadly, is neither likable, even as a villain, nor amusing. The film spends way too much time introducing us to characters that we are not meant to care about, and way too little time on the fantasy element. It comes off as a series of contrived scenes in a dirty house sporadically interspersed with establishing shots of strange places, such as the ridiculous house in which Streep lives.Odd that her character is presented as so paranoid that she doesn't want any of the doorknobs in her house to be touched, lest they should explode and send shards of glass into her eyes, yet she doesn't seem to mind that she lives in a rickety wooden house tenuously supported by tremendously tall and spindly wooden supports at the edge of a huge, jagged cliff. Personally, I'd be more worried about the fact that my house rocked back and forth regularly on its fibrous supports than about the possibility of spontaneous electrocution. Not that it matters, Meryl Streep, despite playing a throwaway character, is given extensive screen time during which I imagine we are not meant to come to any logical conclusions about her other than that she is terrified of the world around her and has recently lost her husband to the very leeches that inevitably threaten the lives of the children looking for good parental custody.The Harry Potter element of the movie, so called because it so clearly wants to replicate it, is very well done, except that it is so small that it's difficult to believe. Most of the film takes place in imaginative settings, but all we really see are small sets, often little more than one room, and not enough of the grand establishing shots which were so effective in creating the whole new worlds in the Harry Potter films. Lemony Snicket lives in the shadow of the Harry Potter films, which themselves live in the gigantic shadow of the Lord of the Rings films. Each successive series is smaller and more childish than the last, but the most quality is lost between Potter and Snicket. Indeed, much of the first half of the film is flat out boring.Jim Carrey doesn't seem to be sure if his character is supposed to be funny or threatening, and ultimately he comes off as being neither. He is simply a greedy old humbug who changes disguises that any rational person would recognize (luckily the only rational people in the movie are the three preadolescent adults), in his efforts to obtain legal custody of them and hence the massive inheritance that comes along with them. It's a simple, straightforward and barely interesting premise that is ultimately made into a simple, straightforward and barely interesting fantasy film.I recently read an interview with Peter Jackson about his upcoming King Kong remake where he said that it would, of course, be pointless to spend the rest of his life trying to top his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Certainly understandable, and also understandable that he thinks it wisest to just have fun with such things as a remake of King Kong, one of his all time favorite films. So even though the Lord of the Rings films are not necessarily what fantasy adventure films are shooting to beat, since their own director all but admits that this is impossible, I still tend to think that we have come to expect more than this. Those involved could certainly have done better.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
50,FiendishDramaturgy,Darkly delightful,9,29 January 2005,"It seems to me that once a film of a specific genre/subject hits, the rights of every like-minded literary work on the book shelves of Books-A-Million (in this case, the children's section) is snapped up in a whirl-wind of studio shopping sprees. One such series was the enigmatic Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. The books are easily and quickly read, but they are not your customary children's books with the average children's story. These are much darker, and do not provide the happy ending most children's books insist upon.Having lost their parents in a horrible fire, the Baudelaire orphans must fend for their lives when sent to live with the nefarious Count Olaf, their murderous uncle. Olaf is a cold, calculating, quirky would-be actor who will stop at nothing to seize the Baudelaire fortune but he discovers he can not touch it until the oldest of the orphans turns 18. Olaf is over the top in the books, and is not above murdering the orphans to achieve his goal.This movie confused some movie goers as it was not based on one book alone, but rather the first three of the run. This film succeeds where some other recent children's book adaptations have failed. It is portrayed exactly as the author intended, thanks to dream casting, and solid adaptational screen writing. These literary works are very descriptive from scene to scene, and it transferred perfectly to the screen, thereby surpassing the aforementioned ""other children's book adaptations"" we have seen lately.Barry Sonnenfield brought the beautifully Gothic comedy ""The Addams Family"" with him as he created the look for the sets and homes which the Baudelaire children would visit, thereby giving it that same numinous feel we all loved so much. It is as if this film were exorcised straight from the Lemony Snicket literary works themselves.As I have already mentioned, this movie was an exhibition of dream casting. The Baudelaire children were perfectly cast and portrayed. Meryl Streep is beautiful and tragic as a Baudelaire relative, and Billy Connelly is a delight. Some critics have said that Jim Carrey was ""over the top."" I agree. He was as over the top as was the character he portrayed. Count Olaf, if you dare read the actual literary work, was as much an over the top character as anyone could imagine. Jim Carrey was perfect as the vituperative Count Olaf and is just as he is in the books.All this dark and lovely perfect casting and performances, direction, and writing, is encased in a gossamer but nebulous cloak which conceals the enigmatic Lemony Snicket who tells us of these Unfortunate Events, by way of Jude Law.He cautions us time and time again to leave, if we have come for a happy story with a happy ending, thereby making us want to stay all the more. Nice device which works well. Another such device which is developed from the series is providing a dialog for the baby Sunny by way of subtitles. That was brought straight from the books, as Sunny's occasional outbursts of a language only babies understand, often prompts Snicket to offer translations.I've enjoyed the books over the years, and although the story is a bit out of sequence and order, this film was absolutely 100% successful in capturing the feel and the pace of the books it attempts to document to film. Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events is every bit as quirky and beautifully dark as the Addams Family movies. I found this completely delightful and far superior to most works of this genre.I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan, so it almost hurts my feelings to rate this where it deserves. But in all honesty, it rates a 9/10 from...the Fiend :.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The kids are swell, I love Violets dress, there is a constant sense of threat, not just from a villain that cannot be discouraged but also the adults that will not take the kids seriously. Handler has always been a very anti-adultist writer.I feel the handling of Snicket as a character, this first person objective narrator didn't really bring much. It's only there because the narrator voice is such a big part of the books' identity and was not put there for the sake of a good movie by itself.Still, it has so much more restraint and elegance than the first season of the series, it has humor and pathos and I know I will rewatch it one day.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
54,r96sk,A lot to be entertained by,8,11 May 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed this, but it's missing that little extra something special which stops it from being rated higher.'Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' offers a lot and does a load of respectable things. Jim Carrey is the perfect actor to play the villain here, his performance is super even though I still think he had more in his locker to show off. Enjoyable nonetheless.The two younger members of the cast, Liam Aiken and Emily Browning, are good in their corresponding roles of Klaus and Violet. I initially found the dialogue for toddler Sunny amusing, but it did get repetitive after a while. There's a couple of other parts that familiar people play nicely, namely Timothy Spall (Poe), Billy Connolly (Montgomery), Meryl Streep (Josephine) and Cedric the Entertainer (Constable) - Dustin Hoffman even appears for a cameo. Excellent overall casting, it must be said.I even liked Jude Law, who I've (as of this review) always found more annoying than anything else. Here, he is terrific as Lemony Snicket himself - Law has an ideal voice for narration.As you can see, there's a lot to be entertained by in this film. However, as noted at the top, there's just simply something that it is absent. I feel it should've been funnier and larger, with much more lustre and lure.

55,davispittman,Very well done film,8,28 March 2017,"This movie seemed almost too good for a nickelodeon family oriented film. I mean the cast includes Jim Carrrey and Meryl Streep for gods sake, which means at least the acting is top notch. Jim is so great in his starring role of count Olaf. He is both funny and cynically Sinister at the same time. He is of course evil and his actions prove it, but it's way he acts that is so perfect for Jim Carrey. The attitude that the count always has about him is just right for the kind of actor Jim is. And Meryl Streep!! Oh bravo! Streep plays Aunt Josephine, and she does it with such brilliance. The character of Aunt Josephine must be almost to the point of scared of her own shadow. Opens the door very very carefully and whispers through it, cautions the children not to do a lot of very basic things that anyone would normally do, like touching the doorknobs, not standing near the refrigerator, and not using the radiator. The writing for the film is pretty good, very good/clever dialogue for all the characters. The visuals are also very well done, the CGI that is used doesn't look cheap at all, very realistic. The sets are great too! Josephine's house and Olaf's house in particular look very well put together. I loved the children too, klause and violet are both very impressive for their age. The makeup, costume design, and hair-styling all deserves much praise too. I strongly recommend this film to all people, especially families with appropriately aged kids. 8/10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

For a somewhat older audience however, it is not that funny and not at all adventurous. Jim Carrey is given space and time to act in the way that is known for, and he does it well, but those moments are just that, moments. Carrey's character is actually outshone by another, the young Sunny (Hoffman and Hoffman). Her lines are witty and funny, simply put the best part of the movie.

It is only after their parents passing do they begin to understand the nature of the work their parents did in life, and they also become aware of the fortune they stand to inherit. All seems on the bright side, except for the children's uncle; the sinister yet hilarious count Olaf (played stupendously by Jim Carrey) who wishes to become their guardian by all means necessary (because he is secretly after their inheritance). The entire film, from the minute this is established is spent on count Olaf resorting to dastardly means to try and trap the kids, while each single time they brilliantly outsmart him.

When they are sent to live with Count Olaf, a greedy distant relative, they soon learn he is trying to steal their fortune for himself.Films that are based on a beloved fan base, such as Lord of The Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, have the enormous task of pleasing so many. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is no different, as it is loved from many young minds. For Lord of the Rings and Narnia, they were transfered to the screen in a fantasy format, for Unfortunate Events, it goes between the lines of Fantasy and Comedy, but cannot be able to connect either to the audience.This is a dark film, about a man who killed the parents of three children so he may get the vast fortune, when this fails, he tries to marry the young girl, pretty dark eh. But In the film, it plays it off as comedic, and many of the comedic moments in the film don't hit all the notes. Jim Carrey, while looking the part perfectly, seems to be playing himself in the role. I saw Count Olaf, but I did not believe him. Although, you can tell that Jim Carrey had fun being all the different personalities, and it is a delight to see him portray the many different characters.While in most movies child actors seem to annoy more then please. Case in point, The Ring. Here all the kids are likable. They know how to act in this film because they understood the material, after all the source material is for kids. Unlike every other movie where the kids seem to know everything, case in point again, The Ring. Here they are lost in what is going on, even though we all know what the answer is at the end. The film tries to play it of as a surprise that we find out what really happened to the parents, but we all knew it from the beginning. It was comedic to see all the adults not knowing Count Olaf's plan, or seeing through his disguise, but it was also frustrating at the same time. Another frustration would be the weak CGI of the baby and snake playing together. That scene made me laugh at it and not with it.So where does Snicket get it's praise from, well that's easy, the amazing set designs and cinematography. All of which are beautiful in their own sense. From the beautiful orange sky, to the house on the edge of cliff. The entire film was a beautiful sight to see. It looks like something that Tim Burton would do, and if Burton had done this film it could have been something incredible.Snicket is a feast for the eyes and a good flick to see if you're a fan of the source material. If you're looking for a film with lots of laughs, then pass. If you're looking for depth in plot, then pass, because it's pretty much generic. Olafs tries to get money, kids go to one relatives, Olaf tries to kill them, they go to next, Olaf tries to kill them, tries to get money. Jim Carrey isn't his crazy self, he seems restrained, to a degree. He lets his craziness out through the wild characters that he plays in disguise.

64,BrandtSponseller,"A beautiful, dark fairy tale",10,9 May 2005,"It's old hat for me at this point, but once again, let me remind those who have forgot--it doesn't matter one whit if this film has changed anything contained in the books (please see my ""novel to film mini-rant"", marked in bold red in my user profile). For me, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is an excellent film, regardless of how closely it ""matches"" the Daniel Handler books that form the creative basis. The film deserves a 10 for production design alone, but there is much more to it than that. If you're at all a fan of surrealism, especially surrealism with a dark edge (although the film is certainly not without humor), you can't afford to miss this movie.The story is centered on the Baudelaire kids, Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken) and infant Sunny (played by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman). In a move that could be a satire on the typical Disney scenario, they're left orphans when a fire tragically destroys their home and kills their parents. The film tells the story of how they are shuttled from home to home of different ""relatives"", with the particularly manipulative and sadistic Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) in hot pursuit of the Baudelaire family fortune after the state finally sees the error of its ways in leaving the kids with him.If you think of the ""Do you think it's all right to leave the boy with Cousin Kevin?"" section of Ken Russell's Tommy (1975) stretched out into feature length, made a bit less vicious, sprinkled with liberal doses of Roald Dahlian fantasy, and set in a delightfully anachronistic mishmash alternate universe that combines everything from Victorian fashion sensibilities to postmodern ""retro-tech"" Terry Gilliam-like gadgets, you'll have a good idea of what the film is like. Tonally and in its visual surrealism, A Series of Unfortunate Events is like a very dark and brooding Dr. Seuss. It also bears some resemblance to the visual art styles of Charles Addams and Edward Gory (IMDb's auto-spell correction won't let me spell his name correctly), as well as animation styles such as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993).As that collection of references should make clear, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is in ""parental guidance"" territory. Even though Handler's books are clearly marketed as children's fiction, and the film was also pitched towards a young audience, the material is darker, more twisted and maybe a bit too intense than some parents would like for their pre-teens, not to mention that younger kids may likely find it boring, anyway. But if you or your kids like your fairy tales on the more macabre side, Lemony Snicket will be right up your alley.Which is not to say that this is a horror film, exactly, although in ways the Baudelaire kids' misadventures do resemble a nightmare (and Count Olaf's name and appearance bear a resemblance to the portrayal of Count Dracula in Nosferatu (1922), called Graf Orlok in that masterpiece). But Violet, Klaus and Sunny (their last name, by the way, is a reference to Charles Baudelaire, whose quirkily morbid poetry was to 19th Century romantic literature as A Series of Unfortunate Events is to contemporary children's literature) solve their dilemmas through cunning, using their respective strengths--ingenious invention for Violet, a wealth of book knowledge for Klaus, and biting for Sunny. The message throughout the film tends to be that intellect can overcome any conundrum--and that even goes for the villain; he just has a bit less intellect than the Baudelaire kids.The actors playing the Baudelaire kids are good, and the rest of the cast contains a lot of starsCarrey, Meryl Streep, Dustin Hoffman, Jude Law, Billy Connolly, Catherine O'Hara, Luis Guzman, and so on. While that might sound like a bloated roster, they're made good use of through the episodic nature of the story. Most are only in the film in their segments. All show why they are stars, even if a couple, such as Hoffman and Guzman, aren't given much to do. The only aspect you might find off-putting is if you're not a Jim Carrey fan, as he does his usual schtick here, albeit far more dark and twisted--a bit like the ""evil"" Mask (1994), only not as hyper. I love Carrey's usual manic-comic mode, and I also love dark and twisted, so I had no complaints.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a technical exemplar in every department. The direction and editing are flawless. Thomas Newman's score is attractive and perfectly fits the mood of the film. But what I continually found the most stunning was the production design. The sets, props, costumes, matte paintings, cgi environments and so on are all wonderfully imaginative and beautiful--even the stuff that was purposefully very desolate, gray and drab. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is fine, although it would probably be difficult to execute a bad shot amidst all of the visual marvels. The anachronisms are seamlessly integrated. Even though our cast is wearing mostly Victorian garments and driving classic automobiles, complete with dashboard mini-reel-to-reel players, it all feels very natural.Although this film did respectably at the box office, it didn't do near as well as it should have (especially considering its budget). I think it may have been a bit mismarketed. It deserves a first look or a second chance, but try to get it out of your mind that it's primarily for the young--it's instead for the ""child"" in all of us.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
65,Sirus_the_Virus,Don't believe how much I loved this film.,10,9 August 2009,"Lemony Snicket's A series of Unfortunate Events is a great film. Filled with a great cast. The film even has great newcomers. Including Liam Aiken(Who I preferred in this film) and Emily Browning(The Uninvited). The true performance is Jim Carrey's as Count Olaf. Olaf is an evil asshole who is trying to steal The Bauldilaire fortune. If you've ever read the books, then you should know this. I loved the books. But I actually thought the film was a lot better. A series of unfortunate events has a great cast also. I'll get to the cast in a second. This is definitely Brad Silebreigh's best film to date. He hasn't done the sequel yet for god knows what reason. I do hope he does it soon. There is speculation that he is doing an animation, which is a fine idea. Because the kids could return if it was a animation. I loved A series of unfortunate events, and I can't wait til the sequel. The cast includes: Jude Law(Narrator)(Closer, The Talented Mr. Ripley) Billy Connelly(The X-Files: I want to Believe) Meryl Streep(My favorite actress)(Mamma Mia!, Doubt) I love this film, and I wont deny it. It wasn't a success with critics either, but it should've been. Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances, and I think you should see this film.The Plot:When the Bauldilaire mansion is burnt down, killing their parents, The Bauldilaire Orphans are sent to live with there Uncle Count Olaf. Once they get there, they realize that he only took them in because of their fortune, and once they leave, Olaf follows them everywhere.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
66,film-critic,We are very concerned.,10,21 December 2004,"What a very strong and concrete film that director Brad Silberling has created. I went into this film expecting child's fare, but when I exited I could have sworn that I saw something more on the adult menu. Using tactics from the early Burton era, Silberling has done what others have only attempted when trying to adapt a young adult novel. While others will spend the time trying to beautify or appeal to a younger audience, Silberling has taken Handler's stories and given them the darkness and pizazz that they need. He has obtained a top-notch cast to guide the audience through the story and into his genuine world of fantasy and wonder. Using amazing visuals, Silberling pulls you into this film from the opening sequence and never let's your mind wander  well  at least wander away from the film.I had seen these stories before, but never found the time to read them. My wife had read the first three and was curious on how they would handle this series. So, to answer all of our questions, we decided to see the film. The first impression that she saw that I thought was impressive was that Silberling transformed the film into a beautiful fantasy world. From her perspective, he took a story that could be taken as a world similar to yours and mine, and transformed it into this mythological place where our world does exist, but with fantasy elements. The use of Carrey as Olaf only helped create more of this mythological fantasy world. His over-the-top eccentric nature only took us to a new level of excitement and wonder. Coupled with the darkness of the cinematography and use of so many different stylish approaches, you have a young adult book easily adapted into a very sinister and dark film. That is what struck me so much about this project, the darkness of the set, characters, and tone. There was no light at the end of this dark tunnel, and Silberling makes sure to constantly remind us of that fact. Each time we think that the orphans are going to a better place, there is this dark turn of events that reaches deep into the depths of the world and never lets go. Silberling holds nothing back, and with that in mind perhaps this isn't the children's film that everyone was hoping it would be. This reminds me of the film The Nightmare Before Christmas which Burton helped create, but really didn't appeal to children because of the darkness surrounding such a ""happy"" subject. When we saw this film, children were not laughing, but instead seemed uncomfortable and lost, which only made Jen and I enjoy the film more.Another element that I thoroughly enjoyed was the element of curiosity that Silberling added to the film. We are constantly reminded of the possibility that the children's parents were not who they seemed, and that Olaf was perhaps a part of a darker organization than just being ""Uncle"". The golden spyglass was perfectly used to allow our minds to continually wander throughout the entire film wondering if the truth would ever be fully uncovered. They eye was another great tactic that kept your imagination flowing. That is something films do not allow to happen much anymore, to make the audience use their imagination. Normally, it is all handed to you and your mind can rest  that is not the case with this film. You are always wondering, picturing a new world inside this one and constantly wishing there was more (in a good way!). This was one of those films that I never wanted to end. Like a classic X-Files moment, I wanted all my questions answered and they were not. Silberling has sold me on the next installment when it happens just because I want to see his world, I want to see his people, and I cannot wait to see his darkness.Finally, I would like to say that this is better than any of the Harry Potter films could be. The darkness was vibrant and imaginative, the actors played their parts with perfection, and the story plucked at that string that made you salivate for more. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events reminded me of another film that I recently watched called Unbreakable. In Snicket, I felt as if I was watching the first chapter of a very explosive book. I was watching the first chapter of superheroes, before they realized what they were capable of. Silberling created a whole other world outside of what we were watching that I wanted to know more about, but was only shown snippets of that world. There is always a first chapter to superheroes, and like Unbreakable, we witnessed the birth in this film.Overall, I walked out of the theater with my jaw on the floor. This was so impressive and so beautiful that Silberling and everyone involved should be patted on the back. If I had children and they were interested in seeing this film or one of the Harry Potter films, I know which line we will be in. The eerie darkness surrounding this film made me think of early Burton and the shadowy films he used to release. I highly suggest this film to everyone. It is mind-blowing to say the least. It is a fantasy film with coupled highlights of society and culture. Both my wife and I walked away from this film very impressed.Grade: ***** out of *****",A Series of Unfortunate Events
67,Victor Field,A series of unfortunate events indeed...,5,30 December 2004,"Not having read any of Lemony Snicket's books, I can't judge ""Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events"" against the originals. But I can judge how it works as a movie in its own right... and sadly, not terribly well.Director Brad Silberling and adaptor Robert Gordon clearly wanted a Tim Burton feel to this (first?) screen adaptation of the travails of the Baudelaire orphans - and indeed, several of the key production team worked on Burton movies - but since this is under the Nickelodeon Movies banner I have a feeling this is why it couldn't be as black and edgy as it could have been (it may be essentially a children's movie, but still). The movie never manages to be really funny or really dark, winding up neither fish nor fowl, and also being irritatingly repetitive in its structure (the kids go to stay with Count Olaf, escape from his clutches, get entwined with him again, escape again...). It doesn't seem like an actual story, more like - well - a series of unfortunate events. Even more unfortunate in that there's nothing like a flow to them, and it winds up seeming like several episodes of ""The Perils of Penelope Pitstop"" strung together.It also doesn't help that in spite of Jim Carrey's leading role, the movie is actually more interesting when he ISN'T on screen - his showboating performance sucks away the spotlight from the movie's rightful stars (Emily Browning, the twins who play Sunny, and the other one), and when he's off-screen they get a chance to breathe and the story has a chance to be a story. But then he comes back, dragging along cast members who leave you wondering what they're doing here (especially Cedric the Entertainer and an uncredited Dustin Hoffman).Browning, Timothy Spall and (surprisingly) Billy Connolly are quite good, the movie has good production design by Rich Heinrichs and a fine score by Thomas Newman in its favour, and a very funny opening sequence (and an even better animated end credits sequence), and it does have its moments... but in the end you might want to take narrator Jude ""Snicket"" Law's advice and go to see another movie that's more upbeat, or indeed more successful. Remember, just because something's grim doesn't mean it's good.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
68,vip_ebriega,One of Jim Carrey's better performances in years.,8,30 May 2007,"My Take: Jim Carrey at his outrageous self. An superb adaptation of the Snicket chronicles. I honestly say that I have always liked Jim Carrey's comedy movies, and he's also one of my favorite comedians (though I'm not much of a comedy fan). ""Liar Liar"" and ""Bruce Almighty"" were amongst my favorites of Carrey's wild antics. But when I viewed this film, I was surprised to see Jim Carrey in a whole new look. His performance here was of the villainous Count Olaf, and he was more than just making me laugh, but also a villainous character. He's really a villain here, but yet, you can't help but actually laugh at some of his antics. This is really he's best performance that I've seen. Surely, there would be more, but this is by far the best that I've seen (Though I haven't seen ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind""). Do I need to say that this movie was great? For I already see that many agree with me on that. A very colorful production, with excellent costume design, make-up and special effects, and yet, also a wonderful story, well pressed from Lemony Snicket's ""unfortunate"" account on the Baudelaire siblings. I wouldn't mind a franchise myself. There are still a few other books still left, so why not? Rating: **** out of 5.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
69,Stampsfightclub,Dark and relative story with an awkward Carrey,8,23 February 2009,"After the death of their parents Claus (Aiken) Viola (Browning) and Sunny (Hoffman) are put into the care of Count Olaf (Carrey) who wants the fortune of the deceased parents.Based on the popular children's books by Lemony Snicket, this 2004 picture had the potential to be an outright rival to the growing Potter phenomenon and considering Carrey's appearance, it was due to be a classic.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were originally attached to the project and though Burton's presence isn't missed thanks to some wonderful styling and dark imagery by Silberling, you are left to wonder what the Pirates star would have brought instead of Carrey's awkward presence.As big a fan as I am of Jim Carrey, he lets the film down with an unwelcome comedy slant that is misjudged and uncomfortable. The wacky and goofy protagonist so memorable in the Mask is present here and considering the story revolves around strong dramatic issues, you are left squirming against his motions.His portrayal of Count Olaf takes the shine off a story that is passionate and dramatic. Starring young protagonists Liam Aiken and Emily Browning as the brother and sister who are dealing with the death of their parents and you have the potential for a dramatic and dark story about intelligence and fighting the odds. Their genius inventions and memorizations work spot on to create that family magic and the sophistication of the performances shines through the dark outline of the scenery.The settings are very Burton. Dark, dismal and delightfully demoralizing this story reflects the concepts of hardship through its surroundings and the series of unfortunate events the children find themselves in.What works about this story is the sense of misery the children have. Whilst there is encoded humour along the way including some interesting performances by Meryl Streep and Billy Connelly, this reflects the unlucky circumstances and dreadful situations of natural lives in the child universe.Dark and reflective, this is a strong film with the issues in the right places with some passion and tension that is let down by Carrey's awkward inclusion.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
70,cultfilmfan,Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events,5,6 February 2005,"Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events, is based on a couple of the books in the A Series Of Unfortunate Events series by Daniel Handler. The film uses the books The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room and The Wide Window. The film is about three children. The oldest is named Violet Bauldelaire, and her brother Klaus and infant sister Sunny. Violet, likes to invent things while Klaus, likes to read and Sunny, likes to bite things. One day they come home to their home to find out that it has burned down and their parents have died. The man in charge of their will takes them to their closest living relative who is a bizarre actor named Count Olaf. The children are forced to do chores for Count Olaf, and soon find out that he does not like them at all and plans to kill them to get their parents fortune. The children escape and go to live with other eccentric relatives such as their Uncle Monty, who is fascinated with reptiles and their Aunt Josephine, who is scared of everything. While living with each relative Count Olaf, disguises himself as different people and tries to get custody of the children again so he can kill them and get the money. Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events, has good direction, good performances by both Emily Browning (Violet) and Liam Aiken (Klaus), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costume design and good makeup. The film is a nice looking film and well made but it just wasn't for me. Jim Carrey (who has done great jobs in such films as Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind) was annoying here as Count Olaf. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was that it took a long time to get into and for the most part it was very dull. The story doesn't always add up either and I always felt like something was missing. I realize that the film is based on a lot of books and all of them were not covered by the end of the film but it still felt empty. And most of the time the story seems to focus on Jim Carrey making faces and noises rather than the children who the movie tries to make the main center of attention but but it can't quite get away from Carrey. The film was made well but I can't quite recommend it.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
71,rainking_es,Amusing.,8,13 February 2006,"After Harry Potter's series' great success it was just a question of time till the big Hollywood studios look at other sagas of children's books searching for new gold mines. That's the case of Lemony Snickett's books: they tell the story of three orphans (Baudelaire Bros.) and their fighting' against their nemesis, Count Olaf, who will try to get the children's inheritance at all costs.The movie is great, so amusing. It's nothing to do with the cinema for children that Disney uses to make. The first thing that will attract your attention is the st design, it is kind of an hybrid of Oliver Twist and the Gothic touches of Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" or ""Corpse Bride"". It is a hell of a visual prodigy. As for the story itself, well, the story is so funny, so imaginative, full of humor (and with a little bit of cruelty).The three kids are the main characters, but we all know that the bad guy is always the most charismatic; so, that chamaleonic Count Olaf is the real discovery of Lemony Snickett's series. Of course Jim Carrey plays the Count, he uses some of his well known grimaces and his foolishness (but not too much!!).Everybody, the younger and the older ones will enjoy the film.*My rate: 8/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
72,TheNorthernMonkee,"clever in construct, but tedious to watch",5,25 September 2005,"SPOILERS First and foremost, an admission. This reviewer confesses to never reading the Lemony Snicket books. With that in mind, those that are not going to agree with my comments, my apologies now.Lemony Snicket is the brainchild of author Daniel Handler. Designed as an author who tells tall tales, the world of Snicket is a dark and mysterious place. With multiple books in the series, 2004's ""Lemony Snicket's: A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is the first of the lot. Hopefully, in this reviewers mind, it will also be the last. For whilst there is little point denying that whilst the film is technically beautiful to watch and never lacking in grandiose style, it is also a turgid affair which manages to frustrate just as much as it does captivate. It's a monotonous story which causes pain behind the eyes and truthfully, that's just the good parts.""Lemony Snicket's: A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is the story of the Bauedelaire orphans. Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken) and Sunny (Kara & Shelby Hoffman) are all taken in by a series of odd relatives, starting with the cunning and dastardly Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who hopes to snatch their inheritance from them. All possessing of particular skills, the children find themselves constantly forced to fight back against the evil Count, but every time they think he's gone, he reappears in another form.There's little point denying the skill of Jim Carrey in this film. Whilst always finer in more serious work, Carrey has a gift for rubber faced tom-foolery. Playing the actor Olaf, Carrey has the opportunity during the course of this film to play multiple different roles without ever loosing the essence of the devious Olaf. He hams up the role and he does so brilliantly.At the same time, both of the two elder children are also great in their respective roles. Browning has great potential for the future and the same is true of Aiken. You never expect children to have much skill before a certain age, but these two perform admirably in admittedly difficult roles.In the directors chair, Brad Silberling is up to the task of achieving a dark tone. Whilst there's little point denying that Tim Burton would be a God given choice for the chair, it is harsh on Silberling to not praise him for setting the tone just right and giving us the right feel for the dark and evil world.So technically, yes ""Lemony Snicket"" is a brilliant film. That is, until you look at the crucial fact of the story, and at that point, sadly the film falls flat on it's face. Put brutally, the story is dire. With some well constructed characters, you genuinely believe it has potential. It has all the standards in place to provide you with a solid, entertaining 108 minutes of fun. So it is even more infuriating that it fails so hideously. Killing characters off with ease, certain plot elements are tediously underdeveloped whilst others just fail to go away. Billy Connolly's Uncle Monty is not given enough time whilst the eventual conclusion is rushed and awkward. You want the film to focus on major events, but ultimately it doesn't. All in all, it just doesn't hold the attention and makes you want to stick sharp objects in your hand to wake yourself up. It's a mess of a film, and certainly not worth the time it takes to finish.Maybe the books are entertaining, personally it's an unknown, but the film, well that's a different matter. Well shot and acted, it is technically a sound production, but with a terrible script and a badly constructed plot, it is a turgid waste of time and money. A huge disappointment, and a massive shame.

74,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,A dark comedy that is still entertaining after 15 years,8,28 April 2020,"I remember this film when I was 10 years old and heard that Jim Carrey was gonna be the villain, so, before I later read some of the Lemony Snicket books, my siblings and I went to see this back at theaters and remember this one scene where the Incredibly Deadly Viper scared the daylights out of me. Whoa! Wasn't expecting that. Anyway, time to explain my thoughts on this film.This film is very very good. Ok, it's not a masterpiece, but before I go into some detail with my problems, there's a bunch of things that are done well.Thomas Newman (who did the score for Finding Nemo and the later film 1917 from 2019) does a really good job with his score which provides a haunting, comedic, and intense atmosphere which suits the moments really well. The cinematography and production design is gorgeous from the look of Count Olaf's house, the 19th century cars, and the costumes which look really good. Even the special effects still hold up really well after 15 years. The pacing's pretty decent and doesn't contain a rushed or dull moment. The script is also good too which balances comedy with some dark moments really well and don't feel sugar-coated. And last, but not least, the acting. Everyone did a really great job in this. Jim Carrey is entertaining as Count Olaf although there are times where he did feel a bit too silly, Jude Law does a really good Lemony Snicket who chronicles the adventures of the Baudelaire children, and everyone else including Catherine O'Hara, Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep do a good job too. And the child acting is good too. Liam Aiken and Emily Browning have some heartwarming moments which are done very well.OK, now for the problems. While the film does a decent job in following the source material, fans who read the books criticized it for cramming three books while leaving out certain details. The idea of having three books into one film is ambitious, but also pretty messy which is understandable given their reactions. Also, the movie left the door wide open for a sequel which apparently didn't get made mostly because of the mishandled marketing campaign and competition with other movies such as The Incredibles and The Polar Express at the time (which is also apparently why we got a Netflix series later). Also, many people didn't like the casting of Jim Carrey as Count Olaf since I've heard that the villain was sinister and creepy as was described in the book and not goofy. Again, very understandable even though I still love Jim Carrey to this day as he's done some good films aside from The Mask, Ace Ventura Pet Detective, etc.So, overall, A Series of Unfortunate Events may not be a perfect movie, but this is a dark comedy film that's still entertaining after 15 years. Check this film out if you're in for some dark comedic fun. It gets a 4 out of 5.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

76,rebeljenn,"Good special effects, an average film",5,16 January 2006,"'Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' is a children's film about three talented children who are left homeless after their parents are killed in a house fire. The children move from home to home to avoid Count Olaf, who seeks to be a little bit too close to them for comfort. The best thing about the film is the use of creative sets and special effects to tell the story of the fate of the children. There's also a dark sense of humour in this film and the sense that it does not take itself too seriously. Although the film is dark, Jim Carey (Count Olaf) plays an eccentric character who is often more annoying than he is frightening. (I suppose they had to do this so children could watch the film.) Overall, it is a pretty good evening film, but Jim Carey's character was annoying, and I found parts of the film to drag on endlessly.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
77,FloatingOpera7,A Good Looking And Dark Film For Young Ones,10,9 February 2005,"This movie is visually very good and the plot is quite engaging. Based on the British author's series (hes considered a rival to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books)it stars Jim Carrey as the villainous Count Olaf, Emily Browning as Violet Baudelaire and Liam Aiken as Klaus Baudelaire, the clever orphans. The movie is quite dark, and some material I have been told is not suited for children ages 4-7. Mature kids 8 and up and teens will definitely appreciate this film. It deals with the death of the Baudelaire kid's parents- they were killed by the evil Count Olaf- and now Olaf wants to get the children's money/inheritance by killing them in a series of accidents i.e. being hit by a train. The endless pursuit leads the kids from one home to another. Meryl Streep guest stars as a grammar queen Victorian lady who lives on a crooked house by a cliff near Lake Lachrymosa. The special effects are quite good. The film has a dark Gothic feel to it. Highly recommended but very different from the book. That cute claymation segment ""The Happiest Lil'Elf"" or whatever was hilarious. Jim Carey is quite the actor. In this role, he must transform himself into various guises while still portraying the evil Count Olaf. He looks the part and acts the part well. It is hard for some to accept him as a villain since he has never portrayed a bad guy in a film. Even this role is done with comic flair. Carey tries to expand his repertoire but he is and always will be a comic actor.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

But every scene has lots of luscious detail and you can really see the effort that went into this, the costumes are great as well and I really enjoyed the timeless feel of the film, with some of it seeming early Edwardian era and other parts 1960s. In my opinion the costumes and design is better than in the new TV show.Acting wise it was pretty solid, Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep and Billy Connolly all do well. The child actors are alright, with Emily Browning standing out as the best. And Dustin Hoffman makes a surprising but entertaining cameo near the end! Furthermore, the way the children stand out in every scene, with every other actor being an adult really reinforces the theme that they've only got each other.However, what I didn't like about this film was how quickly it went through the story, Uncle Monty's section is broken down to about 15 minutes, not nearly enough for such a fun character and actor! Even though it's a children's film I wouldn't have minded an extra 50 minutes added on to take it to 2 and a half hours, especially since it's meant to be an adaption of three fairly lengthy books. I also take issue with Count Olaf in this adaption, Jim Carrey plays him very well, all too well as it's just like his other characters and you can never really take Olaf seriously in this. But it is a joy to watch

79,tomimt,How.... unfortunate...,8,29 June 2006,"'A Series of unfortunate Events' begins from a situation every child must be afraid of: Klaus (Liam Aiken), Violet (Emily Browning) and baby Sunny are on beach when they receive the news; their parents are killed in a fire and they are placed in a loving, tender care of their ""uncle"" count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who is a villainous man in pursuit of the Baudelaire family fortune.I haven't read the books, nor had I heard of them before I heard of this movie, so I really can't comment on how good of an adaptation this film is, but for some one not familiar with the origins I can say, that I quite liked the film and its darkly humorous take on regular children's tales. The end result isn't a mockery towards the genre but a refreshing tale making fun out of the clichés often attached on the stories: the misfortune, the turmoil, the hardship yet in the end the most just and deserved victory over evil.The overall quality of visual effects, even though isn't the most realistic one, is quite appropriate to the mood of the movie. It is the style that matters in a tales like these, not the fact of how real they look. And in all truth: would the places like these shown in a movie like this really exist anywhere, just waiting to be used in a film? The acting in the film is justly silly and over boiling, just like the characters are. In cases like this, when people are aware, that they aren't making the most serious drama they can justify the overacting. Especially Carrey on a good swing in his role, just like is Meryl Streep in her small role, and very different role from her usual ones, as aunt Josephine.'A Series of unfortunate Events' is very tasty fantasy movie with a lot of elements to offer for children and adults alike. There is plenty to watch and notice in this sad, yet delightful made movie about children with grimmest of luck.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Yeah that happen the first time I have watch this movie and it instantly becomes one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. IMHO, ""brilliant"" would still be an understatement.There something about this movie that is very compelling and no matter how many times I watch it, it is still that good. It is all sorts of things that make this film so good, - from the undeniable brilliant narrating of Jude Law, brilliant set, lighting, make-up, wardrobe to the breathtaking work of art at the ending credit. Another thing that can't be denied is the score of the film. It is unbelievably good.Jim did an awesome job as portraying Count Olaf, Stephano, and Captain Sham. He really deserve as least Oscar nomination for it. The orphans where also awesome, you can actually sense the closeness between the characters, especially Violet and Sunny.And another plus point is that the movie is carrying the mood and the heart of the book really well making it almost resemblance, which is rarely seen in most adaptation. I think it is brilliant with a very good English and wordplay. I know for the people who read the book, it might not be as good as it but for me it is brilliantly written.Recommendation: Buy The DVD it Worth Every Penny, especially commentary of Brad and Mr. Lemony, so funny.Rating: 9.5/10 (Grade: A+)",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The child actors are brilliant. even if the violet character is a bit annoying by being a little bit too brainy for her own good at times. The baby is hilarious, but the subtitles for the baby could have been MUCH bigger. They were VERY very difficult to read. Billy Connelly should have had a much bigger part, his comic and acting talents were totally wasted. Tim Spall was excellent and held the film together very well on his own without much help from that IDIOT Jim Carey. I just wanted to PUNCH him in the face very hard every time he was on screen. The guy just tried far too hard to be funny. Jude Law interrupts the film as the voice of Lemony Snicket far too often, also someone else this film can do without.

To get all their money, Count Olaf plots to kill the children, but instead, the children are taken away from him and are given to a series of odd guardians. Count Olaf worms his way into the lives of these guardians and soon they end up dead. This is a dark depressing movie that I did not like.

Any idea or concept that made the books good was voted out of the film by the committee meeting clones who oversee movie production. All we are left with is swooping camera work to fool us into thinking action is happening, lots of elaborate art design to make us think that money equals quality and crude humor to make us think that the film is ""cutting edge"".Feh.Jim Carrey, to his credit, takes his character to an extreme but is not countered by the child actors who are very bland. In their defense, they are not given much to do or are directed very well. The baby is actually the best of the trio but I tired of the stupid crude subtitles after the third one. Meryl Streep walks through her part. Cedric the Entertainer could have been replaced by the studio janitor for all he given to do. Why is Dustin Hoffman here? The ""exciting"" finale is so misdone, it's probably the most boring part of the film.The most applause should be reserved for the uncredited animation team who created the great end credits. This sequence evokes the books better then anything in the film.

86,MichaelMargetis,"""I'm sorry, I don't speak monkey"" - Count Olaf",6,29 June 2005,"'Lemony Snickets' A Series of Unfortunate Events' is one dark children's movie. The children's novel on which the film is based upon deals with very serious adult situations such as death and the truth that nothing in life is ever fair. For a children's story this deals with very harsh and abrupt issues, but maybe that is what makes the book/film so superior to it's genre. While pretty much all of the other Disney or Pixar productions deal with talking toys, friendly fish in the ocean, monsters that scare kids but redeem themselves in the end, or the lesson that if you do good, good things will happen for you, this film sends a very opposite message. That's not what 'Lemony Snickets' A Series of Unfortunate Events' is about in any way, shape or form. For a kid's feature, it sends a very true message - life isn' t fair, the good guy doesn't always win, and there is nothing you can do to change it. It sounds a little harsh or mean-spirited, but that's the way it is. This Tim Burton-ish pessimistic tale is very original and features scenes of hilarity, but at the end it doesn't fully satisfy.The film surrounds the Baudelaire children; Violet (Emily Browning - Ghost Ship), the eldest, who's an inventor; Klaus (Liam Aiken - Road to Perdition), the middle child, who's a genius when it comes to books; and Sunny (Kara & Shelby Hoffman), the infant who is obsessed with biting things. One gloomy afternoon, the Baudelaire children are informed by Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall - Still Crazy), that their parents died in a horribly inconvenient arson. The children then get taken to live with a distant three-times removed relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey - Bruce Almighty). Olaf is an actor and an evil man who just wants the children to get his hands on the enormous fortune their parents left behind. Olaf turns the children into slaves, but the kids have plans of their own to escape from Count Olaf. During the course of their journey, the kids encounter other relatives besides Olaf including their snake-obsessed Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly - The Boondocks Saints) and their easily frightened grammar-obsessed Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep - The Hours).The movie has a certain creepy coolness to it, and that's why I really enjoyed most of the film. Some of it drags a little, and sometimes the film' s weirdness seems absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary. The performances are great especially from the two children, Liam Aiken and Emily Browning (I see a strong future in film acting for her). Jim Carrey steals the show as Count Olaf, and two other wacky and inventive characters. Carrey is hysterical most of the time, but in some scenes he seems more downright mean and uncomically scary the way he acts towards the children. I don't know if that was what Carrey and the filmmaker were aiming for, or what, but I found it out-of-character for Carrey's usual characters. Meryl Streep is perfectly cast in an extravagant role, and Billy Connolly plays up his role as Uncle Monty. The film doesn't run short on cameos including Jane Lynch (Best in Show) as a Realtor, Jennifer Coolidge (Best in Show) as one of Olaf's buddies, Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights) and Jane Adams (Happiness) as Olaf's other buddies, Cedric the Entertainer (The Honeymooners) as a police detective and most surprisingly, 2-time Academy Award Winner Dustin Hoffman (Meet the Fockers) as a play critic at one of Olaf's ridiculous productions. Brad Silberling does an okay job directing (a lot of his work closely resembles that of Tim Burton's), but the unnecessary commentary by Lemony Snickett (voiced by Jude Law in the film) during the course of the events of the film really annoyed me. I think they could have left the commentary by Snickett at the beginning and the end of the story, but hey, I didn't write the screenplay. The movie's makeup, set design, costume design and musical score by Thomas Newman are outstanding to say the least, and the cinematography is pretty neat also.When all is said and done, 'Lemony Snickett's A Series of Unfortunate Events' proves to be a pretty entertaining and enjoyable movie. It's nothing great, groundbreaking or something worthy of a standing ovation, but the film's good aspects out shined the bad aspects, and the sheer originality of the film ended up winning me over. If you enjoy these kinds of zany features, don't hesitate to pick up 'Lemony Snickett's A Series of Unfortunate Events' your next trip to the video store.

89,DavidSim240183,Episodic but entertaining,8,20 May 2006,"When I first saw Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events at Christmas, I'd never read any of the books. For that matter, I'd never even heard of them. After writing this review, I've now read four. Three of them is where the film derives it's plot, which makes it, although admittedly episodic, a refreshingly dark children's tale. The likes of which we haven't seen since Roald Dahl.The Lemony Snicket books follows the trials and tribulations of the Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus and Sunny. They belonged to a wealthy family, until their parents were killed in a mysterious fire. Mr Poe, (Timothy Spall) the banker in charge of their estate sends them to live with their closest relative, (in this case physically close) Count Olaf (Jim Carrey).Count Olaf has no love for the children, but one thing he is interested in is their sizable fortune. Something that they won't inherit until Violet, the eldest, comes of age. Count Olaf makes numerous attempts to murder the children with increasingly dastardly schemes, disguises and help from his acting troupe of misfits and oddballs. Every time he fails, the children end up with another relative, only for him to bump them off.The Lemony Snicket books are admittedly rather repetitive. Once you've read a couple, you can figure out the chain of events for the following books. What keeps them interesting is that Count Olaf's scheme is different each time. But it's so frustrating when he escapes time and again.This is a pattern that ends up in the film too. It's just something you have to get used to. But the film more than makes up for that in it's set design and performances. The Baudelaire children are all entertaining. They manage to be capable, astute and likable without ever becoming obnoxious. Violet is a great thinker and very modest about her achievements. Klaus is a voracious reader, something we have in common, and Sunny is only a toddler but she has unbelievable comic timing. The subtitles that translate her gurgles work better on film too than they do in the books.But Jim Carrey is probably the wrong choice for Count Olaf. Carrey's whirlwind energy is completely different from the character in the books. Count Olaf is a sinister devil with a silky attitude that leaves you in no doubt he has something horrid bubbling away in his twisted mind. But Carrey plays it strictly for laughs, which is a bit jarring to say the least.Because Count Olaf tries on many disguises, it gives Jim Carrey a chance to flex his muscles and show his range. But apart from his performance as Captain Sham, I didn't care much for any of his other interpretations of the characters. The make-up is excellent on all his disguises, but overall, Carrey underwhelmed me as Count Olaf, and never really brings him to life the way the character deserves.The set design is a real eye-opener though. Gloomy countrysides, Gothic mansions, and surreal settings really enhance the viewing experience. There's more than a hint of Tim Burton's influence at work here, and I really enjoyed Count Olaf's mansion with eyes carved everywhere, a subtle touch to emphasise Olaf is always watching the children. Make sure you stay all the way through the end credits as well. It's wonderfully animated with lots of neat little touches.As for the parts of the relatives, these get filled by Billy Connelly and Meryl Streep. But they get such short time it's no more than a walk on. I wasn't so bothered by Connelly since I'm not a fan of him anyway, but I was disappointed by Meryl Streep's considerable absence. She's an incredibly talented actress, and she's not used to her full potential, sadly.It all ends with a marriage between Count Olaf and Violet under the masquerade of a play. Naturally it fails, but it is satisfying, and I love the part when Violet tells Count Olaf he's a terrible actor. Are you listening Jim?! Lemony Snicket is entertaining, if repetitive and episodic, but it provides solid viewing for the most part. If they ever make any sequels, I hope they alter the plots a bit, and perhaps recasting Count Olaf might help. But the kids are fine, and I predict bright futures for these three. Unlike their fictional counterparts.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
90,Flagrant-Baronessa,Lemony Snicket's: A Series of stupid scenes,5,15 July 2006,"Having never read the books on the 'unfortunate' Baudelaire children by Handler, I figured it would be easier for me to enjoy this adaptation. This way, I would not bother to make comparisons or have my own preconceived images of the characters and events shattered. So, I basically knew nothing about what A Series of Unfortunate Events was about - and I still found it extremely disappointing. After all, the premise sounded so promising.The film has some serious Burtonesque undertones and features the same kind of quirky Gothic elements. Maybe it would have been a better movie had Tim Burton got to direct it, and cast Johnny Depp as Count Olaf instead of Jim Carrey. I have no deep love for the former or deep dislike for the latter, but alternative casting choices could maybe have improved things. Who knows? Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is by no means a terrible movie, nor does it fail on all levels. In fact, I found some things very funny and Emily Browning (with lips that could put Angelina's to shame, and a pout that is more conspicuous than Keira Knightley's) was strangely captivating to look at.Throughout the film, I could not help but notice the borderline distracting lyrical flow of the narration, which tells me that this was probably a very good book.

The movie has added this phrase because after seeing the wonderful display of evil by Count Olaf (Jim Carrey).After purchasing the rights to the movie, due to the financial concerns the movie suffered many setbacks but Paramount got Dreamworks on board on the project to help financing and signed Brad Silberling to direct the movie.The visual effects of the movie had some scenery designed using forced perspective techniques, combined with matte paintings.

94,supertom-3,Good Fantasy Film! But could have been much darker.,7,4 January 2005,"As a fan of fantasy I was looking forward to this film. The the whole design of the film looked promising and the film delivers a great blend of good old fashioned set work, and matte painting, with up to date CGI. The film looks great, has a decent story and a good cast, and works well a piece of enjoyable entertainment. However it loses out on being a classic fantasy film like the Rings trilogy, Terry Gilliam's, Jim Henson, and Tim Burtons work. Even though it is a kids film and has a fairly dark subject matter, it isn't really that dark a film, not quite quirky enough, and without the depth of the best fantasy films. The film could have been much darker, and the villainous Count Olaf, although well played by Carrey, was played for laughs too much, it was what you could call a blockbuster friendly performance, without giving the role an edge.The plot centres on the Baudelaire children, Violet, Klause and their baby sister Sunny. When they are told that their parents were killed in a fire at their mansion, they have to go and stay with their closest living relative, Count Olaf, a cruel, egotistical actor, who despite totally sucking at his chosen profession, thinks he is gods gift. Olaf doesn't really want to look after children, but what he does want is the Baudelaire fortune. When he gets custody he then takes it upon himself to try and kill the children. That is about as dark as it gets. Despite the theme of attempted murder towards young children, the film isn't as dark as it could be. It's a little too safe. This comes particularly evident at the films climax which ends kind of limply, particularly after an exciting sequence at cliff top home in the middle of a hurricane. Basically the film is about the children escaping Olaf's clutches with the help of various obscure friends of the family, Aunt Josephine and Uncle Monty, members of a secret troupe that the Baudelaires' parents were in. As the film progresses the kids must find out why the fire happened and the link between the deaths of their parents and the deaths of Josephine and Monty's families in similar circumstances. Granted by the end it is all too obvious but that is perhaps due to the books, although how accurate the translation from book to screen is, I don't know. This film does suffer from being a combination of 3 books from the Snicket's series, the obviously isn't enough in each book to put a story into one film because not enough action would happen, or not enough unfortunate events shall we say but much of the depth the books might have had do feel glossed over. In the end the twisting plot involving cover ups and conspiracies is underdeveloped while there isn't enough action, or dramatic enough action.Despite some fairly negative parts to this Burton-lite film, it does have many positives. Visually it looks great and doesn't rely too heavily on CGI. It also has more soul to it and flair than the first too Harry Potters, without as engaging a story though. The film also has a very good score from Thomas ""American Beauty"" Newman which is unique for this type of film. The cast are also good and what gives this bonus marks above the first two Potters are the young cast. Emily Browning is excellent as Violet, the eldest of the children, an inventor. Browning was only 15 at the time of making this and shows a remarkably mature and accomplished performance. Liam Aiken is also very good as Klaus, who reads a lot of books and has garnered a vast knowledge on many subjects, and finally the baby Sunny is hilarious and gives a surprisingly good performance albeit with subtitles and some computer help but she always seems to have just the right facial expression, how much was the baby and how much was computer I don't know but in any case Kudos. The adult cast has some gravitas with one of the greatest actresses, Meryl Streep and a funny cameo from Dustin Hoffman. Also some solid Brit support from Timothy Spall and Billy Connelly. Jim Carrey is good here too. For anyone who doesn't take to the story at all, Jim can always be relied upon to give entertainment value. A problem though that keeps the film being as dramatic as it could is Carrey though. The character wasn't nasty enough. Carrey had some menacing moments and was as nasty as he has ever been but for every quite, moment of evil menace he would do a crowd pleasing gyration of the body, or pull a face, make a stupid noise, a dinosaur impression, and as funny as those moments were they undermine the darker more dramatic side of his character. The film suffers from pulling its punches in moments and perhaps not adding to the content of the books to make this more movie friendly. Brad Silberling does a good job, showing flair but you have to wonder what a Burton or a Gilliam would have done with this material, to make it more exciting, to add depth.Overall this is enjoyable fare and in a high pap ratio genre this is considerably better than most fantasy films, for example Legend, Masters Of The Universe and Krull but in the end it doesn't have the depth and classiness of Never-ending Story or Labyrinth. It's a shame when a film has so much going for it that a few tweaks could have made it a step up, but all in all this is still a good watch. ***",A Series of Unfortunate Events
95,christian123,An entertaining movie and should satisfy most people,6,28 December 2004,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is an interesting movie and seems that it is a film that should have been directed by Tim Burton. When the three Baudelaire children are orphaned and sent to live with various relatives, the evil Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) repeatedly tries to kill them to get his hands on the family fortune. Fortunately, they're too smart and creative to fall for his elaborate disguises and tricks. The plot sounds rather weird but it wasn't half bad. I never read the books but the story is very interesting which is why I saw the movie. The acting from the kids was alright but not quite as good as the actors from the Harry Potter series. Jim Carrey goes overboard with his character and sometimes he is funny but other times he is very annoying. Meryl Streep is good as the super state's aunt and I wish her role could have lasted longer. Billy Connolly did his role well but he isn't in the movie for very long. The film is directed by Brad Silberling who does a good job but I think Tim Burton would have made a better director since he made Big Fish and that was a pretty good movie. Jude Law narrates the movie and does a good job of course this is like his 6th film that's been released this fall. The visuals were stunning and I think this movie should get an Oscar nomination for best costume design and for best visual effects. The movie may scare little kids but if they lasted through Harry Potter 3 then they will most likely not be scared by this film. Fortunately the movie did not live up to its title and turned out to be an enjoying ride. Rating 7/10 not the best holiday movie but entertaining none the less.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It isn't a film that's hated by a lot of people, although some fans of the book don't care for it, I actually saw a comment saying Klaus was supposed to have glasses...who cares? Hey, Hermione was supposed to have extremely long buck teeth until the middle of the fourth Harry Potter book, you don't hear us fans of the Harry Potter books complaining. Wow I got off on a tangent, well anyway, this film is just not remembered by most people. It did OK at the box office, it made it's money back, but it didn't make what the Harry Potter series was making, as in around $900,000,000.OK, first I do love the book series, I only own three of them, but I have read all of them (by the way, Snicket is writing another series set in the same universe, thank you). This film is actually based on the first three books in the series, and let me just say, this is one of the best book to film adaptations I've seen. I'm serious, this film follows the books very well. Are there differences? Of course. But that's a film adaptation, some books just can't be literally put from book to screen, for one they would be too damn long, and two some things don't work in books, especially dialog. True some movies do leave out a little too much, the main reason Order of the Phonix is my least favorite Potter movie, but this film brings in all the important plot elements from the books.The acting is great, Emily Browning and Liam Aikan need more work, sure Browning was in a few things including Sucker Punch (which I never saw), but these two were Violet and Klaus. The twins who played Sunny did good, and Jim Carrey as Count Olaf, well, in my opinion one of his best roles. He is so over the top funny, yet is also sinister and conniving, I can't imagine anyone else in this role. And the rest of the cast is good too.The production design and special effects are fantastic. I never realized that some of the backgrounds were painted in, and despite being eight years old, the special effects work still looks good. The film just looks cool, very Gothic.Are there some things I don't like, sure, Timothy Spall as Mr. Poe could be a little wooden at times. Like when he tells the orphans that their parents died and their house was gone. There are a few parts of the book that were done better than in the film. And maybe it is a little too comedic, the tone of the film constantly switches between comedic and dark, most of the time it works but sometimes it doesn't. And that Incredibly Deadly Viper is definitely starting to show CGI.Overall, I love this movie. Is it perfect? No. But it is one of my favorite book to film adaptations to date. The film may not be for everyone, but I think that even if you haven't read the books, you should still get a few laughs out of it.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
97,LCShackley,"Yummm...lemony...and snickety, too!",7,23 December 2004,"First of all, let me go on record saying that I think this is a wonderfully entertaining film. The sets and costumes are perfect; even the little details like the odd instruments on the car dashboard were carefully thought through for their effect. Jim Carrey is perfect as Count Olaf and his disguises, partially because he has always been adept at creating convincing odd characters with his flexible face and voice. The kids were likable, even the cute baby. Thomas Newman's score is a quirky mix that's just right for the film. (I want to ask him if there's a reason why one of his themes sounds like ""We Three Kings"" gone awry.) I'm writing this comment primarily to respond to the wacky criticisms of LEMONY that I've been reading here on IMDb. Most fall into two categories: 1) people who don't ""get"" the movie and haven't read the books (and therefore are offended by its dark tone), or 2) adolescents who are obsessed with the books and are disappointed that their little dreams of how the movie should be haven't been perfectly realized (e.g., ""the boy doesn't have glasses, so this movie stinks"").Let me address the second group. WAKE UP!! The Lemony Snicket books are a pre-packaged, heavily-marketed series that was deliberately created to appeal to your age group...the Harry Potterites. Unlike the history of J. Rowling and the Potter books, the Snicket books were the result of some money-mad marketing guru coming up with the idea and finding a writer to execute it.The Snicket series is not ""classic children's literature,"" although I must say that the actual author has done a fun job with the idea (yes, I have read several of the books, in case you're wondering). One Snicket book does NOT equal one Potter book in length or quality; therefore it's perfectly suitable that they put three Snickets together for this movie. The little gimmicks that made the early books amusing (the author's asides to define words, the translations of the baby's gurgles) become tediously annoying tics in the later books. And if you're going to have a tantrum because someone's hair isn't the color you imagined, or an actor is taller than you thought he should be, WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD of movie adaptations! Perhaps if someone took liberties with Jane Austen, Dickens, or Tolstoy, it would be worth getting upset...but this is LEMONY SNICKET, for crying out loud! Read some real books for a change; not just cynically contrived kiddie lit designed to make big bucks with marketing deals and product tie-ins.And to the first group I say...lighten up and read a couple of the Snicket books before you lament about the ""dark tone,"" or the abuse of children, etc., etc. It's part of the joke, and one of the aspects of the books that the producers did a good job conveying on screen. In fact, the movie even softened the tone a bit with the touching flashbacks about the missing parents, building a ""sanctuary,"" etc.And what's with the wonderful, yet thrown-away closing credits? Seems to me these were made for the opening, but they realized that they would conflict with the ""faux"" Elf movie that starts the film. As someone else said, this is one of the most delightful parts of the film, but my son and I were the only ones who stayed to watch!

98,kgprophet,Non-Book Reader = Fun Film,6,1 January 2005,"There seems to be the inevitable curse of the ""never as good as the book"" complaint. Since I have not read the books (I am 40, no kids), I judged based on no pre-conceptions. From the first moment Jim Carrey appears on screen, I had a silly grin on my face. I avoided most other recent Carrey vehicles (""Grinch"",""Majestic""), and was lured by the fantastic production design. I was not disappointed. The one complaint was that the lavish production sets whisk by in a blink of an eye. I trust the able hand of Micharl Kahn's editing, but wish I could absorb the library, sea town, or so on. My guess is that the anticipated sequels will return us for extra glimpses.Carrey seems to thoroughly enjoy his exaggerations as much as I did. For an adult, he was very engaging in his silly transformations. But one thing that I was totally mesmerised by was the stunningly beautiful Emily Browning as Violet. This is good, because Carrey should not have upstaged the main characters. Meryl Streep also joins in the silliness as the paranoid but caring Aunt. This movie does not entirely play for laughs, with the baby's goo goo subtitles providing the only real guffaws. Thankfully, this is discontinued about half-way through the film before it gets old.The only real downside of the story is the movie's arc. The three stories are: the snake man, the Aunt who lives by the sea, and the marriage play as the final act. However, the film cannot top the exciting second act. The ""will she be married or won't she"" is a bit of a let down. This is a minor complaint since the tremendous pace keeps you riveted.So, I as an adult was fairly amused and so were my relative's kids.I give it a 6 out of 10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
99,AndyVanScoyoc,What on Earth were these people thinking? *Spoilers*,5,23 June 2005,"I was so excited about seeing this movie and never could get my husband to agree to go as he said that it looked like a) a knock off of ""Edward Scissorhands"" and b) like myself, he just can't stand Jim Carrey.However, being a Gothic author myself, the clothing and houses, not to mention the dark scenery in the movie is every Victorian's Goth's dream who has a penchant for that elegant, bygone era. I wished to see what darkness and depth the movie would take me to.I came home to a surprise last night...my husband had purchased the movie for me. Excitedly (well, I was) we sat down and watched it. Within a half hour, my husband was reading the paper and finally declared, ""this movie is dumb."" He proceeded to leave the room.I agreed that the movie was ""dumb"" but decided to finish watching it. After doing so, all I can say is ""what a catastrophic waste of time."" The positives in this movie are as follows...and are the only reason I continued to watch this movie, even though I would have preferred doses of Castor oil I believe.1. The scenery was dark and macabre...eerie in a way that defies description except to say that the idea of the Gothic culture, architecture and class of a bygone era of stark beauty and surrealism, is the high point of the entire movie.2. The clothing choices are once again, especially where Violet is concerned, indicative of an elegance that is not found in most movies and certainly not where children are concerned.3. The houses are of exceptional beauty and go back once again to the Gothic style of dark and dreary...they were the envy of the movie.4. Sunny was mildly amusing.Now, for the down points of this movie: 1. The character of Count Olaf (or how he was portrayed...not sure which it is) was ridiculous beyond contemplation. He was not funny, he was idiotic. The only truly funny thing that I found in the entire movie was in the outtakes and involved a joke between Cedric The Entertainer and Dustin Hoffman. The joke could be considered, by those who are easily offended, in poor taste, which was probably why it didn't make it into the final cut.2. The ""unfortunate events"" which were just that, were ridiculous as well. There were seemingly no breaks, it was one event after another after another. Maybe this was intentional, but it made for ludicrous filming. If they tried to jam pack the series into one movie, then they succeeded but at what cost? As an author, I can't imagine this being allowed to be done to my books. A series or even a few movies (look at how many ""Friday the 13th"" movies have been made!) would have more than likely made for much better filming.I gave this movie a 5 and that is only because the Gothic surrealism, the dark and stark allure of the macabre, the eerie (almost as if filmed in the world of the legendary Edward Gory) made this movie, visually, one of stunning and spectacular art.Other than the elegant clothes, the stark sets and the dark artistry...this movie is better avoided.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
100,cosmic_quest,Not As Good As It Could Have Been,5,17 December 2004,"I think this is one series that suffers in the transfer from books to film. The books/film basically centres on the three wealthy Baudalaire children: fourteen-year-old inventor Violet, twelve-year-old bookworm Klaus and two-year-old Sunny. After they are orphaned, they are dumped in the care of their their vile uncle, Count Olaf, who is more intent on their fortune than the children.I enjoyed the first three books- they were darkly humorous and refreshing in that the three children had to rely on their brains rather than powers to escape whatever fate Count Olaf had in store for them. However, in the film, since it revolves around the three books condensed, the repetitive theme-- Olaf's plan to kill the kids and various adults refusing to believe this forcing the children to deal with Olaf themselves-- gets rather tedious.Also, while the three children give good performances, even the toddler who plays Sunny, Jim Carrey who plays Olaf is too camp and humorous for such a sinister, menacing role. This is where you truly feel the film, like the first two Harry Potter films, are too focused on pandering to small children in the audience that it's afraid to bring in the darker side of the books. As for Meryl Streep, Billy Connolly and Dustin Hoffman, all were woefully underused that you barely felt their presence.Younger Lemony Snicket fans will probably enjoy this story but those in their teens or adults may find it too childish in comparison to many elements in the books. I also think typical cinema-goers, those who are not fans of the books, won't be drawn into the film because of the more childish nature.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
101,I_Am_The_Taylrus,One Of The Better Films Based On A Book(SPOILERS),7,26 January 2007,"SPOILERSLet me be honest here, a whole ton of movies that are based on best-selling books are not very good. In fact, most of them, well, suck. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It had some great acting by the one and only Jim Carrey, it has a surprisingly good score, it was also pretty cool that they had the end of the first book for the climax of this film that has the first three books in it. Wow, that was confusing.Here is the plot. It is pretty much the plot of the first three Series of Unfortuante Events books. A brother and two sisters lose their parents in a mysterious fire. They have to live with their abusive relative named Count Olaf. He makes them work all day while he practices a play and he also tries to kill them. After the murderous train mishap the orphans have to live with their uncle Monty. He is a very nice man. He also love snakes. Then a man that looks awfully like Olaf comes. Then Monty dies. The orphans then live with their Aunt Josephine. Then a man named Captain Sham comes. He looks like Olaf. Then, Joesephine goes missing. The orphans find her in a cave. She is eaten by leeches. Gruesome, isn't it? Then, Count Olaf has his play. By they way, the orphans' names are Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. Anway, in the play Violet and Olaf have a wedding. Little do the audience know that the wedding is real for Olaf wants their parents' fortune. Then Klaus burns the certificate for marriage and Olaf is arrested but escapes.Overall, this is a pretty good film based on the novel. It sticks very close to the novel at some points but at other points it is very far away. This movie also contains the dry humor and the dark humor that you can definitely find in the books. The casting for this movie was very good. The baby that played Sunny definitely stole the show. Anyway, this is an enjoyable family film that a family that are a fan of the books can, well, enjoy watching.7/10Recommended Films: Harry Potter.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
102,jpintar,over-hyped mess,3,30 April 2005,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is an unfortunate mess. Jim Carey's character is simply obnoxious, not evil. I simply didn't find Carey's character neither funny nor interesting. I can't believe so much money was spent on a movie where basically nothing all that interesting happens at all for that matter. The three actors playing the kids are very good in this film and the production design is great. However, the plot is basically a bunch of set pieces with different strange characters while the children try to get rid of Carey's Count Olaf. The audience will want to get rid of Count Olaf too. Not having read the books the movie is based on, maybe was lost in translation. Either that or this series of unfortunate events is just not my cup of tea. This movie was incredibly over-hyped when it was first released and now after seeing the movie, my first instincts were correct.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
103,Quebec_Dragon,Unfortunate yet beautiful adaptation of the books,7,24 June 2009,"In case you didn't already know, this is based on the first 3 books of the 13 books ""A series of unfortunate events"" series. Think of them as a crossbreed between Charles Dickens and Tim Burton aimed at children. The film has a peculiarly dark yet endearingly clever tone coming out mostly through the narrator (Lemony Snickett) talking to the audience (like he addressed the reader directly in the books) which was one of the parts I enjoyed the most. Visually, it looks amazing. The set design (Victorian mixed with modern), the stylish costumes, the evocative lighting are truly outstanding and even won prestigious awards. It's also beautifully framed by the director. Jim Carrey as Count Olaff hams it up but it works perfectly with his evil ""bad actor"" role. The Baudelaire children look quite good and are very smart except they're way too obedient for real children (but that works with the book characterizations and Victorian-like settings).The story is well told, engrossing even, but it seems to lose some steam near the end as it seems they patched an ending (that wasn't in the books) in case there were no sequels. I have read that unfortunately, the first cut that was darker was modified because of test screenings. I do wonder if that's why even though I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to children young and old alike, there seems to be a little something amiss that would have pushed it into the realm of greatness as if it had been watered down for the mass market. I do think however that if you're a parent, the movie would incite your kid to read the series and if you're already a fan of the books, you're likely to appreciate it but mourn the lost scenes and creative liberties taken. Tim Burton's fans (of which I am one) are likely to love it but wonder how much better it could have been directed by the master and not censored by executives. A warning for parents though that even though I think the dark tone is not inappropriate or exaggerated, there are several glimpses of scary animals and insects.Rating: 7 out of 10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
104,D_Burke,"Unfortunately, This Film Is A Big Letdown",5,21 December 2011,"It's incredibly disappointing how much ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" gets right, only to have so much more go wrong. It's a great looking movie, but trying to cram 3 novellas together into one film is the first mistake the filmmakers made in adapting the popular young adult book series.As of the date I'm writing this review, I have read the first four books in the series. I made a point to do so before seeing the movie. Having liked the books, I guess that may have been what set me up for disappointment with this movie. However, I don't believe so.My first problem with the movie was the acting. The great actors tried to be over the top when they shouldn't have been, especially Jim Carrey. As talented an actor and comedian as Carrey is, and he's one of the best, he seemed unusually self-conscious in this movie. As Count Olaf, the Scrooge-meets-Peter-Sellers-like guardian of newly-orphaned Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken), and baby Sunny (twins Kara & Shelby Hoffman), he plays menacing like he's doing a sketch on ""In Living Color"".You're supposed to hate Count Olaf, which would make him an effective villain. Instead, Carrey remains unsure whether to be evil, or play a character who is spoofing playing evil. I won't go as far as to say Carrey was miscast. However, given his talent in comedy and drama, he could have acted better.The real stars of the film should be the children playing the Baudelaire orphans, although Carrey's being cast in the film also cast a shadow over that fact. Still, I liked Browning as Violet, and the Hoffman twins (no relation to Dustin Hoffman, who does in fact make a cameo in this movie) were cute as Sunny. There were also some surprisingly funny moments they had speaking gibberish baby talk.However, Liam Aiken, the actor who plays Klaus Baudelaire, was terrible in this movie! Truly terrible! The screenwriters not only made the mistake of giving him more lines than Browning, but Aiken also failed to deliver any line he spoke with the slightest conviction at all. Especially when his character was supposed to be angry or distressed, his diction always sounded completely forced.Disappointingly, in the book series, Klaus is a very interesting character. He's a bibliophile, and his love for reading plays crucial roles in the novellas. In this movie, it's said in the beginning that he likes to read, and it's never brought up again. The book series detailed many interesting plot points revolving around his reading habit. Here in the film, they have none.Liam Aiken was the most miscast member of this ensemble. I also didn't buy Timothy Spall as Mr. Poe, the lawyer who unknowingly sets the Baudelaire siblings up for inevitable catastrophic circumstances again and again. Spall is also a good actor, but he doesn't play clueless well enough. Reading the books, I always pictured an older gentleman like Abe Vigoda as Mr. Poe, someone whose heart is in the right place but is not there mentally. At least senility is a good excuse for these children being placed in questionable living conditions.There were things I liked about this movie. For instance, the set design and special effects were gloomy enough to be interesting, but not too depressing. Jude Law was exactly who I thought would be Lemony Snicket when I read the books, and he definitely has the wry, Dickensonian wit in his voice that the narrator possesses in the books. Billy Connolly was a good casting choice as Uncle Monty, although his appearance was too brief. Meryl Streep, while sometimes guilty of being too over the top in this movie, otherwise had some very humorous scenes as timid, panophobic Aunt Josephine. Her scene where she's fearful of real estate agents was pretty funny.This movie was a relatively big hit worldwide. However, the movie was not strong enough to merit a franchise, despite having some great actors support it. The three children being all grown up (with the Hoffman twins now being close to 10 years of age) nullifies the chances of a sequel. However, in a couple of years, they should start the series over with some better child actors. The books deserve better, and I believe Mr. Snicket would not disagree.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
105,anhedonia,Film gets too Carreyd away,5,20 December 2004,"Ever watch a film and think to yourself it's being directed by the wrong person? That's what happened while I was watching ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.""Brad Silberling's too unimaginative and conventional a filmmaker. He's the chap who made the innocuous ""Casper"" (1995), followed by the terribly syrupy ""City of Angels"" (1998) - an awful Americanization of Wim Wenders' ""Wings of Desire"" - and completed the trifecta of mediocrity with the shamelessly maudlin ""Moonlight Mile"" (2002). Not exactly the stuff needed to bring author Daniel Handler's twisted sense of humor to life on the big screen.This film needed a visionary filmmaker daring to be gleefully perverse, if need be. Say, Terry Gilliam, Tim Burton or Barry Sonnenfeld, who was initially slated to direct this movie before dropping out and now is listed as an executive producer.It also needed someone other than Jim Carrey as Count Olaf. Not that Carrey isn't a talented performer. But a menacing character as loud and flashy as Olaf requires an actor to underplay the role, not overact, which is Carrey's chief forte. Carrey's an actor who needs a director who can rein him in, say, someone like Michel Gondry, who was able to get the actor to find the essence of Joel Barrish in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" without going overboard.This time, Carrey revels in hamming it up. Except his shtick isn't all that entertaining or funny. And once the disguises start popping up, it gets downright tedious. For one thing, the masquerade never hoodwinks the children and you get the impression the filmmaker might be trying a bit too hard. The film truly does stumble when Carrey appears. There's no sense of fun in watching him as Olaf. I wonder how Alan Rickman, David Thewlis or Gary Oldman would have done as Olaf.The two standouts of the film are young Emily Browning, utterly delightful as Violet Baudelaire, and Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine, who gives new meaning to the word neurotic. Streep hams it, too, but watch how she plays her funny lines - in the cave and on the boat, how understated and natural they feel, and you realize you're watching someone who makes it look all so easy. Her comedic timing is absolutely impeccable.The rest of the cast is adequate. Jude Law knows how to turn a phrase and give it the edge it needs. But the others actors are merely glorified cameos.This really isn't a film for kids. Not because there's anything scary or offensive about it. But much of the humor is way beyond the average kid's comprehension. Take, for instance, Olaf's riff about the advantages of having a peg leg. You really have to pay attention to the dialogue to appreciate Handler's humor.Hollywood clearly intends to franchise the Lemony Snicket series. I only hope the next film is more in tune with Handler's wicked humor and also has a director willing and eager to be more daring, creative and inspired.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
106,willywants,"A nice, bizarre movie with a hint of surrealism and a brilliant Carrey",7,4 January 2005,"Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are three intelligent young children who receive terrible news that their parents have died in a fire and have left them an enormous fortune not to be used until the eldest child is of age.

Sure it has it's downfalls but it's a thoroughly amusing and different film. Jim Carrey is excellent as Olaf.

I should even say this movie does not even follow the plot correctly. When this film was made, book thirteen hasn't even been published, which is a fault in this movie because by the third movie, Count Olaf dies and there is a happy ending. That is incorrect. Book three did not end the series of A Series of Unfortunate Events. Book three was just the beginning of the series. Count Olaf didn't have to redo all his unfortunate deeds he did to the Baudelaire children, nor did he get hit by a train and die and everyone lived happily ever after. That has never happened. Count Olaf has gotten away.I am disappointed, also as a Jim Carrey fan, I am disappointed that he was chosen to play a character in such a horrible movie. This movie was not funny one bit.

109,TheMovieMark,Even better than Harry Potter!,7,16 December 2004,"Lemony Snicket? Didn't Taco Bell used to have a dessert called that? I'm pretty sure they did. And much like their tacos, eating one would most certainly lead to a series of unfortunate events. Bwahahaha! Is anybody else laughing as hard as I am right now? Oh.Anyway, did you know that Jim Carrey isn't Lemony Snicket? For some reason, I originally thought that was one of Carrey's characters. Turns out, Lemony Snicket is voiced by Jude Law. Sheesh. Why is this guy in every single movie that has been released this year? I'm barely exaggerating. Unlike his other movies, however, this one has a chance for box office success *I sit back and wait for angry emails from Jude Law fangirls COUGHmsangandmscaliHACK* Oh well, I never read any of the Lemony Snicket books, so I didn't know who the name referred to. Nor did I really know what to expect in regard to the movie. I figured Carrey would be chewing the scenery with the veracity of Rosie O'Donnell at Christmas dinner, but other than that I was pretty clueless. Thankfully, my lack of familiarity with the books didn't lessen my enjoyment of the movie at all, and it may have caused me to enjoy the movie more than I would have had I been a huge fan of the books. Even my 10-year-old brother was over-analyzing the differences between the books and the movie while I just sat there enjoying the blueberry muffins I smuggled into the theater.I was surprised that the story was as detailed as it is. I wondered (aloud, much to the dismay of the other theater patrons) whether a movie based on a series of children's books would keep my interest. After all, I only mildly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and I basically walked away wondering what all the hype was about. So I was a little surprised by how well the story was told. And I don't know if I'll find many people who agree with me, but I prefer Lemony Snicket over the four-eyed British wizard. I just enjoyed the plot more and felt the movie had more adult-oriented humor, more life, and more atmosphere.Speaking of the atmosphere, well, it's pretty dark. Some people may feel it's a bit *too* dark for a children's movie. I admit, I was originally a little surprised at the morbid tones - death, the attempted murder of children, vipers jumping and hissing at the screen. But if you think about it, aren't most of the old classic fairy tales pretty gloomy? For example, what happens in Hansel and Gretel? Ohhh, nothing except a witch tries to MURDER AND CANNIBALIZE two small children! And Little Red Riding Hood? That merely tackles the subject of a wolf wanting to devour a little girl. So as you see, upon further reflection, Lemony Snicket isn't all that different.One thing I really liked about the movie is how the beginning starts off a little unexpectedly (I won't say anymore), and then Snicket starts narrating and explains that this isn't a happy, lovely holiday film. He even warns you that there is still time to leave and go watch something lighter if you want. I thought that was pretty clever. A similar warning should've been inserted at the beginning of Alexander. I would've had less to complain about if Colin Farrell or Oliver Stone had done a quick narration explaining that I was in for nothing more than a 3-hour snoozefest.Now back to the dark tones surrounding Lemony Snicket... Count Olaf is not a ""good guy at heart"" with a minor character flaw or two. Nope, Olaf is more than happy to kill children in order to gain a fortune. And as grisly as that sounds, it actually works really well because it's done with just the right amount of humor.The Baudelaire children manage to escape the clutches of Olaf, but he never leaves their trail as they get bounced from their snake-loving Uncle Morty (Billy Connolly) to their overly paranoid Aunt Josephine (Streep) who refuses to use a doorknob because she's scared it'll shatter into a million pieces and get in her eye.As Olaf tries to keep track, he appears in disguise and fools everyone except the kids. This is where Carrey shines. He does a great job as three different characters, my favorite being Captain Sham - a grizzled old captain with a wooden leg who loves the fact that he gets good parking spaces, but he laments that he doesn't have much luck with the ladies because he has a wooden leg and the face of a hen's posterior. I've always been a Carrey fan, and I'm sure I'll be accused of being a studio shill, but he's hilarious here, and he brings his characters to life.Everybody else does a good job as well. The kids actually are fairly competent and not the annoying little brats that you might expect in a children's movie. They're much much better than the red-headed punk (Ronald) from Harry Potter. But hey, that's just my opinion, you could be wrong.Things do get a tad sappy at times as the kids learn how important family is and how they have to stick together, etc. etc. But hey, it's a good, positive message, so who am I to complain too much? Make fun of the cheese a bit and have a good time.THE GIST If you like Jim Carrey and you're in the mood for a children's movie with dark tones reminiscent of the Brothers Grimm, then check out Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. But if you're the type of moviegoer who is only interested in light and fluffy holiday fare, then The Polar Express may be more your style.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",A Series of Unfortunate Events
110,galensaysyes,Heavy,2,22 December 2007,"I liked two things about this movie. One was the girl playing the older sister, who has an intriguing look and manner, seemed to understand the material perfectly--and may have talent besides. The other was a few of the introductory shots, which were dreamlike, elliptical, and, I thought, rather beautiful. Most of the rest, I found heavy, tiresome, and ultimately disagreeable, because Too Much. There was no lack of effort or ability: the sets were wonderful in their shapes and colors and textures; but they were hardly used except as backdrops, and there was no occasion for them to be. An animated cartoon--line drawings--would have rendered the material better, funnier, in half the time, and with a hundredth of the trouble. The only thing the movie has going for it that a cartoon could not is Jim Carrey; which is to say, Jim Carrey shtick; which is to say, once again, Too Much--and shtick that is wrong for the character; even a Snidely Whiplash uncle, in an imitation Roald Dahl/Edward Gory universe. Here Carrey's face is unrecognizable under its heavy camouflage. The material, unfortunately, is likewise. (Note: IMDb now has an automatic spell-check that doesn't give the user a choice.

111,kyrat,"OK, but disappointing, captured some elements, missed others",7,31 August 2006,"I enjoyed the rather old fashioned stylized costuming. I though Jim Carey did a great job. I think he found both the villainy and the humor in Count Olaf. His physical ability to get into a character is fantastic & that along with the makeup/costumes a person who didn't know what was coming would've been fooled into not immediately recognizing Count Olaf too. Many segments of the film were obviously well thought out. The scenery was pretty good. The credits were some of the best I've ever seen.What I didn't like was how they tried to cram three books into one film that was barely 1.5 hours! It was way too short for all this. I felt this made them lose the essence of the books. I knew the marvelous wordplay would be hard to adapt, but I felt they started out well with the voice-over and then lost it for rather pedestrian dialogue. They should have fleshed out the stories and gone a little more into depth, otherwise it just felt like 3 sat. morning cartoon episodes. For example, you barely met Monty before he met his end. So there was no long set up of what was coming. Also, the book already has a particular sense of humor, so trying to stick in lame one-liners from Cedric/Dustin Hoffman was stupid. Finally what I didn't like was the ending. They tried to stick on a relatively happy/hopeful ending for a series that is literally an endless series of unfortunate events. That's what brings you back, you watch & you think things are going to be OK, then something awful happens and they move again and the whole cycle starts again. I'm not saying they should make it entirely depressing and hopeless because it is in fact that very grain of hope that keeps you reading the books to find out what will happen. So worth watching, good effort, but as with all adaptations of books... go read the books instead, they are much better!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
112,johnny-08,Jim Carrey show,7,26 December 2007,"At first I liked the idea of this movie but I expected one movie that is not extraordinary, just normal and plain fun. But this one really surprised me. It is movie for everyone to watch, cause you can smile, you can think of it as fairy tale or adventure movie. You can think of it what you want but you have to agree that this is not bad movie. Cause it is very original, the atmosphere is just great and well known actors are included in this project. The story follows our main three characters: Klaus, Violet and Sunny, who became orphans after their parents died in a fire. They are all given to Count Olaf for care and all he wants is their wealth and he will do anything to get it.This plot really sticks with you and I think that narrator Lemony Snicket (Jude Law) is great thing for this movie. That suggests us that we're watching one fairy tale and that is good because this isn't serious movie and it definitely isn't for people without imagination. Also there are many good actors involved here; like Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep, Billy Connolly, Timothy Spall, Dustin Hoffman and many others. Although I liked Streep's and Connolly's contribution I have to say that this is Jim Carrey show. He play Count Olaf (who is actor) with perfection. He enjoys every moment of it and it looks like had fun in filming this one. His positive approach spreads on the whole acting team and especially on the kids (all of them were good). All fans of Carrey won't be disappointed and many of them who aren't must say that he is a good actor cause he can make you smile and make you cry. And I think that it is harder to make people smile, then cry. Carrey is a winner of this movie.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The entire movie shows us three peaceful hearts in a bad world. All the scenes are beautiful enough to be compared to Lord of Rings. And Jim Carrey never disappoints me.I saw the movie right after a vital examination. I thought I was going to fail it. But it came out that I was strongly encouraged by this fairy-tale. Although the name of the movie is called A Series of Unfortunate Events, the children were really lucky in their situations. This really delighted me. Besides, it seemed in the movie that even luck is a kind of wisdom, it comes from heart. When audiences(especially those who haven't read the novel)find that their second guardian is a snake-fan, they may feel nervous for the children. However he is a good man, and even the deadliest viper is a good and kind snake. What a sick joke! In ancient Chinese tale Qing She, the author said ""human-being's heart doesn't worth a snake's love."" In the movie, you may also sense such reference. That is, the intellectual part of the movie.Forgive me for bringing up the special effects. But I really think this movie deserve at least a ""nomination of best achievement in the visual effects"" in Oscar. We see fantastic sceneries and pure beauties in the movie, not so frivolous like some Harry Potter movies.After all, this is a good tale not only for children to admire, but also worth grown-ups' tears.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Perhaps ""The Littlest Elf"" would have been more appropriate, but she begged me to continue and if you must know the truth, I was more than a little curious to finish the book myself. The genius of Jim Carrey was his ability to bring great humor to the sinister Olaf. It was a stroke of genius , for to play the part as dark as Olaf comes off in the books would mean box office poison. In the book it is Lemony Snicket himself that brings the humor to the books with asides and even comments about his own choice of words as narrator. In the film to give Jude Law a similar role as narrator would be difficult if not impossible. I really believe that in twenty years this film will be cherished as a classic. I wouldn't say that about any of the Harry Potter films to date. I'm surprised with the critics of the film. Let's face it, the biggest naysayers and the biggest fans all put the onus on the shoulders of Jim Carrey. I, for one, enjoyed every second that he was on screen. 9/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
115,netwallah,Who would have thought creepiness could be such fun?,10,21 April 2006,"A curiously delightful confection of elaborate Gothic gloom, bad things happening to good people, and a contrarian spirit rejecting the clichés of children's literature, all with a mordant satisfaction and mopish cheer. The young actors who play orphans Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire (Emily Browning--a girl with a beautiful mouth and a thoughtful expression, Liam Aiken--quick and alert and intelligent, and Kara & Shelby Hoffman--aware of what's going on and yet always cheerful) are very good indeed, capable of holding their own against the wildly bizarre, transparent, and fiendish overacting of Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), through whom nobody can see except the children. Carrey sets the pace for the major adult actors, all of whom stretch to extremes, especially Meryl Streep as a frightened, quivering Aunt Josephine, and Timothy Spall as persistently myopic banker Poe, and even Billy Connolly as the amazingly sympathetic, gentle herpetologist Uncle Monty. The other actors are fine, tooJude Law as Lemony Snicket's voice, and Count Olaf's henchmen, the hapless judge (Catherine O'Hara), the constable (Cedric the Entertainer), and an uncredited Dustin Hoffman as a member of the audience. A lot of the tone of the books is preserved, though mostly the lovely play on defining words has disappeared, and Carrey's parts unsurprisingly get more words. The story is very faithful to the books, though there is some resolution at the end of only the first three adventures; but Count Olaf escapes, leaving open the possibility of sequels. Not all the innovations are badhaving baby Sunny's noises translated in subtitles is amusing. By far the best thing in the movie, though, is the over-all design, a lavish mixture of Victorian costume and decor à la Edward Gory, contemporary-sounding speech by the two speaking Baudelaires, ingenious sets, effects, and devices, strange automobiles, weird characters, creepy extreme situations, and a consistently dismal feel. Great detail in house interiors, book titles, costume, everywhere. Really amusing. The Littlest Elf sequence is repellently awful, but the animation in the closing credits is brilliant.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I get that it's supposed to be over the top gothic but why so many high profile and respected actors agreed to associate themselves with this tripe is beyond me.

118,jaxbubba,A Mansion Family Value's Film,5,29 April 2005,"I guess the first thing that crosses my mind when reviewing this film, is that I can't believe that it's geared for kids. Based on the books of the same name, I really could not believe what was being presented as entertainment. Though done in a whimsical fashion, the children of this film are virtually being stalked and endangered for their family's heritages; and the adults surrounding these children are being killed in an attempt to secure their custody.Looking much like a Tim Burton film, the film is dark and sorted; and tracks the accounts of the Baudelaire children. The three orphans: Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny are thrust into the care of their Uncle Olaf, when a freakish house fire takes the lives of their parents in the beginning of the film. Uncle Olaf, played by Jim Carrey, has other plans for these children. His intentions include pilfering the Baudelaire family fortune, as well as, eradicating the Baudelaire children.The three children possess various traits and talents which provide a plethora of tactics used to curtail Uncle Olaf's attacks. These abilities include Violet's wizardry to invent things, Klaus' knowledge of books, and Sunny's ability to bite. Each of these personas come into play throughout the film, and is very intriguing as the children continue to thwart Uncle Olaf's always obtrusive advances.Again, the film in itself is amusing at times; however, not what I would perceive as ""family value"" entertainment, unless of course you are a member of the Mansion family. Remember being fore warned is to be fore told. Watch with caution. However, it did keep my interest.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I thought it was pretty good, and hoped that this film would maintain the darkly humorous tone of the book. It doesn't quite make it. The casting of the children is excellent, with each fulfilling his role perfectly. Jim Carrey is good as Olaf, but we get far too much plain-old Jim Carrey along with his portrayal of the character. The director gave him too many opportunities to goof off and Be Jim Carrey, and it detracts from the tone of the film. This movie also is a bit of a plodder. I saw ""...the Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" last weekend, so a basis of comparison is fresh in my mind, and the pace of this film does not compare to the sharp excellence of the Wallace and Gromit offering. The inevitable sequel to ""...Unfortunate Events"" could be successful, but it will need sharper direction and editing. I could also do with many fewer computer-generated special effects. Again, the comparison to claymation makes this film look feeble next to W&G.

121,barbagvido,Dark and beautiful,10,31 August 2015,"Say what you want, but I think this movie was awesome and in my opinion, even better than the books. Actually, it made me like the books because I finally realized their charm. Before watching this movie, I took everything way too seriously but when I saw the movie I realized it's so Burtonish and I love Tim Burton and stopped taking it so seriously. Acting was great, and the two leads gave one of the best child acting I've ever seen and Jim Carrey was so great as Count Olaf. Some people complained that he wasn't Count Olaf from the books but in my opinion, he gave his own unique spin on the character and his transformations were awesome and I must say make- up artist did a terrific job. Looking back at the actors, I must say Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine was so great and I don't know if anyone would do it as good as she did but we will see about that because Netflix is making this a TV show and I'm really excited to see that. Visually, the film was beautiful. Every scene was a feast for eyes. And now, let's talk about book-to-movie differences. The movie is based on the first three books in the series:The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room and The Wide Window while adding some foreshadowing to the rest of the series. The Bad Beginning part (the beginning and the end of the movie) was done okay with quite a few changes. The Reptile Room part felt a bit rushed and too short but Carrey makes us enjoy it with his probably best and funniest disguise as Stefano. The Wide Window part was probably the best and Meryl Streep makes it even better! All in all, it wasn't the most faithful adaptation but it still had the most important plot elements and it was also really fun and visually stunning.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
122,gcrokus,"Sachar, Handler and Rowling, Respectively",7,9 January 2005,"There have been three children's fables crafted in the past few years  the Harry Potter series, Louis Sachar's ""Holes"" and this the most recent Lemony Snicket contribution (author Daniel Handler)  that have been brought to the screen. Let's face it; the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and Tom Swift were fine in their time, as was Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan series in my father's era, but we must have authors of imagination generating thoughtful books for new generations. Like its predecessors on screen, ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" will satisfy many imaginative youths and a few adults as well.Lemony Snicket himself is the narrator (Jude Law  his silhouette is seen typing at times in a shadowy loft as he speaks  provides the voice-over) in a tale of three orphaned children passed from one to another oddball family member after the death of their parents in a suspicious fire. Snicket's own mysterious relationship to the children is part of this darkly woven account.Various misadventures continue to befall the threesome as they try and fashion a life and escape the attentions of Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). They first meet him as an adopting relation interested not in the safety or comfort of the children but completely absorbed in bilking them of their inheritance. His singularly and aggressively sinister attempts to continue to find the children are the basis for most of the children's problems.As Count Olaf Jim Carey demonstrates just enough over-the-top theatrical verve to ensure that we are in fact watching a movie in which he stars. Meryl Streep, Timothy Spall, Catherine O'Hara, Dustin Hoffman and Cedric The Entertainer all are entertaining in this costume piece, and surely had fun filling their roles. But the film is really about Carrey.And he did enjoy the role. For instance, in an interview (http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/498/498545p6.html) he notes that ""They asked me to read these books and I did. I thought it was just a really original voice. For me, it's an opportunity to have fun just throwing on disguises."" Furthermore, in the Dec. 31/Jan. 07 2004 Entertainment Weekly (#799/800: Pg. 69) Carey is quoted as saying: ""It's exultation  not compromiseI don't want to bore the hell out of people, or myself, by sticking to a pattern and always doing the same crap."" But most interesting of all, he shares a view which gives some insight as to how he actually feels about the film. ""You know, the thing about this movie that I love is that no one believes the kids, ever. Which is awesome. It's so much like real life."" (http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/).In a minor criticism, there are a few scenes entirely too protracted  to wit, the wedding scene and the auto/train peril section. But not many viewers, be they critics or not, did not see any real problems with the film as a whole. Rated 69% on the Tomatometer, it did equally well on IMDb (6.7/10).""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is better than the phenomenally successful J. K. Rowling (Potter) series but is less engaging than ""Holes"", in my view. The unsatisfactory use of magic in the Rowling films consigns them, in my view, to the lowest form of art. Far less use is made of this imaginative cop-out in ""Lemony Snicket"", and that is as it should be. But really the best of the lot continues to be Sachar's ""Holes"". There is a story grounded in the now with believable heroes and villains.Rating: Three Stars.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
123,thomvic,"Atmospheric, dark, humorous.....but the books are better",8,6 October 2010,"I saw this film before I read the books and it is definitely something that you can enjoy. It is not too kiddy, nor too serious enough to not make you have fun. The grim atmosphere along with terrific performances from Emily Browning as Violet and a solid performance (though can get slightly annoying) from Jim Carrey as the menacing Count Olaf.After I did read the first three books in which the film is based on, you do see how the film does take away a lot of the depth each book had and how it developed the characters a lot. After reading the whole series, you can start to see serious problems if they are going to make sequels. In particular, as the film at the end reveals how the whole fire burning started (this isn't a spoiler), it sort of reveals the whole mystery when you slowly start to discover this in the books later on.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film immensely. The humour adds to the film a comic relief when it is a dark tale of three kids who become orphaned and have a villainous Count Olaf after their fortune. I particularly enjoyed Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine as the woman who is practically scared of everything made to mad kind. The three main kids are charismatic and have chemistry with one another, though they could have made Klaus a bit more book wormy - they left out his glasses.The main problem is that the first three books are rushed in the film, and then it feels simply they are moved to one guardian to another, though you expected that in the novels. So it does become slightly predictable as to what will happen next. What you wait for is to see how clever the Baudelaire children are at escaping from Olaf's crutches each time and what sort of new plan they come up with.I also loved the narration from Jude Law acting as Lemony Snicket. His voice, which is immediately recognisable adds something to it. I also thought the opening sequence was hilarious and definitely captured the tone of the book - the happiest little elf scene had me wondering if this was the right movie hahaha lol. Also, stick around for the credits because it is a brilliant piece of animation that you will just admire.If there is a sequel, I'm not sure how they can keep squishing a lot of books into one film, but as long as they have the main actors it will definitely be worth a watch.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Having seen the film, I'll make it a priority to take a look. The film has a strong ""Harry Potter"" feel, what with the heroic, much put-upon British children, and the fantastical setting. If J.K. Rowling had cast Lord Voldemort as a nefarious villain out to steal the Potter family fortune, and made Ron and Hermione Harry's siblings, I imagine it would look something like this. Jim Carrey swallows huge chunks of scenery in his portrayal of Count Olaf, one of the most despicable villains to grace the silver screen in a while. The four child actors are all superb, especially the very attractive Emily Browning as the inventor, Violet.

As Count Olaf, rubber faced Jim Carrey looks like a knock off Beetlejuice, and a great actress like Meryl Streep is totally wasted in a thankless role.The children are cute, but they appear to be too old for their roles.

127,CherryBlossomBoy,Lovely design good acting but predictable writing,4,25 September 2005,"I was very eager to see this movie as I am a huge fan of Jim Carrey's manneristic style of acting, and was very interested to see what will he do in this supposedly dark story. Add in the appearance of Meryl Streep and a couple of Academy Award nominations and you build up a huge expectations.So... Jim Carrey was on par again in his role of dubious Count Olaf. His style is recognizable, similar to everything he'd done before, but it never runs dry. He gave a dark and satirical portrayal of an arch-villain. There is always a dose of restrain there, though, preventing him from wandering into frivolousness, which would surely happen to lesser actors. I also felt that he didn't try to steal the show. That's why he functioned perfectly.Meryl Streep was also fun to watch, and her role was a nice balance to Carey. It would be enjoyable to see two of them together in something of a more weight. Also worthy of mentioning is young actress in a role of older sister.The concept of the story was sabotaged from the beginning. It starts very promising, with Disney-like opening animation of elves, which is suddenly interrupted with a narrator's announcement that we are going to see much darker story. That's where the problems begin - narration. Narration is a technique which is usually avoided and for a good reason - it kills the atmosphere of a movie. It sets whatever the story in a benign framework of being told by someone who lived it and/or knows the ending. It automatically makes the viewer feel that, however horrible the story develops, the ending will be happy or at least satisfying to a viewer. That holds very true for this movie. The narrator practically promises us a dark story of what happened to poor children, but deep down you already feel they'll be just fine by the closing credits.The screenplay also isn't written well enough to match a well thought design and synopsis. There are no real surprises in it, it is pretty unconvincing and clichéd, and then there are some major plot-holes, which makes you wonder: why they have to go through all the misfortunes in the first place? The climactic finale is something of a letdown and the only thing that saves it is the final speech given through the letter from deceased parents.On a deeper level, this movie could be about a number of things, starting with child abuse to secret societies (there's even a hint of that in the opening narration), but there's no strong point to any of those issues. There's enough symbolism thrown all around the movie (most blatant being masonry symbols), but they never went too far with any of it.As a note of disclaimer to what I wrote, I'm not familiar to a book series nor to what THAT is supposed to represent. I merely watched the movie on its own, regardless of all the references to its origins, and didn't find enough darkness nor humor in it. I recommend watching the movie mainly because of Streep and Carey.Oh yes, and you'll probably like the little baby's subtitles, too.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It is that because it has tried to make child abuse by Jim Carrey's evil character entertaining. Yes, he played his role well and visually, it is quite nice as well. But, the underlying theme of the whole movie is these kids trying to get away from and evil Count Olaf who basically wants to kill them. His hits them, tries to force on into a child-marriage, makes them do hard labor, and over an over again tries to kill them. I am no wimp or wussie and this movie made me sick. I hated it. I have seen abuse like this from a family member and they looked the same. I knew that Horrorweird was sick and did some pretty raunchy things, but trying to do it in s children's story, and as entertainment, they have sunk to a new low. I have been a JIm Carrey fan for years, but this guy was not funny, not even remotely and was quite pathetic. Do not take your kids to see this. This is a sick movie made by sick minds.

It's gutsy to dare people to walk out, especially when the warning tells parents that their kids are about to see some creepy & scary stuff. My audience didn't take Lemony up on it and I also stayed put to brave a theatre full of fussy kids. The movie itself isn't much fun, although it's a dream to look at the Baudelaire children's' nightmare. The production design by Rick Heinrichs and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are first-class. The story? So-so.The 3 Baudelaire kids (played by 3 moppets full of moxie) lose their parents in a tragic fire. Rushed off to stay with the devious Count Olaf (Jim Carrey, who's overdoing it and having a ball...he should play a campy vampire someday), they quickly realize he wants their sizable inheritance for himself. Billy Connolly (a congenial snake charmer) and Meryl Streep (a fretful old wingding living in a house hanging over the sea) take them in when Olaf temporarily loses custody. The kids are smarter than the grown-ups in this movie, who don't see through the Count as soon as they should.That's about it. Kids in danger, save themselves like little Batmen, find themselves back in the soup shortly after. When the movie needs a laugh, director Brad Silberling cuts to a baby close-up with silly subtitles (which ARE pretty funny). Even though the characters go on quite a journey, the movie just sprints on a treadmill. The terrific makeup, good casting, and overall cinematic beauty weren't enough to suck me in. What DID suck me in were the closing credits. They were so cool that I stayed just to see the story play out again in these expressionistic snippets.'Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events' (that's a great title!) is about as near a near-miss as you can get. I guess this is what the Lemony Snicket books are all about, with the dark 'Wizard Of Oz' style material and the bittersweet ending. Silberling uses Carrey's nuttiness and multiple characterizations just enough so that he isn't annoying. The kids are resourceful in a mostly believable way. So why doesn't it all hold together?

I think for the most part they are a screenwriter's admission that he can't tell the story through the characters' words and actions. That's probably why they're used so often when the protagonists are children: although obviously all adults were children once, they seem clueless as to how children think or communicate other than in the stilted phrases they reserve for ritualistic interactions with adults. In this adaptation of Daniel Handler's wonderfully clever children's books, the adult narrator is continually intrusive and patronizing. Both Emily Browning (Violet) and Liam Aiken (Klaus) already had considerable acting credits to their names, and I'm sure could have conveyed the plot quite adequately on their own if given the chance. They suffered only from being too old for their parts, but anyone who watches American films comes to expect (but not relish) that. Jim Carrey, as the arch-villain Olaf, is the giant among mere mortals here. His performance is, as usual, beyond words, and is the only thing that makes this film worth watching.

133,manicman84,"incredibly atmospheric, compelling adventure",9,12 August 2006,"""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is a wickedly grotesque film based on a well-known book. One can even classify it as a horror movie meant for the whole family. Brad Silberling extensively uses black humor and does not fall into excessive sentimentalism. The film maintains the specific atmosphere of mystery and horror. The flick is visually stunning and artistic. In particular, set design and cinematography are just mindblowing. In addition, the credits at the beginning and at the end of the movie are done with great reverence. I was amazed and had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the movie. The film probably wouldn't be so superb, if it weren't for Jim Carrey. His Count Olaf is simultaneously insane and extremely villainous. His appearance triggered off a suspicious smile on my face. Besiedes, Meryl Streep (Aunt Josephine) who exhibits his comedy talent here is as always great. ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is unpredictable, avoids repetitions and keeps in suspense. What more can one require from a fantasy film ?",A Series of Unfortunate Events

135,divaclv,"Entertaining--a word which here means ""not perfect, but containing enough good stuff to make it worth watching""",7,7 June 2005,"If your childhood was anything like mine, at some point you whined to your parents or another adult, ""That's not fair!""--at which point the adult blithely retorted, ""Life's not fair."" A hard lesson, sure, but one we all learn eventually--life isn't fair; people die, bad things happen to good people, and justice isn't always served. Lemony Snicket's ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" books, in which siblings Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire start off being orphaned by a fire and then having things go downhill from there, embraces that philosophy with a dark, sly humor that is irresistible. Fortunately, Brad Silberling has kept the spirit of the series mostly intact with this film translation.The movie encompasses Snicket's first three books, in which Violet (Emily Browing), Klaus (Liam Aiken), and Sunny are foisted off on several guardians by the dimwitted executor of their parents' estate (Timothy Spall). The first and worst of these is Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), a thorough scoundrel who's after the kids' immense inheritance. The children manage to escape, and over the course of the film encounter a kindly snake enthusiast (Billy Connolly) and an ultra-hypochondriac (Meryl Streep), each of whom try to look after the children in their own way. But mostly the Baudelaires look after themselves, each resourceful in their own way--Violet invents contraptions with whatever is at hand, Klaus is a reference desk unto himself, and baby Sunny practices her teething on whatever (or whoever) is convenient. The trio share the sort of unique bond that can only come from having survived a long string of misadventures. Olaf pursues them throughout, aided by disguises which he considers brilliant and which fool everyone except, of course, the ever-observant Baudelaires.Most of the elements which make Snicket's books so appealing are present here: the entertaining characters, the cleverness of the children, Snicket's delightful black humor (given voice by Jude Law), and even the cunning reverse-psychology promotional scheme of the series (in which the reader/viewer is told, no really, you DON'T want to hear this story, go find something more cheerful, etc.). Carrey gleefully gnaws the scenery as Olaf, and indeed with such a character he can do no less. Browning and Aiken are quite appealing, but the real scene stealer is Sunny (played by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman). Sunny does not actually speak, but her coos and gurgles are translated via subtitle in a dry and witty manner (another inspiration taken from the series). The production design (combining the best parts of Tim Burton and Edward Gory) creates a fanciful but accessible world which modern inventions like remote car-keys are wielded by characters who dress like they just stepped out of a Victorian melodrama.It is perhaps too much to ask that the film could have avoided a Hollywood-style attempt to soften its delightfully dreary outlook, or that Carrey could have gone the entire movie without having at least one sequence in which he's just required to be Jim Carrey. But this is kept to a minimum--as Violet herself says, there really is more good than bad here.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
136,saint405,What a headache,4,30 June 2005,"Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events is a film adapted from a series of books. The movie is a pile of book chapters fumbled into a plot with it's characters, Jim Carrey is thrown in, and for that we have a weird world of stupid creatures and weird people. Boy this film was dumb. I like Jim Carrey and all that but he was all down and bad in this movie. No funny jokes at all and the scenery doesn't help. Oh no the leeches are attacking! The leeches? Stupid film with bad characters that totally mocks the books. This film is full of good talent that's wasted, not funny at all! Now the plot is three different stories tied into one that turns the characters through one obstacle to another, not that entertaining. Now do yourselves a favor and watch something else than this nightmare. Unfortunate Events gets the big 4, dull and boring. If you want to get a good nap, watch this film.

137,de_niro_2001,Great! (contains spoilers),10,3 January 2005,"Not being a kid any more I'd never heard of Lemony Snicket. However my family were keen to see this film and I'm glad I went with them. It's one of the most original family films of recent years. The opening sequence with the rather awful animated film The Littlest Elf has you worrying for a few moments that you will have to sit through a boring short just like in the old days. But mercifully it abruptly stops and the story begins. Not having read the books I can't say how faithful the film is to them but it is a very good and original story. The kids are all good actors. As Count Olaf, Jim Carrey hasn't just entered the pantheon of frightening villains in children's films he's outdone all the other members of this pantheon like the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the Wicked Witch in Disney's Snow White. Some scenes certainly are quite frightening, in fact there is one scene which would definitely be unsettling to anyone with a fear of snakes. There is also plenty of suspense in it. I particularly liked the scene with the precariously placed house on the cliff. It is a great film about good v evil. I won't say any more.

It is a valid argument, just like the ""Modesty Blaise"" movie is awful for anyone who knows the original.But for me, who have not read the books, it is charming and fun. Carrey is fun in a very different way than his other films. The movie reminds me of old-style horror comics, including both the storyteller, Gothic settings, characters and much of the story. For me it is a pastiche on such stories, a spoof, making it somewhat similar to Mel Brook's movies ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"".I can't complain about the acting. Carrey is over-acting just as the villain of a story like this should, and Streep is truly hysterical. The children don't act much, which is fair enough.On the negative side, the girl is a bit too pretty (are those lips real or enhanced?) and the scenery a bit too obviously computer-generated, complete with at least one ""invention"" that is also in ""Robots"".",A Series of Unfortunate Events
139,filmbuff-36,Macabre film proves perfect antidote to mindlessly happy Christmas films,8,25 January 2005,"Children's movies tend to be so light and uplifting that you can't help but feel you're drowning in cuteness. This is not the case in ""A Series of Unfortunate Events,"" a film cut with both Victorian era sensibilities as well as dark dread of a Tim Burton film.Life has not been well for the Baudelaire children. When their parents killed in a mysterious fire, the court places them in the custody of their theatrical uncle, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). Olaf has his own plans for the children, which involve wiping them out in elaborate methods that would make Wile E. Coyote blush.But the kids are not helpless. Violet (Emily Browning), the eldest of the Baudelaire children, has a knack for invention. Klaus (Liam Aiken) is well read and can tap into his extensive knowledge at any time, and little baby Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman) has a habit of biting things with her powerful teeth.The children soon visit other family members as well, each with their own particular quirks. Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) has a fascination with reptiles, while their Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) has become very paranoid about how various things may come to harm her. However, whenever the kids are starting to become comfortable or learn more about their family's mysterious origins, Count Olaf pops up in disguise to ruin the proceedings.The children choose to use their skills to fight off their uncle while simultaneously trying to piece together clues their parents left behind for them.""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" may be the first very dark children's movie in quite some time. As the narrator, Lemony Snicket (Jude Law) tells us, this is not a story filled with happy little elves and the like. The plot is filled with harrowing, depressing and shocking turns for the little children, but what happens is so over the top and tongue in cheek you can't help but laugh.Director Brad Silberling gives the film the right surreal feel, a Gothic nightmare of a world where people such as Olaf are free to play deviously with unsuspecting children and the authorities remain ignorant of the man's true intentions. He brings an Addams Family level of the macabre to the story.Carrey steals the show, playing Olaf with camp and scene chewing bravado while also showcasing a few of his own trademarks. However, if Carrey is the loudest thing about the production, he's also the most distracting. He commands attention in every in scene he's in, taking it away from the other characters who should be considered equally interesting.The children all give great performances, with Browning and Aiken both playing their characters with nice touches of humanity in an inhumane world. The Hoffman twins are both cute as baby Sunny. Supporting actors Connolly and Streep both are interesting but are not on screen long enough to leave lasting impressions. Law, on the other hand, narrates the story with a dry British wit that feels perfect with the rest of the movie.If ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" has any problems, it's that the film is so episodic. This is not a surprise, since the movie is a combination of the first three books in the series, ""The Bad Beginning,"" ""The Reptile Room,"" and ""The Wide Window."" Still, the story just seems to hop from one bad situation to another with little rhyme or reason. However, in many people's minds that may be one the more addictive aspects of the series.If you're looking for a family movie filled with cheer and joy, look elsewhere. However, if you want a dark tale that would fit in with Roald Dahl's output, then ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is just your ticket.8 out of 10 stars. Carrey camps it up nicely, and everyone brings a delightful bit of gloom and doom to the holidays.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
140,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - A Truly Fortunate Experience,9,16 January 2005,"The story for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a practically flawless presentation of some of the most cultivated content, though still stylized enough to be categorized as a family-oriented feature, aimed for the pre-teenage set this side of the Harry Potter fantasy universe. Even with that in mind, that material is still enriching enough to spark a certain amount of constructive debate among its desired audience base. All of this is assured of course given that you are not one of the crazed novel enthusiasts who howl and moan every time a mere sentence is altered from the text. It is always more appropriate that you go into these sorts of films without any prior knowledge of the previously released texts as this sort of thing can only lead to nick-picking, a terrible and annoying habit which ruins the viewing experience for everyone involved  those members of the Harry Potter, and to a lesser extent The Lord of the Rings, sects know exactly what this means.As was the case with Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas, there will undoubtedly be critics of Jim Carrey's amplified antics in the role of the villainous Count Olaf, no more so then from the fanatic fan-base of the literary series, clamoring that his interpretation of the character offset his truly monstrous nature and intentions as the novels indicate. Yes, Carrey does give about an amusing quality to Count Olaf, or maybe that is only do to the workings of the young orphans against him that we find so entertaining. In either case, crucial scenes such as the one where he is show slapping Klaus for speaking up against him in front of his acting troupe demonstrates the character's truly malevolent nature which must be despised and scorned rather then mock. This becomes even more evident when children take into account the idea that Count Olaf is attempting to kill his own relatives  no matter how distant  for his own profitable gain. Meryl Streep, an Academy-Award wining performer entirely unfamiliar with the realm of family-oriented productions such as this, takes to the role like a total natural with no question to her magic implored in the role of Aunt Josephine. And what is more is that she does this without having to be as drunk as a skunk as she was at the recent Golden Globes ceremony  Alright, that was not exactly an evaluation of her performance but rather a well deserved jab that has been in quite seclusion for quite some time waiting for the appropriate moment to be let loose. Jude Law, who without question has become the Colin Farrell of 2004 after appearing in what would seem like twenty films this year alone, gives to the narrator of Lemony Snicket a composed, mystifying, and regularly witty voice that could not have been delivered as respectively as he does here.Overall, though literary zealots may whimper and wail over the very thought of even the tiniest aspect of the franchise changing in this feature film adaptation, what to them may seem like a series of unfortunate events might, in fact, be the first steps of an even greater and more whimsical franchise ahead. One of the most marvelous aspects this film manages to present successfully to its audience is its ability to not only entertain but inform as well, not merely through a monotonous series of long-winded speeches but a variety of operations that, no matter how exaggerated they may be, reflect upon experiences in our own lives. The young children who are anticipated to be A Series of Unfortunate Events' core audience this holiday season are at quite a vulnerable age, standing at what some would consider ""the water's edge"". Slowly but surely they are beginning to mature into free-thinking and conscious adults and admirable members of society, or as close as they can be depending on the behavior of one's own family. Though it is suppose to be the direct responsibility of the parents to instill in their children lessons to assimilate throughout life, it certainly does not hurt to have popular culture such as films like this expand on their teachings. The most sensational thing pertaining to the characters of this film is that they teach us that even the best of individuals have their own little quirks about them but, despite these seeming strange to us, they do not change the natural good inside them that they have already demonstrated. In fact, they may even make them better individuals. Another lesson too many children in this world learn all too late in this life is that the world is not always a happy and fair place and events do not always work out in the way we would want them to. Those that raise their children with the hippie-dippy view of society, that being that all men and women no matter how evil they may seem have a source of good in them, should be jailed for child neglect. What a horrible and ignorant way to propagate their minds like that! But Lemony Snicket's most decisive lesson taught within the course of this film is that no matter where you are or how dire the situation may be, as long as you are surrounded by friends and family, you are never truly far from your home. Quite simply, this is the best family film this holiday season and will sure to go down as one of top ten family features of the year.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

When I saw this movie, I was interested for the first 10 minutes until Jim Carrey appeared, and usually, I like his outlandish behavior but somehow, it just did not work in this movie. I think this movie is suppose to be a dark comedy but it was mildly dark and even less comedic. Moreover, the movie is suited for children than adults. Anyway, after about 20 minutes, I got bored so I left the theater. The story is basically about three children whose rich parents die and some long distant relative, Jim Carrey, takes them in.

Then, my friend recommended the movie to me, and I instantly fell in love with it.The dark nature of the story is what fascinated me, because not everyone wants to see a movie where everything goes well, and everyone is happy all the time, and in a way, the darkness of this story reflects well on life in an extreme way.Emily Browning is an amazing, beautiful, and talented actress, while Kara and Shelby Hoffman are two of the most adorable twins ever, and brought the character of Sunny to life in a cute and funny way.

Initially I thought it was a wannabe Tim Burton project, but as the film went on it starts to impress. The dark, dry humour that makes you wonder if it was appropriate to laugh.

145,Iain-215,Unexpectedly good,8,19 December 2008,"This film has been out for quite some time now but we have only just got round to watching it! I really was not sure what to expect. I feared it might be overly sentimental or just another vehicle for Jim Carrey (of whom I am not a great fan). I am pleased so say that I loved it - almost - unreservedly! I have not read the books so cannot comment on how the film compares to them. I very much enjoyed the overall look and feel of the film. I don't understand why some people complain when a fantasy film mixes periods and styles....it's a fantasy!! What does it matter if the cars are from the fifties yet they talk about faxes and wear Victorian frock coats? Its a fantasy!!! The overall tone is dark though mixed with a good deal of humour. I believe the books are darker still but I suppose the general feeling is that a film aimed mainly at a young audience cannot be too unrelentingly dark or it will alienate a large section of the potential audience. Personally I found the mix about right although I expect that it may be too dark for the very young.Despite not being Carrey's greatest fan, I enjoyed his performance here. I little more reigning in here and there might not have gone amiss but overall I think he is well suited to this bizarre and unpleasant creation - I also enjoyed his weird accompanying 'troupe'. Billy Connolly is all sunny, warm contrast as Uncle Monty (I loved his house!). I adored Meryl Streep as batty, twitchy yet oddly lovable Aunt Josephine and was quite mesmerised throughout her whole (too short) performance. I thought the children acquitted themselves very well, especially Emily Browning as Violet.I have read some complaints in other reviews about some of the subject matter in this film (death, attempted murder of children etc) but (as the prologue points out) life is not a sunny fairy story like The Littlest Elf. Horrible things happen. I'm not sure that it's a good thing to avoid this even in a children's movie. And besides, evil does not triumph in the end...Why only eight stars out of ten? Well, I felt there were quite a lot of untied loose ends and unexplained things. I'm still not sure exactly what the children's parents and all their friends were investigating. I still don't really understand about the spyglasses or the significance of the 'eye'. I'm still not sure why Count Olaf ended up as first choice legal guardian when he was so obviously the enemy...why would their parents do that? Perhaps the plan was to make a sequel? Ah well, I will perhaps have to read the books to find out.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
146,psi_fla,One of the best Tim Burton films not directed by Burton,8,21 December 2004,"Directed by: Brad Silberling Starring: Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara & Shelby Hoffman, Catherine O'Hara, Billy Connolly, Timothy Spall, Meryl Streep, Jude Law (voice) Lemony Snicket (the pseudonym of Daniel Handler) and his Series Of Unfortunate Events could be one of the best Tim Burton films not directed by Tim Burton. Burton may have been losing his touch in recent years (Sleepy Hollow and Planet of the Apes come to mind) but this film reminds us of what he was capable of at his best. If a merely competent director like Brad Silberling (Moonlight Mile) can craft such an engrossing fantasy, does this mean we can forget about the likes of Burton and acknowledge that Silberling has a promising future? I think we can.Meet the three unusually clever Baudelaire children: Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken) and baby Sunny (Kara & Shelby Hoffman). They are about to be greeted by some awful news - their parents have died. What remains is a fortune that can't be touched until the eldest child comes of age. Their first legal guardian, as such, is the sinister Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who really only wants custody of the kids for the money. Thus a series of unfortunate events in the Baudelaire kids' lives follow. How will they deal with them? Suffice to say there are many surprises in the film, and I won't spoil them for you. It's a fantasy that is more out of touch than either of those mega-franchises, Harry Potter or The Lord Of The Rings, though it might not have the same scope as either. Maybe the film's morals are a bit sugar-coated, but you never consider that when you watch the film.I guess with three kids in the film, you'd expect to be struck down with cute kid syndrome. Yet that isn't the case. These three - sorry, four - child actors, especially Emily Browning, seem genuinely gifted. They never allow themselves to be overshadowed by the film's countless recognisable faces. Especially not by the film's supposed star, Jim Carrey. He is very nearly in full on clown mode here, hamming it up consistently the whole way through. Yet it suits him in this scenario. His Count Olaf is a thoroughly despicable villain.A Series Of Unfortunate Events (which is actually based on three books by Lemony Snicket himself) is a terribly imperfect film thanks to some plot holes, a brush with melodrama that doesn't quite pay off and a cop-out ending. A riskier ending could have elevated this to the level of the best fantasy of recent years. (Yes, I'm serious.) But the ending is not bad enough to undo everything that has come before it.Let Carrey and the kids keep you occupied on their marvellous and fascinating journey. This might just be the best of 2004's Christmas releases, and much more besides: a significant boost to the quality of the fantasy genre.Rating: **** (out of *****)",A Series of Unfortunate Events
147,Juni78ukr,A story of the real children in a surreal world.,8,8 March 2006,"Have been not familiar with popular books on which the movie is based I was not exactly sure what expect to from the movie and to my great surprise I quite liked it. Surprisingly excellent and stunning on a visual level the movie has lots of appealing for both children and adults it was one of the best high-budgeted film I've seen in recent memories.From a very beginning we came into a very strange and rather gloomy and surreal world. The story begins when three Baudelaire children, become orphans when they parents died in a fire that destroyed their home. After such an unfortunate event they are taken to they closest relative count Olaf and since then their unfortunate adventures begin. The children are fourteen years old Violet, twelve years old Klaus and infant Sunny. They are smart and fearless, they always support each other and believe that there is always something, there is always a way. Despite living in rather strange world and many less than ordinary situations, they are real children, though every one is extraordinary in a different way, and they have real feelings and emotions, they make real decisions and always care about each other.The story despite being rather dark is satirical and positively unusual and funnier than I could expect with incredibly soft and suitable Jude Law's narration, which is never (on the contrary to most of movies when narration is an important part of storytelling) annoying or overused.Even if Jim Carrey's involvement sometimes was too strong and he stole the show, the main heroes are Emily Browning and Liam Aiken who as I believe were equally good in their parts. This time I have to agree with the director who said that they were very suitable for playing those characters. At the same time I like and respect Brad Silberling's approach and what is the most important that the movie did not turn into something too dark, too silly, too satirical, too stylish or too perceptive. There is always a sense or proportion and common sense. The decorations, costumes and make-up are excellent all the way and deserve many good words. Without such hard work, it would be simply impossible to create so strong on visual level movie with numerous memorable and capturing my imagination scenes. The movie soundtrack written by Tomas Newman sometimes is dark, sometimes is light and uplifting and it's a very good and suitable supplement to a visual part.After watching Lemony Snicket's I was disappointed that there is no direct plans of making a sequel, possibly because of less than expected commercial success of the movie. Whatever happens in the next books with our heroes the story is just unfolding in the movie based on the first three books. The connections have been made and there are many secrets yet to be revealed. Most likely, the main problem that the movie has faced was its marketing as a Jim Carrey movie. He is a very stylish actor and his appearance in the movie could attract some viewers while at the same time turn away others. He is excellent playing a very colorful character of count Olaf but as a narrator says this is a story (and rather satirical story) of the three ""reasonably attractive orphans"" and their struggles to find a place in that rather unusual world. The real stars in the movie are Violet and Klaus with Emily Browning and Liam Aiken who played them. I still don't know is that a perfect adaptation but I think it was a pretty good motion picture. However, despite being very good the movie after watching it I thought that it still lacks something, something hardy perceptible. Maybe because it was the compilation of three books, the story was too rushed and the movie was just a little shorter than it could have been. Finally, the animated titles are very nice and worth your attention.Grade 8.5 out of 10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
148,NicolasCostoglou,A series of great set-pieces...,9,12 February 2017,"A series of unfortunate Events is a very well made, Tim Burton-esque movie, with a lot of great atmosphere and charm.The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is very fitting with the tone, the movie is going for, which is kind of bleak and macabre, but also fairly funny and sometimes even hopeful...The three Budelaire children are all played by great actors, and the adult acts are on-par. Meryl Streep gives a not TOO over-the-top performance so that you are still invested in her character, Billy Connolly is the uncle everyone wishes he could have, and Jim Carrey is excellent as Count Olaf. For many years i didn't even knew it was him! (The same with Jude Law, but to be fair, he's embodiment of Lemony Snicket is always in shadows ^^)The visual Effects of this movie (which is 12 years old by now) stood the test of time incredibly well, most of the time it's not even visible if somethings real or not. There is only one effect shot which overstays it's welcome, when the little Sunny catches something with her mouth and than looks straight into the camera in full CGI. A cut a few seconds earlier would have been great, every other CG-embodiment of her character works fairly well.The soundtrack by Thomas Newman hits all the right emotional marks and the atmosphere of the film. The end track sticks in my head for weeks after i watched this.Speaking of the end track, it's heard while seeing a incredible artistic and creative fully animated end title-sequence which is marvelously great to the end, so stay for the end credits.It's all in all a fairly well made, dark, but not too dark family picture, with great performances and intense set-pieces...",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It's a pity that though nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction, it didn't win! The cinematography was also amazing! Thomas ""the great"" Newman and one of Hollywood's MOST prolific and gifted music directors was also nominated for an Oscar for his score on this film. I've been a been a great fan of Newman's music for several years now and I felt wretched when he didn't win the Oscar for 'Road to Perdition'. The score of that film takes film-music composing to a truly new level! It's responsible for half of the film's beauty. It's high time Newman gets acknowledged for his scores... If he does win an Oscar in the future, it won't be just for the film he's nominated, it will be for many years of composing spell-binding, ethereal music...!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
150,ChrisTreborn,Unexpected Bad Movie,5,26 May 2005,"I didn't know any thing about this movie when I first watched it, I think it was based on some kind of Graphic novel/ fairy tale adaptation like Cinderella. What ever it was, the outcome turned out to be a SUCKING Movie! I am a great fan of Jim Carry, even though he did a great performance, the movie failed to take his advantage. I think it's only because of the lagging screenplay, bad script and the terrible treatment made by the filmmakers. It was supposed to be a Good movie but bad execution changed it into a Worst One! The most distressed portion was from the movie score. It's about the ABSENCE or the SILENCE of MUSIC gave this cinematic experience a DUMB ART FILM TONE. And the existing SCORE which was supposed to be a children oriented movie-score, was done terribly tragic. I blame only the director/producers, they had the chance to make it as a masterpiece, but they blew it widely.The only best thing I liked in the movie was its mind lifting photography. It gives a different feelings/experience, and immerses the viewer in the cinematic representation of a sketched scenery. And also the child actors and the A-list actors, they totally done justice to their roles. Also I have to give credits to the MAKEUP and COSTUME departments, for their amazing INTERPRETATIONS for the story.

151,colettesplace,"Looks great, but there's not much more than that",6,25 February 2006,"There's been a lot of hype surrounding Lemony Snicket's  A Series of Unfortunate Events, but the film doesn't quite live up to it. While it looks marvellous, and features noted actors like Meryl Streep (as overanxious Aunt Josephine) and Jude Law (the narrator), its plot is episodic and curiously insubstantial.The Baudelaire children  comprised of 14-year old inventor Violet (Melbourne's Emily Browning), reader Klaus (Liam Aiken) and biting toddler Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman)  are three attractive and resourceful orphans surrounded by well-meaning but foolish adults. Pursued for their fortune by the unscrupulous Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), they move from guardian to guardian, experiencing ""a series of unfortunate events"".Directed by Brad Silberling, and also featuring Billy Connolly as the children's snake-handling uncle, the film's impressive at first glance and will certainly engage children. Aided by a prosthetic nose that gives him an appropriately sinister profile, Jim Carrey gives a unique performance that is simultaneously irritating and brilliant. His failed impresario is surrounded by a pancaked troupe of dissolute actors (including Jennifer Coolidge) that contribute to his menace. As for Carrey's dinosaur impression: it's uncanny. Emily Browning is particularly effective as Violet.The film's adapted from three of the popular Lemony Snicket novels by Daniel Handler  giving it an episodic structure which, in this case, is unsuccessful. Set in a hyper-real hybrid of the Victorian era and the 1950s, there's something of the fairytale in Lemony Snicket's. In many fairy tales, there are three variations on a theme (The Three Little Pigs, or Goldilocks and the Three Bears, for example), and Lemony Snicket's follows this but, unfortunately, replays the theme without variations. Or, more accurately, no character variations, but fantastical changes in production design and minor tweaks that are insufficient to advance the plot, given the lack of character development. It's this fundamental flaw that gives Lemony Snicket's its insubstantiality. Despite the truly gorgeous production design (courtesy of Sleepy Hollow designer and Tim Burton collaborator Rick Heinrichs), it's like that poor player: ""full of sound and fury"", but signifying nothing.Ensure you stay for the credits, which feature charming hand-drawn animation in the style of The Triplets of Belleville. 3 stars.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
152,stargunner,Carrey's only half the fun,8,13 January 2005,"I thought Jim Carrey did a marvelous job in Lemony Snicket as he returned to his roots in portraying a humorous character. His body language and lively facial expressions brought a lot of life to the several characters he played. Although I don't believe his role was enough to keep the film going. In fact, about halfway through the movie I was beginning to get disappointed.But Emily Browning as Violet and Liam Aiken as Klaus, the two unfortunate children in the story, even their baby sister Sunny, all did a superb job in making this movie what it is. The dark and dismal humor of Lemony Snicket is mostly dependent on the three children and their troubles, and they all do very well. Carrey makes a great antagonist, but again, he's not there to steal the show, because he didn't. All played an equal role in this film.Even if you don't appreciate the humor, you have to appreciate the wonderful acting by everyone.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Lemony Snicket didn't disappoint me, but it wasn't the must-see I expected. Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire have lost their parents in their home's fire. So, they ramble from a tutor to another, threatened by the presence of the unpleasant Olaf (Jim Carrey, perfect!). The story isn't extraordinary, but it's full of literary mentions that excite your mind: the surnames Baudelaire and Poe (the banker who escorts the kids), an atmosphere among the Gothic novel and Charles Dickens. Costumes, make-up, production design and cinematography were magnificent (all they deserved an Oscar, but Aviator was a little better). The cast is perfect: Jim Carrey is the only actor for Olaf, Meryl Streep really funny (she'is Aunt Josephine) and Jude Law inviting as the voice-over Lemony Snicket. I didn't like very much Emily Browning (but she's very pretty, she'll be a party girl soon) and Liam Aiken (he's forgettable). Kara and Shelby Hoffman were bothering.

154,HardKnockLife210,A Series of Captivating Scenes,7,2 April 2005,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, a ""children's film"" directed by Brad Silberling, tells the tale of the Baudelaire family, or what remains of it after the parents of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire die in a fire. The film is told from Mr. Snicket's perspective, as an observer who gives his own perspective on events. From the beginning, the film warns the viewer that it will not be the happiest of films, and the film does have somewhat of a dark atmosphere, especially for young viewers.So Violet, Klaus, and young Sunny (played by three youngsters), end up in the hands of Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), a villain who wants nothing but the Baudelaire riches. To receive the Baudelaire riches, Olaf makes several creative attempts at the children's lives. The film is very intriguing, as the children go from obscure relative to obscure relative to hide from their wicked uncle, and as Olaf thinks up new and hilarious disguises for himself. It's true that the film is dark, but it's not completely devoid of comedic material.The set and costume design is indeed brilliant and is about as intriguing as the quirky relatives of the young Baudelaires. Sure, everything's cartoonish, but the film isn't exactly trying to be serious. Lemony Snicket's isn't completely lacking in commentary on society's attitude toward children and the current condition of the legal system, but if you're looking for something deep and thought-provoking, this isn't the movie to see. Plus, the situations are complicated enough to keep a child's mind working, instead of providing mere visceral pleasures.Carrey does a pretty good job as Olaf, and Streep does a decent job as Josephine, too, but the children are slightly below average in their display of skill. Also, the characters of the children are mysteriously less developed than those of the minor characters, so the emotion that the children display seems strangely distant and empty.Even though the film sometimes successfully displays a dark atmosphere throughout the film, I found the ending of the film disappointing in that it wraps everything up too nicely, putting any troubles that the children have visibly experienced into a more felicitous light. It becomes just another children's movie, although it be a more visually creative one.So if you're looking for smart entertainment and something that you can show your kids, check this film out. Be sure you pay close attention to Thomas Newman's inventive music, and stay tuned for the brilliant credits.Final Grade: B.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The film involves three children who get taken into care by various relatives and embark on a series of unfortunate events, as the film title suggests.The film is stylised in nature, very similar to that of Tim Burton's usual neo-Gothic style, as a result it is more theatrical, beyond the border of fantasy than reality. Kids are sure to enjoy it, and it was a pleasant enough ride, but for me, the gags were hit and miss and though it held my interest I can't say that it was one of the better children's films I've seen.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I think that is is probably a great film to take the kids too, but not something adults will be particularly enamored with like Harry Potter. The makers do a good job with the cast and the 'look' of the film, but I just felt like it was lacking something that the books have. Carrey produces less laughs than you think, and it seems like the director probably kept a tight leash on him to keep him in character. Too much so I think! The plot seems a little rushed, and the mystery that is added is simplistic, so that probably made me like it less. I'd say only see this film if you have kids to take with you.

They go to live with Count Olaf and they are tormented until they are moved away to several more guardians. They use their brains and skills to get out of unfortunate situations. If you cant watch a movie that involves an evil man with an eye on his ankle, a snake, a bunch of leeches, a hurricane, and a marriage scene which happens to be pretty weird, this movie is not for you. Anyway, this is a good movie, but the books are very better, but the movie is still worth watching. It's really short, though. Only around 90 minutes.

No, not because of the extremely hot guy OK so he was extremely hot, but even if he wasn't it was still very good! So here is what was good about the movie: -it had awesome snakes (especially that big yellow one. Will Circe get that huge one day?) -It had the general musty feel of the books (though not quite so dark, which I actually liked), -Each scene was beautiful without looking fake or tacky, -the acting and casting was awesomeJim Carry's overacting was actually appropriate for once! -the screenplay wasn't nearly as bad as they say in some reviews (it was quite good actually, and it resembled the books' style) -yes they did stuff a few books into one movie but it really sped things up and worked better then it usually does -the characters looked the way I imagined them -ok, so there was an optimistic (not happy, just optimistic) ending, but so what? I liked it! -the credits were by far the best I have ever seen Bad things about this movie -it endedin style this reminded me a great deal of the new Peter Pan (which I also adore) If you like this you should definitely see it.

I appreciate humor dark enough to tar rooftops, have two kids, and study 19th-century Gothic literature for a living. I was Lemony Snicket's dream audience.Hated those damned books. I found the plotting poor, the pacing weak, the dialog crude and ineffective, and the intrusive narratorial sneer grating as hell. I labored my way through the first, and tossed the second halfway through.So I had low expectations for this movie. I'd heard some of the criticism both from fans of the series (""not close enough to the original,"" they whined) and regular movie viewers (""slow and dull,"" they groused). I was prepared for a thoroughly miserable time, and only agreed to the viewing to screen it for my kid.Imagine my surprise when I found a tight little allegorical gem. The acting is passable, and occasionally quite good (with the strange and glaring exception of Carrey, who positively reeks in his roles in this flick - gratefully, he ain't on screen much). The art direction, as has been noted, is flawless, out Tim-Burtoning even Tim Burton. The music is strange, atonal, and absolutely perfect without being intrusive. And the pacing, while admittedly slow in some places (particularly when Carrey takes leering center-stage) is generally fine.Best of all, the films take the sprawling, snide and obnoxious text and translates them into a taut moral fable. Jude Law deserves extra kudos for transforming the character of the narrator from a sneering know-it-all to a deeply sympathetic figure - it saves the entire tale, even the macabre bits (absolutely *NOT* for small children) and the melancholy parts (very affecting - again, not for small children, nor the easily weepy).

Jim Carrey as expected is brilliant, but it was surprisingly how funny was Meryl Streep and how witty is this movie at all.Too bad the movie fails to reach that high level in the other parts that make the story. The adventure fantasy part doesn't actually fails, it's quite good and inventive, but it doesn't take much space of the story. The dark side of the story is caught well, but yet the makers were very careful not to cross the line, so again nothing revolutionary is made, but it is daring.Unfortunately it fails in the drama and the end happens too soon, too fast and completely lacks culmination.

It explained a lot during the closing credits (truly the best part of the film, by the way) when it mentioned that the movie was basically three books strung together because what you end up watching is the exact same scenario played out three times, then it ends. No doubt the next film will play out the same ""unfortunate events"" three more times and end just the same.The performances, shooting, etc., were fine. It's just not a very good movie.

165,toast-15,better than the books that's for sure,7,18 December 2004,"I saw this movie with my son this afternoon. I thought it was by far a better story than the books which I refuse to buy anymore after the first. The movie moves along and weaves together a better story than the first three books, though it takes its basic premise from them. SPOILER ALERT******** Several times throughout the movie, my son and I exchanged knowing glances when we knew the plot was deviating from what the author wrote in the books...for the better I'd say. Did I mention yet that I generally am not impressed with the books? I bought the first one for my son and he has been getting the others from the library. They are very thin and there are a very many of them. Cynical me just hears Ka-Ching Ka-Ching...when compared to what J.K. Rowling produces, (700+ page tomes), these little books just aren't worth it. And as you can see, three of them will fit nicely into a movie with enough room left over to add a little here and there.I thought the movie was brilliant and Jim Carrey was almost unrecognizable. The children were excellently cast as the somber but imaginative and intelligent orphans. They certainly looked the part and the baby, Sunny, was cute and charming...the comic relief of the bunch. I'm giving this movie a 9, it's almost a 10 but I just don't like the books and I don't understand why they have to be so dour. The dedication of the first one says something like, to my wife, dearest darling dead. I'm not quoting directly but it's something along those lines. There's enough in life to make one somber and cynical, I don't think children need to be inured so young...there's time enough for that. I've told my son to just take these characters like you would a cartoon. You don't cry for Wile E. Coyote or Tom and Jerry, right? But it's hard when you're reading, not to get attached to a character and when that character dies, it's still sad. There's too much in life to be sad, reading should be a pleasure and an escape.

166,flyingamon,Good but feels kind of rushed,7,29 April 2011,"This was a dark fantasy movie, I think that is the best way to describe it. The movie is based on a series of books (which I haven't read) so that's why I feel that a lot of things are left unexplained and that the movie feels pretty rushed. I would have preferred that the movie was a bit longer and provided us more background about its sub-characters such as Uncle Monty and aunt Josephine. Josephine is played by Meryl Streep who executes the part as the panicking and ever seeing accidents happening aunt marvelously. That Jim Carey plays the evil Count Olav might be a surprise since he is always type-casted as a comedy character. He does play this part well and adds humor to it, which is good. However he might not have been the best choice for this role. The children are the main center of the movie and do this well. Little Sunny was adorable as the biting toddler. Violet was pretty, smart and elegant (loved the way she dressed) and I was happy to see Emily Browning (also great in Ghost Ship) doing this role. And Klaus showed that reading and thus inheriting knowledge is pretty handy when being in danger. Intelligence doesn't make you boring at all.

But surprisingly this movie kept with the book's elements and Jim Carrey acted exactly like Count Olaf. It wasn't one of those movies where you know that it's him, like in the grinch he didn't need to where the make up you can already tell it was him. But in this film I did not see Jim Carrey, I saw the actual Count Olaf. Jim Carrey has to be one of the greatest actors and as for the dark and gloomy elements, they kept with the same atmosphere as the books.

168,LG72387,Very Burtonesque but Not as Imaginative,5,28 December 2004,"This is essentially a film made for kids. It kindles to their liking and allows for them to extend the boundaries of their imagination. The director, Brad Silberling, knows this and focuses on the stuff that kids will respond to. As a result, the film suffers because it does kindle to the adult world of imagination and creativity. My viewing of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events was thus tampered with because I was unable to stretch the limits of my imagination and respond to the characters as willingly as the children in the audience. The film indeed had the opportunity to be a creative and original masterpiece in the tradition of Tim Burton. It started out that way but then faded into a lackadaisical endless struggle into a bizarre and primitive world. It wasn't aided by the sight of Jim Carrey playing Count Olaf. If you're looking for a great performance by Carrey in this film, you will not find it because his acting is way too over-the-top that it fails to illustrate the true evil that lurks within the confines of Count Olaf. We get the sense that Olaf is evil, but is he evil enough? Carrey goes for cheap laughter rather than acting with subtlety and cleverness, which I thought were the essential qualities that Olaf possessed other than the fact that he was a villain. He tries to act all comedic in his sinister planning and as a result, he fails to illuminate his character's personality. If you're looking for a great comedy starring Jim Carrey, don't see this film. Rather, go out and rent Liar, Liar because he is way more funnier in that film than in Lemony Snicket's. Carrey is looking to identify himself as one of the premier actors in Hollywood. If he keeps making films in which he goes for cheap laughter like How the Grinch Stole Christmas and this film, then he will never be considered as a premier actor. He has so much talent that he fails to realize that these types of films hurt his credibility. I am not criticizing the film as much as I'm criticizing Carrey's performance. The film does have some good qualities that make it worthy of 2 hours spent at the movie theater. The performance by the terrific Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine is subtle and filled with substance. She captures the essence of her character, who is a neurotic, grammatically obsessed woman who just wants to live in peace and Streep has fun while doing it. I only wish that we could have seen more of her. Timothy Spall is also very good as Mr. Poe. I didn't particularly like the actors who played the children except for the Sonny character (and she didn't even say a word). The look of the film is appealing enough for kids but not for adults. It is very Burtonesque in its design but not as imaginative as a typical Burton film. During my viewing, I saw a preview of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and I hoped that what I saw in that preview would be similar to what I would see in Lemony Snicket. Unfortunately, that wasn't so and my expectations dwindled because of it. I did like the narration by Jude Law as Lemony Snicket and I felt that he was essential to the plot of the story rather than just a meaningless writer who happens to be narrating the story. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is vivid and imaginative...for kids.

The books take a year in the Hogwarts School but take at least two years to write and the movies take two also. That means Daniel Radcliffe age 12 in the first film was supposed to be 11. He was 14 in the second film and supposed to be 12. He was 16 in the third and supposed to be 13. As you can see the discrepancy in ages will eventually doom Daniel Radcliffe in his role. If there are four more films, he will be in only one more if that many.

A paint-by-numbers Tim Burton knock-off, when even the originals are pretty debased coinage these days, obviously made solely to milk the Harry Potter cash-cow.Anyone expecting this not to be a Jim Carrey movie will be disappointed. Count Olaf is a re-run of most of his comedy riffs from The Mask and Batman Forever - lots of hand-wringing, chest-hugging, grimacing and lip-licking, and the first entrance down the mansion staircase seemed a note for note lift from his entrance as the full-tilt loony Riddler. Meryl Streep is terrible - but then, when wasn't she? Billy Connolly is a British National Treasure (tm) but he's never been a great actor and gives the worst kind of patronising bedtime-story voice performance I think I've ever seen.

174,TonysLittleFriend,I Was Very Concerned...,7,10 January 2005,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***The movie follows three wounded but intelligent orphans who lost their parents in a fire and are forced to ricochet from home to home as their dastardly distant relative Count Olaf schemes to make their lives miserable and steal their inheritance. The story is composed of three books in the series by Daniel Handler, whose pen name is Lemony Snicket. An ingenious opening animated sequence rushes the audience through a sick-sweet forest of happy little elves, then Jude Law's narration as Snicket kicks in, warning the audience that if they want to see a happy movie they're in the wrong theater. Then he introduces us to the sad orphans: Violet, the eldest, who improvises inventions; Klaus a bookwormish know-it-all; and baby Sunny, who . . . bites things. Hard. Even though the trio is weak, small and callow, the children work so well as a team you wouldn't want to mess with them. Tell that to Olaf, the first guardian of the kids, who turns them into servants in his rancid mansion while he schemes to have them killed to get his hands on their inheritance. Olaf, a bundle of sneers, exaggerated facial contortion and gleeful evil, is the type of ham sandwich Carrey loves to chomp and smack. His insidiously comic battles with the orphans provide the movie's greatest joys. Olaf dons a variety of disguises to stalk the kids once they escape to the care of the eccentric, oblivious Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine. The movie is empowering to kids because of its depiction of comically stoogish adults, who are no match for the heroic, resourceful young'uns.My expectations of this film were simply another Harry Potter type movie. And during the film's opening credits, I was ""very concerned"" that I entered the wrong. Thankfully, due to Lemony Snicket's following narration, stating that if you want a nice kiddie flick, your in the wrong theater. Then things got better. The film is very dark and is perfect anyone of any age.Jim Carrey is effective as the evil Uncle Olaf. The children in the flick are equally great as well as Meryl Streep. The film is a very dark, moody, weird ride. And an entertaining one at that. I was pleasantly surprised by it, and is better than those Harry Potter films.

My friend put it on at my birthday party telling me that it was a great movie. Well, it wasn't good at all. It was boring, stupid, and had no plot. It was a painful movie to watch. It only kept my full attention for like five minutes. The acting as well as the storyline were terrible. There was no humor, no action, nothing remotely exciting about this movie. The characters were dull and boring and had no depth to them whatsoever. After about an hour of the movie I started having a conversation with my friend who didn't like the movie as well. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie, you'll be sorry if you do.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
176,standardbearer,What the hell was this about?,2,3 December 2007,"When I saw the very first trailer, I was already sure that this film wasn't going to be one of my all time favorites. I went into the movie with rather low expectations, but still i came out totally disappointed.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a raging fan of the original books, to be honest I've never read one... I don't even who who the hell this Lemony Snicket is (and after watching this movie, i don't even care)!So, I'm not saying that it is a bad adaptation, I'm saying it is a BAD FILM. Right after the film boosts off, we can hear the gentle voice of Jude Law whining annoyingly about some kids, we don't even know yet. You better get used to this whining, because mostly that is gonna be what you hear during the rest of the movie. Then we finally meet those kids. Two little boys, a bit elder sister, with their mommy and daddy. Mom and dad dies right away, so the kids dig up their relatives all around the world, and ask them, to take care of them children. All of them answer ""Yes! Gladly!"", but the evil Count Olaf kills them one by one, to get his hands on the kids' legacy. Just when this monotonous method gets very tedious, the movie ends, and you can watch some very well made cartoon end credits (surely they wanted to make up for the rest of the movie).What the hell was this all about??? Who the hell were those kids, and why should we, or that Lemony Sicket guy care about them? And who the hell is Lemony Snicket, and why is it necessary for him to whine during the whole movie? Why should I sit through a movie, which has NO ENDING?This movie is a miserable attempt to ride the waves of the adaptation-frenzy.That's it. And the most unfortunate event about this movie, is that it succeeded somehow. I could tolerate all the stupidity, and dumbness in the movie versions of Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter, but in this case they failed to put together a standalone movie.Even more unfortunate, that some of the staff really tried. Techincally, the film looks marvelous. The costumes, the scenery, the colors, they all come together really well, and we can see the hard work in it (I don't understand though, why a story with basically NO wondrous elements should get a so out-of-this-world scenery). I feel pity for this group of the filmmakers, for having to take part in a mess like this. They deserve better. Better than the director, the writer, and the main actor in this movie. Yes, I'm talking about Jim Carrey.I can't see why most people melts down from the performance he does here. It's hysterical. Count Olaf in Carrey's role is a raging idiot, with no real character, and a stupid fake beard.As far as I know, there's no attempt to make a sequel, so this movie remains a torso forever. A money-monging pile of crap. But if a sequel comes around soon, I'm sure it wouldn't be more either than an attempt to feed some fat producer.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
177,mcgriswald,Jim Carrey's tour de force,10,27 January 2007,"There is definitely going to be a difference of opinion on this film, as it strays from the book similar to the Harry Potter movies, but as a stand alone film, I thought it was a work of art.Jim Carrey is one of the greatest muggers in the world, but unfortunately, since ""Living Color"", his talent has been wasted on crap like Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber. In Series of Unfortunate Events, Carrey hits his stride, playing three different characters with perfect pitch.No doubt that Carrey will continue making ""straight"" films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but his strength will always lie in his incredible ability to wrap himself in bizarre personas like Count Olaf. He absolutely knocks it dead, from the vocal inflections to the posture and the hand motions.Carrey's bit as as the old salt absolutely cracks me up, particularly when he spouts phrases like ""He's just a young lad, still in his Oshkosh B'gosh!""--when the kids play the DVD in the car while I am driving I love to listen to the dialog.Its a shame the movie wasn't the blockbuster the studio anticipated, I would have loved to see Carrey carry this franchise for years to come.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
178,FilmWiz,A Series of Unfortunate Events is just that,6,26 December 2004,"Okay, perhaps that is more than it deserved, but hey, it got you to read this, right?I have not read the books, and I do not plan to in the near future. The fact that this film had star power did not mean anything, as Jim Carrey was in a role that no one would ever dream he would be in- the menacing bad guy.But the film itself isn't too bad, and one can enjoy it, even without young children, and as a film that can take your imagination someplace else,. I'm not saying that I particularly enjoyed that other place, but it was fun to be inside.The film starts and we realize that three children, Violet, Klaus and Sunny lost their parents due to a house fire. Sunny is a tiny little infant, and the other two seemingly are within the stages of puberty. Each has his distinct characteristic. Violet is the inventor, and can think her way through any problem using available resources. Klaus is a very avid reader and retains the information he reads from books. Sunny, however is not intellectual as of yet, and her power is the ability to well, bite. She can bite through practically anything, including wood tables.The series of unfortunate events begin with the death of the parents. That begins the domino effect. The children are taken to Count Olaf, their third cousin four times removed, (or is it their forth cousin three times removed?) apparently their closest relative living, who they never heard of before. He attempts to kill them and there they learn that he is a monster (He's such a Shmuck!!, as Sunny bluntly proclaims in translated babble talk), who is only after them for their money. After yet another series of events, the government takes him from there and the children live at Uncle Monty's (Billy Connelly) house, but who should appear there than Count Olaf, posing as someone else. And so on and so forth throughout the rest of the film. Even those who have not read the books (such as myself) could easily predict the upcoming ""unfortunate"" events. While there was something sorely missing from the plot, namely any sort of suspense buildup, the film was wonderful to look at, with eye candy all around. The film had the feel of a computer-animated movie, and it was fascinating to watch all of the dazzling special effects, even if the film itself left stuff to be desired.It occurred to me, while watching the film, that I was being engrossed with a Harry Potter like film. However, after reading claims that the books were much more symbolic and filled with room for interpretation, I may just as well take it upon me to begin reading all thirteen (eleven as of now) of the books. That is of course, after I am done with all of the other books I have on my plate.Overall, the film was a very entertaining way to spend two hours. A quick survey at the end of the theater calculated that fans of the first three books were not disappointed.MPAA rating: PG for thematic elements, scary situations and brief languageMy Rating: 6 and up 6.5 out of 10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
179,POG-2,Some good scenes don't make a good movie!,6,2 November 2005,"My perception of the film may be influenced by the fact that I watched it on DVD and on my computer, so I have to admit the experience can't be compared to the being in a movie theatre. I was quite curious about it because I read about it before and it was compared to Harry Potter. This is my take on it. I did like quite a few scenes and the costumes and special effects are well done, too, but at the end I just felt that everything fell apart - there's no unity to all those scenes, there's no unifying vision to it. It's a shame really because I liked the basic idea. I've never really felt like this about a film: I liked some characters, I liked some scenes, ... Jim Carrey is as you would expect him to be - which is a bit over the top and he's counterbalanced by the matter-of-factness of the kids. The music was good. Aunt Josephine was good. ... but it's just not really a good film. In fact, I wonder: is it finished? It's like cooking: even with the best ingredients you won't get good food if something goes wrong with the cooking.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
180,jaakkochan,Top Visual Movie of 2004,8,7 May 2005,"I was heading back from Japan in flight of SAS when I caught this movie in front of my eyes. I previously saw brief trailer of this movie in cinema in Japan and had a nice impression about it. I was stunned about this epic, parallel reality context the movie had. Its kind of interesting since the movie's world is partly like caught from 50's rainy London and part of fantasy novel of Lovecraft. Another thing that left me gasp my breath was the eyes dropping visuals. Its just amazing - the foggy lakes, crimson skies and structures. Amazing scene of the building built on the gorge is quite unforgettable - it has a great pace, and immersion. Most of the acting is very good, especially Meryl Streep's and the Emily Browning's performances. This is my first time to see Emily Browning, although she acted in Ghost Ship which I don't really remember well. The movie's got humor and a nice pace. Generally the story is very good although the final solution of the movie leaves me a little cold. The great design of the movie peak up in the ending titles - the movie has most wonderfully designed ending titles there is. I'm graphic designer myself and I was really inspired by these wonderful designs and animations the end titles show. Also the soundtrack the movie has is generally wonderful and gets best in the end titles. Jim Carrey is good as Count Olaf and I suppose Timothy Spall fits well to the role of Mr. Poe. Billy Connolly acts as Uncle Monty, but I wish a bit more from his performance. I gave eight for this movie. I recommend!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
181,meako1973,Lemony goodness,9,17 October 2006,"After the success of Harry Potter, the film industry began snapping up the rights to every book on the shelves in bookstore's kids section. One such series of books were these quirky little tales about some unlucky kids, written my the mysterious Lemony Snicket. Each of these books is very short, taking a mature reader only an hour to read, but the tale they tell is one which isn't quite the traditional kids story.When their parents pass away in a terrible fire (the first of the unfortunate events to befall them), the three Baudervile orphans, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, are left the fortune their parents owned. However they can only get it when Violet, the eldest, turns 18. Until then they must remain in care of a relative, which is how they come to be in the care of the disturbing, scheming, and murderous Count Olaf. However will the poor children survive their ordeal? Based on the first 3 books in the series, the film is cast perfectly, portrayed quirkily perfect, and adapted deftly. Whereas the Harry Potter books lost some of the impact on the screen, here the reverse occurs. The book are very visual in their depictions of scenes, and they convey brilliantly on screen. Producer Barry Sonnenfield, who masterminded the gothically comic Addams Family films has had some influence over the look and feel of the film, which retains the same otherworldly feel that those comedies had. From Olaf's decrepit mansion, to the vast lake at sunset, each setting is beautifully twisted from the pages of the book.All of this is assisted by some stunning casting. Jim Carrey seems to have been let off the lease totally in his role as Olaf, and many of his lines do not exist in the book, but fit the cunning devil totally. Meryl Steep is given chance to shine in a small role as another 'relative', as is Billy Connelly. Even Dustin Hoffman turns up for a brief moment in the film, as it seems that everyone had been clawing to get into this film. The children, unlike those in Potter, not only look the part, but actually convince in their roles. Even the youngest (Sunny), who was played by two children, avoids the 'saccarine cute' and captures a quirky toddler aspect last seen in Addams Family Values. However, it is Carrey who steals all the best lines, and scenes, in the film, overshadowing the other stars in the same way that the dastardly Count overshadows everyone else in the book.All this is wrapped up with a voice-over, and occasional cut to, a shadowy Lemony Snicket, the mysterious investigator who brings us all these terrible tales (voiced by Jude Law). Telling us many times to leave if we want a pleasant story, he sets the atmosphere well, and some nice tricks are used throughout his story-telling. One nice trick which is sort-of adapted from the books is to provide subtitles for Sunny's random shrieks and gurgles (in the book we are offered suggested translations.) As a recent reader of the books, the tale was fresh in my mind when I went in, and I knew what I wanted to see. Although the story has been flipped about a bit, and a few tweaks made to tuck it together, the look, feel, sounds, and essential ingredients of the story are all perfect. This is a wonderfully quirky family film which should introduce a lot of people to the strangely quirky books. I only hope for the rest of the tales to follow to the big screen over the next few years.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The very beginning of the movie really did surprise me because having a child-oriented animation as the introduction seems not to be common. I actually was supposed not to push through with the movie after seeing it, but for a while, I then realized it was just a technique used by the director.The title 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' really does fit the film, but seems to be so literal.The movie was excellent though the main theme of having children adapted was not that unique. What makes it different is that a series of unfortunate events really did happen to the lives of the two, and unlike other films, those unfortunate events that happened seemed to be fantasy and not much dramatic.The effects used and the idea of the producer in solving mysteries was very very good. The effects seemed to be realistic and the way they solved mysteries was perplex and I enjoy it.The ending was good.

The story really doesn't go anywhere and the ending not only leaves something to be desired - it doesn't even have an ending. There's no continuity, the characters aren't exactly believable, and Jim Carrey can only do so much.

186,slofstra,"The alchemy is impressive, but the elements don't come together",5,24 May 2005,"Jim Carrey's portrayal of the incorrigibly evil Count Olaf, in itself, makes this movie worth watching. And the sets and props are intoxicating eye candy. However, I found myself getting quite restless at times, mostly because the story is just not that good. Not even close to Harry Potter, even though the execution of this movie is of a much higher standard. The movie also seems confused as to genre. Was I supposed to empathize with the child characters, or revel in how bad Olaf was making things for them? As an adult viewer I was pulled in both directions (well, okay, I probably rooted more for Olaf). The sets indicate a 'film noir' atmosphere, and Olaf's villainy is very humorous, but also very black. All this probably runs over the heads of much of the target audience, which I think would be pre-teens of age 12 to 16. Running at odds with the dark tones of the movie are the various crises which are resolved using tricks that are reminiscent of an episode of McGiver. Further confusing the mix is the funny, callous and sudden way in which first the parents and later, the guardians, die, making it hard to feel too sorry for the three children. This would all be fine if the movie tried only to be campy, but it does try, at times, to create pathos around the children, using a lot of close-ups, cute baby sequences, and showing them camping in a little tent with a seemingly touching cameo of their parents. Thus, the movie becomes a strange melange of bleak Dickensian orphan narrative, black humour, and 'Inspector Gadget' tricks, leaving this viewer's emotions somewhat confused. Incidentally, this movie is much too callous for younger children. The darkly humorous approach to the deaths of the guardians, and the lack of any display of grief for the victims, requires a fairly high level of sophistication to detect the irony and humour involved. (Which older children may very well possess in spades; discretion advised).",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I've always thought Liam Aiken should have a lead role in a film. Emily Browning, though only a teenager, is seductively beautiful. Both their characters, as well as the younger sibling, are very bright and resourceful. It's a trait I, as a teacher, enjoy seeing in kids.The artwork, cinematography, and directing were superior. It was beautiful, but delightfully creepy. The plot started a bit slow and tedious, but became more intriguing.Jim Carrey was a bit over-the-top as Olaf. But then, that's Jim Carrey.

There were Lemony Snicket's drinks, Lunchables, Happy Meal Toys, regular toys, and so on. It disgusted me. Now, many months later, I caved in to see it at the local second-run theater (Bless it) and I had one heck of a good time. ""Lemony Snicket's ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"""" is a surprisingly great film! The film is told from the perspective of Lemony Snicket, a journalist assigned to chronicle the unfortunate lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. The three children were orphaned by a mysterious fire and immediately sent to live with Count Olaf, who is either their third cousin four times removed or their fourth cousin three times removed. Whatever the relation, Olaf is as bad a guardian as he is an actor (he's notorious around town as the worst actor anyone has ever seen). Olaf plans to kill the children and take the family fortune, unaware of the legal loopholes that prevent such a plan from working.The kids use their talents to overcome Olaf's dastardly plots. Violet is an inventor, Klaus is a know-it-all book worm, and Sunny is a teething infant with a strong bite. Together, their talents allow them to overcome anything.Jim Carrey makes Olaf one of the most flamboyantly evil villains of recent years, and one of the most fun. Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, and Kara and Shelby Hoffman as the three Baudeliare kids are superb. Aiken and Browning give mature performances, and the Hoffman twins are hilarious as the biting baby. Meryl Streep turns in a funny performance as Aunt Josephine, who is afraid of being killed by her every earthly possession.While it is uneven in spots, ""Lemony Snicket's"" is undoubtedly fun.

He was convincing as to be eccentric and humorous while being deceitful and evil at the same time.As for the rest of the performers, the kids (even the chomping baby) were quite good in their roles, portraying the stark contrast to the ridiculously and sadly inept adults who seem to be blind to common sense. What was disappointing, though, was the overall scale of the movie; in the end, I was left with that sour feeling of ""That's it?

I was not impressed with Jim Carrey as Count Olaf, just something didn't sit right, he was trying to be funny and evil at the same time and should have stuck to evil.

While the writing style is quaint, I find the storyline is repetitive and infantile. I know they're children's books, but so are the Harry Potter series, and I enjoyed those immensely.The movie is a cobbled together pile of crap that completely rewrites the story to the point where it bears little resemblance to the books. The events that ARE in the book are told out of order and completely twisted until it no longer the same story at all.This isn't necessarily a bad thing, given the puerile storyline in the books, but it certainly is no better. In fact, I'd have to say actually a bit worse.The characters are fairly true and relatively well cast, as was uncle Monty. Jim Carey, who I actually like, looked the part but tried to steal the show.

192,terrors89,"Gloomy, gloomy, gloomy.",5,25 April 2005,"This is an incredibly gloomy movie and I for one am not sure it's a children's movie even though when I went during the day, the majority of the audience was children. From the previews I thought this would be a dark comedy. Well I was half right, it was dark but I did not laugh a lot. The movie is based off of famous children's books written by Daniel Handler. I have never read the books so I don't know how close the movie follows the books however, after watching the movie it would appear that the books do not transfer well on to film.The premise of the story is that three children whose parents are killed in a mysterious fire are turned over to their cousin, an actor, named Count Olaf, played by Jim Carrey (Bruce Almighty.) Olaf does not hide the fact that he is trying to get rid of the children in order to inherit the enormous wealth left over by their parents. After trying to get them killed in a car  train ""accident"", the kids get transferred to another relative, an Uncle Monty, played by Billy Connolly (The Last Samurai). However his is killed by Count Olaf who is disguised as a scientist. The kids are then turned over to their Aunt, Josephine, played by Meryl Streep (The Manchurian Candidate.) Yes, you guessed she too is also killed by Count Olaf. The climatic scene of the movie is when Olaf discovers that if he marries the oldest of the three children, Violet, played by Emily Browning (Ned Kelly, Darkness Falls,) who is fourteen years old. So he sets up a play in which he will marry Violet while all those around think the wedding is not real. See what I mean, dark, but not very funny.I would like to give kudos to the director, Brad Siberling, who has also directed City of Angeles. Who did a nice job of mixing in the narrator of the story Lemony Snicket, voiced by Jude Law (Every movie that came out this year,) in such a way that helped explain the story. The acting was nice, but since all of the adult characters were written over the top, especially Count Olaf, that I did not find any of them enjoyable. I feel Carrey did the best he could with the role of Count Olaf but it appears to be such a difficult role that I don't know if anybody could have pulled it off. I would have liked to have seen Robin Williams in the part. The two child actors, Emily Browning and Liam Aiken (Road to Perdition), who played the middle child Klaus, were quite enjoyable.From what I have been told, the movie stays pretty close to the books, so if you like the books, by all means go see the movie. If you haven't, I think there are better movies out there.*This review and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com",A Series of Unfortunate Events
193,Boris_Day,Much better than expected,7,14 December 2004,"In the wake of Harry Potter the popular Lemony Snicket books have been rushed into production and considering the less than promising prospect of Brad Silberling directing and Jim Carrey starring, I didn't really hold out much hope. It turns out that the film is surprisingly good and apart from The Incredibles this was the only big budget Hollywood film I truly enjoyed this year.Like Harry Potter, the Lemony Snicket books appeal to adults as well as to children but they are darker, funnier and more eccentric, making them more of a cult than the mainstream success of the Harry Potter series.If you've read the books, you may miss the clever word play and you may feel that the two older children are miscast. Unlike in the books, the boy doesn't come across as particularly brainy and the girl looks just a bit too sexy as Violet, reminiscent of a teenage Anjelina Jolie. Still they are better than some of the child actors in the Harry Potter series.On a visual level the film is simply stunning. True, some of it is reminiscent of Tim Burton as both Burton and Daniel Handler are strongly influenced by the work of the writer and illustrator Edward Gor ey. The look of the film is a highly stylized mixture of Edwardian times and the 1950's and convincingly brings to life the parallel universe of the books, where death is ever present and where the whole world has conspired to make the Baudelaire children's life a misery.Folding books two and three into the storyline of the first one, the plot feels episodic but it stays consistently entertaining. Not being a Jim Carrey fan I was worried about his involvement (I still think Richard E. Grant would have been the perfect choice) but he nails and certainly looks the part of evil, failed thespian Count Olaf and thankfully he doesn't end up dominating the film, turning it into the Jim Carrey show.The section involving Meryl Streep's fearful Aunt Josephine is the best part of the film. Taking place against backdrops reminiscent of Masaki Kobayashi's stylish horror classic Kwaidan, Lake Lachrymose is as beautiful as it is nightmarish.

194,curtman2,Lemony and Snickering,7,1 February 2005,"Every so often, a film like ""Lemony Snicket's..."" comes along, a film of such uncanniness and bizarreness that it is ungeneric: partially delectable and visually sumptuous and partially lewd and abysmal; a torrential and primitive children's fantasy with aspects of low-brow perversity and shocking unconventionality; gorgeous eye candy with a bewildering and capricious premise. Featuring the manic, comic genius of Jim Carrey (the only familiar regularity in the film) appearing as several versions of himself through various titular ""events"", as a sinister and wily thespian seeking the fortune of the Baudelair family in plotting to ""kill"" the family's three surviving and of course, unfortunate children. Named ""Count Olaf"" (yet with several aliases), he instantly afflicts the poor children (who certainly deserve better) with dire, tiring labor, isolation, and fulmination. Through ""a series of unfortunate events"" described by the titular narrator (Jude Law) evoked by the children's evasions from Olaf and Olaf's pursuit of the children, the children are sent abound in an oblique, yet extravagant world of physical and visual aberrations (three-eyed frogs, uncorroborated house at the edge of cliffs, amiable serpents, dreary, discolored skies, etc.), and this is one strange, yet wholesomely delectable, adventure (if one could deem it as such). ""Lemony Snicket"" is a wildly imaginative, innovative, Tim Burton-esquire, bizarre, yet always sumptuous children's odyssey, featuring some welcome cameos from John Cleese as the zesty and amazon-bound Uncle Monty, Meryl Streep as the erratic and verbose Aunt Josephine, and others: watch for Catherine O'Hara, Luis Guzman, Jennifer Coolidge, and Dustin Hoffman. There's something about ""Lemony Snicket"" aside from its conspicuous barbarity that is unsettling: the solemn and unadulterated themes of death and tragedy immersed in a seemingly harmless children's tale can be received as exceptionally unseemly. The resolution itself is bizarre and torrential: the children's final escapade involves an obligated marriage between the girl and Count Olaf! ""Lemony Snicket"" is an audacious, vivacious, torrential, and unconventional revolution of the typical childish innocence of ""Harry Potter"", and weirdly enough, it's as whimsical as it is abysmal: perhaps the most enigmatic ""child's story"" I have ever experienced, and certainly entertaining in the bizarreness of its visual grandeur and comical disguise of thematic abjectness. *** out of ****",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The sets are great, the makeup is spot on, the script is well written, and the movie also has some creepy imagery, which was a cool thing to see. Jim Carrey as Count Olaf is very funny and entertaining. The cast all around give very good performances. My only flaws with the movie are the pacing can get a little off sometimes, and some of the CGI does look weird, but other than that, I find this movie to be a funny and entertaining movie. If you haven't watched Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, you should go and watch it.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
196,sackleywhistle,"Better than you think, dear reader...",8,25 August 2005,"I saw this blind, having only seen the trailer a couple of times almost a year ago. I was hard-pushed for a film to buy, so I got this.The most gorgeous film I have witnessed in some months. While there are many, many things to admire and enjoy in this film, the most striking aspect is the sumptuous production design and virtually seamless effects work. Every shot is crafted delicately and acutely to perfection and, without having read any of the Lemony Snicket books, you get a tangible sense of the Gothic grandeur which they undoubtedly contain. The design lends the film a very Burton-esquire air, though I fear that is selling the film short, as director Brad Silberling is becoming more confident with each film, defining his own niche in cinema. With his previous films Casper, City of Angels, Moonlight Mile and now this, his work holds together as musings on the impact of death on the living and, having dealt with a loved one's death himself, he is carving an auteur's body of work, balancing adult material and family films expertly.While there is indeed plenty for children to enjoy, not least Carrey's manic and hilarious performance(s) and the overall sense of awe, in many ways it is a children's film for adults, much in the same vein as Roald Dahl's books were bedtime stories adults would enjoy reading and indeed revisiting. This is aided by the uniformly wonderful and offbeat performances of all involved. Carrey, of course, is perfect as Olaf, hamming it up delightfully yet believing he is the world's finest actor. If I had one complaint, it would be that we simply don't see enough of his creations - I was enjoying his one-legged sea captain immensely, but he wasn't on screen long enough. The Baudelaire children are excellent, without a trace of mawkishness or Jake Lloyd-like discomfort. Emily Browning is surely set to become one of Hollywood's most beautiful young actresses and, unlike most of her peers, has talent to back up her looks. Liam Aiken also has a bright future ahead of him, holding his own against a stellar cast.And what a cast, full of famous and familiar faces, from mega-stars - the always reliable Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman - through well-known character actors such as Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly and Luis Guzman, to the cultish faves of Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge and Jane Adams. The cast is every bit as finely picked as those of the Harry Potter films, though frankly I would rather sit through one of these each year.While the story is by its nature episodic - the Lemony Snicket novels are very short and this film comprises three of them, each contributing about a half hour of screen time - events move at a fair pace and there is never any boredom thanks to the inventive, witty, often hilarious script. Add to this an interesting and very enjoyable score and some grand set pieces, as well as a mystery running through the film, and this is ideal family fare of the highest order. A sequel would be most welcome, though it seems doubtful at this stage whether we will receive one.Extra mention must be made of the credits and DVD. The end credits surpass even the recent Catch Me If You Can for inventiveness and sheer enjoyment, rounding off the tone of the film and the fantastic world it sets out for itself. You will find yourself watching right til the end of the main credits, just for the gorgeous animation. And for the 2-disc DVD, Dreamworks obviously set out to put Warners' Potter discs to shame, cramming them with pretty much anything you could want to know about the film - including a pair of very good commentaries and hours worth of making of material, highlights being the Jim Carrey featurette and the pieces on making an artificial version of Sunny, the baby. A must for die-hard DVD aficionados and first-rate viewing for the family.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
197,rockndaparadise,A Very Different Experience for Any Film-goer,6,28 December 2009,"This is a movie that was recommended to me by a friend of mine, who happens to be a huge Jim Carrey fan. Now, I am familiar with Jim Carrey, and I know the kinds of characters he plays in his movies. There are times when he is funny (""Bruce Almighty"" and ""Liar Liar""), and there are times when he is annoying (""Batman Forever"" and ""Cable Guy""), but this movie shows a completely different side of Jim that I've never known him to be. In this movie, he is not being Jim Carrey; he is playing an actual character, and his lines are all totally scripted, but still, his nature can still be spotted pretty easily. I was a little surprised to know that he actually played the villain in this movie. This isn't the first time Jim Carrey played a villain in a movie, but this was a pretty intense character for an actor like him. Now, I have nothing against Jim Carrey, but the character he plays just really disturbs me. There are a lot of movies where I can understand the motivations of both the protagonist and the antagonist, and in these films, I like to route for both sides. There are some villains like Cruella De Vil that I love to hate. I don't love to hate Count Olaf; I just hate him. This was a film where I seriously felt the antagonist deserved to die. He was that horrible. I had the same feelings towards the Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man movie. For all you Jim Carrey fans out there, before you start sending me any hate mail, let me just clarify this for you. I don't hate Jim Carrey, I hate Count Olaf. I gotta say, this movie was really, in my opinion, quite dark for a children's movie, let alone a Nickelodeon movie! I was practically freaked out by this movie the moment I popped the DVD into my DVD player and witnessed the creepiest looking DVD menu I've ever seen: a Tim Burton type of animated menu playing some very unfitting music. Please don't ask why I have these opinions; I just do, and it's really too difficult for me to analyze. So, anyway, if you're a hardcore fan of Jim Carrey, then I probably don't recommend this film for a viewing, but if you want to see a different side of him, then by all means, check it out.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I haven't read the books so I am not one of the people who would be upset at its closeness or otherwise to the books ideal. It was just a dull boring film. I liked the sets and I liked the children. When Carrey was off the screen it was a better experience. I watched until they were at Billy Connolly's house and then Carrey reappeared and I simply couldn't watch any more.It was totally implausible. Billy Connolly's character was so obviously a nice gentle friendly reasonable and intelligent person. The possibility that they couldn't immediately have told him that this new 'assistant' was in fact Count Olaf - was completely unbelievable. I have no idea if this plot disaster was from the book or not, but coupled with the appalling over acting of Carrey it was enough for us as a family to decide that the film was just too pathetic to watch any further.We had more interesting things to do. There was a newly painted wall in the other room we could more enjoyably watch as it dried. At least Matte Magnolia doesn't over act.I am so glad we didn't waste money as well as time on this turkey.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
201,Fred_Maxwell,Loved it!,9,10 September 2009,"For us, parents, used to the plain, simplistic and absolutely predictable (thus sometimes boring) moral code of the traditional children movies' story lines (as depicted for example in the Disney flicks pre-1995) this movie comes out as a true blessing. I have to admit that at the movie theater I was actually, shocked. Not only for how visually stunning this movie is, but mostly from not knowing if my 7 & 6 years old would be able to process the story. Afterwards -and I have to say for my surprise- I found out that my kids not only fairly well understood the nature of the drama that serves as the basement for the funny moments of the movie, but also began to ask interesting questions. Questions that in turn helped us as parents to openly talk about things that are not commonly discussed with 6 & 7 years old. I found out that the movie turned out to be a great opportunity for education about some dark, yet undeniable facts of life: evil, greed, not-trustable adults, indifference... And also about things that can help us overcome difficult situations: love, family, strength of character, companionship, trust in your own capacities and putting them to the service of those you love, logical reasoning, intelligence... The Baudelaire children are three siblings that after tragically loosing their parents happen to land in the hands of an evil relative (Count Olaf) who couldn't care less about the children's well-being and whose only real interest is to control the children's money. The Baudelaire kids despite their youth, come across surprisingly mature, realizing their real (and I would say even traumatic) situation and trying to overcome it in the best possible way by relying on each other and trusting in their own capacities and abilities. Not letting themselves down by all the nasty things that Count Olaf -and life in general- puts them through and learning how to defend themselves in order to survive. Some reviewers say that the books are way better than the movie. I haven't read any of the Lemony Snicket books yet. But IMO this is a great parent-children sort of movie. Plus the visual quality, the cinematic narrative, the characters realization, and the whole look of it are greatly, greatly achieved a will surely catch the young kids' eye (as well as teen's too!). A lot of interest angles to exploit and produce great lesson-sharing moments and talks. I highly recommend it. For those parents who disregard this movie as being too traumatic, or too ""heavy"", let me give you a word of advise: remember that in these days our post-modern society kids are constantly bombarded and exposed to visually stunning content (videogames, television, books, you name it)... Plus they get to live in a highly violent and aggressive sort of society. Thus for these visually ""advanced"" kids, living in an environment far from perfect, we parents need graphically attractive educational media and materials, with poignant and interesting stories that catch the attention of the young mind. Once this products come across, we concerned parents can magically appear and make a great educational moment out of virtually everything. This is definitely, one of those movies.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
202,Mystical_lonewolf,most awful film!,1,18 July 2012,"I can honestly say that without a doubt that this film sucked so bad. I remember the first time seeing this film, i actually, literally want to throw up. I'm not just saying it, i do literally felt like throwing up for real. I was told that this is like Harry Potter because of magic. Seriously? This film is not only dark, but sickening. It's supposed to be a children's book right? But Alas, it did say in the beginning that you shouldn't watch this film. Heed to its warning, it's really is the stupidest, worst film ever made.I never really liked Jim Carrey or his movies. The only film with him in that i may have liked and think is better was ""liar, liar."" After his role in this, i despise him and never again want to see any films he's in. He's not funny, he's not cool, and his role as a villain is just revolting! The children in this are unsympathetic. I can't sympathize them, i cannot connect with them.Apparently the story has no plot, it has nothing to show. It just has some characters it introduces and kills them off and in the end tries to compensate by making Jim Carrey's character suffer the same way. Seriously? That is pathetic! This deserves beyond the (1 out of 10) and it should be -10 billion. I'm just so glad they're not going to make a sequel.I would never recommend anyone this film, i would rather people just walk away from the film. Don't buy it, don't even rent it, it's really stupid and useless. The director and the creators of this film and the author needs to take a break and try something better than this crap.

204,Will_Scarlet,Too much Carrey.,7,18 February 2005,"""This film's perfection is only added to by presence of the great Jim Carrey. His screen time gives a movie, made from a series of perfect books, a perfect movie."" I am sorry to say that this is NOT the sort of review you are going to be reading. The following review, dear reader, is somewhat critical of this movie, and of its leading actor, as well as the book series on which this film is based. So if, by any chance, you are the sort of person who enjoys reviews in which every aspect of this film, particularly the books it is based on and Jim Carrey, I am sure there are plenty of other reviews on this page that say just that. The film ulll-timately suffers the same problem numerous films about children suffer: the attention is simply in the wrong place. At least the Harry Potter films focused solely on the youngsters. Here, however, the young actors are, alas, only second. The majority of screen-time seems to be given to Jim Carrey, who, as in many of his films, hogs the spotlight, a phrase which here means ""tries again and again to be the center of attention."" By the time the end-credits roll on, I could not shake the feeling that these three endearing children have not quite invented, read, or bitten to their full potential, and a great many possibilities are lost in that way, which is extremely unfair for such talented actors as these three. It is extremely strange, now that I think about it, that Jim Carrey should be considered for this role. The Count Olaf of the books was comic, to be sure, but certainly not in the way Jim Carrey portrays him. The humor came solely from the character's wickedness. I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but villains in films or books can be very funny without even throwing a joke. For instance in The Wizard of Oz, the Wicked Witch of the West is a perfectly horrible woman, who still, to this day, causes audiences to burst into sadistic laughter. And like her, Count Olaf of the books is simply fun to hate. In the case of Jim Carrey's Olaf, however, it is entirely comic. Though I will admit he acts as well as usual, and any audience will have more than a few laughs over his jokes, he exudes no menace, no sense of terror or real wickedness, even when he slaps a young boy's face for no good reason. Even he, at times, seems unsure if he is playing a straight villain, or a humorous take on a villain. This is even worse for a young audience than many people would say a straight villain is. The story of the abused child is still a popular one among children. To this day, when I read such a book, like ""James and the Giant Peach,"" my heart goes out to the child when contrasted with the despicable adult, just as when I was young. But it was hard to feel for these children when they are in the clutches of such a funny man. Still, one cannot help but smirk at the fact that Mr. Carrey is playing what he actually is-an incredibly hammy actor. Jim Carrey behind us, let us take a moment to consider the rest of this movie. The three young people, as I said, are very talented. After a humorous, but somewhat unnecessary saccharine opening, the film truly takes off. Meryl Streep steals every one of her scenes as Aunt Josephine, even though she has less screen-time than the children. I did not truly care for the books. Well written and humorous though they were, I felt there was little point to them, and they soon became repetitive and somewhat predictable-the children find another guardian, Olaf finds them in another disguise, they foil him, he escapes, and they must move on because he disposed of their guardian in some way, with the author repeatedly apologizing for the sadness of the story. Occasionally, a point comes, but not too often. The film, however, does make a point. The point comes in the form of a letter at the end, followed the Narrator, well-played by Jude Law, concluding by telling us of the extraordinary will to carry on through an unjust world in which there is ""always something."" That is truly where the heart of the story lies, in the fact that these children, with only their skills and cooperation, feel they can make it. And in this respect, I am glad to say, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, is one of the most charming films I have yet to see.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
205,robertrosado,A fine family film.,8,1 January 2005,"I just love the holidays, don't you? It's the perfect opportunity to spend time with your family, curl up with a good book, get eaten by leeches, and sip on a cup of hot cocoa. It's the time when all of the Oscar hopefuls are released, a joyous occasion for a movie fan. It's also the part of the year when the Christmas movies come out. Usually, this is a good thing. Such classics as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" come to mind. This year, however, we were treated to ""Christmas with the Kranks"" and ""Surviving Christmas"". What do you mean these were bad movies?! Oh, yeah They were. Well, don't fret. After his touching 2002 drama, ""Moonlight Mile"", Brad Siberling works his magic once again in ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"", based on the collection of children's books by none other than Lemony Snicket.After their parents die in a fire, the wealthy Baudelaire children, Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken), and Sunny (Kara & Shelby Hoffman), are sent to live with their distant relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). Olaf is a flamboyant stage actor, and heads a troupe of oddball performers (Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Adams, Luis Guzman, Craig Ferguson, and Jamie Harris). What the children don't know is that their uncle Olaf is trying to off them, and steal the family fortune. What Olaf doesn't know, though, is that the Baudelaire children are junior geniuses. If they are ever going to get out of this alive, the children have to work together or else.When it comes down to it, whether or not you enjoy ""Lemony Snicket"" depends on your opinion of Jim Carrey (""The Truman Show""). In this film, he gives a comedic tour de force performance as the 'beloved' Count Olaf. Carrey surprised me, by proving that he can be quite scary. As the paranoid Aunt Josephine, Meryl Streep (""Adaptation"") adds another interesting character to her resume. She is funny without even trying to be, and bizarre beyond belief. With her performance in this film, Streep further proves my hunch that she can do anything. Billy Connolly (""Mrs. Brown"") is lovable as the herpetologist, Montgomery Montgomery. With very limited screen time, Connolly creates a character that the audience wants to see more of. Jude Law is amusing as the cautionary Lemony Snicket.I'd like to give kudos to Siberling for assembling a trio (er quartet) of impressive child actors. Emily Browning (""Ghost Ship"") is excellent as Violet, the inventor of the family. Browning carries the finale on her shoulders, and does it like a pro. Browning, an Australian, is a radiant beauty with a lot of talent. I have a feeling that she will be a star in the future. Don't forget, you heard it here first. Liam Aiken (""Stepmom"") is a bit weaker as Klaus, as he tries way too hard to convey his emotions. His earnest line deliveries are admirable, if not always successful. There is some potential here, though. I never would have guessed it from ""Stepmom"", but he is growing up to be a very handsome young man. The Hoffman sisters are adorable, and make hilarious noises at the appropriate times.If there is one fault in the film, it would be that there is a very minimal sense of danger. (Spoiler!) I knew that these kids would come out on top, and use their skills to defeat whatever problems got in their way. This left me at somewhat of a distance whenever they were in peril. When all was said and done, the film's good heart won me over. The final scene should come off as cliché, but it was sincere enough to win me over. Nevertheless, the film is very enjoyable, fast-paced, and well worth the $10. Some sequences are also truly twisted, involving snakes, trains, and the aforementioned leeches, and may or may not be too scary for children. I doubt it, though.The film comes off as very Tim Burton-ish, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It simply means that Siberling is trying to helm different types of projects, which is okay by me. The score, Carrey's kooky makeup design, and the art direction all combine to create an imaginative world that could have easily stepped out of a children's book. With it's threatening atmosphere and off-beat sense of humor, I guess you can safely call ""Lemony Snicket"" an anti-holiday film.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I have always been a huge fan of Jim's ever since The Mask and this movie really shows why. His amazing sense of humour and acting abilities are put to the ultimate test in Lemony Snicket's A series of unfortunate events.However he really pulls it off to a tee. Jim's facial and physical movements can be compared to that of Jerry Lewis. A true comedy actor. Well don't Jim.Young Emily Browning was amazing as Violet. She is definitely the next Nicole Kidman (Something I never thought I would hear myself say). She is somebody that as an Australian I am very proud of. She was brilliant in her role and she too was really really funny. I hope to see more of her in the future.Liam Aiken was wonderful as Klaus. He seemed to fit into the role smoothly and really gave it his all. An absolutely amazing performance definitely worth commending.Kara and Shelby Hoffman were great as Sunny. Sunny really was more of a central character than what one would expect. Sunny was an extremely funny element in the film.Other famous actors in the film included Meryl Streep, Jude Law, Billy Connolly, Catherine O'Hara and Dustin Hoffman.

They really captured the spirit of the book well through use of colour and placement in every scene.I have heard many people complaining about Jim Carrey being too funny as Count Olaf.

The books, while occasionally interesting, are clearly aimed at a very young audience, and are predictably paced. An adult can pretty much read the entire series in an afternoon.The movie, on the other hand picks and chooses the best episodes from the book series and blends them together into a passable story.

On top of it all, the movie is visually stunning, portraying a bleak, timeless landscape that is sometimes present-day and always retro in a ""Brazil"" or ""1984""-like way.Kudos to all involved with this production for taking very marginal source material and turning it into a real treat, including Jim Carey, who does his usual over-the-top performance.

It's a story about the Baudelaire orphans. The books, and the movie, begin with the orphans being told that their parents both died in a fire at their home, and that the kids are to be relocated to the closes relative. This is where the vicious Count Olaf steps in. Count Olaf, in the movie, is played by a restraint Jim Carrey. It's, for the most part, not the Carrey you know from movies like Ace Ventura or the Mask. It's a Carrey with restrictions and more ""into-the-depth-of-the-role"" type.It's a wonderful and funny story, and even if the books are written for both the young and adult audience, the movie itself is made for kids, mostly. It's sad, because the books have such a wide prospective, and aims for a broader group of people.. Carrey is, I am sorry to tell, not what he could and should have been in these movies.. In my view, Count Olaf is a much more sinister and ""evil"" character than Carrey provides..Other than that, a truly entertaining movie...but read the books first..the movie jumps rapidly between the stories, and without prior knowledge, this can be a bit confusing...ALSO...please stay put in the cinema until the end credits start rolling.. they are truly entertaining.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Would it help if I swore to you that this movie is hilarious! It is as long as you have a flavor for dark humor, or at least humor in less than good taste. If you like South Park, then this movie may be just what the movie doctor ordered. Now, in a nutshell the film is about the misfortunes of the Baudelaire children. The eldest Violet is the quick thinking leader and a very talented inventor. The second younger is Klaus, the all knowing know-it-all bookworm. The baby Sunny just likes to chew on things. They don't function independently, but instead corporate to achieve their goals and survive. They must, for they are being hunted by their evil distant relative Count Olaf. The details are extensive, and I would spoil the fun to reveal them. I will say that the screenplay of the film suffers from one important shortcoming, the fate of Count Olaf isn't explained. He is captured for his misgivings when he fails to marry Violet, but his escape is left solely to the imagination of the audience. I will also say that the events that lead to so much suffering and the solutions revealed in the plot are ingenious. The world of the story resembles a dark netherworld reminiscent of Myst. I would consider the performance of the cast to be believable and dramatic, but for the screenwriter only allowing the children a statement or two per scene. The performance of Jim Carry is quite excessive, but it complements the character Olaf positively. I see great potential for any sequels. The film is overall quite excellent, I give it a 9 out of 10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Don't know if I had an advantage or not. This movie kept my interest to some extent with the cool graphics reminiscent of Edward Gory, and the music, and the acting by the youngest of the Beaudelaire's (who I thought stole the show from all the others, including Mr. Carrey). I really didn't enjoy watching Jim Carrey in this. I think he has done better recently (Spotless Mind, Truman Show) and this role was a fallback to his other goofy stuff, which I don't like too much. I might have given this movie a 7 if it weren't for this, in fact. Oh well. Music was excellent, credits at the end were great. Other than that, rather humdrum...",A Series of Unfortunate Events
216,tim-vanlaere,Bad caricature,6,20 December 2015,"This movie isn't much more as an American caricature of good European movies and literature or culture. That's why it is so bad..You have the Wes Anderson universe and story-telling but it didn't really work. The Harry Potter universe (but with a certain feel of unauthentic-ness. Like made in China gucci.) and a sense of Tim Burton without the effort. Or a bit of Baz Luhrmann. But it doesn't feel honest or authentic. Which is a shame because of the great potential.Is it because of bad propping (manifacturing a scene instead of using existing locations ?) ? Is it because of the distance from English (Harry Potter) culture and literature ? Or trying to make a certain movie without a identity? I cannot say. I just can say that halfway in I see fragments of style of different directors, don't feel anything in relation to the children, don't feel like I know the children (other as narration you don't know them or get to know much about them. They seem without personality), and the cliché characters seem a caricature and unauthentic.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
217,theantigaz,Dark but compelling fantasy adventure,8,1 January 2005,"Having read none of the Lemony Snickett books, I was unsure of what to expect from this film.The film begins with a gentle introduction that quickly turns into a humorous, but noteworthy, disclaimer that the following film has dark underlying themes. The main characters are introduced (the three children) and almost instantly we are subjected to the news of the first in a series, or unfortunate events. The film is fast paced and sends the children from one unfortunate situation to another, with Jude Law doing a splendid job of narrating the story along the way. The children a likable and resourceful characters with good chemistry between the actors. You genuinely feel they care about each other and have a great desire to help each other out of these incredible situations.The real star of the show of course is Jim Carrey. This film provides the perfect platform for Mr Carrey to do what he does best, goof around and play over the top and outlandish characters. In this role Jim Carrey excels, never goofing off to much to undermine the credibility of the character, but being suitably over the top to convey the eccentric old count.Visually, the film is stunning, the sets look straight out of a Tim Burton film, the costumes are fantastic, the direction is splendid and does a fine job of progressing the story. The visual effects are tremendous and fit in with the tale perfectly, never distracting nor undermining.This film is quite dark for a children's film, but not dark in a sinister way, but dark in a spooky hallowe'en sort of way that kids love. Watching the film reminded me of reading Rhoal Dahl books as a child, with the over the top characters and out of this world situations.The plot of the film is fast paced, but contains good character development and plenty of action and adventure. I would recommend this film to children and adults alike.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
218,Azrael269,What's your target audience lads?,5,19 September 2006,"When an inexplicable fire burns down the house of three wealthy and exceptional children, claiming the lives of their parents, they are forced to live with their uncle, a mean and bizarre actor who only seeks to claim their fortune as his own. The children must go through a series of events in order to move on with their lives and also keep the evil uncle at bay. This all, set in a beautiful, fairytale-like world, constitutes a fine watch for a Sunday evening. However, although the acting is very good (Jim Carrey at his finest, not to mention the hordes of brilliant Hollywood stars that make even a brief appearance in the film) and the basic idea seems to be in order, this film seems to fail to aim at a proper audience. It is too childish for adult taste, with fairytale scenery and a naivety surrounding, while at the same time, too deep and gruesome for children, with death and evilness being a prime point throughout. It thus becomes one of those films that you might enjoy but would hardly ever watch a second time.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

220,szekeong123,Fairly engaging,7,4 March 2005,"Marketed as a family-comedy, and starring comedy guru Jim Carrey, one may be made to believe that ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" is a typical starring vehicle for Carrey. Personally, I have not read the book and don't really know what to expect. However, I decided to give this film a shot since the book it was based on seems reputable, and the overall reviews recommend this film. Beside, I have always like Liam Aiken and thought Jim Carrey is an under-rated actor, even if he is an over-exposed celebrity.Though received top billing, and the marketing of this film is highly dependant on his star power, Jim Carrey is not the key character of this film. In fact, his role pretty much supporting. The real leading actors are Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, and the Hoffman sisters, playing Baudelaire siblings. Nonetheless, I do think that Jim Carrey gave the stood up performance. Equally impressive is Meryl Streep. The rest of the cast are fine.As for the film, it is a dark film with a few violent scenes. Certainly not as family-friendly as it may seem. Also, the film has a higher genre-weighting on drama than on comedy. At the beginning, the film sarcastically warn the audiences that this film is not going to be a fluffy fair, and the warning is, to an extent, for real. In fact, at the end, the film provoke guilt in audiences for watching light and airy films.Thanks to my low expectation, I wasn't too bothered by these genre conflicts. It is well-crafted and moderately entertaining. It is not highly accessible though.To Dustin Hoffman's fans: His cameo appearance is very brief. So brief that he is barely noticeable.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
221,RMFendt,Burtonesque,9,5 November 2005,"Well, I have to admit I have not read the books (yet). At first I was pleasantly surprised by this film, towards the end I was in love. The whole film is strange, the characters are total wackos, and the whole thing is just-- beautiful. As a devoted Burton-worshiper I can tell you: this movie could have been a 'Burton'. Great costumes, brilliant actors, and just this ""not too real"" touch that makes Tim's films so special.Especially Carrey really shines here. Unfortunately he did not do too many real film gems in the past, which is a real shame, since in my opinion he is a great actor. But apart from the ""Truman Show"" and the ""Grinch"" (and maybe ""Liar Liar"") he could just never show it. Come on, who would think ""Ace Ventura"" or ""Bruce Almighty"" icons of film history? I certainly do not. But in ""Lemony Snicket"" he is simply brilliant.Glorifying Carrey does not mean that we see bad acting by the rest of the cast. I especially liked Connolly's and Streep's characters. Even the youngsters Liam Aiken and Emily Browning deliver good to excellent performances. We should especially expect much yet from the adorable (and talented) Browning. Though the film's pace slows down a bit at times, this is deliberate and it never ""drags on"".

222,madscientist2787,Cute little kid's film,3,12 December 2005,"Jim Carrey plays a nefarious villain here who is out to cheat a trio of extraordinary orphans out of their inheritance. Carrey swallows massive amounts of scenery as Count Olaf (think of Snidely Whiplash crossed with Doc from Back to the Future) and there are some fun cameos from Billy Connoly, Meryl Streep, and (briefly) Dustin Hoffman. Fortunatley, the child actors aren't too horrible in this movie either.For its intended audience - kids who are a little young for Harry Potter but starting to outgrow all that Disney singing lobster crap - this should be a lot of fun. The Tim Burtonesque decor ought to delight 'tweens who regularly shop at Hot Topic, too. As for parents and older folks who are subjected to it, it should be an enjoyable throwaway experience. It's not a subversive family film masterpiece like The Iron Giant, but it's a nice-looking film with a few chuckles to be had.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
223,Citizen_Cam,Odd. Very Odd.,6,28 March 2005,"Children these days are obviously harder to scare and prefer their stories edgier and bleaker than they did in my day (Ooh, me back, etc). The story of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is incredibly bleak - the title gives it justice. The three Beaudelaire children, teenage inventor Violet (Actor), bookworm Klaus (Actor) and infant Sunny (a biter) are orphaned when their wealthy parents die in a fire. They are brought by banker Poe (Timothy Spall) into the custody of their 'closest relative' the bizarre actor Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), who proceeds to treat them like dirt before trying to kill them to get their parents fortune. They spend the rest of the movie with other unknown relatives (at one point Klaus says ""isn't it strange that none of our relatives are related to us?"") such as snake-handler Billy Connolly, who is totally wasted here, and paranoid Meryl Streep, who makes a fine fist of a peculiar role. All the time, of course, Count Olaf is coming for them in a variety of guises, threatening them and murdering (yes, murdering) other characters to get to them. The whole narrative is told through mysterious, silhouetted writer Lemony Snicket (Jude Law). A Series of Unfortunate Events is a very dark and bleak film. Bad stuff just keeps on happening to these poor kids with nary a respite. It didn't seem to me particularly appropriate to children, but as I said I'm not a kid anymore. I felt very old watching it; I was suddenly aware, at the age of twenty-one, that I am clearly no longer a kid. I had a similar reaction to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The movie, despite Carrey's presence, is not really a comedy, not designed to be funny. There are some laughs, coming mostly out of Carrey's character and the young Sunny, who speaks only in subtitles, but mostly it's a serious, twisted story about some extremely unfortunate kids and a series of unfortunate events. The film looks amazing, with a distinct, almost Gothic atmosphere. Ostensibly set in the present day, the background is constantly shifting around through what looks the like Victorian-era, a sort of Jules Verne quality. And then we have modern cars. But all of this is done very well; it is a beautifully designed film and very easy on the eyes, despite a singular lack of colour in many scenes. A note about Jim Carrey. He has had a distinguished but uneven career playing basically the same role - the wacky, eccentric, limb-flailing role he began in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective a decade ago. He repeats this performance in a dozen films, like Liar Liar and of course, The Grinch. And he repeats it here. Only this time, he plays a villain, the first time I have seen this. It is essentially the same role with a dark, sinister edge and he handles it very well. He is, however, walking through the role. This sort of performance is so known to him he is breezing through the movie, basically counting his fee. I haven't read the original books, but one of my companions had and he told me it was close enough to pass muster, though events were jumbled around somewhat. And the script does look like it is three separate stories linked together, which it is. But that's not my major concern. The film is not particularly remarkable, and quite disturbingly bleak. That is possibly a virtue today, but I found it tough to get through: bleakness doesn't interest me, that's why I'm no poet. What's the matter with kids today? Now, excuse me, I have to go watch Matlock. Good-o-meter rating: 6.5/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events

This is a movie where you don't care about the special effects, even though they exist somewhere.

One scene of the movie excited the most my imagination. It made me wonder how it would be like if snakes were friendly cuddling and even furry animals.

He'd read the books, I hadn't and still haven't, most likely won't ever, because I've always preferred more adult literature. But I walked in as a HUGE Jim Carrey fan (as I still am today). The sets are are perfect, the music is playfully dark the tone is a weird mixture of depressing and hopeful, and I love it. Everyone is great in this movie, well almost everyone. Klaus is the only character that is difficult to watch because his actor is so inexpressive with his delivery that it just bores me whenever he talks, the movie also gave me my first crush, Emily Browning, who plays Violet Boudelaire, she's easily the best child actor in the film, often times giving the viewers a much needed break from Klaus' tedious indecisiveness. Another issue I have with this film is how fast-paced it is, it rushes through the books so fast that some plot points don't connect with the gravity they could've had the scene been given another ten to fifteen minutes. But Jim Carrey's hilarious antics, Meryl Streep's fun, if annoying performance and Bill Connolly's heartfelt and genuine tenure as Uncle Monty make for an entertaining watch. Going back to my story, we both (me and my friend) had a blast.

A capturing mystery begins to unfold, and rather creatively I must add, that puts everything together and answers all the confusion experienced in the first half.The baby is hilarious! If you're a big Jim Carrey fan, I'll tell you, his humor doesn't really shine here. If you can't stand him (like me) there's nothing to fear, his humor only really bothered me in the very beginning of the movie, but it wore off as the movie went on.I'll just say, if you like watching three kids go through a wild suspenseful adventure together, you'll love this! This isn't the little kids movie it may appear to be, it's rather dark and dreary.

Lemony has the feeling of a Tim Burton movie, but amped up about 500%. The scenery, costume and technology in this film is excellent, but above all it's use of all things phantasmagoric is brilliant. There is a huge element of technology in this movie. The two main plot movers are a spy glass and the diagram of an eye.I am tempted to say this is the most Gothic movie I have ever seen, in a style context, not a subculture. The actors are also brilliant, Jude Law has the perfect voice of narrator and I just loved Billy Connolly as the very lovable snake charming doctor.

The cast is fitting for their roles, you may be unfamiliar with most of them, but needless to say, they've got a fair amount of talent, and cameos from *WARNING!

I think they are amazingly boring and are waay to detailed, just my opinion, but I cant really think of what drove me to see the movie other then my friends saying it was adorable, and they were right. I enjoyed the movie very much in my home town theater with my Mom, my Mom didn't like it, but everyone is to their own opinion. I think Jim Carrey did a fantastic job as Count Olaf, I think he was perfect and extremely funny for the role of count Olaf.

And when the film started what i thought were my worst fears were already starting. I mean that happy little elf really does give you the wrong idea, and then the screeching sound like the end of a tape playing at the end of the little elf part. And all i remember after that sound was watching one of the best films this summer.Jim Carrey was awesome, you cannot fault him at all in this film, well you cant fault him in many of his films. Its just so good to see someone who cant act amazingly well and yet change their face so many times in one film that a some points you forget its Carrey. He played his part awesomely, and he did really overdo his part but i actually think that Count Olaf needed to be overdone, i mean one of my funniest scenes was when he had his acting party round and they were all asleep, then you suddenly hear, 'LETS go back to prehistoric times when dinosaurs ruled the earth' lol that was funny his actions were hilarious. but not just that scene every scene he seemed to do it ended in a laugh.Even the 3 little children were great, Violet whom I've only seen in Ghost ship did a remarkable job, she is an upcoming star i think, and then there's Clause who i would much rather like to see in a part such as Harry potter, just by seeing him in this film. He like the other 2 really did a grade A job at acting.The actual story was at times confusing, but even so it really was greatly directed and put together.So please whether you've read the books or not this film is awesome and should be watched by one and all, young and old.

233,punyerd,Nowhere near as funny as you'd want it to be,2,18 September 2021,"I'm known quite well for having a dark sense of humour. Those Doom/Mortal Kombat finishing moves (dubbed Fatalities in the latter), the Corto Maltese beach opening scene in The Suicide Squad (2021) and similar things all have me rolling on the floor laughing my head off. These sorts of things don't have to have extreme gore or other things that would disturb or haunt other people for weeks like the things above, and I also enjoy lighthearted stuff just as much.Recently, I realised I'd actually been cutting myself off from a whole subgenre of dark comedies: children's horror films. I don't know why I didn't realise this sooner. I recently rewatched Gremlins (it's been 9 years since I saw it for the first time in my youth) and I couldn't believe I'd forgotten how funny it was. And then it just hit me: what if there are other children's horror films that are just as funny when watching through the eyes of an adult, and simultaneously scare kids to death, like Gremlins did? And turns out, there are. Shortly after, I watched a few other children's horror films. These included Jaws, Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children and Coraline, which were all very funny and would definitely watch again for a laugh. Then I watched the theatrical cut of Little Shop Of Horrors for the first time, which wasn't that good. It actually had a happy ending, unlike the superior Director's Cut which I had previously seen countless times. But it was a lot better than this film, which I had watched after for a laugh. I ended up walking away disappointed and thought that it was a waste of time. Jim Carrey was wasted as much as he was in The Mask. I beg you, if you have black humour, do not watch this for a laugh. Don't watch it to scare your kids either, nothing about it will. Watch the couple of films I mentioned above instead.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The cinematography, acting, music, it was all so beautifully-made. I wasn't too sure on reading the books, but eventually did so - and I love them as well. Looking back on this adaptation, yes, it's not quite as perfect, seeing as how they tried to do the first three books into an hour-and-forty-minute film. And I would also realize that the scene in which - spoiler! - Count Olaf puts the children in peril on a set of train tracks never happened in the books, but I personally don't mind, because that addition was pretty awesome! But I still hold this in a special place in my heart, especially since it got me into the book series to begin with. Sunny playing with the Incredibly Deadly Viper is one of the cutest things I've ever seen! And the end credits, such wonderful animation and amazing score! This got me familiar with names like Meryl Streep, Emily Browning and Jude Law.Despite being a failed franchise, I'm glad that there's no Sequel Hook at the end, and it's left more open-ended, if not, hopeful.

Almost immediately into the movie, I began to wonder HOW this was supposed to be a film for children? I am horrified that it is supposed to be a great family film. I would not take children to see this film, nor would I encourage parents to go see it with their kids. The film is about a guy trying to get inheritance from three orphans by killing off the people who get custody of them and kill them too. The movie is very dark and depressing and there is NOTHING happy or upbeat about it. It is also hard to understand the plot (in my opinion). My sister is a fifth grade teacher and said these books are very popular with her class! I think this movie is terrible and would recommend for UPBEAT excitement, take the family to see Harry Potter (still not as family-friendly as The Little Mermaid but not as Prozac-worthy by far!)!

I don't really know any of the other actors (except Meryl Streep) but they all delivered a good performance. The special effect weren't to convincing at times but they weren't bad either.

I mean the story is good, thanks to Lemony Snicket's (Daniel Handler) books, the sets are great, Jim Carrey is more calm than usual (thank god!)and Meryl Streep is wonderful as always. But still something would still be missing. The first thing I would notice would be the music. Far from Tim Burton's long time collaborator Danny Elfman, Thomas Newman in this case delivers a straightforward score with nothing to be remembered by. And you look at Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, The Nightmare Before Christmas or the incredible Big Fish you start to see the difference. After all Brad Silberling is the same man who gave us the poor Casper and the remake of the Wim Wenders classic Wings of Desire called City of Angels, that was once again a watchable movie but far from Wender's genius.

239,working98,Much better than it's given credit for.,9,15 July 2006,"I have, intentionally not read anyone else' comments about this film. I'm writing as I see it, with an acknowledgement that this film's not terribly well received. It should also be noted that I have not read the books. I come to this film with few preconceived notions.That is, to my mind, a shame. The art design alone recommends this film as worthy of a viewing though that is with the agreement that it seems to owe a lot of its feel to the Gory/Burton school of aesthetics. Still it's lovely and about as lush as one can get outside of A Little Princess or Babe.The story is sweet without drifting into the land of cloying. Of particular note is Billy Connolly's turn as the greatest uncle in fiction. The themes of family and home are no strangers to American cinema but they're not overplayed here.Speaking of actors, that seems to be a strong problem with the film. American audiences, for all their love of the cult of personality do enjoy hating successful people and while I can't always argue with that, it seems that the casting of Jim Carey in this film was probably the single biggest mistake the producers made. While Carey is talented enough to do this, each appearance in his various guises reminds the viewer that Jim Carey is on the screen and he kind of overpowers the film. Were this done by an early career Carey, say around the time he did The Mask, this would have probably been a career maker. As it is, audiences seem to have grown weary of his rubber face and by and large gave this movie a pass due to him. Shame. He wasn't bad at all, just sort of uninspiring. A lesser known actor, perhaps someone like Bruce Campbell would have done this without so much falderal and it wouldn't have turned audiences away so easily.On the positive side of casting, the Baudelaire children are played magnificently by Emily Browning and Liam Aiken, two terribly beautiful young actors who should have tremendously successful careers as adults. The orphans are played with a calm certitude that contrasts perfectly with Carey's manic...Careyness and really sell the film admirably.All in all, this is a gorgeous movie and with the convincing performances given by the two leads (the kids...) it's a shame a sequel isn't in the offing to use them before they grow too old for the roles. As it is, I imagine the three years it has been place all of the children and especially the toddler, outside the proper range to play the Baudelaires again.Please give this film a try. It's excellent, gorgeous and intelligent and in everything it does it has so much heart. Truly terrific.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I originally got it for my son as I was under the impression that this would appeal to kids. In fact not so, my son went back to his room within 20 minutes of having it on.Jim Carey does a great job. His character is dark and over the top as the roll calls for. The kids also do a good job, they all play their characters well and the baby is very cute. The rest do fine, and the acting isn't the problem.It's the story, it is predictable beyond belief. Once you see where the story is going it's so straightforward that if you tried to write it, you probably wouldn't be far off what the author did.

241,kelc_mishthegreat_02,"Very good, could have been more",7,7 October 2007,"Based on the book series by Daniel Handler (aka, Lemony Snicket), this offbeat film follows the adventures of the three Baudelaire Orphans, after their parents are killed in a fire that destroys their mansion. They are taken by a delusional Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall) to live with their distant relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who turns out to be a creepy, self-obsessed, greedy pyromaniac who wants the Baudelaire fortune.Jim Carrey injects grim humour into Olaf and is hilarious with his theatre troupe (he is an actor)which consist of a few big names including Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Adams and Craig Fergson.The Baudelaire Orphans Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken) and Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman)deliver capable performances, particularly Emily Browning, a timeless young beauty who is able to carry the emotions of the siblings on her shoulders with credibility and maturity. Liam Aiken is also not bad, he's not woodenly but could show more emotion. With a little time and practice he could be quite good.Meryl Streep is highly entertaining as the paranoid Aunt Josephine and Billy Connoly is quite fatherly and touching Uncle Monty. Dustin Hoffman also steps in for a cameo as a stage critic.A Series of Unfortunate Events, while episodic, is still a good adaptation of the first three novels in the series.The film is technically great, with a distinct 50's Gothic, Edwardian, old-fashioned, Broadway, carnival freak show, expressionistic feel to it. It has outstanding costumes and sets (apparently filmed in ten different stages at Paramount Pictures). The musical score is also great, adding to the already well established dark atmosphere.The film is times charming, funny, intriguing and consistently atmospheric, but lacks some emotional punch. At some points it is sad and moving, but that needs to be high-lighted more.This may be due to the toning down of the books' dark content to make the film more ""kiddie friendly"". What I don't understand is that these books are meant for and read by kids yet the film version still tones down some of the content.Don't be mistaken, adults, this is not your average ""kid"" film, it is still quite enjoyable for an older audience too.I would give this film 7/10. I also look forward to the rumoured sequel, as the next few books deal with more provocative material.Oh, and make sure you watch the credits, they are amazingly done.I would suggest seeing this film.

I'd just like to point out a few annoying weaknesses. Primarily, the story was too episodic and uneven, too formulaic and constructed. Emily Browning's acting was absolutely horrible, and Liam Aiken should certainly change careers immediately. I have never seen less sympathetic child actors. Liam Aiken was particularly odious, coming across as a spoiled, stuck up, emotionally constipated and snobbish brat, and pretty much caused me to root for the Count Olaf character throughout the film. Overall, I'd say that inept casting ruined what little chance this film had of being good. Billy C. was his usual charming biscuit tin self. Jim C, as always, was brilliant. I just wish that he would be more cunning with his choice of roles. It seems perverse that he could have been in this year's best film (ESOTSM) and also in this crappy flick.

243,happyakazukin,It's not that terrible,7,15 May 2009,"I recently re-watched this and was surprised by how many times I was moved to laughter or being close to tears. I have read a few of the books, and I find it strange that they compressed 3 books into one movie- I'm sure it would get just as much money if they did a more ""accurate adaption"" to the books. It stands alone.The acting is fantastic. Jim Carey is a little TOO crazy in some scenes, but otherwise he portrays Count Olaf in an amusing 'let's parody villains' sort of way. Emily Browning and the guy who played Klaus are fantastic- you feel their sadness, their anger.... you care for them. Of course Billy Colony, Meryl Streep and Timothy Spall do a great job. They're living versions of the characters! In the technical department the movie is beautiful. The costumes, ""sets"" and scenery look beautiful, detailed and polished. The music is memorable and makes you feel the appropriate emotions at the right time. The script is witty, well written and fairly tight. It focuses highly on dialogue, but the book is very much the same. It was nice to have some action in there (the train) even though it was not from the book. (from what I can tell). The end is touching.The other aspects: story and characters are all the marvelous invention of Lemony Snicket. All the characters are unique, memorable and likable- even if they're evil or crazy. Well developed all around. What can I say? If anyone disliked this film, it was probably because they were comparing it too much to the book. As I said before: the movie stands alone, so it's best to enjoy it! :) The end credits are very stylish.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It was all somewhere between Dr. Seuss, Edward Gory and A Nightmare Before Chrhistmas. The plot was delightfully surreal and wonderfully played out. I'm not sure how much license was taken by the director, but the books from which the story was taken must have been very clever. The plot seemed very well developed and even though it seemed to wander a bit, one could tell it was meant to appear that way. Overall a very entertaining film.

245,norse76,Unfortunate Adaptation?,8,28 April 2005,"I have read several reviews regarding this film complaining about the fact that it doesn't stick close enough to the source material. Realistically, how many book-to-film adaptations do? Although I admit that the film does not contain all of the wit and dark charm of the books (I am currently reading the sixth volume, my children have just finished number 11), I really enjoyed this film. I had been anticipating it for quite some time, and this generally proves to cause me to feel let down by over-hype (Can you say, ""Phantom Menace""?). This film, however, captured the overall spirit of the books quite nicely. Nobody, and I do mean nobody, could have captured the feel of an enormously failed actor quite as convincingly as Jim Carrey. Not only does he provide great comic scenes when adopting Count Olaf's disguises, but his sense of menace is wonderful.I agree with other reviewers that if you are looking for a picture perfect rendition of the books' events, look elsewhere. This film is more of an adaption of the plot of the first three books, mixing the timeline of the first book around the second and third. I applaud the books portraying children using their intelligence to figure things out rather that relying on magical powers. The movie also captured this quite well, showing each of the children using their natural abilities to solve their problems.A perfect movie? No. Certain dangerous situations from the books are completely omitted from the film that I think would have added a further degree of menace and sense of dread. Also, by cramming three books into one movie, the film can feel rushed at times.Minor problems aside, I truly enjoyed seeing this film with my family and am eagerly awaiting the next installment (how are they going to film the finale of the Miserable Mill?).",A Series of Unfortunate Events

That's really the reason I watched it, I saw part of it on a plane with the sound off and it looked so good that I had to check it out. but...I would have enjoyed it a lot more without Jim Carey. I never liked him and this film didn't change that. Any moment he appears on screen you are watching non-stop Jim Carey shtick, the same shtick he always does.

247,phayzyre,A Lemon(y) of a movie...avoid it like the plague!,1,1 February 2005,"There are some books that make great movies. Here's a shining example of one that failed, crashed and burned! From what I have learned after watching this dung-heap-of-a-movie, the Lemony Snicket books are great. However, this film is a flat out kick in the mouth because it does them no justice! It was almost like taking a movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and marketing it as a kid's movie! It also makes some of the worst B-rated movies that I have seen in the past deserving of an Oscar!I saw this film with my family a few weeks ago, and I'm still trying to make sense of it! This garbage was dull, lifeless, boring, confusing, not to mention stupid! After reading some of the positive comments posted by others here at IMDb, it leaves me scratching my head wondering what in the world did they see good about this movie?! Too bad I wasn't able to go outside, puke and then overdose on Prozac after seeing this film! That would have been a big relief after having to ingest this feces!!My wife and I were looking for a good kid-friendly movie to take our daughter to. To confess, we were not too ""up to snuff"" with any of the latest releases. Seeing the poster for this movie at the theater, we were under the impression that it was a child's fantasy-like picture. You know, like The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Neverending Story, etc. Boy, were we disappointed in wasting nearly $20 on this mess! Yes folks, it WAS that bad! No joke! To those who said it was good, please, go have your head examined! Jim Carrey is a good actor, but his calling is comedy. They should have picked someone a bit more sinister because this movie made him look pretty bad if not out of place! Here he plays the part of an uncle (if I remember correctly) who tries to do away with three orphaned children in hopes of cashing in on their inheritance.....then later on tries to marry one in hopes of getting his hands on the money? What kind of kid's movie do you call that?!!! Was the goal of this movie to promote murder and incest to children?!! I've read several fantasy books and I've seen several fantasy movies. Some good some bad. All of which had some kind of halfway decent plot or story line. The plot behind this trash (to put it bluntly) wanders around like a dog looking for a place to defecate! In saying that I don't mean to slam the actors, they did a good job, and the special effects were a treat, but this movie as a whole just wandered around aimlessly dead with no goal or meaning in sight! Even a cameo by heavy-weight (or maybe, since he went so low to appear in this crap, I should say former heavy-weight!) Dustin Hoffman wasn't enough to save this nonsense!To conclude, the only thing I can figure is that you have to be either brain-damaged, over-medicated or high from huffing spray paint to be able to understand this junk! Me nor my family cared for this film, neither did some of the others from the audience who I overheard voicing their opinion while leaving the theater. However, this movie did succeed in doing something that no other picture has ever made me do in over thirty years of going to the movies.....yawn. Not just once, several times! My only regret is that I'm not able here at IMDb to give this movie a zero out of ten! Giving it a one out of ten is being way too generous! If they ever add insult to injury and make a sequel to this mess, they ought to borrow one from Monty Python and call it: LEMONY SNICKET'S COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! One more thing: To the director of this movie, Brad Silberling, all I have to say is YOU SUCK! Go and deliver pizzas, work at McDonalds, sling trash, clean toilets or find some other line of work because your directing ability sucks big time!!! The Raspberry Award has your name written all over it!!!",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It is both utterly predictable, repetitive, and suffers from such horrible, terrible illogical acts. Not just once or twice, no, it's non-stop. I don't want to bore you with the story, get that from other comments. I personally found this movie to be equivalent to mental torture. The only plus side is the scenery and settings, which are excellent. The person who designed those houses may design mine...There are two kinds of kid movies, the harry potter, pixar and Disney kind which are excellent; the other kind is this type of junk, in which apparently any form of storytelling has to be totally destroyed by producers and directors concentrating only on artistic decors and ignoring the horrible overacting by egocentric actors. And I don't mind Jim Carrey overacting, that's his normal style, and I liked him in Liar Liar and The Truman Show.

And they were not exaggerating. What a miserable story - someone trying to kill three children so he can get his hands on their money.Carrey can be absolutely brilliant, but in this case he is completely overwhelming, and quite frankly once one has seen 10 minutes of his performance, the prospect of having to face another hour or so was more than I could bear.The movie was unrelentingly depressing and heavy, with nothing to lighten it with no whimsy. The children were (realistically) passive participants in their circumstances, in counterpoint to Carrey's overacted but single-dimensional character. Coming from a country in which child abuse, domestic violence, murder and poverty are horribly present, I felt that this movie treated crimes against children too lightly by making the perpetrator to be an object of fiction, instead of the very ordinary (but sick) people they are.On the positive side, the sets, camera work and costumes were exceptionally good.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
251,wilkins_r,"Good moments, but average overall.",6,8 May 2005,"We had high hopes for this film when we saw the trailers come out, but after watching it last night, we were disappointed. We've never read the books, so we approached the film unbiased - in the end, the film does have some high moments, and some laughs, but the end feel is of a film that is struggling to find its way, and never quite settling into any kind of rhythm.The narrative elements, though doubtless a key part of the books, seemed to trouble the story rather than add to it; only on the one or two occasions, such as where the typewriter jammed, did the narrative really come into its own and lend something to the film. For the rest of the time, it seemed to interrupt the flow, stopping the film from being able to build up any real sense of either tension or momentum, such that in the climactic scenes of the film, neither I nor my wife felt the least bit of either concern or doubt over what would happen. And for people who'd never read the books, the climax in the tower seemed far too coincidental to be at all believable. Perhaps there's more to the way this came together in the books - but in the film, it seemed far too convenient.And although my wife and I have been fans of Jim Carrey in some other films, he seemed to spoil the feel of this one. Throughout, he seemed like a comedian playing a bad actor, rather than a genuinely bad actor; and at no point did you really get any feel for him being an evil character. It seemed as though the director wanted to let Olaf's actions bring the evil of the character to life; but Carrey himself never seemed remotely evil. Weird, yes. But not evil. Most of the time, in fact, he just seemed like Jim Carrey.With the narrative restructured to allow the film to really build up energy, and with Olaf's character played by someone with a more sinister feel - an actor, even - I think this film could have been a lot better. As it is, it's just average.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Half way into it we have to actually remind ourselves what the movie is about. And it's not about a quick-change comedian. It's about orphans, and it's not a funny subject. There are 4 murders in this movie and it's not a funny subject either. However kids in the audience are forced to laugh and be drawn in the action. True feelings are shown very little. We don't see the children's reaction to their parents' death, because that would be insensitive to the audience. Well, the whole movie is insensitive to real-life orphans. What is the message of the film? ""It's good to be inventive and strong""? But there is too much Jim Carey going on. Who cares about the kids? The children are clearly miscast: they don't look like siblings. Especially the older brother and sister. The girl doesn't look very inventive either, and she is way too careful about expressing her emotions.From the point of view of artistic language the film can't be told apart from the recent Willy Wonka movie or any of the Harry Potter movies.

255,marieltrokan,Peace wants image and observation to be the same,9,14 November 2017,"The ideology, of the 2004 adventure drama A Series of Unfortunate Events is that peace has had enough with symbiosis, and finally has the balls to cut its ties with victimisation.To clarify (something which is desperately needed in this instance): the 2004 adaptation is about the brutality and the cruelty of peace having the right to be separate to a victim. Regardless of circumstance, and regardless of details, the ideology of A Series of Unfortunate Events is that if something can be a victim then that something has no right to experience peace. Peace has had enough with symbiosis, and is willing to be rid of symbiosis even on the basis of condemning the innocent. If a force can be a victim, then it should be condemned: obviously, this is excessively brutal and cruel, but is it logical? Based on the ideology, peace must be something which can't experience terror. So terror has never been peace. Terror is an experience, and it's an experience that has never stopped. Ergo, terror is constant, peace is never constant. The antithesis of constant is change. Change isn't terror. Change isn't an experience. Change is appearance, and so appearance is neither terror or experience.Appearance is peaceful, and it's something which can't be experienced. Terror is something which has no appearance, and it's experience. Appearance isn't history, and it's peaceful. Appearance is no time, and it's peaceful. Terror is history, and it has no appearance.History has no appearance, and peace is no history. Peace is no history, and history doesn't look like anything. Peace is no time, and time has no image. Terror is no image, and peace is no time. Seeing nothing is terror, and not existing is peace. Having time is terror, and seeing something is peace. Peace is the compromise of seeing something as a result of going through time. The problem though, is that peace doesn't want to be compromise anymore: peace wants no time but it also wants image. And this is why the Baudelaire children are depicted the way they're depicted: they're depicted the way they're depicted to illustrate peace wanting to free itself from compromise. The Baudelaire children have time, but they're also subjected to images that aren't a compromise against time. Time and image are in cahoots with each other - and this is so that peace has the ability to not be a compromise.The Baudelaire children repeatedly see things and see people come into view, where the shape of the something or someone that's coming into view is hostile; reality, and the universe as a whole is the connection between image and separation. Image deserves to be peaceful, but the image can't be peaceful if its basis or logic is to be separate.In short: the true goal of peace is to let the observer just be the image that they're observing. The observed is just the observer, and the observer is just the observed",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I hate to do comparison because it would not help. A movie should be judge by itself. A book can never be represented in any way because they are meant to allow our imagination run wild.

Lord Of The Rings was hailed as a great movie because it stick to the book but as a movie by itself, I don't find anything great about it at all.Back to the movie, one of the reason why I love it is the cinematography, the colors etc. It is so beautiful. Some of the scenes would fit into a frame that I would hang on my walls. The acting was superb which suits the characters nicely. Carrey, after Eternal Sunshine was back to his silly ways. Nothing to complain about that as I love it when he gets silly. What so effective about the acting is that they make you feel for them. You may hate Olaf but you can of accept that he is like that. Same goes with the other characters. When that happens, the actors did their job in my book.

To be honest there aren't that many happy things in the lives of the three Baudelaire youngsters."" ""This is the story of the three Baudelaire children.

And this is where our story begins....Indeed, this is not a very happy movie. As the Baudelaire children become orphans, they are placed in the care of Count Olaf. All he wants is the children's fortune, and he appears to be a VERY unpleasant man.

You are being smothered by it's very dark (and unpleasant?) atmosphere. You are warned: NOT a very pleasant movie indeed. But if you give the three Baudelaire children a place in your heart, which is not so very difficult to do, it is hard not to love the movie.The cast is magnificent: not only is Jim Carrey a deliciously unpleasant Count Olaf, but there's a magnificent Meryl Streep as unfortunately afraid Aunt Josephine ('She's the mayor of crazy town.'), but the ones who really steal your heart are the three youngest actors (fortunately they are pleasant): Emily Browning as the clever inventor Violet, Liam Aiken as the intelligent bookworm Klaus, and Kara and Shelby Hoffman as the infant with sharp teeth Sunny (for as far as such little children can act, they are great).This movie has everything you need for an enjoyable evening.

Although there is a certain amount of... Well, I wouldn't call it black comedy, I would call it grey comedy... Sadly, it is certainly not a 'typical' Carrey movie. It pains me to say that the main amount of comedy that actually provoked a weak smile from the audience, was due to an insane toddler with an infatuation for biting. Yes, biting - nothing in particular, just anything that happened to be around. The subtitles of the translation from 'baby language' or 'monkey' as Count Olaf so delicately puts it, are also quite funny.However, all the actors deliver a brilliant performance, Meryl Streep especially memorable as the 'terrified-of-her-own-shadow', Aunt Josephine.All in all, it was quite good yet I won't be rushing to the shops when it is released on video and DVD. I would recommend a few drinks beforehand to appreciate the movie's finer points.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
262,trynityseven,Not what I expected,5,19 December 2004,"I admit, I never read the books, so I honestly had no idea what to expect. I also neglected to research this movie before I saw it, being drawn in by the promise the talented actors who appear in the film and the fabulous art direction.It was not at all what I expected. My biggest complaint was that I took all four of my children to see it, without knowing how mature the themes were. That was my fault. But the trailers had definitely not billed this one accurately.Having said that, the movie was fine. Not great, fine. Carrey was wasted in this film, resorting to cheap (carry'esque) tricks for laughs instead of playing a villain with charisma. I believe Carrey's talents were wasted. But Liam Aiken - I can't say enough good things about this young actor. He is surely to have a brilliant career. He and Miss Browning, along with the Hoffman twins stole the show. Meryl Streep was delightful (poor woman has so much expectation to live up to that it would be hard to classify such a well-done performance as outstanding). She didn't seem so much like Meryl Streep doing another turn, but as Aunt Sofia she drew me into the character completely.There were some cheap tricks for grown ups in this film that should never have made it past the editing room: the AFLAC duck!?! I suppose they were trying to give the ""grown ups"" something to laugh at.But in all honesty, there is little to laugh about when you're watching the story of 3 children tragically orphaned by an arson that destroyed their home. They were first placed with Count Olaf (Carrey), who was simply out for their money. When the bumbling banker managed to remove the children from his care after his first attempt on their life (NOT a child's movie - I'm telling you!), he placed the children with the delightful Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly)...only to be displaced again, repeatedly. The darkness of this film comes from the combination of the art direction and directing of Brad Silberling (NOT Tim Burton, as some have stated) and the natural tragedy of the actual story itself.Jude Law as Lemony Snicket is telling the story with the appropriate degree of forewarning. I should have listened.I did enjoy the movie for what it was, but I was uncomfortable the entire time with my 4 children ages 8 and under watching a story of repeated murders and trickery. Perhaps I should have taken them to the movie they'd asked for...SpongeBob.on its merits, a 5.5 out of 10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The story of three orphans(played marvelously by the kids) and the series of unfortunate events in their lives and how they get through is a treat to watch! Though the movie is made by Nickelodeon it does not really stick to a childish approach to movie-making. The atmosphere is dark(almost Tim Burton-esquire!) and the kids really have to go through some scary events on their own, with only themselves to depend upon! This is not just another fairy tale where the troubles just go away or someone rescues the kids!! These kids put up a brave face and outsmart their adversary! Jim Carrey's villainous Count Olaf has to be seen to understand his outstanding comic capabilities! have to say Jim Carrey gives his best performance here( if you leave out Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). Meryl Streep and Billy Connoly do justice to their characters. But it's the children who breath life into every scene they are in. The movie brought many a smile to my face!The art direction and set pieces are so fabulous and immersive. The artwork at the end of the movie when the credits roll was great and is itself worth waiting for a few minutes after the movie is over. All in all a classic!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
265,closeupman,"Good Twists & Turns, but a bit slow and too long",9,18 December 2004,"First, for the person(people) who said there should be a happier ending, it was said at the beginning of the film you should go to another theater or get off the plane, if you don't want to see a grim story. It was up to you to leave if you wanted a movie with a happier ending, so please THINK before you put a comment that makes no sense. Most movies won't give you the warning (e.g. Bad Seed, the). This film, while it is a dark comedy, does show something good; Good conquering Evil. Count Olaf tries to kill the kids, but Violet using her ingenuity(and with the help of Klaus and Sunny) overcome his evil deed. Again, when Count Olaf tries to take them from their uncle's place, Sunny, the toddler, defeats his attempt. Then when Count Olaf tries to marry Violet, it is up to Klaus to beat Count Olaf.So you see, while there are evil deeds throughout the movie, good does overcome them. It shows children that they can defeat evil. Still it isn't for the faint of heart, or for a very young child(as I saw one commenter who brought her 4yr old and complained about the darkness of the film and ending....read reviews before you bring such a young child to a film...duh!)The only negative to this movie, as I see it, is the length. About a quarter to 40% in, it seemed to drag a bit. The running time listed 2hr 3 mins should've been trimmed. Movies are getting too long these days. If you can't tell a story in 1hr half - 1hr 3/4, EDIT-EDIT-EDIT!!!",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I didn't laugh a single time in the theater I watched this at, and I almost fell asleep at a couple points.***SPOILERS*** The worst part of this movie is that it claimed to be a dark and depressing children's flick, where nothing but bad things happen to the 3 kids who are this movie's main characters. So how does the movie end? The kids are freed from the evil Count Olaf, and Count Olaf is punished. Yes, the movie has the exact same type of ending that it was supposed to be going against.Yes, this movie is really depressing, but not in the sense that the children suffer.

267,falkar,Anti 'Potter' Magic,6,20 December 2004,"POSSIBLE Spoilers WITHIN:I have never been one for Harry Potter, always finding it very timid and not too exciting. The Lemony Snicket books have been favourites of mine since their publication and I was overjoyed when I learnt they were making a movie based on them and it would be released in the season once dominated by the Boy Wizard. 'Snicket' is a tough film to get into, as it seems to be the antithesis to the sugary, lighthearted early Potter films (more characters die in this movie, the first in a proposed series, than in the first 3 Potters)-this may be a turn off to younger children. But older kids and adults should find it a breath of fresh air that something like this has been made, and made so well. The production design and costuming are stunning, as are the performances of both the child actors are spot-on and you really feel for them. (the twins and Man on Fire's Dakota Fanning have convinced me that not all movie kids are annoying and really dumb) Good use is made of Carrey, playing a villain who is a very vain and bad actor (possibly taking a dig at his critics) Jim is obviously enjoying himself and chews up the scenery with aplomb. However, judging from the reviews and early box office, Snicket is a shock to the system and many people don't seem to understand it. If you pardon the pun, perhaps 'Lemony' is a bitter pill? My rating-9/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
268,Sunshine95,Lots of Comedy,10,21 December 2004,"Lemony Snickets was a Great movie because of the comedy. Not only that, but because the actors were very good also. The movie is about three children who are orphans. The beginning of the movie was kind of boring. It picked up speed when Count Olaf put Sunny hanging over the cliff in order to force Violet to marry Count Olaf so he could inherit the money. Klaus saves Sunny, and brings her down from the cliff. The Special Effects were great, and they made the movie seem very realistic. There is a scene were a python comes out of a cage and it looks very realistic. Another great scene is when Aunt Josephine hides in the cave to avoid Count Olaf. Another great scene storm hits Aunt Josephine's house there are some outstanding Special Effects. It looks real and scary. Then the three children are stuck on the piece of the house that was on the water. So they threw an anchor on the long wooden stick that was holding the piece of the house and knocked it down so they could jump over to the land. Then the kids took a boat to cross the Lake to help Aunt Josephine. The movie was fun and exciting. There were a lot of thrills. The ending was kind of sad because the children got to read a letter from their parents who were dead. It made me want to cry because it was so sad.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
269,possiblegod,visually stunning,9,28 December 2004,"When people go to see films and they say that was good. They usually refer to the acting or the sets or the plot. However a good film is something different. A masterpiece is something different. IT is something that makes you think, that makes you look all over the screen looking at everything, when everything you see stuns you, when you can see the love put into this, when you are drawn into it and when you realise that every aspect of the film got the same amount of care. This was one of those films. Yes Jim Carrey's count Olaf was far more funny than lemony snicket's count Olaf but wasn't this more horrific when he said things like 'I'm going to be the ultimate dad' when you know that he is going to make their lives hell. The sets had so much care, unlike harry potter the special effects were taken as red. They were just used as a camera was used. With films like Harry Potter and Lord of the rings it was all very much 'look what we can do'. There were those wonderful touches the happy little elf in the back of the car and when Count Olaf sat out in the hall way 'have you got a hall pass?' yes funny, but what a lovely little touch. Imagine if you were violet and you heard him say that. Sunny's speech was wonderfully done and Aunt Josephine brilliantly played every actor loving their character and when you saw Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep you forgot who they were and saw them as Mr. Poe, Uncle Monty and Aunt Jo. Hats off to Jim carrey. I could have done with little more threatening behaviour but he had the character perfected.

Such Talent, As Carrey, Meryl Streep, and Dustin Hoffman as no credit critic, ah, the whole thing stank from start to finish. Billy, I wanted to laugh because it was Billy, but the part he played literally strangled his well re-known talent. I think that it is a shame kids today have to be exposed to the likes of this utter trash, as it goes into the HD and stays there. It was creepy, Kooky, Gothic to a default, and if the writer meant to draw attention to a WW organization of momentous proportions, he succeeded. EYES all over the darn place, urrrrrk.

For starters, the kids are great. The cinematography is something to sit back, let wash over you and admire until the cows come home. Thomas Newman's music is also excellent as well (make sure you stay for the end credits).Yet, we feel detached from the movie and its proceedings. As mentioned before, there is a lot to admire. But in the end, do we walk away with any sort of emotion other than ""Yeah, it was...okay""? With the cast and crew assembled here, one would hope for something more.

My main concern is that it's way too dark and Jim Carey is genuinely so disturbing, it's too much that he escapes at the end. All the adults are conveyed as idiots and the wise children left to discover their own resilience in a world of utter incompetence. I'm not pretending that adults always make good choices, but this is so much better handled in the Harry Potter series where the central kids become increasingly resourceful in a world that is more balanced in terms of light and dark.

As fan of the cleverly written books I am happy to say that even though there were a few variations in the plot it has the same sophisticated feel of the series on which it is based. The differences in plot were actually enjoyable and supported the film.Jim Carrey is funny and maybe a little creepy as the arrogant villain of the movie, Count Olaf, and unlike his performance in The Grinch he was goofy but not in-your-face and over the top and all that. The three Baudelaire orphans Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken), and Sunny (twin toddlers Kara and Shelby Hoffman) were quite good actors especially the babies who spoke with hilarious subtitles.This movie has funny dark situations and a star-studded cast. This movie is good for kids 8 and up and isn't too scary or violent. The sets, costumes, props and special effects are mind-blowing.

I liked how they seemed to draw inspiration from several different time periods.I really loved Liam Aiken and Emily Browning as Klaus and Violet Baudelaire- even though they didn't fit my mental images of the characters, they proved themselves over and over again throughout the course of the film. Emily Browning has a history of doing excellent films, and after seeing her in the comparatively small role of Ned Kelly's sister I had a lot of faith in her. I wasn't quite as sure about Liam Aiken because I hadn't seen any of his work, but I was pleasantly surprised.Sunny Baudelaire (as played by Kara and Shelby Hoffman) was just done perfectly. Everybody in the cinema laughed at the subtitles. I seriously didn't think that it was possible for two-year-olds to be good at acting, but the Hoffman twins convinced me otherwise.The musical score was brilliantly done and the sets were, in a word, epic. I felt *dizzy* whenever there were panoramic shots of Lake Lachrymose, for heaven's sakes! There were some scenes which were not in the books- such as the theme of sanctuary, the spyglasses, the lost letter from the Baudelaire parents. As a Lemony Snicket obsessive I expected to fume at these scenes, but they worked wonderfully.Keep an eye out for the hilarious 'Littlest Elf' sequence at the beginning and the amazing animated credits (complete with a song from the film 'The Addams Family', possibly a nod to Barry Sonnenfield, who is credited as a producer).I am giving this film a 9 out of 10 simply because I am a fan of the books and there were a couple of story details I felt could have been communicated better.Excellent stuff!

We went there and tossed between this and Oceans 12, and this one ultimately won. Not having read the books the story was alien to me and my friends. After an interesting start to the movie, it kicked straight into gear. We are immediately introduced to the ""unfortunate"" events of the Baudelaire children. Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken) and Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman), are thrown into peril when they discover their parents are dead. They are taken to a distant relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) to only be placed into a slavery sort of life style. From there you venture into the miserable lives that the Baudelaire children go through.Until I saw the end credits I thought Tim Burton directed the movie. The style is down his alley. Strange production design really makes this movie what it is, a Gothic children's movie. But, as the movie is under the helm of Casper director Brad Silberling, the jokes will not go straight over the heads of a 12 year old.Carrey was perfect for the role of the Count Olaf. No matter how much make-up this man seems to wear you can still see him underneath. Both Browning and Aiken are also very good as the two oldest children and the twins that portray Sunny were the highlight of the show with some of what they say the funniest jokes in the movie. But there are many other jokes that are extremely funny none the less.While the movie is mainly aimed for 10-13 year of age, a older person can still go and watch this movie and enjoy it if they go not expecting the most philosophical story ever. You must go expecting to see a child movie. If you want a adults movie then go watch Oceans 12, but this movie really isn't that bad.

The dude is no longer funny and I got to a point where I wanted to punch his face in.Though not the same type of film as Harry Potter (Potter is in a different league) I think that the makers of this film would have tried a lot harder to win it affection if the likes of Potter were not around to wipe it out in superiority.Maybe children would like this film as it appears their taste over the years has been abused to accept any old dross.I think there must be money laundering going on in films these days or massive tax saving incentives for people to make this kind of stuff knowing full well how awful it is.Naff, predictable and story full of holes.

You would think that the two older kids were really related, they look so much alike. But they are not. However, they really work well together as Emily Browning stars in her first US blockbuster and she defiantly carries it well. The boy, Liam, has done some kid movies that had talking dogs and such, but he shows he can act as he plays the boy that reads everything. It's a great movie, as it reaches all levels and appeals to all ages. Jim Carrey is the guy you love to hate. Timothy Spall is the mindless Mr. Poe, the one who is suppose to be smarter than the children. Billy Connolly is the cool-head uncle. Meryl Streep is the paranoid, air-head aunt. The whole movie feels like a mix of Dr. Seuss and A Nightmare Before Christmas, it is Gothic but charming. You start to feel that it is really, more like a place in Europe than a part real/ part fantasy land. To add to the greatness, Jude Law voices the all watching Lemony Snicket, the writer of the unfolding story, who feels awful for having to tell this story, which is not about magic elves, but of painful and sometimes joyous events. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a must-own. I have seen it twice and I would gladly go again. It is defiantly a movie for the ages, from the beginning (when you think you've enter the wrong theater) to the end (where even the credits are uniquely cool).

What an artful piece of work. Truly it is beautifully done.It reminds me of a Tim Burton film, dark and quirky - something you really do have to watch at least twice: once for the story and once for the detail - and once again to fully appreciate it.I've never read the books, something I'm now going to have to remedy. And I'm told that it doesn't quite follow them, although it gets the main feel of the story right. Perhaps this is important in making it work, I don't know. Ceratinly following to close to the novels can ruin a story (witness the appalling mess that is HP&tPS), so maybe it is helped by the difference.The acting is very well done, and for the first time ever I was able to forget I was watching Jim Carrey (except maybe at the beginning) and enjoy his performance as Count Olaf, the villain. The two child leads as Viola and Kraus showed us what was missing from the first two HP movies, by giving more than adequate performances, and the two little actors who were Sunny were just adorable.Do make time to see this one, I haven't enjoyed a movie like that for a long time!",A Series of Unfortunate Events

So I comment on this as any other movie I'd go and see.As far as a story went, I thought it was pretty good. It wasn't suspenseful or action packed; the plot was moved forward in one way or another. I thought the characterization was well done, especially by Jim Carey in the role of a villain with his talent at caricatures of people. The children were well played and you could relate to their situation. The overall scenery was wonderful, though rather dark. It seemed much like a Tim Burton movie to me.I suppose reading the books would be helpful, and if I had I would probably have been disappointed with the movie since my son tells me they left out many important portions from the first three novels.

I've never read the books, though I've certainly heard of them. The Edward Gory-like end credits are fabulous, as is the art direction--in these ways, the film reminds me of a Tim Burton-lite. This film sort of has a ""Big Fish"" feel to it.I think what I liked the most was that these kids depend on two things: persistence and knowledge, to help them along.

284,spoon_qb,Laugh with tears,10,6 June 2005,"An excellent black comedy. But it has a very important Jim Carey touch. The intrigue is the death of the three children's parents. From here on the action starts. Count Olaf (Jim Carey :)))))))) takes the children into his custody only to kill them so he can be the only owner of the Baudelaire's treasure (fortune). He takes the look of various characters just to approach the kids after he is discovered to have put the kids in danger. He than finds out that the kids need to be alive because the fortune will go to the girls husband. So he changes tactics and wants to marry the girl in a very good orchestrated play. But of course he doesn't counts the ""special powers"" the kids have. Emily, if she puts her black ribbon on, invents very fast anything they need to pass every obstacle. Liam read all his life books and he can read them very (very very) fast and the good news is that he can remember every word he read. Little Sunny can bite...yes thats her specialty; she can bite harder than a Nile crocodile, or a jaguar (is the most powerful feline in the world judging by the power to weight ratio).Jim Carey is Jim Carey. Excelente!!!A plus to this movie is Emily Jane Browning. The 17 year old girl is very beautiful. I don't know what's with Australia but it gives us only ""screen pearls"". It's a pleasure watching Nicole or Kylie (and others) and now we have a new doll in the TV (or big screen or monitor) called Emily Jane Browning. Hope to see you soon girl.The movie also has lessons for the society. It's like a Caragiale text (romanian theater writer) that underlines the bad things in any society. And the best lesson is that people can't see the evil because they don't listen to what others have to say. We never listen to all the sides in a conflict. We think that if they won they must be right. Very wrong!In general this is an excellent movie to watch, to laugh and learn something from it too.Only one -.

While more and more films that are supposed to be watched by adults (alright, alright, young adults!) turn out to be childish and/or irritating, here comes that ultra rare beast: a kids' film that can be enjoyed by adults even more than by kids! ""Lemony Snicket's Series Of Unfortunate Events"" has it all. It is imaginative, exciting, funny, a little scary and well-acted by all concerned. Though the script is based on the first three books of the series, you never get the feeling that things are being rushed, and the film never commits the cardinal sin of hectic cutting, just to suggest ""action"". It also uses the dreaded CGI, that veritable killer of so many would-be blockbusters, but it uses it very well! (Are you listening, people responsible for ""Van Helsing"", ""Riddick"" and other embarrassing monstrosities?)Although not a single natural location has been used for the film, ""Lemony Snicket"" never relies on just the empty spectacle of CGI. Whatever settings and effects are used, they just serve to create a dream-like atmosphere and to enhance the plot. Brad Silberling knows that the characters come first, and his characters, especially the Baudelaire orphans and Count Olaf are excellent creations. Jim Carrey on the loose can be a dangerous species, but in this case he brings just the right amount of madness and eccentricity to his role, while the children, especially Emily Browning, hold their own against such strong competition. Excellent!!!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
287,drmike99,"Tedious, boring, badly written badly acted and badly directed",1,9 January 2005,"This is one of the most tediously boring and depressing movies I have ever seen. The chop-work taken to the original books (which I have not read) explains the structural weakness of the screenplay- it is not a series of unfortunate events, it is simply a series of the SAME events over and over with the same deus ex machina solutions each time. There is no building toward anything- I found myself looking at my watch over and over again. Each segment has its own mini-climax and then on to the next EXACTLY THE SAME event, with different window dressing. There is no suspense- you know they will save themselves in the last possible moment. The acting is abysmal. Jim Carey is not the Jim Carey of ""Eternal Sunshine"" (for which he has a Golden Globe nomination) or ""Truman Show,"" and he is not the comical Jim Carey of everything else. He is just an actor playing a character. Meryl Streep is God-awful doing a characterization, not a character. Whoever plays the banker is terrible. The kids are good. The direction is wooden and plodding. The cinematography is nothing special. And the effects are nothing special.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
288,daneaston,Style over substance - disappointing,5,21 December 2004,"This film looks wonderful - the sets are amazing, the costumes are fantastic and I hope the production designer got paid handsomely.However, I feel that such enormous effort was put into the design to hide what is, in my opinion, a weak script. The story is very linear with no sub-plots and little back-story. The humour works on one level and isn't actually very funny at all.Perhaps it is another example of all the hype causing me to have impossibly high expectations, or perhaps it is because the last film I saw was ""The Incredibles"" (near impossible to beat!), but for me, I found Lemony Snicket really quite boring. The story never lifted off and there was nothing to really make me care about seeing to the end (although, after paying £8, I was going to!).Having now seen it, I wish I had waited until its DVD release. I'm not really sure if I enjoyed it or not. For me, it's a hard-pushed 6/10 and the majority of that is for the production design. I think the 'behind the scenes' featurette will probably be better than the film itself.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

First of all, the previews do nothing except get your hopes up. I thought Jim Carrey was actually going to be a funny character in this trash compactor of a movie. Then i find out he's just some mean old person who NEVER stops coming back to get the kids. I was ready to turn off my DVD player after about the fourth disguise he came up with. And no, i never read the book and realized what i was in for because im not a nerd. And how stupid was the guy from the children's orphanage? You would think he would either a) listen to the kids about Count Monkey or b) Finally recognize that it's him in a costume. But no, the count came back 457 times as a different disguise and the kids just gave up when no one listened to them. They were like, ""OK, No one will believe us so lets just take him in again and we're screwed."" They weren't screaming from the rooftops, ""Help! This guy tried to kill us! He'll do it again! Please help us!!!"" Why did they give up so fast? And how stupid was the movie scene. Again, no one did anything to help the kids out before it was 3443 hours too late. The whole thing was just a huge waste of my time. A stupid little story that was predictable, but wasn't funny enough to keep your attention at all. The only bright spot was the little cute baby who was kinda funny. And lastly, did the parents die or not?! I don't get it. This movie made Death to Smoochy look good.

290,petemail,Lavish visuals but lacks a heart,1,26 February 2005,"Truly an awful movie. I couldn’t feel any genuine sympathy with the characters. The orphans are lack luster and unemotional. I’ve seen cartoons that more real. When a baby is the best thing going for a movie you know you’re in trouble. The direction is the heart of the problem. The movie tries to be both for children and adults but, fall awkwardly in between, failing to be either.Jim Carry plays an unredeeming villain who is too evil to be in a children’s movie. Carry lacks that bumbling humorous side that a villain needs to have so we can laugh at him. Instead we are presented with a dark, nasty person, who repeatedly kills people through out the movie. Peter Pan or Home Alone are examples of how to make a villain evil and funny at the same time. Most of the blame lies with the script and the direction. I’ve seen Jim Carry in lots of movies where I’ve laughed myself silly, so I know if put in the right movie he can work his magic.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

293,DirectedByBrian,Fun and imaginative -- to a certain extent,7,28 December 2004,"The danger in getting excited about an upcoming movie is that one might end up over-anticipating, such that the film, once finally viewed, ends up being not a bad film, but a disappointment in relative terms. Such was my case with ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.""The film is based on the first three books of the series, which follows the unfortunate tale of the Baudelaire children: Violet, the inventive oldest sister; Klaus, the bookworm; and Sunny, the two-year old biter. These three are suddenly rendered orphans when a fire burns their house to the ground with their parents in it (all of which is off-screen so your tots won't be horrified within the first five minutes). The family banker, Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall), takes the children to live with their closest relative, the eccentric  and, we soon discover, sinister  Count Olaf (Jim Carrey).Olaf makes no charade to disguise his real reason for accepting the orphans: He wants the Baudelaire fortune. But since the fortune will not pass to the guardian until the wards die, Olaf sets out to kill them. This is, of course, a dark theme, and one which I would not rush to display before children, although the theater I was in was heavily laden with impressionable youngsters. If there's a plus side, it's that the dark themes of this movie are much more subtle than, for instance, ""Addams Family Values,"" in which Wednesday and Pugsley commit obviously and flagrantly fatal acts upon their newest sibling.When Olaf's plan to have the children killed by locking them in a car parked on the railroad tracks fails, Mr. Poe removes them from his custody  not because Olaf tried to kill them, but because he left the youngest, Sunny, in the driver's seat unattended. Neither Mr. Poe nor any other adults in the film seem to believe the children when they tattle on their uncle.The second foster parent is Monty Montgomery (Billy Connolly), a reptilian expert, who plans to pack the children off to Peru on a little adventure  until Count Olaf shows up disguised as a fellow scientist. I'm not spoiling anything by pointing out that it is indeed Olaf in disguise, because, although the make-up job is quite good, the children announce it is Olaf just seconds after seeing him. Once again, the dim-witted adult (what is the movie trying to say here?) doesn't believe the children for a moment. The grown-ups in the film could have been made a little more intelligent.The third foster home involves Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) who lives practically over the sea, in a shanty that juts out off a high cliff, supported by a rickety collection of beams. There is a comic irony here, because the aunt herself is paranoid about everything (""Don't get too close to the refrigerator  it might fall and crush you!"") Oh, and Olaf shows up in disguise. (I get the idea this is the format of each book in the entire series.)I am always hesitant when a film has Jim Carrey cast in anything but a normal human role. When he is given unrestrained freedom, he is unbearable (""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective""). However  and this is important  when his manic personality has a reason for existing, he can be delightful (""The Mask""). Here, Olaf is a decidedly overboard actor, so Carrey is an appropriate choice. And he is actually more entertaining, I think, when he is playing Olaf in disguise. His Italian scientist and his Irish sailor were entertaining to study as he performed them.The newcomers as the Baudelaire children are adequate, given that the script does not place them in highly demanding situations. The script and director even seem to have removed opportunities for Miss Browning and Mr. Aiken to really act, such as in the scene where they learn of their parents' deaths and simply stare at the sand on the beach.Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep seem to have fun in their supporting roles. Other actors are not on screen enough to be noticed, really  which is a shame, because Timothy Spall, Jennifer Coolidge, and Catherine O'Hara are such talented and entertaining performers.The production design by Rick Heinrichs is excellent, evoking the same visual enjoyment I got out of the Harry Potter movies, and anything directed by Terry Gilliam or Tim Burton (a friend of Heinrichs'). Olaf's house is a ghoulish run-down Gothic mansion with carved eyes in several niches and sconces; the countryside is a depressing brown haze; the seaside town is almost a painting.And now to the disappointments, the largest of which was what I perceived to be anachronisms. The film opens in such a way that I was expecting something that, though modern, would feel old-fashioned and highly stylized. While this was largely achieved, Siberling allowed a few slips, primarily in Carrey's occasional use of ""cool"" lingo in amongst his more grandiose verbal gestures, and in the casting of Cedric the Entertainer as a police inspector. These are just two examples of the way the film set up a certain unity, and then took a misstep in violating that unity now and then.The score by Thomas Newman was disappointing. I liked the ""western"" riff he employed during the train scene and any time Violent got a brainstorm, but otherwise, the film cried out for the comic menace of either Danny Elfman or Alan Silvestri (""Mouse Hunt""  what a beautiful Main Title Theme). And Newman's composition for the closing credits was just plain wrong.From what I saw, the works of Lemony Snicket carry the ingredients to make the kind of film I could positively drool over. But this first work (in what I hope will be an ever-improving series) feels a little undercooked. Which is unfortunate.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
294,flyyy4awhiteguy,"The Books Were Better, but this got the job done",7,20 December 2004,"A Series of Unfortunate Events was an absolute smash in the theaters. Having read the book series, I found the first film installment to be a great translation from book to movie even though it lacks the same character development in the books. The sets designed from the book come straight out of the imagination as you watch the children travel from one guardian home to the next. Unfortunately, Nickolodeon had a say in this production and gave the film a more upbeat twist, removing more graphic areas of the novel as to not alarm younger viewers. Once again, I am sad to say though they there is very little character, the film barely touches on the children's talents, and doesn't even introduce Count Olaf's acting troupe. That was obviously deviated to the beautiful set work. The only question I really had for the film was why such big name actors appeared with such tiny parts.For instance Cedric the Entertainer, Dustin Hoffman, Luis Guzman, and Stiflers mom have roles with one to no lines throughout the film. Obviously this film will have its flaws but I must say that I was completely entertained and feel that children, not adults will love this film. I'd read the books though, to better understand certain parts.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
295,a_non-existent_user,Daniel Handler eat your heart out!,8,18 December 2004,"Last year I heard Jim Carrey was attached to a project for Nickelodeon called (at the time) Lemony Snicket, and was based on Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events books. Being the major Nickelodeon and Carrey fan I am, I read the series and instantly fell in love with them. For months on end, I counted down the days until the film was coming out. Last night, at exactly 10:33pm, I could stop counting.The film is amazing. The film's nowhere near as good as the books, but I had a giddy time watching this goth-Victorian flashback. If you've read the books, you know that the film starts out with Mr. Poe bringing news to the three Baudelaire children that their parents have died in a fire and they are now homeless orphans. Violet is the oldest Baudelaire, and she loves to invent. You can tell she's inventing something when she ties her long hair up with a ribbon. The first person to test out her inventions is Klaus, her younger brother. Klaus love to read, and remembers every single fact he reads. Sunny, the baby Baudelaire, loves to bite things with her four sharp teeth. Upon receiving the news, Violet, Klaus and Sunny are taken to live with Count Olaf, who is played well by Jim ""Carreyed Away"" Carrey. I loved him in this role, he did superb as the loony Count/Actor. Now, there are a few changes in the movie than from the books. First, The ending to TBB has been changed. Instead of the marriage, Olaf tries to off the orphans by locking them in a car on a train track. They, of course, save themselves, and they are taken away because Mr. Poe thinks Olaf was letting Sunny drive as opposed to trying to kill them. Another change is that the secrets of V.F.D., which don't show up in the books until book 6 I think, are in the movie. This obviously was down because Lemony Snicket/Daniel Handler wanted to make just one movie, which I think sucks. :( The third change is that it is revealed that Count Olaf is the one who started the fire, as we learn in the end. And don't fret, the marriage is not gone, but is saved for the ending. Also, instead of Violet signing the papers with her left hand, Klaus burns it with the same magnifying contraption Olaf used to burn down their house. All in all, I love this movie, and while it screws the books up, I think it work quite well in the film.Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events ********(eight) our of **********(ten) stars",A Series of Unfortunate Events

There was no consistency in the acting or directing, just a jumble of dull event after dull event. There are lots of cameos from some of today's funniest actors and actresses, Dustin Hoffman, Jennifer Coolidge, Catherine O'Hara but none of the normally hilarious actors are given a single line that was intended to be funny.

The setting is a beautiful Tim Burton-esquire Edwardian/Victorian world crossed with the modern world. It is visually stunning.

The kids-particularly the boy-weren't award winning actors, but they did an okay job. The subtitled little girl was annoying at times.

I thought we had moved on from a time when films dis-empower women and children and have narratives filled with weak characters that can only be described as frustrating. To me it's a lazy writer's easy way out. The lack of a decent villain and pathetic victims that can only entertain the smallest of children that cant completely understand what is happening in the film. The annoying Jude Law narration made the film even more unbearable with its sarcastic tone constantly droning throughout the film. Visually the film was appealing and well acted with some funny moments but the story was dire!,A Series of Unfortunate Events
308,mistresswong,(shrugs shoulders indecisively ),6,15 January 2005,"Let's start with this. I have never read the books on which this film is based, and can therefore offer no critique on the quality of the adaptation. I can only pass judgment on how I reacted to the film. There are quite a few things that are gleeful about it. There is, however, a fatal flaw that undoes all the good around it. The good news first: The film looks absolutely stunning. Visions of horrific Gothic architecture stolen from inside Tim Burton's head mix with delightful pastel coloured countryside. The camera always seems slightly off-balance and the computer imagery ( which must be plentiful ) is never intrusive. Also, Jim Carrey is not the bug-eyed, screeching, careening off the walls lunatic I had feared him to be. As much as I admire and respect his more dramatic work, whenever he is given the opportunity to ""let go"" and be free, to do "" a ventura "" he tends to irritate. So to find him in such a caricatured yet relaxed mode is reassuring. Billy Connolly is engaging and pleasant, yet somehow a little underwhelming. The best performance in the film come's from Meryl Streep, who despite having very limited screen time manages to come across as comic, sympathetic and just plain pathetic, it's the most realistic section of the film and in the house on the edge of the lake, has the best location too. The highest praise I can afford to the child actor's is that at no point did I wish them dead. It's not that they are bad actors, it's just that when you compare it to work like Haley Joel Osment a few years back, or Freddie Highmore in this year's ""Finding Neverland"" you realise that even with kid's, you don't have to settle for less. The problem with this film then, is not in the look, or the direction, or the acting. It's in the writing. The dialogue is flat and unimaginative, the story never fuses convincingly, and feels like a series of episodic vignettes instead of a cognitive whole and the climax is weak and uninspiring. These would be viable faults in any film, but to find such glaring narrative problems in a film that has such a wealth of ( reputedly ) excellent source material is a cardinal sin. It's not a bad film, and it really does look spectacular. Hopefully though, the inevitable sequel will devote a little more time to the story and the script, and not just the sights.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The sets and costumes were beautiful and flawless, even if it was different from the drawings of the books. That however, didn't bother me. Jim Carrey's Count Olaf and hilarious, yet very evil. He pulls it off perfectly. Sure, the Count Olaf in the book isn't funny at all, but Carrey makes it work. I liked his Captain Sham and adored his Stefano.Now the three Baudelaire's couldn't have been cast more perfectly. They look like the drawings (If people care) with only a few differences (Like Klaus with no glasses, Violet's hair a shade lighter) but that doesn't matter, they were wonderful actors who portrayed the characters flawlessly. The other characters, Uncly Monty, Aunt Josephine, and Mr. Poe to be exact, were absolutely perfect. I know Im repeating myself for saying that, but I couldn't think of anyone better for those roles. Mr. Poe really sticks out to me, it was like Timothy Spall was born to play the role, or Brett Helquist (The illustrator for the series) had that very actor in mind. Jude Law's voice fit wonderfully for the narration as Lemony Snicket himself, as now every time I read the books, I really hear him talking.This movie is great for people of all ages. It has the perfect blend of children's horror and comedy to make it enjoyable for pretty much everyone. The reason this movie is not getting a 10/10 is because of the storyline. If you have not read the books imagine your favorite book series, and think of the first three books. Now take the first part of the first book, then put the major events of the 2nd and 3rd after that and finish it off with the ending of the first book, and you got this movie. Somehow it worked great, but I was disappointed they weren't truer to the series because I think they had a better storyline. However, if it stays just this one movie, then thats fine. If not, I would recommend starting all over and making it again. (Although I did enjoy the fact that they were all part of the organization that was involved with fire; VFD for those who read the books, right?) The thing I loved about the change in story line is the Letter That Never Came. I thought it was full of emotion and it was a fantastic bit that was produced from changing the story.Overall, this movie is one of my favorites, quite possibly in my top five of all time, even though its rated lower than others on here for me. It was beautifully done and I can watch it again and again, and to me its endlessly quotable. I love how this movie could be so funny yet filled with miserable events, and if you haven't yet, I strongly suggest you read the series along with getting the Beatrice Letters, so you know the full story of the Baudelaires.With all due respect, Mydisco182",A Series of Unfortunate Events
311,ecpato,A frightfully frenetic and beautifully tragic children's film,10,17 December 2004,"First, let it be declared that in the media of movie, it is a downright shock that Nickelodeon's monicker appears in this film. It is by far, the best film they have ever made. Second, it is probably the only movie you will see made for children (supposedly) and containing a claymation elf holding a rifle.Second, let it be known that this movie is the most visually pleasing children's (live-action) film any of us will see for years. The costume design is amazing, from the strap-laden sunny to the neo-Gothic formality of Violet, and especially in the under-appreciated and subtle '60s formal-casual of Klaus, who looks like a miniature Harold from ""Harold and Maude"". The sets are equally beautiful, a spree of Burtonesque Gothic-Modern Post-Industrial Asymmetry, from the half formed carnage of The burnt Baudelaire Mansion to the perfectly executed closing credits, animated to perfection. Cinematography also plays an amazing roll on the parts of Violet and Klaus, where ingenious images are used to insert the audience into the minds of the genius Baudelaires.Last, the performances, only two that everyone has't heard; Jude Law's perfect narration, and The Hoffman Twins astonishing performance as Sunny. Law's performance is so on target that it never occurs that this voice is not the elusive and enigmatic pseudonym himself. He is the perfect compliment to the often exciting or disturbing actions being inflicted upon the accurately charming and intelligent Baudelaires. as for Sunny, they have performed the impossible in giving a perfect performance to an infant from an infant, in both the physical acting and the ingenious form of translation. The sequels are sure to be the greatest of series, even if the events be unfortunate as they have been.As an artist, this reviewer cannot help but give this movie a 10/10. It is his deep desire that you appreciate it as much as he, if not, well... ... that is rather... ... unfortunate.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
312,stevehellboy,Don't understand why people don't like this film,10,30 March 2018,Hilarious well done film. I never read the books so I can't compare but it is still a great film regardless. Any negative reviews for this film are from people who have absolutely no sense of good humour and cinematic authenticity. They're probably just upset because they're alone and ugly.,A Series of Unfortunate Events
313,fratl,A stunning display of Talent and Art!,10,18 December 2004,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, when I first viewed the T.V. spot, I was overjoyed that there was to be a movie based off the first three wonderful books. And it was a plus that Jim Carrey was playing the villain Count Olaf, and although most thought Carrey would ruin the role, I kept my head up. And When I entered the theater to see this movie, I couldn't help but be excited.The books to which this movie is based on are written by Daniel Handler A.K.A. Lemony Snicket. And every book has a fantastic feel of darkness but that yet, has a fun and darkly comic lining. and by the looks of the trailer, it seemed to keep that feel. But enough about that, and on to the review.The movie starts off in an unexpected way, but I do not wish to tell you more, because it would definitely ruin the surprise for you, all I'll say is that you'll probably think you are watching the wrong movie. Then, when the movie actually starts, you are introduced to Lemony Snicket (the voice of Jude Law) who warns you that this movie is not a happy one, and he warns you to turn around and view another if you wish to view a happy movie. We are then introduced to the Baudelaire orphans, Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken), and baby Sunny (sisters Shelby and Kara Hoffman). They are on a gloomy -looking beach when Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall), a close friend to the Baudelaire parents, who tells the youngsters that their parents have perished in a terrible fire that has destroyed their entire mansion.They are then sent by Mr. Poe to live with their third cousin four times removed, or maybe it's their fourth cousin three times removed. This man is Count Olaf (Carrey) who they soon realize is after their massive fortune. Olaf's house is barely a home for them, for he is cruel to them and his house is an absolute wreck. When Olaf is officially pronounced their new father, he puts his car on a set of railroad tracks, with them in it! He as well has taken out the locks so they cannot escape. After they save themselves from being smashed by the train, Mr. Poe finds them in the car, and takes them away from Olaf for a reason that is not the reason he should, he took them away because Sunny is sitting in the drivers seat. But it's still good because they are at least away from his at last right? WRONG!The children then go to live with their Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) who is a very nice herpetologist, but before they know it, Olaf is disguised as an Italian assistant there to help Monty with his work. This disguise fools Monty, but not the kids. And before you know it, Monty has been murdered by Stephano, who is later revealed to be Olaf. Olaf then escapes.The Children then go to live with their Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) who, although she means well, is afraid of every thing she sees, making her less than a perfect parent. But, then again Olaf shows up disguised as a sailor, and again, everyone is fooled but the kids. And at this time a hurricane is coming their way! After a long rumble of leeches, hidden clues, and caves, Olaf, dressed as his normal self, pretends, right in front of Mr. Poe, pretends to save Klaus from the hungry leeches. So, because of this, Olaf is put back as the orphans parent. He then forces the children to be in his play in which he plans to really marry Violet in order to get her fortune.Filled with stunning visuals, eye candy sets, and stunning performance by Carrey and all the other actors in here, this movie really takes you out of your cozy room and puts you in their world so you feel as if you are there with the kids trying to escape from Olaf and his plans. A brilliant triumph! 10/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
314,blueleftshoe,nothing to write home about,5,18 December 2004,I watched this movie knowing nothing about the books other than they are a series of children's books. I went to see it mainly for Jim Carrey and because the previews made it out to be a good movie.I wanted nothing more to like this movie and no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get into it. This was a average movie at best but I would consider watching it again perhaps I would change my mind. Jim Carrey was about the only entertaining thing in this movie the child actors where pretty much bland and boring perhaps they were meant to be this way. Then the little baby who bites things god that was dumb the only entertaining part about her was when she was being referred to as a monkey.I just think this movie neglected the story pretty much just glossing over everything and failed really develop any characters that you could like. The best part of the movie was seeing the preview for the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie.,A Series of Unfortunate Events
315,JohnCVermont,A Decent Movie but not a Great Film,6,1 July 2005,"I wish I could have rated this film higher but I just didn't get the feeling of *WOW*. It was a good movie and visually compelling at times. Jim Carrey had some excellent moments but the constant overacting was a touch grating at times. Whoever casted Jude Law as the Narrator should be given a serious Christmas bonus. It was an inspired selection. The four child actors who are the main characters (two toddlers handled the role of Sunny) did a very commendable job. I think Emily Browning deserves special mention for her portrayal of Violet. Well Done! Lastly, I did enjoy Billy Connolly appearance as Uncle Monty. While there were some taut & tense moments with genuine suspense, the movie as a whole just seemed to amble along. This was probably intentional. The film's climax just didn't achieve the height it should have compared to previous moments in the story.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
316,john_johnson,Intelligent and interesting Narrative,7,18 December 2004,"It is refreshing to see a fantasy movie that does not rely on the shock every-two minutes strategy(Van Helsing anyone?). Thankfully, the book the film was based on had some weird and original ideas in it to keep it interesting and entertaining.The movie has an unpredictable storyline, lively and eccentric characters, and a haunting atmospheric set. Carrey was great, but his crazy behaviour perhaps got a little too much as the film wore on. Although this is one of the best performances yet from the increasingly-popular rubber-faced actor. Also Meryl Streep was admirable as a strange, old, neurotic woman who provides the keys to unclocking some of the mysteries of the story.Most of all, I like the Roald Dahl-inspired, sinister and sarcastic wit.

318,micahks-769-261560,Dazed and Confused,5,20 August 2013,"I liked the dark ideas in this film. I didn't read the books; therefore, I didn't have any preconceived ideas. I sensed that the movie was supposed to have a House M.D. or Sherlock Holmes feel to it, but I never got that. I didn't really care if the children were in trouble. I never cared for Jim Carrey, and I felt that I saw too much of him in this film. Like most of his characters, he plays the same role over and over again. In this film, when he's trying to play a con artist; I just don't buy it. He walks the same for each role. If they had just portrayed the first book; this movie would have been better. The end of the film talks about unfortunate events being equal to life: there is a reason why things happen. However, the film fails to explain the events. The unfortunate events are just thrown together without showing how the pieces would fit. The lack of describing events makes the viewer confused and bored, and the events appear random, and the audience never develops a love for these characters. Only the children's characters and Aunt Josephine I understood. Violet just accepts things for what they are and invents things. Klaus is smart and doesn't believe things just happen. Sunny likes chewing things and uses baby talk to communicate. Aunt Josephine is picky towards grammar, which I can relate to as an English tutor. The scene when she dies is supposed to be showing the idea how some students may want their English teacher and/or tutor dead. However, since nothing else is told about her except that she has irrational fears, nobody really cares that she is about to die. These characters (and the other ones in the story if that is what you call them) should have been given more time to develop, so that the audience actually cares about them. If a film is to be dark, you need to care about the characters. If you water down the movie people won't care. The parts that are supposed to be shocking were water downed so much that I didn't care, and were predictable. Other than that, the costumes and overall look of the movie was fine. I also did like the scenes with play on words, such as a ""close relative"" means a person who lives nearby, instead of an immediate family member. However, these scenes were few, and should have been more consistent throughout the film. Again, Carry doesn't get out of his comfort zone as an actor. I just spent most of the time wondering where this movie was taking me. Since I didn't read the books, I'll be fair by giving this film a 5/10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
319,diemartini,a total boredom,2,2 March 2005,"I really cannot understand since there are producers that invest in scripts like this. This film is extremely boring and tedious, in addition to little creative. It is the history of three orphaned children who deal with not falling in the hands of a killer uncle and tyrant that only looks for its inheritance. That is everything. He is purely linear, does not surprise with anything at no moment. Although the performances are not bad since the actors are good by nature, these in case single they cannot save the disastrous thing that are this film. Actors as Jim I do not understand as they accept to act in these films.And the two are only because the actors are good",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Emily Browning did a superb job at playing Violet and Jim Carrey, well what can I say about him, brilliant as always. Actors such as Billy Connoley, Meryl Streep, and Jennifer Coolidge just added to the effect. Also, I noticed Dustin Hoffman briefly at the play and I'm a big fan. It didn't follow the books to the letter but it held up on its own despite that. Sunny's comments in the subtitles were really funny. I don't think that it is geared to younger children, the humor is more sarcastic and sadistic such as Olaf letting Josephine live until she corrected his grammar.

I had to give this movie a ""9"" because as a movie it's pretty spectacular from the major elements like costumes and sets to the nuances like the opening sequence that forces the opening credits to the end of the film (which are beautiful in their own right). As an adaptation though it's pretty terrible. Even my girlfriend who had never read the books said that she felt that the movie felt ""rushed"", and if you've read the books you'll know why. They decided to take the first three books of the series and cram them into one film. There is more than enough story in each book to warrant a movie in its own right, but they're probably betting that there won't be a sequel. Since they never really do justice to the books, the best sections are when they ignore the books all together. It's not faithful enough with its adaptation to be satisfying to readers, nor is it inventive enough to stand on its own.

Then at some point, the story stops making sense, with an atrocious finale. The script also descends from being very witty and clever to nonsensical.The kids are never able to tell people that the person they're talking to is a killer, and they never do anything (almost) to fight him, it is so frustrating and annoying to watch.Enjoyed the first half very much, but was disappointed with the second.

323,evilgrinlord,Entertaining and Unique,8,29 May 2007,"I've been a huge fan of these books since middle school, so naturally, I awaited the movie with some trepidation. Would be as disappointing as the Potter films? Would they get the story and characters right? I sat down in the theater to be greeted by cheerfully saccharine musical number involving a claymation elf, and I grinned as the happiness was cut short by Snicket's humorously dark narration. These filmmakers knew what they were doing.The story was adapted very well. You don't need to be intimately familiar with the books to understand what's going on. Even though the plot changed somewhat, it all served to make the story work better on screen. Some scenes were cut or changed altogether, but all the great characters were done justice(though it seems, alas, that jusice will never do anything to Count Olaf.) The child actors were very likable and relatable, and conveyed a real sibling chemistry. Carrey's Olaf was hilariously over the top, as he is in the book, yet frightening and menacing. It's a difficult balance, because the villain really is kind of absurd, but sometimes, he does something so menacing you really take him seriously. Props to Carrey.The highlight of this movie for me was the soundtrack. It truly captured the unique feel of Snicket's world. Just listen to the ""VFD"" track, which sounds like a particularly haunting music box, and you'll feel yourself getting whisked off to this strange mirror of our own world where lies danger and mystery. The soundtrack sweeps through bars of mournful cellos that convey the dark quirkiness of the world.The costumes and sets were also great. The books don't take place in any particular time. Technology ranges from very modern to very old fashioned. The movie did a great job in using costumes that were a bit of a twist on victorian styles fused in a world with modern sensibilities. It was a great look and feel In short: I want Violet's dress.The inclusion of Snicket's narration was a real treat. It has always been one of my favorite parts of the book. Seeing Mr. Snicket in the flesh (even if it was only a silhouette, or from the back), sneaking around a clock tower to write down the depressing chapters of the Baudelaire's story was great. Jude Law captured Snicket's voice very well.This is a fine example to all other filmmakers who wish to make successful adaptations of beloved books. They really outdid themselves.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I remember him from Road to perdition. Even if it was a small part, I think the guy as a good future in the movie business.The girl (Violet) was very good I liked her a lot. I haven't seen the other movie she plays in. But I sure do hope we'll be seeing a lot of her in the coming years. She's a good actress and we could get rid of Kirsten Dunst which is a real disaster.The Sunny character (the baby) is very well played for a baby. It is very funny.

325,Franco_Zed,Jim Carrey fails to ruin this Charmer,8,25 August 2007,"MY BIASES: I had not read any of the books. I am a very big J. Carrey fan, but a couple of his characters seriously get on my nerves. His version of the Grinch was one. Count Olaf is another.I watched Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (LSASOUE) on a whim with low expectations. The lukewarm reception from critics lowered my expectations. So, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. The Cream of the Crop of Critics on Rottentomatoes.com gave LSASOUE an average score of 6.5/10. It was recommended by 58% of them. Both of these numbers seem too low to me. Anyway, on to the movie itself Despite his best efforts, Jim Carrey failed to ruin this movie. He was overpowered by the low-key charm of Snicket and the Baudelaires. For those of you who haven't been exposed to these kids yet, the Baudelaires are 3 orphans, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire who are 14, 12, and 1 years old, respectively. They come from Lemony Snicket's series of books, A Series of Unfortunate Events. I don't know how these characters and young actors could possibly be more charming. Violet is an inventor, or more accurately, a McGuyver, Klaus is a bookworm and fountain of knowledge, and Sunny is an extremely capable baby who can do amazing things with her teeth. A nice quirk is that Violet always ties her hair up when she needs to think and work on solving a physical problem. The two older kids are very sensible and relatively calm in the face of calamity. They constantly cooperate to look after their baby sister and to get themselves out of trouble. One of the two older kids is frequently carrying Sunny around. Lemony Snicket is the narrator, who is clearly emotionally invested in these kids and it feels like he may actually have been more involved in this story than he's letting on. He's played by Jude Law and he reminds you at regular intervals that maybe you should go watch some other, nicer movie. He constantly apologizes for the grimness of the lives of the poor Baudelaires.The wealthy parents of the Baudelaire Orphans died in a fire and so the banker, Mr. Poe, has to find new guardians for them, but the gimmick of the ASOUE stories is that none of the guardians work out. So Mr. Poe is constantly ferrying the Baudelaire Orphans from one inappropriate guardian to another. The guardians are usually stupid, or evil, or get killed, or some combination of the three things.Jim Carrey plays the first guardian, Count Olaf. I loved Ace Ventura, The Mask, and all of Carrey's more serious roles, but movies like the Grinch, Liar Liar, Cable Guy, and Me, Myself & Irene just got on my nerves. Count Olaf is in the ""got on my nerves"" department. Count Olaf appears in disguise playing other characters and fortunately, one of these characters I did like. Jim Carrey is in full-on thunderous over-acting mode here, and I guess that can go very right or very wrong. Count Olaf is constantly trying to kill, maim, or marry one of the Baudelaires in order to get access to the Baudelaire fortune. Two other guardians are played with wacky enthusiasm by Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep, of all people.LSASOUE has things in common with Harry Potter, Moulin Rouge, and the Princess Bride. All 4 films have some insane adult villains in period-like costumes. They all have a lot of humour, but an edge of seriousness, lurking behind the jokes. They all throw reality out the window in favour of fable-style story telling. They all have an extremely colourful cast of bizarre characters. They all have passionate protagonists who are highly principled and function as heroes. But LSASOUE has a gloomy, low-key quality that I really enjoyed. It has a fresh, very specific tone or feeling that I have not seen before. I think LSASOUE is worth watching because, at very least, you will see something you haven't seen before.I think this sense of originality also means that other people's opinions of this movie may not be a good predictor of your opinion. If your brother says Die Hard 3 is bad (or good) and you like the same films, then maybe you should trust his opinion. But if a movie is a little farther out of the mainstream, your opinions may not match up as well as they usually do. Basically the more unusual a movie is, the less predictable the audience response will be. Don't you think? I feel like this review needs editing. Perhaps I should be a little like Lemony Snicket and try to persuade you not to read it. Anyway, take a look at LSASOUE if you feel like watching a kids' film that is a little unusual and less frenetic than most similar films.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I didn't really enjoy the film and that's a real shame. You couldn't really find fault with the set and costumes, they did give a real kooky sort of feel to whole thing but the story, surprisingly, just wasn't there. I'm left wondering having seen earlier comments, whether stretching such short stories out into a feature film was just doomed or if there was something else missing for me.I like stories with evil adults and larger than life characters doing really audacious things but these moments were icebergs adrift in a sea of dullness. Jim Carey's Count Olaf was definitely the most interesting of the outrageous characters but it wasn't enough to pep it up for me. Timothy Spall did a good job as Mr.Poe but his character didn't get up to too much really.

(Having such wildly wacky sets in a live action film constantly takes me out of the picture.) Acting was top notch from the kids. I had heard good things about Jim Carrey's performance, and I am a big Carrey fan. To me it just felt wrong though. I thought he was way too over-the-top considering the evil role he had. The funny parts made me snicker and even laugh a time or two, but they ended up being few and far between. They needed to either have a genuine serious villain and a dark film, or have more comedy and make it watchable in this fashion.I was severely bored in a few places, and I hope all the kids who read the books see this a couple times each; because those who haven't will probably be bored. The younger side of the audience doesn't have a prayer. I have heard the books are quite good, and I read the author was involved in the production. He apparently thought it was a great adaptation, helped out with it himself, and didn't care if the book story was changed or not. This puzzles me because it seems like I could sense that the source material could be very good, but the film didn't capture it right. But I guess the author did.

With all there possessions lost, and there parents fortune not accessible till Violet is of age they go live with they closest relative, the dreaded, horrible, nasty, disgusting, evil Count Olaf (Jim Carrey)! With giving too much away some appearances from Billy Connely as Uncle Monty and Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine are very entertaining and well acted but the plaudits for this film have to go to Jim Carrey, the perfect man to play the Evil Olaf/Stephano/Captain something! He is excellent and although the scenes with the children are entertaining you are waiting for Jim to appear on screen.The film is different from the books, yes! but having read the books this film is jumbled up but done so well it leaves you with a happy ending, for now of course! The film is very dark and damp, for a kids film it is the darkest about because I'm 20 and Olaf is a scary man, the film is also very slow moving and little clues to whats going on are dropped not often but to not do a sequel of this film would be criminal! Now time for my rating, well I really did enjoy it, and when thinking of a film to compare it to I was lost, this really is a one of its kind!

332,morbidnate,"Beautiful, artful.",10,1 April 2005,"I had the privilege of watching this film three times in theaters and I have to say that it is a stunning achievement in movie making.I can understand people's distaste for Jim Carrey, since he becomes the central character (sharing the spotlight with the very talented child cast) where he should merely remain a villain.The adaptation to the books is quite tight, keeping in mind that it is a combination of three of the books, not just one. That being said and all acting aside, this movie is just mind blowing.The technique used to capture the surreal surroundings the Baudelaire orphans travel through is one that should be marked and used again. The art designers went back to the days of old(film-making) where painted backdrops, elaborate sets and extensive make-up drove the point.An excellent example of what I mean is the scene where the children are left on the train tracks and Count Olaf goes into a store to wait until the kids have been run over. The entire surrounding in the scene, the corn fields, train tracks, skyline, etc. is a painted backdrop. It is simply unbelievable.Another example of what I mean is Count Olaf's house, where the Baudelaire orphans are first sent to live. It is Gothic, run down, and perfect.Besides the Oscar this movie received for make-up, Rick Heinrichs and Cheryl Carasik truly deserved to win their nomination for best art direction. This aspect is definitely the one that stands out among all others...The music was damned good as well...",A Series of Unfortunate Events
333,tmcnabb104,Less than the sum of its parts,7,13 January 2005,"The wife and I went to see Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events at the Kenrick Theater Saturday. We both agreed to check it out, using some gift certificates I've been hoarding since my birthday.Unfortunate Events details a slice out of the life of three orphans whose parents perished in a tragic fire. The children are placed in the care of Count Olaf, played by Jim Carey  weirdness ensues.The Baudelaire Orphans, as the narrator refers to them often, are themselves exceptional. Emily Browning plays Violet, and captures a winsome mix of plucky and vulnerable. Violet is clever and inventive, cobbling together contrivances and developing solutions to their perils. Liam Aiken is Klaus, who ably portrays the younger brainy brother whose voracious appetite for learning provides impetus for Violet's inventiveness. Sunny is an adorable toddler whose contribution is her ability to bite (and be otherwise amazingly well-behaved).The movie is surreal and incongruent, which is to be expected. The settings are Victorian, like turn of the century England. Most of the adults have mannerisms that we associate with England, but everyone is American. It's a little odd.Piled onto this oddness is the ick factor of watching children being pursued by a murderous villain. As funny as Carey makes Olaf, the fact is that the man ends up attempting dreadful things, actions that would land any child in therapy for years. On the other hand, it is rewarding to see children be tough and work to overcome their problems rather than curl up and suffer slings and arrows. The adults in their lives are at best negligent idiots. Against outrageous circumstances the trio stand, surviving by their wits, will and cooperation.The visuals are a real treat, particularly if you like the Victorian era. The set pieces and props show tremendous attention to creating a world that resembles something we are familiar with, but is distorted enough to take the edge off the truly awful nature of the unfortunate events of the movie's title.Jim Carey absolutely chews up the screen. As part of the plot he adopts several personas, and he completely owns his scenes. I would say that the weakness of the movie is the strength of Carey's performance. We have a natural sympathy toward the orphans, and while they do good work capturing the essence of enterprise, Carey's antics are so overwhelming that the movie becomes too much about his character, and we just don't like him.That said, the film has funny moments. Irrational fears about household items turn out to not be so irrational after all, and Dustin Hoffman makes a cameo appearance that is amusing and inexplicably brief.In summary, Lemony Snicket's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' is an enjoyable but flawed movie. The visuals are excellent as are the performances of the protagonists. Carey is at his rubber-bodied best, but that ends up distracting. The film has a dark theme, but not one a kid over eight couldn't deal with.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
334,weirdophreak17,One of the Best Literary Adaptations I've Seen in Years,10,18 December 2004,"**MILD SPOILERS** This film does not follow the books word for word, which is impossible to do. It comes amazingly close, however, and the scenes reserved for the events of each of the three books featured are staged with the greatest of faithfulness to the original text. Additions to the film include some strong exposition for the Baudelaire Orphan's family and the intrigue to come. The ordering was changed for the sake of melding the three books seamlessly. The ending for book one is moved to the end of the film, which I have no complaints for, seeing as how book one's ending seemed the most complete and the most thrilling.What I appreciated most about this film was its strict attentiveness to NOT changing certain aspects of the books that might be considered unsavory in most cases: for instance, I thought the moment where Count Olaf struck Klaus in a fit of anger would surely be cut from the movie -- it's Nikelodeon, after all (and it is also removed in the PS2 version of the video game -- he just throws food). This is not so. The darker scenes of the books still exist and are portrayed in a manner which fits Snicket's narration oh so delightfully.As for the actors: Nothing but praise, especially for Jim Carey, in a role that he was made to play (and for once his characteristic energy and ham did not make me wince for even a second). The character he has taken here is that of a hokey, but still cunning and resourceful actor. The perfect role for him, I'd say. His characacture (sp?). This is what Jim Carey would be had he just a little less talent, 2 pints more corn, and a subtly concealed bloodlust. Beautiful performance. The children are brilliant, the two portraying Violet and Klaus play off of one another beautifully, and Sunny was a joy to watch (and read!) and most certainly got as many laughs as Count Olaf.This is not just a kid's movie, as some humor will be better appreciated by adults, and some of the darker scenes and subtleties may be better understood as well. There are one or two shocks that may make your younger kids jump (I took my six year old niece with me to see it, and she jumped and hid once or twice), but all in all it is a treat for all ages. I intend to see it again as soon as time will allow me.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

336,tokenyon,Worthwhile Viewing,8,31 October 2005,"I have to admit before attending this film I had paid little attention to the (increasingly) popular collections of books, Lemony Snicket's 'A Series of Unforunate Events'. I can certainly say that a post-movie reading of the books does highlight a certain charm perhaps that is missing from the film, not to say that the movie is at all unsuccessful. In fact, taking the movie as a whole makes a rather impressive experience. Silbering's directing is certainly competent, but more impressive is the use of Burtonesque sets (in places spectacularly put together) which draw the audience into a sort uncertain timeless land. Others have pointed to this uncertainty as a flaw in the film, the world itself in terms of technology and time placement is confusing but to me it works; we glance at a world of childhood fantasy and design, a mix of old and new, things don't always have to fit. The usual criticisms can (and perhaps must) be made of child actors, but in many places the script does not draw out their characters enough. The slightly moralising (but not always in a bad way) 'there's always something' theme of the film is used in a number of beautifully put together scenes but not enough emphasis is put on how this relates to the true abilities of the children. We need to know more, see more of the 'inventing' and 'thinking'. Not a Carrey fan, but I am pleased with his performance within the film, although it distinctly overshadows the roles of the children. Merryl Streep delivers a magnificent performance as the paranoid aunt, and Billy Connolly is certainly good enough to carry his sequence forward. Criticisms of the episodic nature of the film are reasonable, it certainly feels as though we are being carried from book to book; although it does reflect the feeling of the children as they are thrown between guardians.Overall a highly successful film, with some breathtaking scenery and superb acting. It does have its flaws but if you look beyond them you can discover a film that delivers much.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The scenery is so bleak, grey and depressing...the landscape looked like a surreal nuclear wasteland; burnt out trees,and no light at all. Dour expressions and crazy people spewing gibberish. I haven't read any of the books, and I realized it would have some ""dark' gallows like humor, but I felt a kind of unease in the pit of my stomach through the whole thing. Just as I started to relate to a character, they would meet some terrible end, and everyone was just plain insane. Kind of like spending 90 minutes in a bad dream in an insane asylum. I get enough of that on the freeway. Yes, there was a little humor in there. A lot wasn't connected or explained. What was the meaning of the spyglass all these people had? Why did Olaf have the eye on his ankle? Harry Potter is dark but at least it makes some sense and has a plot that can be followed. Jim Carrey was really good and you could almost smell him through the screen. I can't help think that this movie would have done much better if it hadn't been so morbid and dark, especially being marketed to kids. It's like the Grinch movie that scared all the little kids to death because the Grinch was SO over the top. The Grinch movie was kind of a bust for that reason. I felt that most of the people who saw the movie, young and old alike felt slightly traumatized by the whole thing.

Jim Carrey(under Bruce Campbell) is my favorite actor. His performance as Count Olaf is one for the books. Even though The Count didn't have much humor in the books. The acting was great. Emily Browning is going to grow up and be a wonderful actress. She's soooo HOTT!!!!

I really liked Director Brad Siberling's ""Moonlight Mile"" as a story and movie. There must have been too much material to edit down to make ""Unfortunate Events"" equally as good. My son, who HAS read the books, said that Meryl Streep gave a marvelous performance as Aunt Josephine, true to Handler's character. ""Unfortunate Events"" is a remarkable visual masterpiece.

I am not fond of the reviews I have seen though, with parents saying how bad this movie is for their kids, because of course you would not take an 8 year old to see this movie an expect them to understand it. This movie is meant for kids who are old enough to read and appreciate the books and adults who enjoy Tim Burtan-esk type films. It was a dark artsie film and for this I have much admiration and give respect to its director. The only thing that took away from the movie was the baby, Sunny. I thought the character, and the way she interacted with the rest of the characters was a little over the top, but then again I have never read the books so I do not know how it ties in with everything in the original work. I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys darker films because although the movie does have a good message it is kind of depressing. No less beautiful though.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

He totally ruined it!I am a huge Lemony Snicket fan, but this piece of crap that Mr. Gordon pulled out of his arse was terrible! I had a high expectation, I really hoped it would be as well as the books, but of course, I was terribly wrong! I think that the funniest thing about all of this is that it costed $125,000,000 to produce and it was only about 90 minutes long! The first three books weren't even followed very well! I mean the first book was covered in about 16 minutes. Throughout the rest, they continuously jumped throughout the 3 books and generally skipped PLENTY important parts that played a major key role in the story. The lamest thing I can think of about this movie is that the ending had the Baudelaire parents miraculously survive. I mean OMG, they are dead! The director, Mr. Silberling has yet again been proved untrustworthy, and would NEVER, EVER continue directing, especially for Robert Gorden, who was the main reason that this movie blew! He ruined ""Men in Black"", and now Mr. Lemony Snicket's books. I think that this could have been done a lot better with a different crew. The cast however, Brilliant! Although Mr. Carey wasn't my choice for Count Olaf, he was OK... I guess. There was still many flaws to be fixed. As for the screenplay... They left out about 3/4 of all the books, tossed the remains into a blender, put it on puree, then spread it about on a old cookie sheet and OVER cooked it. 1st part of the movie: Way way too short. They left out many parts that was very important especially how Violet saved Sunny from the tower. And weren't the Baudelaires suppose to meet Justice Strauss a few times? Well, thats Mr. Gordon for you Eh???2nd part: Woah! It was way too rushed! Next time instead of combining 3 books, do us a favor and take time to appreciate ALL 3 of them for f*cking god sakes!!! Not only was the timing off, but all of the elements, including the kidnapping were deleted.3rd Part: Started out as OK, It didn't seem rushed until the dinner scene was brought up. Then it was rushed. The lamest part was that the play ""The Marvelous Marrige"" was suppose to be in the first part, not after the 3rd. And I mean, how could they possibly rearrange everything and not expect the audience to be confused?? Overall: Count Olaf should have been crueler, less silly, more abusive, physically, and mentally. And he wasn't suppose to be captured, I mean Lemony (as Jude law) said clearly at the beginning that it didn't have a happy ending, but instead, Count Olaf made it to jail, and it seemed that they all took the books and took it in a completely different direction.

343,mark-1493,A Warning.. Of sorts...,5,9 January 2005,"This film, although starring one of my all time favorite comedic actors (side note: Jim Carrey is a great dramatic actor as well), is NOT a comedy. Also, although it may appear so in the ads, this is NOT a family movie, and frankly, I'm not quite sure I would want my preteen to see this. That is the warning part. To be honest though, they never did say this was a happy story. Wink!The movie is somewhat disturbing in many parts. It has a plethora of miserable plot events, by miserable I mean sad and morbid.Positives for the movie would have to be decent special effects and nice cinematography on behalf of the camera work. They definitely deliver the dark mood they wanted to impress upon viewers.Now, if you have read the book(s) and are looking for the big screen version, you may not be disappointed by this movie. I felt that the character interaction could have used a bit more depth, or even activity for that matter. Most of the roles were very flat, but that was intentional and not due to any lack of acting skills.Overall, I did not really enjoy this movie, but that was no major shocker for me, I did not enjoy reading any of the series either.

However, I was more than pleased with the children in the movie. Who doesn't love a smart-alec baby who can bite ANYTHING?

I'm not saying Carrey is bad though. In fact he is my favourite actor! I just think that his funny jumpy personality is not really suitable for this kind of movie.

Also, I only gave it as high as a 3 because some of the jokes did succeed in making me laugh.I can recall the first time ever seeing the previews for this movie. As soon as I discovered that Jim Carrey would be playing Count Olaf, I died a little inside. He seemed very wrong for the part of a greedy, treacherous villain with no regard for anyone or anything but himself and money. Upon seeing this movie, my suspicions and worst fears were confirmed, and in fact, came to life.A comedy actor should never have been casted as Olaf, no matter what anyone says. Although Olaf does occasionally crack ""jokes"" in the book, they are cruel or ignorant, and not meant specifically to appeal to the audience as they did in the movie. Olaf's jokes are there with the worst intentions, and personally as a reader, I can concur that they are in place to make the audience feel worse for the Baudelaire children, not by any means to have us laughing.Also, I can't help but wonder why the first 3 books were meshed into one movie. Each book had enough content to make a movie a piece. And even if there were feelings that solely one book would not have enough appeal, then 2 books would have done just fine. To those who object, you cannot deny that the plot seemed hurried and random. The events were so out of place it was ridiculous; they go to Olaf's (book one), he tries to get them hit by a train (not in any books, and an absurd concept considering he wants their fortune, and they'd all be dead if this plan to succeed!), off to Uncle Monty's (book two), then to Aunt Josephine's (book three), and finally the wedding (book one, again). And of course, they can't possibly end the movie without discovering some truths about the fire that killed their parents. Yes, truths that in reality they didn't start discovering until book 6: ""The Ersatz Elevator"".If you have read the books, do not see it. If you haven't, go right ahead and watch it.

The reviews here pumped me up, and I thought that it would be as if I was whisked away to a land like that of Harry Potter. You should know that I really am not that interested in Harry Potter, however I did see the first and second films and will admit they are well done, I just don't care about the story. Here I was hoping for an opportunity to be put in as fantastical a world (or at least as rich of one) but with a different story, perhaps one I could care about.Unfortunately none of that came to fruition.The movie is riddled with terrible colloquialisms that I can only guess were ad-libbed, probably by a highly self-satisfied Carrey. I highly doubt that in one of the books appears a phrase such as ""I'll give him the old wax-on, wax-off"" (is he reusing ad-lib...well, I guess everyone's humor is predictable if you have to hear it enough). Or that the child is quoted as having mumbled ""bite me"". Or that the police officer ends any of his phrases with "", man!"" The effect of this is to immediately pull me OUT of the film and make me think to myself ""what did they do THAT for?"" The movie has terrible incidental music. So ill-suited for the scenes in which it was used, I was again pulled out of the film world -- continually asking myself, ""did someone watch this scene, with this music, and think it looked GOOD?"" Honestly. There were actually times when the score sounded reminiscent of the score from The Rock. Maybe married with Powaqqatsi. Maybe you don't know what music I am describing, but suffice it to say it's not what you are expecting to hear at certain parts of the film. And that's not a good thing in an innovative sense or anything like that.There was one actually interesting unfortunate event. The first time that Olaf tries to destroy the children. I thought we were setting the stage here for a movie filled with the children using their heads to get out of unfortunate event after another, sort of like MacGyver. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie went something like this. Something that made no sense happened, then I was left forced to assume that whatever happened did make sense because so many people seem to like this film. But in retrospect none of it did. For one example, when watching the final ""unfortunate"" event, ask yourself...how did the children ever allow themselves to arrive at that situation? Had we been forced to watch the entire timeline (instead of the film making the HUGE cut it did from the previous scene), everything that they would have had to have done to arrive where they are would have been horribly out of character.Ah yes, one more thing. If I weren't forced every moment to think to myself ""hey, that's Dustin Hoffman"" or ""boy, I didn't know Meryl Streep could act so poorly"" (in other words, if they would have used a few less big names which I am sure they were using to make extra sure that I would go away convinced that the movie was pure gold), then maybe I could have stayed at least a little bit inside of the film. As it was, though, this did not happen.Yes, my companion and I repeatedly looked at one another, rolling our eyes and asking how this movie ever got released in the sorry state it did.Before I part, never again to dump any money into any films from this franchise, I have to ask... Is there not one person involved with the film that knows the difference between grammatical errors and spelling errors? Well, it's a good thing that movies aren't the primary educational source of children these days....right? .... .... right?",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Jim Carrey's costumes will get a good series of inner chuckles out of you, but so will all those funky cliffs, caves, and cages in and around the relatives' kooky abodes. Unlike Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Snicket is also good storytelling--considering the obstacles.If you haven't read the books, this film makes perfect sense, having taken only the main narrative threads from the original weaving to hold the film's three chapters together, taking a few liberties with dramatic emphasis to condense three stories into one.Bottom line--it's good fun, even if you're 22, as long as you can pardon the story for being a bit childish.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

This was an even worse adaptation than the Harry Potter movies. The acting by all of the cast were great. Jim Carrey was a perfect Count Olaf. The visuals were great.The previews made it look promising. Which shows the genius of money and marketing.I know that film from book adaptations have to be different. But great writing would forgive all that. In this film, they tried to squeeze three books into one which was a huge mistake. They left out important items and added in ridiculous items.

The kids go through very sick events without any regards to what the audience might think. Murders left and right. But just to give you an idea of how perverted these filmmakers are I'll describe one scene. At the end, Jim Carrey has established himself as pure evil. He is forcing the fourteen-year-old girl to marry him so that he will get the inheritance. To make sure that the girl complies, he has her little baby sister hanging from the top of a building and will drop the baby if she says no. Then the filmmakers try to redeem themselves by having a cute moral: even though bad things happen, endure and go to your ""happy place."" Skip this one.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

But as it progressed, the scenery and story line improved, and was enjoyable to watch, at least for what it was worth. If your'e not a big Carey fan, don't waste your money. If you are, I'm sure you'll love this movie. I guess I can say it was cute, and somewhat predictable. So if you don't mind those kind of movies, you'll give this a ten.

But watching it recently, I realized how truly amazing it was. I think that I enjoyed it more now that I was older because I got a lot more of the jokes. It was also great as an actor to hear all the theater jokes Jim Carrey did as Count Olaf. Speaking of which, I thought that he did an excellent job. Aside from being very funny, I thought he did a great job with the sinisterness of Olaf. The kids are all very good. As always, Meryl Streep was brilliant. Timothy Spall was the perfect Mr. Poe! The only thing I would have wanted in this movie was more of the acting troupe. On the DVD, there are some outtakes and deleted scenes of Olaf interacting with his troupe, played by a group of truly hilarious performers (including the brilliant Jennifer Coolodge).

360,Evariyun,wonderfully refreshing,10,24 June 2005,"i really didn't expect this movie to be good, although i find children's movies more entertaining than most adult movies. so i was watching this movie with my family, and it started out showing Nicalodean advertisement etc. and seemed rather childish through the opening credits. then it took a twist. the movie was fast paced and very engaging. in a few minutes i was hooked. the story is of three siblings (one of which is a baby) who lose their parents in an 'accidental' fire. they live in a rather big home before that, basically implying they were wealthy, so with insurance and all that, they have this huge fortune and some sort of secret behind them and their parents. so throughout their orphaned journey they meet many thoroughly animated characters such as their 'dear' uncle count Olaf... who is mysteriously related to them... third cousin twice removed or something of that sort. this man is greedy and very self indulgent and not to forget self centered and another unmentionable word. he basically wants to seize the fortune from the children anyway he can. the effects very mysterious and focused. the acting maybe over dramatic and a little 'overboard' but still marvelous and entertaining, and the baby, is just adorable and happened to be the favorite character of all, especially after the fact... well he proves that uncle Montgomery's's death was not an accident... check the movie out and see for yourself. it will remind you in a way of 'the nightmare before Christmas'... the soundtrack is awesome. i cant wait for part two or whatever it is that will follow. Jim Carey of course was awesome, but i guess a lot of people are getting tired of his antics, but personally he did a great job. Meryl Streep was hysterical and paranoid, but very honorable. Cedric the Entertainer had a surprising and outstanding presence. Dustin Hoffman was stout yet persistent.

361,imdb-4336,A modern fairy tale - Brothers Grimm style,8,29 December 2004,"First of all, it's a beautiful movie to look at, in a dark, sepia-toned kind of way. The visual style is very similar to the Borrowers movie (come on, surely someone remembers that?). The location and period are indeterminate, with a mish-mash of anachronistic props, confusing dilations of time and distance, and a mixture of British and US actors adding to the lack of any sense of place or time. Then there's the plot - obviously ludicrous, and full of adults whose inability to identify a thinly-disguised Jim Carey at a hundred yards requires a serious suspension of disbelief.But then, that's the point. This is a fairy tale, and like most fairy tales it picks and chooses between reality and fantasy as required. The closing credit sequence, reminiscent of shadow-puppet plays, reinforces the message: we are in a dream world of heroes and villains, where nothing is as it seems. Also, like most traditional fairy tales, it features a fair amount of nasty moments.Once you accept this basic fact, the film's not bad at all. Jim Carey is - for him - very restrained (though by anyone else's standards it would still count as gross overacting) while the lead children put in excellent performances. Timothy Spall continues to stake his claim as a top character actor, while Billy Connolly unfortunately seems to be doing a Jim Carey impersonation.This is a sophisticated film - far more so than Harry Potter - and I'd suggest that kids below 10 won't get it unless they're particularly tuned to it. Younger children will be more frightened by this movie than they would be by more overtly violent movies, if only because of the sense of menace that pervades. Conversely, if you're an adult, you'll need to abandon any attempt to make sense of the story and accept it with a childlike sense of wonder. If you can do that, you'll enjoy yourself.It's not a classic, but it's reassuring to know that Hollywood still has space for eccentric goodies like this.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

They did not stay true to the book at all and tried to put 3 amazing books into one movie. In truth if I had not read the wonderful books I would have found this movie great but I did read the books and found the movie a highlight of some of the parts from the books all thrown into a movie that did not even begin to cover the greatness of the books. Jim Carrey is did an amazing job with this movie,like all his other movies but if a great actor is given a bad movie there is nothing they can do.

For a start, the books just don't seem like the sort that should be turned into a film. I don't think Mr Snicket adapted it himself, either. There was so much sentiment and emotion in this film that I almost threw up. The same things would be said over and over again and I just didn't feel sorry for them. I was bored of their moaning. Does that make me heartless and cruel? Also, there was not enough explanation of anything. They just kept coming up with things from nowhere. Having read the books, I knew roughly how they ended up in the places that they did, but I still felt a little in the dark about it all. Speaking of which, the plot seemed to have come from a completely different book. So many brilliant and clever ideas were missed out, and whole new things were put in altogether. They might as well have given the film a completely different name. It seemed unnecessary to have compressed 3 books into one film because they were getting each guardian over and done with in about 2 days. They were out of Olaf's care within 10 minutes. Everything seemed very rushed and pointless. I expected something awful, and that's what I got. I was cringing all the way through. And telling Mr Carrey to get off the screen (even though he can't here me) because his interpretation of Count Olaf was dire. He's just too Jim Carrey-ish.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Jim Carrey did a great job playing Count Olaf. Emily Browning and Liam Aiken did a good job as well. I would however like to say, that I like Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings better. Harry Potter is more likely to be a classic, for it is more magical, and it is more popular, look how much money the author J.K. Rowling has made. She's richer than the queen of England.Oh, and few movies even compare to Lord of the Rings, let alone, be better. There aren't many that can say honestly they've done better.

365,kjtocool21,A fantasy lacking a background.,7,18 December 2004,"Please visit my website and check out the forums: www.worldofkj.comLemony Snicket's: A Series of Unfortunate Events By: Karl Schneider Afantasy lacking a background.It was a Friday night, and one without a lot going on around my parents home in Georgia. I decided to gather up my sister and head to a movie, figuring that I could at least do away with this boredom for a few hours. My little brother who is still tottering his way through grade school had ditched us to go out with his girlfriend, coincidently to see a movie, which when you think about it is quite embarrassing. So it was just the two of us, and I decided that we would see Lemony Snicket's, figuring that it was a solid choice for the both of us.Lemony Snicket's turned out to be this peculiar movie about three young children who's parents were killed in a fire. The children with nowhere to go, are sent off to live with a distant relative Count Olaf (Jim Carey) who it turns out could really benefit from a trip to the dentist (does AFLAC cover that?). Soon the children are being whipped around from relative to relative, with Olaf constantly disguising himself trying to regain custody and control of their vast fortune. The movie has its fill of humor, though not as much as one might expect. Carey turns in a good but underused performance which was constantly overshadowed by the toddler Sunny, who managed in subtitles to produce more laughs than Carey in all his makeup.What really struck me about this movie was its settings. The scenery was so amazingly dark and eerie, yet shockingly empty, leaving the film out of touch with its own world. It is hard to describe how such vividly detailed scenes can be so vacant. Take a quick look at a scene from any Harry Potter movie and you will quickly see the attention paid to background action. Action which Lemony Snicket completely lacked. The scenery while dark and amazingly unique, left you feeling empty and craving more. Unable to place the story in a world of its own, I was left confused and bored as the story unfolded. Unfortunately the story was no better than the scenery, also being deprived of any meaning and filled with more holes than Count Olaf's house. The movie seemed at times to grasp for this higher ground, one where it could tie up at least one of its many loose ends, but alas I think that ground was lost somewhere on the cutting floor along with the background action.The movie does work, it is entertaining, and I didn't walk away from it feeling like I had wasted my time. It is just really to bad that such a good premise, with such a solid cast was wasted by such a shoddy story. It is hard to place the blame all on Robert Gordon, who penned the screenplay, but in the end you have to. I know three books into one movie is a sometimes impossible task to accomplish, but it simply could have been done better.Go see the movie, you may be underwhelmed at the end of it all, but it really is a decent movie with a good family message.Grade: C",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The one moment that could have been exciting was interrupted for a joke... which wasn't very funny...But yesss, this film isn't about the excitement its about the humour right? Which more than often falls flat more often than not.... Jude Law's narration is boring and read with little expression...It's not so much the actors as the script... Billy Connelly seems to try his hardest with the material but its too dull for even is outstanding humour to have an effect. In the end coming off as a charming, if somewhat lifeless professor. The kids are ample - but fail to insert any life into the movie...However... From the first time he is on the screen to the last moment Jim Carrey is excellent, bringing life to the dead (so to speak). His performance is hilarious and is the only reason you should wish to see this film...I haven't read the books, but its seems Count Olav (Carrey) will be back for a sequel, and if they fix up the script and liven up the characters it could be a sure fire hit...See it for Carrey's performance alone... 6/10 P.S.

Also, does the world really need another movie about unloved orphans? My sister justifies the bad and rushed ""plot"" by telling me that it is three books combined into one movie, but I don't think that really justifies anything.

Don't get me wrong, I was all choked up at the end, but it really made me appreciate the strength of the children, and made me admire their characters more. I loved this movie, from the incredible scenery, costumes, makeup and characters. Even the ending credits are fun to watch. Jim Carey was... Jim Carey, and I thought he was perfectly hate-able, which I believe the intention was. The children were great, especially in expressing their depth of emotion. The only disappointment I had was not finding out all the Baudelaire secrets, I know there are others books (and I assume other movies) but I never like a cliffhanger - hopefully the others will come out quickly.

It was very different from the books, but that is not fully bad. Most movies based on books were like that until Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Now we expect them to be exact, word for word. Jim Carrey portrayed the vile Count Olaf very well, and the children were spectacular. Meryl Streep (Aunt Josephine), Billy Connolly (Uncle Monty), Timothy Spall (Mr. Poe and Wormtail in Prisoner of Azkaban), and Jude Law (Lemony Snicket) also did a fantastic job of portraying their characters. The Littlest Elf beginning was a little goofy, but the rest of the movie was amazing. It left room for a sequel, but ended it well in case they never got around to it.

It would have been better to maybe just base the movie on just two of the books. The plot moves very quickly throughout the movie. The lack of restrain of Jim Carrey is a bit ridiculous and annoying. They tried to make Count Olaf more funny and less cruel instead of evil, like he was in the books. The sets were perfect and the children were really well cast. Liam and Emily were really good and natural actors. It annoys me how in movies they always move some of the main parts from the girl character to the boy. In the books it was violet who looked after her siblings but in the movie it was Klaus who climbed the tower, Klaus who saves Sunny, Klaus who destroys the marriage document, Klaus who decoded the message in the note, Klaus who sees the connection of the spy glasses. In the books Violet did some of those things instead. I also think it was better left a mystery to who burnt down the Baudelaire Mansion like the books, in the movie they revealed that it was Count Olaf. It would have worked better if they had stuck to the books abut more. Overall a good movie with good child actors and sets that represented the books fairly well.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The first thing that grips you is the fantastic set design and atmosphere; a lavishly Gothic, Tim-Burton-esquire world colliding with the 21st century in several quite delightful ways. If this doesn't get a Oscar nomination for its artistry, there is no justice in this world. But without a good story or characters, a film is nothing and Lemony Snicket wins on both counts. For a kid's film, the story is (generally) unsentimental, and one can forgive the few moments where sentiment does creep in. Admittedly, it does seem somewhat bitty at times, and I occasionally felt that they could have added a bit more background but otherwise its a engrossing, original, darkly amusing romp. As for the characters...Lemony Snicket has some of the best child acting I've seen in my life, the supporting characters all act with flair and humour; and as for Jim Carrey's Count Olaf and his ridiculous disguises- I personally feel it's his best comic performance in years and overshadows even the brilliantly cast Meryl Streep and Billy Connolly.

I did not much appreciate the secret magnifying eye in the tower that came into play at the end of the movie. And it also seemed that Carrey was overplayed. I mean, he is Count Olaf, but it would have been almost fitting to name the movie Jim Carrey's Series of Unfortunate Events. Maybe just a bit to much Carrey, and not enough Olaf; but Carrey still did an excellent job of portraying the villain. The film felt too rushed with three of the novels smashed together, and I felt as if something was missing, maybe no chance to take it all in. Not enough time to retrospect. Plus, with middle-schoolers' spitballs flying in your face, it can be hard to focus. Maybe attending opening night was a bad idea... The three books adapted-- The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window (this book probably had the best adaptation) are presented quickly but concisely. The main events of the books happen in the film (albeit not in bookly order), and we do get a decent unfortunate ending. The Littlest Elf played a vital role, but he was a bit too present for my taste. I know that Lemony Snicket had quite an ordeal to get his story to the screen (his public person, Daniel Handler wrote eight or nine drafts of the screenplay before getting kicked off the project). They got new directors and producers, fired the triplets (not the Quagmires) who were to play Sunny, and hired a pair of twins (again, not the Quagmires) instead. I wonder what Handler's book-to-screen versions were like. Sorry, I'm sounding like Snicket himself, I really did enjoy the film, but I know many kids will be a bit sad that the books were changed. So, if you haven't read the books, you're in for a treat. If you have, you still are in for a treat, if you ignore the changes.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
383,JackIrelandFilms,A Series of Unfortunate Tim Burton Scissorhands.,5,25 December 2004,"My Dear Friends, I often come to you with reports of movies that strike the imagination and leave you pasted to the seat where it takes an ice cream scoop just to peel you out. This is NOT one of those movies.I, like most of my secular American brethren and sistren (I know there's no such word, but look at the way the baby in this film talks!) went to see this film over X-mas day, when most cats were sweating their way through mass in one form or another. Here's the thing about this film from a filmmaker's point of view, it never really starts. Like, you expect it to at some point, but before you know it, the three kids (who were played brilliantly, and to most degrees outplayed the adult characters with their deadpan looks and delivery) the movie is over, and you're left with many a questions about just who stole the story, much less the show.Jim Carrey, I think we all can agree is an amazing actor, but he NEEDS direction in this film! It's almost like the director got to a point where Carrey is supposed to do his bit, and said ""You know what, you've been acting a lot longer than I've been directing, just come up with something."" What comes out is that Carrey over-over-overacts and often ends up stealing the entire frame, for long periods of time as the camera just holds on him and him alone until he stops to take a breath, almost like you're daddy's '76 Vomit Comet who's engine keeps turning after the motor's been killed.Really, what this entire film is, is an complete om-age to CALArts own, Tim Burton, because you see so much of Batman and Eddie Scissors-for-hands both in the framing of the shots, as well as the juxtaposition and gothicky image of characters. Violet almost could be the stand in for the Addams family girl.But the worst part about this film was the fact that it was clearly and utterly a prequel to a Part II to come in a couple of years. Remember when Part II's used to delight us? When we were surprised that Hollywood would think enough to continue some of our favorite stories, like dad agreeing to read just one more chapter before bed? This film makes no secret that there is another story following it. It might as well say on the poster ""Just go see the second one, cause we'll cover what you missed in the prequel anyway!"" And I think this is the one major flaw in the story, it's that the writer knew there was going to be a part II movie in the offing, so why delve too deeply in the first one to begin with. It's that Hollyhole franchise machine rearing it's ugly McDonalds-could-you-supersize-that head again, and ultimately, with the exception of the kid actors, turns in a terrible performance. Note to Jim: Man, next time you say yes to a script, make sure you get a director who puts some reigns on you, cause that guy was as impotent in directing you as a jayhawk. Part of being funny is holding back and letting the audience come to you, instead of you ramrodding the joke down their throats...I hope to see better out of you.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Jim Carrey is a very talented character actor, and he does a splendid job of showing the audience how deliciously evil Count Olaf can be. Meryl Streep was, as per usual, delightful. I was, however, disappointed by the tiny involvement of Justice Strauss, played by Catherine O'Hara. The costume designer did a fantastic job with all of the interpretations. My favorite pieces included Violet's black goth/edwardian dress, and Jim Carrey's ragged pinstripes. Thomas Newman did a perfect score, with which the mood was easily influenced.

I would have been interested to see a marathon movie.. and yet.. the formula of the movie is a perfect one..Jim Carrey is proving his talent in changing characters... the kids play in a natural fashion.For the young spectators.. a motivational story in case of bad things... for the older ones.. a look into life through the eyes of the children,A Series of Unfortunate Events

This such a great film, I didn't have many expectations so I'm really glad it turned out so good. Jim Carrey is, as usual, hilariously funny with almost every line. And for once i watched child actors without getting annoyed at how rubbish they were. All three kids were good actors, watchable and also very good comically. And i loved how Tim Burton-esquire this film was. I love all the sets, the costumes, the hair, the lighting. Just everything about the film was great, though i must say i was quite disappointed with the end. Throughout the film it seemed to have avoided any normal gushy morals, but we got a bucket load at the end. Anyway, although i'm not sure that very young kids will enjoy this, it is certainly a film for all the family to see, and one i intend to get as soon as it comes to DVD!!",A Series of Unfortunate Events

We are a big movie buffs. But I haft to say, this movie was not worth seeing. We were very disappointed. It wasn't really because of the actors. It was mainly that the story line stunk. My children was relieved they were able to leave, the movie once it was over. If it was any longer, I would have been the same way. The movie is one big unfortunate event after the other. (Yes I know that is what it is called.) But there should have been more mystery to this story and explain a bit more about the details of the story. All through the movie I was thinking OK now they will explain this or explore that. But they did not. It was not a cute movie. Sunny the baby is the only one who had any good lines.

388,markartis69,Release the child within!,8,21 December 2004,"A little apprehension before, throughly amused after. Without knowing any plot details or even heard of the Lemony Snicket books, I found myself watching a genuinely original film. The sensation of attending a kids-focused movie engrossed me as it did indeed bring out the child from within. I thought all of the way through that Jude Law was talking to ME, narrating through his character, a ghastly nightmare tale that kept me wanting to know the next bit.The movie flowed wonderfully from scene to scene, aided admirably by Thomas Newman's beautiful score, with the actors each providing memorable performances. However, Jim Carrey steals the show, his Count Olaf wonderfully eccentric but deviously evil at all times. The appearances by Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep bring authority to the screen in the wake of a clown-like Carrey, and the children perform well. The toddler will steal the show and is hilarious in places where peril prevails.Overall this film is must for an 8 to 14 year old but go in a expect a tale that will take you back to your childhood, scare you in places, amuse in others, but overall you'll leave wishing that innocence still existed and that all stories could be as believable as this one.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

For some reason I'm reminded slightly of the 80's flick - Labyrinth and movies similar of my childhood. This will be a classic in our home for our children. What an amazing performance by Jim Carrey who was just perfect for the part. He was brilliant. I thought it was very well written and has beautiful special effects. The main thing I love about this movie is that it took a chance to be different. It has a great (and rare) theme for children and adults as well, that life is not always sunshine and roses, there are hardships and trials and we get through them and become better people because of them. Trials in our life build character and teach us more about ourselves and the world than if we went through it without troubles. It's a creative reality check. The one thing I would say is that it's not a great movie for younger children because it deals so much with death and has some very dark/scary moments.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

391,anatomyrock,A beautiful film....but still not any good,5,27 February 2005,"Entirely forgettable.I was very very very disappointed with this film. I had looked forward to it for ages and ages, but then it totally let me down.Firstly, I very much disliked the way they put three books together and missed out most of the details, because it felt like they skimmed everything and never went into any depth. I was very annoyed at the way they changed the ending, when in the books Violet was not married to Olaf because she signed with her left hand, not that Klaus used some ridiculous thing to reflect light onto the paper and make it set alight. In the film, the fact that Olaf noticed she was using the wrong hand was completely contrary to his character.Secondly, most of the actor choices were terrible - Jim Carrey did no justice to Count Olaf whatsoever, not that the script gave him much scope. The actors playing Klaus, Sunny and Violet were far too normal to be cast in the roles, except they all did as well as they could within the script, which they did not too badly. Jude Law was not the right person to cast as Lemony Snicket, at all. As you read the books you do not think 'sex icon'. However, the performance from Meryl Streep was good, and she was cast well. Along with Uncle Monty.However, the costumes, the sets, the whole thing was beautiful. It was a very aesthetically pleasing movie, but the terrible script could still not be saved by this.I sincerely hope they make no more of these films.

He just needed to put a little emphasis into his lines. I thought they could of followed the first book better, the whole wedding scene was different, and they didn't put a lot of detail into the dialog, but i still enjoyed it.

I am told I must read the books to really understand the movie...we may see. Jim Carrey is excellent at portraying the multiple characters; he is aging gracefully. There is one phrase in the movie which sounds rather Newfie like, although ""Tell me where you're to and I'll come to where you're at"" is how I have heard it. Maybe Jim Carrey is really a Newfie instead of a British Columbian...? The kids did a great job (I must read the books to find the significance of Sunny). As an added bit of entertainment, the cinema lost power (or something) just as Violet was forming the ""e"" of her name. We got a refund.

My wife and step-daughter really liked the movie, but they are from Haiti, what do they know right? Anyway, the filming was spectacular, the DP really knows his stuff. Lighting also superb. I think with some quicker cuts to help speed up the pacing and some added info on the plot i would have enjoyed it more. Also i might add, if this movie is directed towards adults as well as children, the director must keep in mind that adults have seen every technique under the sun and should have added new technology like for instance ""sin city"" (although also having weak arrangement in story plot, sorry Robert).",A Series of Unfortunate Events
395,yodacola,wonderful,10,18 December 2004,"this is quite possibly the best kids' movie in a century. The Baudelaire orphans were played excellently by four sincere young actors (even the two babies were exceptional). The special effects were minimal, and subtle. The movie was stylistically dense and took risks that no other kids' movie dares to do. A line of cameos and surprise cast members would keep any adult interested while still managing to stay visually spectacular. It remained very true to the source material and was not afraid to be sad or scary when it would have in the books. I can't imagine this movie could have been adapted in a better way by anyone. The story was cleverly reorganized to accommodate three books and had a brilliant trick opening that fooled me. This movie is a product of the best of the best.

Although I've never read the books by Daniel Handler (born 1970) these set of children's books were first published in 1999 & the movie is very very similar.

IMDB had no mention of either Flight of the Doves or of author Walter Macken. I tried many sites including Wikipedia also and still no mention of the original.
I looked up the author of the books, Daniel Handler, to find if he had mentioned being inspired but the original book but still no mention at all.
I was flabbergasted. How could this be?
How can someone blatantly rip off someone's already published story but give no credit whatsoever?I was wondering if anyone close to Walter Macken was aware that someone is highly profiting from his original story and allegedly claiming the idea as his own?

400,NeverWinter06,A deviously dark tale,9,26 December 2004,"Three amazing children outwit and unforgettable villain in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events - a must see film for young and old this year.After Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire's parents die in a fire, they are sent to live with an uncle they have never met, Count Olaf (Jim Carey), an actor, master of disguise and evil villain.Count Olaf puts the children to work as his servants while he hatches a plan to kill them and steal their inheritance.The oldest child, Violet (Emily Browning) is an inventor, her brother Klaus (Liam Aiken) a bookworm and baby sister Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman) a sweet-faced infant with a penchant for biting and one-liners.After a near-miss with a speeding train, the children are sent to live with other relatives, Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly), and Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) while Count Olaf does his best to ensure nothing stands in the way of him getting his hands on their fortune.The Lemony Snicket series of books may have been written with children in mind but their appeal is universal with the deviously dark tale set to grab your attention from the word go.Drawn into a world of make believe, the film opens with a stern warning from the author himself (narrated by Jude Law) about the story having no happy ending, no happy beginning and very happy moments in the middle.Never fear, the charm of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events comes down to how the film's makers have managed to retain the books sharpness, black humour and compassion without drifting into Disney clichés.Breaking away from the lure of film franchises like Harry Potterwhere sequels rule, the first three books of the Lemony Snicket series have been combined to achieve a one-off movie experience (or so we think). While the film remains true to the books for the main part, the dark story has evolved in the process of bringing it to the big screen, with imagination and creative story telling making it accessible to a wider audience.Stealing scenes in the role of Coutn Olaf, Jim Carey reaches a career high. Restraining his trademark brand of manic overacting long enough to capture the true essence of the villain of the piece, Carey is superb in this role.Emily Browning as Violet, and Liam Aiken as Klaus, the older Baudelaire orphans, form the heart of the film, courageously carrying the burdens of their characters' childhood effortlessly.Fresh from films like Planet of the Apes and Sleepy Hollow, production designer Rick Heinrichs creates a world of shadows and Gothic charm that lift the film out of the realms of the ordinary. Director Brad Silberling steers the trials and tribulations of the Baudelaire children away from cutesy kids' flicks, captivating audiences as they join in the journey. While the fans of the Lemony Snicket books may be a younger audience, A Series of Unfortunate Events is bound to be a hit with adults too.The film title may be unfortunate, but the series of events that unfold herald a return to good old-fashioned entertainment, excellent story telling and a cast of characters sure to delight.

403,pegeenmame,This and that...,8,17 December 2004,"How to make A movie off of such a series of thirteen books (eleven, at the present), which are deceivingly simple, yet filled with so many angles and hidden messages, symbolism, and very literary I will admit, is definitely a challenge. So my hat is off to Brad Silberling (the director), the screenwriter, Robert Gordon, and others for taking a stab at it. For they came up with a very decent film, if not what I had anticipated or hoped for.That is because, in my opinion, they are the kind of books that if each reader were asked to write a screenplay for them or direct a film of the Series of Unfortunate Events, each person's version would almost certainly differ greatly. They are just those kind of books. Very broad and open to interpretation, in a sense.I certainly expected the film to be much darker than it turned out to be - with its somewhat hopeful ending. That is the appeal of the books, after all, the overwhelming dreariness of the Baudelaire's cyclic circumstances.The emphasis in this film seemed to be on the art - the costumes, sets, lighting, FX, properties, even the creative and amusing end credits (if you get the opportunity, sit through them). Visually it was a very strong film, a fantastic film to feast one's eyes upon.Furthermore I enjoyed all the character parts, especially Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine, and of course, Jim Carrey as the heinous and exceedingly repugnant (dare I type his name???) Count Olaf. I don't think the role of THE villain in Daniel Handler's tales could have been more perfectly cast. Jim Carrey IS Brett Helquist's illustration and Handler's monster come to life. Whenever there were shots of Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) with his face in close proximity to Violet, or Aunt Josephine, or anyone else, I kept thinking to myself ""How can they stand being that close to him? How can they stand the foul odor that must be exuding from his sinister mouth?"" Maybe I am too into these books... I guess that's why I was disappointed with the majority of reviewers who reviewed this film. They obviously have never read the books, or they would not have complained about Carrey's performance being very show-offy, in-the-face, vain, egotistical, over-the-top, contrived, just too much to take, fake - THAT IS Count Olaf in the books. That IS exactly who he is. If only they could have know that and then perhaps they might have more enjoyed the film.I think the film gave me an appreciation for the books that I didn't have before because of the fact they skipped over so many of the seemingly unimportant scenes, and altered many of the crucial ones.Jude Law was a good choice as narrator. I was surprised that they introduced the V.F.D. already. My brother and I both agree that the opening sequence featuring the Littlest Elf was hilarious. For anyone who has read the books, they will probably find the film very different in flavor from the books, but readers and non-readers alike should enjoy the movie very much, in any case. It was a shame Sunny's character was used mostly as comic relief, but the twins who played her were absolutely adorable.

404,jl_berry,The Talented Mr. Carrey,8,18 December 2004,"The Mask and the Ace Ventura films deluded me into thinking that Jim Carrey was a one-dimensional 'funny man', boy was I wrong. I can't begin to tell you how much I thoroughly enjoyed not only his performance(s), but the entire film. From the introduction right through to the creative and seductive (I couldn't' turn away) credits. The film itself is a very clever adaptation of the novels, which I hadn't read before seeing the movie, but now have. But what really made the movie wasn't the fantastic visual effects (and trust me, they are fantastic), or the solid story, but the performances of a great cast. From the biter, to the reader (hasn't he grown up!), to the inventor (a great actress, maybe I am biased towards an Aussie, but I did enjoy her performance. Lets ignore her role in Ghost Ship, in my opinion, possible the worst film ever). Meryl Streep is bloody awesome as Aunt Josephine, the once courageous woman who is now terrifed of almost everything, including the dreaded realtors (but who can blame her really, those people can be animals). Billy Connelly is always hilarious, and Jennifer Coolidge is one of my favourite actress', she definitely would have excelled with a bigger role. But it really boils down to Jim Carrey.

Though it changes the storyline a bit I thought it was really clever how they did it because the ending was more round unlike the books. Being a fan of the books I didn't know what to expect but I found it very enjoyable. The only thing I was disappointed about was the length of the second book. The second book was my personal favourite. Though it was done very well it was a bit short for my liking. I thought the actors were very good. The sinister count Olaf is always in the background watching them. His character came out well. I thought it would be hard to have a very good baby actor but the twins did extremely well and the subtitles brought a sense of humour to the film. Overall I thought it was very exciting and fun to watch and I recommend that you go and see it. I am looking forward to the next one coming out. I also must comment on the credits.

408,nerfthedigitalsmurf,Waste of time!!!,1,23 December 2004,"I cannot understand what series of unfortunate events brought about the making of this horrible film. Among the many unfortunate events, is that people are somehow drawn into throwing good money away to see such an splendidly stupid film. I'm not a fan of Jim Carey anyway, so what I got was pretty much what I expected from him. However the rest of the film was extremely tedious to have to sit through. Slow moving, with a dialogue that leaves much to be desired. The best acting in the whole film was attributed to Meryl Streep and the children. But even those wonderful actors could not save this sinking ship!I also think that the ending could have been a little better. Considering what these children went through in the loss of their parents and being pursued by a greedy relation, one would think that a happy ending is a little redundant. Come on, sometimes that works in a film, but not, I think in this situation.

409,cjacquier,Lemony Snicket: an Unfortunate film,1,28 December 2004,"I went to see this film with number 2 son and mother-in-law in Milton Keynes as a Christmas treat whilst my wife took numbers 1 and 3 sons to see The Incredibles. We lost. This film is awfully bad as it said it was at the beginning, but that might have been intended as a tongue-in-cheek comment. Some families left after 20 mins or so but number 2 was amused and, perhaps, liked the character of Violet - which was quite sweet. Jim Carrey was as predictable and I was pleased to see Billy Connolly in an avuncular part and not swearing or using coarse language for a change - which is never really funny. The most appalling thing about the film is the sentiment it expresses regarding the family - yet again, non-existent - demonstrating that all adults who are not intrinsically evil, are undiscerning, mad or purblind idiots. Not one adult was a satisfactory role model. What a nice message to send to children, to whom the film is aimed. Still, it serves the purpose of the purveyors of existentialist clap-trap in priming young minds into thinking that everyone should listen to them and that they should be believed above all adults. I am not quite sure how this film is to entertain or serve up a lesson for society. I think it does neither and that despite the good acting of Aiken, Browning, Streep and Connolly it is very poor. Still, it is better than Disney's ""Holes"", another parent/adult/family-bashing film that left even number 2 son's sophisticated appreciation of story lines dessicated.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The only reason I waited an hour to walk out was I thought it couldn't get much worse...it did. The trailers for this film are more entertaining. The theater gave me my money back and a free movie pass, so not all was lost. I can see how some may enjoy it, just wasn't my bag, the movie seemed to drag almost all the way through it (atleast the first hour) When a movie makes me check my watch, its not a good sign. I doubt Ill ever see the end of this movie, just didn't keep my interest. The sets on the film looked good, but thats not enough to make up for a boring film.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

There have only been two other movies that I have seen that I was more upset about paying to see. If I didn't have 3 other people with me, I would have walked out. At the beginning of the film, it mentioned something about the movie about the happy little elf in theater 2. I am now wishing I would have left at that point to go see a movie about a happy little elf. This movie almost makes me not want to read the books. Pathetic and lame. Honestly, I believe my money would have been better spent if I had paid to watch paint dry! I recommend this movie to only those looking for a place to nap.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The characters have no personality, and when they do: it is stupid. If you read the books, you will be greatly disappointed if you see this movie. They split the first book in half, and the relatives that they live with each stay alive for a total of two minutes each. Sunny has jokes that ""come"" out of her mouth so frequently, it is not funny any more. Violet was an okay person, but they had none of her inventions, and I'll bet that she said a total of 50 words the whole movie. Klaus was not good at all, he said nothing, and looked constipated the entire movie. And there were no colors in the movie, so it does not seem real. Gray, black, brown, and dark blue. That is about it. Nothing more. This movie stunk, so save your money for another show.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It was good tho. I definitely will be getting the DVD!!! they definitely should have had at least one little scene with the baudelaires and uncle monty at the movies, like in the book. in the book, they go to see Zombies in the Snow, but the baudelaires cannot enjoy it because ""stephano"" is sitting right next to them. And the thing from the wide window with aunt josephine being afraid to answer the phone would have been good in the movie too. but I'm sure the deleted scenes on the DVD will have some stuff from the books in them.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Jim Carrey made a really good Count Olaf, 2 year old Shelby and Kara Hoffman were adorable, Liam Aiken did great as Klaus Baudelaire(except he didn't have glasses), and Emily Browning did a good job as Violet Baudelaire. This movie is based on the first three books written by Lemony Snicket(Daniel Handler):The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window.

The storyline is NOT a happy ever after story, it is simply a sad tale of three orphaned children who are basically being stalked by a distant relative intent on stealing their fortune. From the instant the movie began, I was enthralled. It just felt like you were right in there, living the lives of the Baudelaire youngsters. Their heartbreak and their comfort.Unlike the books, the movie had a strong sense of mystery. It made you feel curious as to what was going to happen in the end. And thats another thing, the ending was great! It left the entire thing up to the imagination of the audience.So, I said it once, i'll say it again, this movie was brilliant.

One can hardly tell the difference most of the time. This offers a lot of eye candy and I feel one certainly gets their money's worth.People's comments about the movie being not as good as the books or the casting as a letdown are just ways of justifying themselves for believing that they can do it better. But, I don't think any movie should be rated by such ways.If you haven't read the books I think you will be more than satisfied with this movie. Jim Carrey fits the role as ""Count Olaf"" in this movie. Unlike his other more recent roles where we seem to get Jim Carrey in each and every shot and you totally go crazy, This one seems to have none of that. Even with the numerous roles that Carrey has to play as Count Olaf. The focus clearly seems to be on the Baudelaire Orphans. I liked the fact that each child has a special gift but that gift is not taken overboard and is shown up like a superpower of sorts.The best part however was the credits which compliments the movie 100%.On the downside there is no story at all, just 3 little orphans going though a few adventures in the journey called life.I should have given the movie 8/10 but after seeing the credits had to give it a 9/10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

If you haven't noticed the first three books can be quite boring, and they made it exciting and added a twist. I have seen it 3 times and can't wait to see it again. But I would advise you to read the first 3 books before seeing this film, because they change so much you wouldn't understand the rest of the books. Liam Aiken (Good Boy), Emily Browning (Ghost Ship), and the Hoffman twins did such a great job. They really understood how much this film meant to us fans and took time to read the books.

None of us has read Lemony Snicket's books (and after watching the movie, and reading other people's posts, I wouldn't in case I was disappointed by either book or movie). From the opening credits to the closing ones, this movie presented a cleverly cohesive, yet impossible, story with wit, humour, strong acting from everyone and a virtuoso performance from Jim Carrey. Even the minor roles were played with verve and commitment. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of about ten who has a sense of humour (preferably black), a good imagination and the ability to appreciate an intelligent script. Incidentally, the costumes and make up were particularly good, some actors being almost unrecognisable at times. Special effects were also good, though not used too obviously. Bravo!

The cast fit their roles perfectly and, from the trailer, I could already tell that this film had the exact atmosphere that I sensed coming from the books.***SPOILERS*** We begin with ""The Littlest Elf"", a darling and happy tell about a small elf who lives in a gorgeous forest with lots of adorable little animals. However, a dark cloud soon falls over this perfect scene and the narrator (Jude Law) informs us that this is not the movie we will be seeing. (Darn it; it looked so good too!) Meet the Baudelaire orphans: Violet (the inventor), Klaus (the scholar), and Sunny (the biter). They are informed by Mr. Poe, a sad excuse for a banker, that their loving parents have just died in a terrible fire that destroyed their entire home. They go to live with the closest (distance wise) relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who is nothing short of pure evil with a load of craziness stuck right in. He desires to do away with the children and steal their massive fortune. Can these intelligent children outsmart this vile villain? Will the children ever find their happy ending? ***END SPOILERS*** As the Baudelair parents said in their letter: ""What may seem like a series of unfortunate may in fact be the beginning of a journey"". No truer words have ever been spoken about this movie.

I said maybe we should see Lemony Snickets and we both laughed. He is 19 and I am 16 and we are both horror movie fans and we both want to direct movies for a living. So with nothing else to do we decided to go and see the movie. We were surrounded by 7-12 year olds and their parents and we had to watch about 30 minutes of previews. But when the movie got rolling I got very enthused in it. Right off the bat the imagery is absolutely amazing. The acting was excellent and the story was amazing. I loved absolutely every minute of this movie. Now as I said before I am usually the ""horror/thriller"" movie guy but this movie which was completely opposite became my favorite movie of all time.

426,Nhatita,Read the book? Then don't watch the movie,6,15 August 2005,"First, about the acting. Well, I think Jim Carrey is too funny. When I was reading the book, I count Olaf in the film must be cruel and very bad-tempered. *But*, *but*, *but*, Jim Carrey is too funny, not cruel like I always imagine Count Olaf. The book is not really comic (I know, sometimes, there are some details that can help the audiences distress). I was not expecting a comedy. But, after all, the acting is OK, particularly (don't laugh) Sunny. Liam Aiken and Emily Browning is just OK. Their acting has nothing to comment about. And I think their acting is really bad at the scene where the Baudelaire heard about the death of their parents and went back to their house which is completely destroyed.Secondly, and this is what I dislike the most about the film, is the adaptation. This is not what I was expecting. What? It was lacking of so many important detail that make the film become so boring and I felt nearly asleep in the middle of the film. I know, they have to cut some part of the film becos' the film is going to be too long. But they don't even know how to cut, they cut some most important details. For example, why they didn't keep the part when the Baudelaire find out how Count Olaf killed Uncle Monty, disguise and hide the tattoo? I feel really unpleasant while watching the film.So, I highly don't recommend you this film if you have read the book. Don't think that the book is good that the film will be perfect.

When I say the movie on opening night I was very excited. I couldn't wait. Somewhere into the movie during the Reptile Room segment I got up to use the restroom. As the movie ended I couldn't believe what I had seen.My first thoughts we 'It was so short and rushed''Why did they leave so much out!''WTF was with the car on the tracks scene, the eyeball magnifying glass, and the marriage at the end!?''Olaf didn't get away!' I thought maybe in that brief moment I was using the restroom I had missed something. So later that week I say the movie again. My opinion was the same after a second viewing.I also couldn't believe what I had seen because the film is a beautiful work of art. The sets were great. The actors were OK. The adaptation sucked.So many things were not in this movie. There was no Anxious Clown scene, no Zombies in the Snow movie, if you never read the books you would understand that Olaf covered his tattoo with make-up. You wouldn't understand that his henchman was of undetermined gender(i thought he looked like a cross-dresser). And the biggest mistake of them all...Jim Carrey. He was too funny. He wasn't sinister enough. He made everything a joke. If a sequel is made to this movie it better be a damn good one. And the director seems like he never read the books. In my opinion they should have pulled a Kill Bill. They should of made the movie about the 1st 4 books but divided them and released them about 3-4 months apart leaving each movie about 2-2 and a half hours each. 109 minutes just doesn't cut it.If you have never read the books you should.

I understand that the 3 kids go through horrors and what not because of their horrifying uncle Snickets, and I understand that the movie ends when the children are to start the next chapter of their lives. But if the ""intended point to be conveyed"" is that people have the most rewarding experiences in life when they stick together (and financial disposition in life isn't of consequence).... then I regret ever having seen this movie. This will be Jim Carrey's ultimate disappointment of a movie as was Toys for Robin Williams! I hope that the directors get a clue and try to put just a little more into a plot when they make their next movie!

Jim Carrey was brilliant as the villainous Count Olaf, and the children portrayed their characters well. Billy Connolly may have been slightly bland as Uncly Monty, but Meryl Streep perfectly depicted the nervous, high-strung Aunt Josphine. I really enjoyed the music of this film, along with Sunny Baudelaire's sarcastic comments in baby-talk, subtitled at the bottom of the screen.

As I love to dissect movies, and see how directing, music, script, and acting all combine together to make a film, this movie was a treat.While I have only read the first book, I am pleased at how well they kept to the basic story line, and tied in the three books, without leaving too many loose strings. I felt that the Orphan actors were absolutely amazing. They have talent in years to come.My one problem with the movie, surprisingly, was Jim Carey. Normally, I enjoy Carey, and his antics, however, for the role of the count, I felt that he overdid it slightly. Also, they did emphasis Carey too much, in my opinion, in the film, and most especially in advertising. However, he did do a good job. He interacted well with the orphans, and made for an excellent viewing experience.The music was amazing, allowing for both suspense, and hope at the same time. Jude Law as the narrator, and the way that they tied him into the story telling was director genius. And the ending credits were spectacular. I loved the music so much that I downloaded them onto my computer.Overall the movie was a success.

The movie itself, I found to be a quirky little tale, with more than one twist to the plot. In one way it reminds me of the animated movie Shrek, since the spoken dialog was constructed in such an obvious way, to please the more adult viewers of the film. I see this as a family film, with a twist. It's likable, a little scary, a little funny, a lot weird, but mostly harmless. I would recommend parents to watch this with their children, since the atmosphere of the film could get to smaller children. The surroundings are not exactly pleasant, and Count Olaf is right out bad to the bone. Although I never have heard of Lemony Snicket before, I guess this author wrote stuff much in the same way that Roald Dahl did. It's an odd, intelligent dark humor that lies over everything in this film. I liked it, but did not find it to be a movie that stands out.

Everything that makes the books great has been removed and what is left is a plot free mishmash.The worst part is Jim Carey playing Jim Carey, who once again defecates on a children's classic as he did in The Grinch.There are good things about the movie. It looks great. The costumes and sets perfectly capture the Snicket world. Timothy Spall is an excellent Mr Poe.

439,the87thbombfish,Critics (and younger children) need not apply,10,3 January 2005,"First of all, as the father of a 4 year old daughter, I would like to say that this movie is NOT for a true PG audience. The rating is appropriate, insofar as there is no theme of drug abuse, no blatantly sexual imagery, no trace of swear-laden monologues, et cetera. However, the dark nature of the film and the subject matter are clearly aiming at the 10+ group. If you have a stunningly mature youngin' back at the ranch then exercise no caution, but my humble recommendation would be to ensure the child can handle heavier themes than the average PG flick would communicate. That being said, this movie is a gem. Anyone who would address this film from the professional standpoint of 'film critic' would do well to remember the target audience. Much as films past have clearly spoken to a particular generation (see The Breakfast Club), Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is trying to entertain the mind of a young adolescent, one who is walking the tightrope of self-realization; the equidistance between briefcases and backpacks. And while this movie does not deliver sugary endings or carry the heavy-handed smack of a bluntly disguised moral (...see also, The Breakfast Club) the message is clear and the delivery is certain. The performances range from on-par to stunning; the supporting roles are locked in place and the main characters shine like Christmas bulbs. Carrey's Olaf is a lanky, skeletal villain who twirls his mustachio with the best of them. Emily Browning's Violet displays genuine range of emotion throughout and I truly believe that she has unique potential in future films. Liam Aiken as Klaus comes off as a bit stoic but not offensively so; as the movie reveals he is a deliberate young man with savant aspects so it feels appropriate he should be a bit detached. The Hoffman twins as Sunny is as delightful a performance as one could squeeze from a pair of toddlers. To what degree their performance is intentional is, of course, anyone's conjecture, but it would be a lie to say they do not hold their own. An all-star cast of supporting actors fleshes this movie out elegantly. From Streep's jittery Aunt Josephine to brief cameos by Dustin Hoffman, Cedric the Entertainer and even the AFLAC duck, everyone manages to explore their roles while keeping them in bounds at all times. While die-hard fans of the series of books that inspired the movie have cried occasional foul, remember the format and remember the audience. Past experience has showed us that rarely can a 110 minute movie contain a library; do not expect it of this film. Expect a story that a newcomer to the series can follow and understand. Remember also, the ideal audience member will be those precious individuals who are so often entirely catered to in false advertising and MTV fakery. This movie can serve to wash it all away, if only for a matter of hours. It finds an adolescent core and tells it a secret that us parents have always struggled to engender; the world is not always safe, and things don't always go according to plan, so stay close to one another and things will unfold exactly as they should.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The beginning had me and my friends wondering why we were even here which is pretty terrible. I mean come on, who would watch a movie that started out with a freaky animated character and a sun that smiles? OK, I should give them a break, they mentioned in the book about how it wasn't going to be like that. Very disappointing. The rest of the movie sucked also. From Jim Carrey's acting, to the lines they were saying. I completely give this movie a thumbs down and encourage everyone NOT to see this movie.

It is clear from the get-go that they are very talented and certainly should enjoy better days, though such never arrive in the film. Important in some regards as a children's film, dealing with more difficult subject matter, yet still engaging and entertaining. The real estate agents are a particularly funny/quirky addition, and Streep's character is quite interesting, as well as Jim's, though Olaf is almost too funny for being such a maniac. The spyglass group is interesting, I believe it is an addition to the storybooks. Jackwhiteyouaremyhero made a really interesting comment in the summary which is worth mention. I am not certain about Lemmony himself or how he figures into the whole scenario, he seems to be more on the inside of this fantastical situation than expressed, an odd choice in the film narrative.

442,z-94680,a series of fortunate director decisions,10,9 December 2019,"Lemony Snicket's 13 book series, A Series of Unfortunate events, was a captivatingly thrilling read and an absolutely stunning movie. Between the costumes, props, sets and actors, it's easy to see why this was Nickelodeon's first Academy Award winner. Directed by Brad Silberling, this movie is gold from beginning to end.Fans of the books have their breath taken from them as the sets from the first three books come to life before their eyes. For those who didn't read the novels, they are instantly transported to the world of Violet, Clouse and Sunny Baudelaire; who on a gloomy day, become orphans after their parents parish in a mysterious fire, leaving their home in ashes. They are sent to stay with their Count Olaf, a mad man obsessed with getting hold of the fortune the children will eventually inherit.
Played by Emmy winner, Jim Carrey, Count Olaf is never far behind as the three orphans get passed around from guardian to guardian, causing the unfortunate events to follow the children everywhere.
While the movie does a good job at following the first three books, fans of the series are downcast to see the movie stop at only the third book in the story line. While the screen writers did a good job with the newly made ending, fans are left heart broken, knowing that their favorite series is stopped so soon.Luckily though, there is so much effort that was put in this movie, it almost makes up for the missing 10 books. Every inch of this movie has amazing props, fantastic sets, and just the right amount of imagination. Every time a camera zooms in on the crazy Count Olaf, we are reminded why this movie received the Academy Award for Best Makeup, and why Jim Carry received the award for Best Portrayal of a Villain for his role in it.
15 years later, fans are still screaming Encore for this fantastic work of art. It is a must see for all fans of creepy, unfortunate, and imaginative stories.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
443,xbeautyofthebeastx,Eh.,7,19 July 2006,"Although this movie was funny and brilliantly acted, it wasn't true to the books at all. First off, it squeezed three of the books into one hour-and-a-half long movie. If you're going to do that, at least get the events in the order that they happened. Then there are the minor details that only readers would even care about: Klaus is supposed to wear glasses, Sunny cannot yet walk. Added scenes and plot devices cause the movie to differ even further from the books, causing readers to question whether they are even watching the movie they thought they were.The movie was fun, it was clever, but it wasn't at all what was expected.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Even though several situations and the plot may not seem totally original, the actual cinematic implementation does make it seem original. I have'nt read the books and I get the impression that they must be really good but the movie itself could only implement a small portion of them? Jim Carrey's performance, contradictory to some views, is actually excellent. Besides his roles in the Mask and Liar Liar, I usually find him quite annoying and sometimes even irritating and stupid. However, he has played Count Olaf so well that he actually comes out as a hateable character desired against your previous perceptions of him as a comic or jackass. Besides him, all the other actors also gave a splendid performance. In my book, this movie is a must watch.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

447,nbrucegardner,Much better than expected,8,18 December 2004,"I must admit two things. First, that I've only read two of the Lemony Snicket books before I gave up on them and second, that I'm not much of a Jim Carrey fan. I think that although very talented, he is just too over the top to let me get fully involved in his movies, but saying that, I thought he did a pretty good job with this movie. At least I think his character is pretty true to what I felt in the books. Meryl Streep is excellent in her part as are each of the kids especially the youngest one.The inventions and wit of the kids doesn't get in the way of the characters who are developed quite well. When I read the books I got a little tired of the adults not believing the children and I felt the same frustration with this movie. The banker is just as irritating in the movie as in the book, but if you like the books, I think you will like the movie very much. The special effects are just fun to watch. Meryl Streep's home is incredible.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

BUt I am afraid that this will not happen because I am not too sure if the movie was a hit. I know most people probably went to see it for Jim Carrey, or they read the books. But other than that, why would anyone go see it? So if Jim Carrey isn't Count Olaf in the next movie, then it won't be a hit, which means they won't make it.

Yet I was quite surprised that it did have things from the latter books included, eg when Klaus found the spy glass in his fathers drawer,there was also a package of green cigarettes like the Verdant Flammable Devices (V.F.D) used in book 10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
450,poppersmoke,This movie is an unfortunate event,1,4 September 2007,"I was drawn to this movie after reading all the Lemony Snicket books to my children. It was a disappointment throughout.Jim Carrey is at his hammy worst. His Count Olaf isn't the shrewdly evil menace created by Mr. Snicket; he's a clown in need of ritalin. In contrast, Violet and Klaus Baudelaire drone through their adventures without expression. These unfortunate young actors were in need of some on-set guidance; clearly director Brad Silberling wasn't up to the task. Despite their predictable escapes from inescapable situations, the kids' intelligence characterized in the books never comes through in the movie. And poor Sunny is reduced to boorish attempts at comic relief. Rather than adding insight or contributing to the siblings' successes (again, as in the books), Sunny's baby talk is subtitled with witless one-liners taken not from Mr. Snicket's clever writing, but conjured by screenwriters looking for a cheap laugh. (Sunny: ((baby talk)), Subtitle: ""What a schmuck!"" or ""Back off, Parrotface!"") Thankfully, whatever fart jokes the writers scripted for her were edited from the final cut. But the filmmakers were surely delighted to have Sunny threaten to bite Olaf in the crotch. (After sinking her teeth into his leg, Subtitle: ""I'll bite higher!"") Is there anything less appealing than the thought of a baby attaching her mouth to a man's genitals? Timothy Spall is fine but insignificant as Mr. Poe, the children's ineffective trustee. As is Katherine O'Hara as Justice Strauss. The movie's only charming character is Billy Connelly's Uncle Monty. But alas, he is (spoiler) snuffed out before his time. Too bad we can't say the same about the entire flick.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
451,silly-annie,this movie is really well-made,10,29 April 2012,"This dark comedy is one of witty dialogue and spectacular set design. Director Brad Silberling sure did an excellent job of capturing the exact same tone as the novel and applying it to make an artistic Hollywood film. The costume and set design elements portray an artistic version of something that seems like the 1920's yet the characters talk about things as if they are living well into the 21st century such as relaters, 'happy little elves', and slurpees, this creates a comical element to the film, however the pinnacle factor of comedy in this movie would have to be Jim Carrey's character Count Olaf, Carrey does an impeccable job of portraying the malicious, greedy man who you can't help but love to hate. Olaf persists to steal the fortune in which the Baudelaire are granted due to the parents' death. Olaf continues to follow them from carer to carer dressing up as different hilarious characters to try and steal the money, killing and deceiving people along the way. The main concept of the movie revolves around the three intelligent children whose parents perished in a mysterious fire, Violet the oldest at 14 who invents things, Klause the middle child at 12 whose life strives on reading, and the youngest child Sunny, only an infant who bites things and speaks gibberish which is also a contributor to the subtle comedy behind the movie. Overall Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a good quality, under-rated, unusual movie that is about sticking together and never loosing hope.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
452,susanyprice,Happily Surprised with the Quality,7,18 December 2004,"After reading my usually trusted film review sources, including the NYTimes, I'd expected to be heartily disappointed. The Lemony Snicket series is fun in a snarky sort of way, with plenty of in-jokes for the literati. It's not so deathless that it can't be improved, though - and this tale got better from being moved onto film.Seeing Jim Carrey's name made me shudder for the books, expecting a slapstick Carrey-fest. I hate Jim Carrey's patented Pet Detective, Mask, Grinch type mugging and slapstick, but admired him in Man in the Moon, Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - a good actor, when he works to tell a story.My spouse and I groaned to see that every single trailer before the show touted remakes - Bewitched, War of the Worlds, Pink Panther, Willy Wonka. Hollywood is so very unwilling to bet on a new idea, it's depressing.But from the opening ""Happy Elf"" sequence that brilliantly sets off this enjoyably dark Snicket film, we were happily surprised, and stayed that way.My 7-year-old, a Snicket fan, remarked on a few changes from page to celluloid, including omitting Klaus' glasses, and giving him the grappling hook up the tower sequence. He simply shrugged when I explained that translating from book to movie was sometimes difficult, and the filmmakers introduce changes to keep up the pace and fit into the time constraints. Books and movies are different - and turns out that's OK with him.Otherwise respectable reviewers have lambasted Carrey for overacting, scene stealing, showboating. Yes, his Olaf moments on screen are fun and over the top - but so is the Olaf character, and Carrey is a happy casting choice. This is an ensemble piece, and the other actors and perfect sets hold their own.The most ridiculous complaints are those that accuse this tale of melodrama. Hello! Melodrama is fun when that's what you've set out to do. Go see it, even if you adore the Lemony Snicket series. It's fun in a slightly different way, that still manages to pay homage to the original.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It is a bit like the Roald Dahl books I used to read as a kid - remember the BFG, with the giants who used to devour sleeping orphans? - but with little of the rubbish that used to bore me to tears as a kid watching kids films; such as long, boring songs (Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, Pocahontas) or dreary romantic subplots.The look and feel of the film, its bizarre characters and the ridiculous plots by Olaf are vastly entertaining. You genuinely feel for the kids, but while their plight is bleak this film is anything but.Highly recommended for everyone.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
454,shipleym701,Fantastic visuals and impressive narrative,8,18 January 2009,"I have to make it clear from the start that i have not read any of the books so i cannot comment on the film in terms of accuracy. I was extremely dubious about watching this film, it seemed childish and immature but it happened to be on TV and i watched it whilst having a duvet day. Completely surprised by it! The cast is top class, Meryl Streep, Billy Connely, Timothy Spall, Jude Law and of course Jim Carrey. They really have a huge impact on the film but it is not just a standard Hollywood film that relies on these stars. The visuals are incredible, the cars for example are magically real, and the costumes are also brilliant. Jude Law as the narrator works perfectly and I especially liked the disjointed way that he interferes in the story. The scenes where the typewriter jams for example really hits home the fact that you are involved in a fantasy tale. Anyone who is into the neo-noir will love this, untrustworthy narration and scenes with loads of fog and mist add to this. I have recommended this film to all of my friends including the hyper-critical film students and i think the film holds its own in the face of the uber-critical! A must see in my opinion, i don't think anything i can write will do it justice. Please, if you are looking for an hour and a half of pure, escapist cinema then watch this film!

455,calsnoboarder,A Series of Fortunate Events Makes for a Better Film,8,19 December 2004,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is the short attention span answer to the Harry Potter books. I'd have to say that I didn't really find much to like in the Lemony Snicket series with the exception of the main premise, which is three orphans struggling to survive a series of unfortunate events. The books are thin on plot or dialog so when they announced a film based on the series, you could color me unimpressed.Of course, a funny thing happened on the way to the straight-to-video bin and that thing was Jim Carrey. Few could argue Jim Carrey's appeal considering that he is among Hollywood's highest paid stars. With amazingly colorful turns in such notable films as ""The Truman Show,""""Man in the Moon,"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" Carrey is a theatrical chameleon, capable of shining regardless of the genre.Lemony Snicket would not be the movie that it is without the talents of Mr. Carrey. Without him it would be a poor stopgap as we wait for the next installment in the Harry Potter series. With him it is a shining example of books that take on new life when brought to the screen. You'd have to go back to Forrest Gump to see a story that was better as a film than as a book. If this is what we can expect from future films in the Lemony Snicket series, you can count me among the fans eagerly anticipating the next installment.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
456,williearcher23,More like a series of very unfortunate events,1,16 July 2009,"The series was butchered! I was so disappointed, Jim Carey(Don't get me wrong I think he's hilarious) over-acted the comedy scenes like he always does but this wasn't a movie which needed over acting the funny parts. It was cute I'll give it that, and suited children but honestly I can usually take it when books are changed a little to adapt to movies. But events and books were switched around and tampered with beyond acceptable...It was too fast paced. What was with the entire cast more or less of Best in show and A mighty Wind...it might as well of been another one of their movies the farce that it was turned into. Now mind you I think they're hilarious but...it was too much that mostly all of them were in it. This isn't meant to be a complete comedy....hello it's called a series of UNFORTUNATE events. Not ""A series of comedic events featuring the cast of Best in show"". This would of served better under the direction of Tim Burton...I'm not usually head over heels infatuated with his movies and find them either creepy or dumb but he always has a way of balancing comedy and drama and tragedy....just look at Edward scissor hands .The end was also dumb....and only added to the farce the movie had already become straight from Jim Carey's first scene. What I'm talking about is the part where Jude Law is saying something along the line of ""And Count Olaf was sentenced to go through all the things he'd put the children through."" and then there's a series of clips of him comically suffering all the things the kids went through. This series was destroyed...I hope it's re-made from scratch by someone with an understanding that it's not a full out comedy.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
457,deevil_2000,setting the score right,3,19 February 2012,"maybe no one will care about this review, as there are so many already. But i feel compelled to write it, because to me this movie is way overrated and has disappointed me very much.no one argues, that this movie is visually stunning. and certainly the huge budget shows through everywhere. but, as some already pointed out, there is hardly a character, that feels ""real"". or a storyline with a proper end. i didn't read the books and this is one of the problems of this movie: the story apparently throws together the first three volumes of six and so hints everywhere of mysteries, that don't get solved here at all, but maybe in some other movie later on (that very probably will never be made due to the deserved mediocre box office success -compared to the budget at least)the whole movie had an intellectual feel to it, like, as if someone drafted this out with a lot of intellectual thought - and hardly any feeling at all. just like the bad count Olaf tries a couple times to appear caring and uncle-like, this movie tries to be hearty and fairytalely - and hardly delivers at all. Carey as Olaf is funny, i give him that. but hardly ever does he come across as menacing as he should - i mean, he is all the time killing people and wants to kill the children too! someone like that should scare me to death, when he comes and reveals his dark secrets to me. the only characters, that got through to me were the children. to me, even Meryl Streep was a disappointment and what they hired Dustin Hoffman for will be a mystery to me forever.this movie clearly was made on the premise, that the ingredients used cannot fail - regardless of the story or direction. this may work for a lot of people who are happy with stunning visuals but usually i am one of them and this time i feel totally left behind.the pacing is too slow the whole movie through. apparently because the director thought his sets were so beautiful, people should look at them a bit longer (and i fear this is no joke). one reviewer compared the movie at this point with Tim Burton - and rightfully so. beautiful pictures, way to few story and slow pacing. (but at least Tim Burton keeps me engaged most of the time, not least thanks to his beautiful drawn characters) There is loose ends and open questions all over the place, badly stitched together episodes, that feel chopped together too. and scenes that were meaningless and could have been left out to make way for explaining some of the loose ends.too bad. it could have been, what it set out to be. it just wasn't up to the task. another big budget wasted by Hollywood.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
458,darkheartdreamer,One of the worst films I have ever seen.,1,6 April 2010,"I very wisely went into the cinema without high hopes. I have never liked Jim Carrey- he tries to be funny and fails so badly, that I want to rip out his spine and beat him to death with it. In the books (which were very good, I might add) Count Olaf is a terrifying, sadistic, selfish, evil maniac. Jim Carrey makes him 'funny'. Why?! It goes completely against Olaf's characteristics! Although I can't say I was surprised. This film was pretty much banking on people loving it because Jim Carrey was in it. It seemed rather random to just glue the first three books together in the way they did, especially since they messed around with the plot and changed the order of events. This is an excellent example of the way they ignore the books and just go off in their own damn direction. In my opinion, the film might have been better if they had just done the first book, and done it well; or at the very least, done it in a way that was less than awful. I was also annoyed beyond belief when I saw the actors playing the Baudelaire orphans. They look. Nothing. Like. The characters. Violet, aged 14 is supposed to have black hair and be quite a bit taller than Klaus, who is 12, wears glasses and also has black hair. But, Violet is the same height as Klaus in the film, they have brown hair and Klaus does not have glasses. Again, a complete disregard of the books and the way the characters are meant to be! I suppose I can let them get away with Sunny- the child who portrayed her was a bit too old in my opinion, but I'll let that slide. The ending was dreadful. The whole sentimental walk down memory lane when they visit their old home? And when Klaus gets their father's spyglass? Quick! The bucket! In short- film bad.

Sadly, this was not the case. Violet, Klaus and Sunny are all portrayed brilliantly by their respective actors, as were the majority of the other characters. The only character I had an issue was Count Olaf - I like Jim Carrey, but he wasn't right for the role. Olaf is meant to be creepy and sinister, however Carrey ruins this by being too OTT and almost stupid, not funny, and as such I despised the way he played the role. They also completely ruined the plot. Had I not read the books I daresay this wouldn't be an issue, but they managed to fit three books into one film and didn't do a very good job of it. The plot was cut up and put back together in a Frankensteins monster-esque way - basically very badly. Overall, I didn't enjoy this as much as I could have done. Yes there are some positives, but not many!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
460,lollapalooza8903,Unfortunate Compression,5,29 September 2006,"This movie is alright to see once, even if you've read the books, or even if you haven't. I was hoping that this would be a film to see over and over that would convey the right feelings and the well-placed tension. Nothing about this movie will do that to you.In the books there are plenty of aspects to focus your attention on, and even more underlying themes and secrets that you may be able to gather as you read on in the series. Why this would immediately scream, ""Let's condense the first three books into one movie!"" is beyond me. It is undoubtedly shorter than say, Harry Potter, which is what many people compare it to. And they shouldn't, because not only are books and movies very different from each other, comparing a movie with a different movie is just as foolish. Readers of the books will be disappointed, but not so much that they would leave the theatre. It's watching that small dash of hope being crushed, but somehow compelled to stay in your seat to bring it back somehow. Which doesn't happen.Jim Carrey is a good actor, for comedic roles, and sometimes those heart-warming films where he doesn't speak much (Simon Birch). However, in a role where it calls for a certain dark aspect in a character, he does not pull it off. Count Olaf is not an intentionally comedic character, and when you do read the novels and compare it, you will definitely not like Carrey's part in the movie. He most certainly does his thing, but that is not what the character calls for. This proves that Carrey is only versatile when there's a punchline at the end.The children in the story are casted well enough, but when there are shoddy lines, what can they do? Emily Browning is a young actress I admire, and wish I would see more of, but the script doesn't give her a lot of room to shine, especially in the shadow of Carrey. The young baby is cute enough, and does her role just fine, though those captions take away any intelligence that Sunny might have had. Klaus was cast bad, just not very lively, and he's supposed to be a smart boy. In fact, I wouldn't doubt it if Sunny had more clever lines than him. The lack of facial expressions overall is what did me in; I did not like Liam's casting. And while the movie was ruined for me because of this (Klaus was my favorite in the books), some people may have still liked it.Theme-wise, this was not dark enough, and it could be because the movie was not paced well, or written well, for that matter. Just because the books do not go past 300 pages most of the time, does not mean they should be pushed together so that the pages equal that of a Harry Potter novel. There is no need to try to stuff that many things in a damned movie. You miss out completely on the relationship the Judge forms with the children, and you miss out on the intense fear the children get from the troupe (whom are the biggest and most lame sidekicks in a film I have seen). How much more riveting would it have been to have been put so close to someone, only to be ripped from them? We do not get enough time to see that, and the characters don't even have enough time to care. Even with Montgomery, you don't get the feeling that they've connected as much as they should have.Condensing the feelings and compacting the books are what did this film in. For anyone who isn't easily amused or has read the books, this film will not be worth purchasing. Just watch it once, learn what not to do, and move on.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It's dark, doesn't shy away from 'adult' issues of death and cruelty, but manages not to leave you completely despondent by using the adult actors to their comic best.

My children looked at me as if I was mad - so beware of that. This movie was awesome and entertaining. The characters were so colorful. And the baby by far is the cutest. However, Jim Carrey amazes me with his performances. I never know what he will do next. My children have read these books and are quite the connoisseurs of keeping the fiction true to the screen (something I understand that was lost in the first two HP movies). They are looking forward to number two, and so am I. As we were leaving, my daughter says, ""Nothing ever good happens to those children.""

Just because the actress who plays violet has big lips does not mean she is like Angelina Jolie and ""sexy."" She obviously didn't wear anything revealing, and I happen to believe she was gorgeous, and in Lemony Snicket's books, she is described as ""beautiful."" I think she did a great job. So did the boy playing Klaus... he did seem very smart, so I think they did a fine job picking actors and actresses.This is a great movie to watch, I don't know if you should bring your kids though. I don't think they'd understand the darker part of it until they're older. Jim Carrey and Meryll Streep both did amazing jobs portraying Count Olaf and Aunt Josephine.

Having not read the book(s) most definitely gave me an edge as opposing to those of you who have in fact read it/them.

As for the cast, well anyone in his or her right mind will agree that Jim Carrey was phenomenal. That meaning both hilarious and devious. Bill Connolly also did a great job, whilst I admittedly would've loved a few more spiffy remarks from Cedric the Entertainer. Original, devilishly well-animated, brilliantly casted and very well told.

This movie left out things, like Klaus not having glasses witch is one of the most important things in the forth book.

Most of the acting in this movie was good. Dustin Huffman (I can't spell his name right!!!) made a appearance in the end. This movie was good, a 6/10. My mom would have given it a 1/10.

468,samantha-baisas,Review,10,8 May 2012,"Lemony Snicket's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' is a well thought out movie, with a brilliant story line. The movie is made using the three books 'The Bad Beginning', 'The Reptile Room' and 'The Wide Window'. It is really entertaining to watch, and shows great detail and acting skills. It uses a lot of thrill and suspense as well as comedy. I personally like the books better, but the movie is still great. It really captured my attention. The setting put a lot of mystery in the theme, and this made the movie more interesting! The three children show courage and great maturity throughout the movie. Jim Carrey shows great humour but with a side of evil. He uses the character and interprets it into his own type of character, but still using the characteristics of Olaf. It really makes you sympathize the three children and despise of Olaf, but you still see Olaf as a humorous character! The costumes looked brilliant and entertaining! The movie had a good use of cinematography as well. The movie uses a great use of editing skills, and they kept the uniqueness that the series contains in the books. It is a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone!",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Three young children embark on a Journey, after their parents are killed in a mysterious fire, going from house to house, guardian to guardian, whilst attempting to figure out why their parents were killed. This film, though dark and mysterious, has an element of humour which helps to carry the plot along. The setting of the film, a fictional world, is both creative and interesting, with strange people, costumes and houses, that reflect the dark but humorous style that the movie is trying to portray. Jim Carrey plays his role as 'Count Olaf', the children's first guardian after their parents are killed, extremely well. He manages to be the different people that Count Olaf dresses as during the film, whilst still portraying Count Olaf underneath. He adds humour to his character, though is still cruel and rude to the Baudelaire children. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, with its gripping plot, and eccentric and hilarious characters. This, and the setting of the movie, made it so enjoyable! I would definitely recommend Lemony Snickets: A series of Unfortunate Events to all teens and adults.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

This movie so entertaining you won't stop watching! It will keep you interested till the very last second! The movies both funny and sad and will keep you entertained!

I think that it shouldn't have covered three of the original novels though, two would have been enough. I felt as though the Baudelaire children's stay with their new guardians was made too brief and that there wasn't enough detail put into them either. It seemed a bit choppy and the scenes changed a bit too much. The right actors were chosen for their roles, especially Jim Carrey who made a wonderful Count Olaf. Jude Law's narration as Lemony Snicket complimented the film perfectly. Emily Browning made Violet seem the creative inventor she is meant to be. I liked how the Sunny had the funniest lines of the film – even though she didn't say a word! Hats of to the Hoffman twins on their brilliant acting (and all round cuteness!). My only criticism is that Liam Aitken's character Klaus wasn't made out to be a nerdy book worm, but never the less he was still wonderful character. The film has a very Tim Burton feel about it, with the strange settings and odd costumes. I loved the way the characters dressed – it was fantastic! The old fashioned clothing really brought out that they were living in an imaginary world. Also Aunt Josephine's house was amazing! It was pretty cool how they showed the structure of the house standing on the cliff, not just the inside of the house. Overall it's a great film and not one you can get sick of, even after multiple viewings. There is always something new that you can spot every time.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The director Brad Silberling does an excellent job of setting the scene of a dark time of which the children need to stay together to try and continue their life even after a series of unfortunate events. The movie was a dark comedy that had light and dark aspects. Jim Carey playing the character of Count Olaf gave the film an extra funny edge that was necessary with the dark areas of the movie for the younger audiences. Starting the film with a confusion 'Happy Little Elves' sequence braced the audience ready for extreme unfortunate events which continued throughout the film. The characters of the children Violet, Klaus and Sunny were excellently depicted by the actors. The characters dressing in more of a 1920's style and fantastic setting and scenery gave the movie an extra edge and definition.

Based on the successful book series; it is a movie that is not to be seen by those wishing to see a classic happy ever after ending, but instead is one that shows the harsh realities of orphan life. The story is about the three intelligent Baudelaire children Violet, Klaus and Sunny who have been left as orphans after a mysterious fire claimed the lives of their parents, and thus shattering their perfect life style. They find themselves quickly taken away into the care of a distant relative Count Olaf, who is an evil man wishing nothing but to claim the family fortune when the oldest child (Violet) come of age. The movie contains many strong themes, such as that family can survive anything and that life isn't fair or easy but you have to be thankful for what you have got and make the most of the life you have. This movie is well produced and enjoyable, leaving you on the edge of your seat countless times!",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Jim Carrey who plays the villain of the movie, Count Olaf, is a stand out character for me in the film. He does a perfect job of playing his part of being the intimating scary man who changes his identity varies times in order to try and steal the Bauldelaire fortune. It's an interesting film that is filled with strange character personalities and feels as though you are taken to a whole new world and time.

The film was created in 2004 and directed by Brad Silberling. The leading actors are played by, Jim Carrey, whom plays the role of the greedy, unheard of relative; Jude Law, plays the voice of Lemony Snicket; Timothy Spall plays the role of the children's carer, Mr Poe; Liam Aiken plays the role of the intelligent, book-loving brother- Klaus Baudelaire; Emily Browning plays the eldest daughter, Violet Baudelaire, the quick thinking inventor. The baby girl Sunny is played by two twin sisters, Kara and Shelby Hoffman. The children's overly nervous Aunt Josephine is played by Meryl Streep and their loving, reptile crazy Uncle Monty is played by Billy Connolly. In the film, Violet, Klaus and their little sister Sunny, are unexpectedly reeled off into a series of unlucky situations, following the devastating news of the death of their parents. The children are moved into their greedy Uncle's house, Count Olaf who goes to extreme lengths to take the Baudelaire's fortune. The children are quickly taken out of the care of Count Olaf into what they hope to be a more fortunate experience with their new guardian-Uncle Monty. Their time with Uncle Monty again comes to a rapid end and the children are again moved location. The children are sent to live with their anxious, grammar loving Aunt Josephine who is forced to leave the children. The children then are pushed into being under the care of Count Olaf again who is in disguise. Count Olaf casts himself and Violet into a play, where he arranges a legal marriage between himself and Violet, unknown to the audience of the performance. The children manage to overcome this by using all their knowledge to one again escape Count Olaf.The film setting was very creative, and it can easily relate to young children's imagination. The choices of actors are very suitable for the roles they play, and the three Baudelaire children accompany each other well. Jim Carey plays his role very well and creates some humour in the storyline. Ultimately I found the film to be very enjoyable and kept the attention of the audience throughout the duration of the film. I would recommend children between the ages of 7-14 to watch this film. The film was very creative and makes you want to read the books, I would score the movie 7 out of 10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Unlike some films based on books, this film has kept to its storyline, featured fantastic actors and keeps on you on edge during every scene. The characters, plot and setting were fantastically imaginative and original. For those who haven't read the books, I can easily say that you won't be disappointed. This film has captured the important elements, and with the fast paced action you won't miss a thing. Jim Carrey makes a perfect Count Olaf, with the occasional quirky comment casually thrown in and the shifty eyes and eyebrows, Jim was made for the part. As for casting Meryl Streep as the superstitious and soft speaking Aunt Josephine, she had done brilliantly. Each scene was produced beautifully; the sets were different and interesting, something you'd hardly see in many other films. I think that after this film was produced, many people anticipated for a sequel or even a series, but were severely disappointed, as I was and still am. With the dramatic music and the extremely dark humour, I would have to conclude that this is an amazing interpretation of the 3 novels.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Most book adaptations ruin the mental picture of the characters in your head, but the characters in this film were exactly as I saw them in my mind. Seeing as the film has squashed 3 books into 1 movie, I thought that key plot elements in the books would be cut out, but most were not, which pleased me very much.

The Baudelaire children are played by Emily Browning (violet), Liam Aiken (Klaus) and Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman (Sunny). Violet, Klaus and Sunny, are just as creative, inventive, smart, funny, cheerful and confident in the film as they are in the beloved book series and are very well played by their actors.

But we deducted 8 points (bringing in a big fat zero for a score) due to the perversion, darkness, lack of moral value, and it's appeal to the young child (I would NEVER let my child below 13 watch it, and it was targeted to children, obviously). This is not really an adult movie, nor is it a child's movie. Maybe the next trend will be to send the kids to the crack house rather than summer camp. That way they can learn that everything doesn't always turn out nice. The content was too heavy and disturbing for children to view, but it was cleverly masked with beautiful and whimsical backdrop.

Jim Carey did his usual good job but it was wasted on a totally unsympathetic character. The rest of the cast all did a good job to absolutely no purpose.

It is hard to describe but is most definitely a pleasant and unforgettable experience.To the nay-sayers that think this movie is rubbish because ""people left the theater"", I ask you this - Do the masses of conformity ever recognize or appreciate virtuous traits such as quality, ingenuity or, in the case of SOUE, theatric flights of fancy?

I have read all of the Series of Unfortunate Events books, and this is one of the movies that is most closest to the book. The movie has the 3 first books of the series in it, and I'm not quite sure if they set it up for a second movie or not, because at the end of the movie is how the first book ends, and the second book is called the reptile room, and that is with Uncle Monty. The third book is called the Wide Window, and that is with Aunt Josephine.The first book is called the bad beginning. In the first book, and in the first book only, is when they are in custody of Count Olaf. Not at the end of the third book, like in the movie. Also in the book, Violet Baudelaire avoids marrying Count Olaf by signing her name with her left hand, not her right one. In the movie, clause burns the certificate with the light of the magnifying glass, which also shows that that is how the Baudelaire Mansion burned down, and in the book, they do not tell you that. Although it makes sense, putting that in the book, is messing it up for chances of a second movie.

VERY MINOR SPOILERS,8,22 December 2004,"Before I begin, I'm pointing out that I haven't read the books which the film is based on ""the bad beginning, the reptile room and the wide window"", maybe if I had read them my opinion on the film would haven been different (just like the harry potter franchise, which I have read). But I found the film thoroughly enjoyable and one of the best recent family films. In my opinion it is more enjoyable and easier to digests than the long, sometimes plodding harry potter films. The acting is surprisingly very good, Jim carrey has the star power but Meryl Streep steals the show. Even more surprising though was how mediocre Billy connelys performance was, apart from Carrey, he is the most comedic actor out of the whole cast but is the least funniest character. The film is visually stunning and Tim Burton is obviously an influence (try and spot all of the eyes!) even the end credits are full of visual flair and just have to be seen. Adults will probably enjoy the film more than young children, and overall this is a very good, enjoyable film. Young children may be frightened by a few things, like the ""deadliest viper on earth"" or the leeches but these are just minor scares and add to the overall enjoyment.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

He has a horrible tone of voice and always seems like he's scared when he's supposed to be the brave one.The baby, Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman), was absolutely useless in this movie. All she said was ""Goo goo"". Wow that makes a great translation into ""Wow, he's desperate"". It's supposed to be a mix-up of words, not ""Goo goo"".I've read every single book. The first three books (The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, The Wide Window) are not the same as they are in the movie. I know this is not supposed to be expected but, it made it so confusing! The wedding (Count Olaf and Violet) was supposed to be in the first part (The Bad Beginning) but then was put at the end of the movie after Aunt Josephine died.

Every one of the sets look fantastic (especially the lake, complete with overhanging house).Some aspects of the books have also been changed round, which makes the film better and helps the flow.All in all, I'd say this is one fo the best films this year, after so many that nearly made it, but weren't quite there. 9/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I have commented on this board in the past and have been silenced by imbeciles who have whined about how ""the trailers are bad but i bet you will love it when it comes out"" and similar crap. Well i've seen the movie now....i have experienced it....and i am currently suicidal for having seen it.This movie was possibly the worst I have ever seen. It bore no relation whatsoever to the books. For a start it jumbled the order completely. Secondly, what was with those totally irrelevant and not in the book scenes like the train scene!!??!! Even little facts were overlooked...for example, if anyone feels like READING the reptile room they will discover that contrary to the movie, Uncle Monty actually never had a wife or family...little things like that.As for the acting....whoa....talk about inexperienced. Emily Browning was passable (although her lines weren't) but as for Klaus....wow, he was bad....and by bad i mean worthy of never being cast for another film. He wore the same expression throughout the entire movie with no hint of emotion or intelligence. I am pained every time i think of this boy trying to act as Klaus.... Oh and someone should tell Jim Carrey that a) he sucks and b) he needs to learn that some stories do NOT benefit from his eccentric acting and slapstick humour....this being one such film.Script wise, this movie seemed to completely ignore everything daniel handler integrated into his books in the way of black humour, style and even plot. And yes, i know he drafted the movie, but he did a crap job! If you need an example....just look at Sunny's lines that were subtitled...perhaps some people were childish enough to find them funny, but if you check the books, sunny does not once mutter anything close to ""She's the MAYOR of crazy town""....i feel sick! If you haven't seen the movie....please don't...i mean it, you are wasting your money...if you are a fan of the books especially don't see it, it will make you lose your will to live.

Time and time again hints are dropped about a great and mysterious conspiracy of friends involving spyglasses and fires. As an adult you are bursting with anticipation following this promising build-up only to be sorely disappointed when the whole thing unravels into a hurried and uninspired conclusion in the end. Considering the immense care gone into the visuals it leaves one even more frustrated that the story is such a let-down. I hope the books are better! The only plus the story has is that it follows JK Rowling and the Harry Potter Philosophy that children can actually handle sad stories quite well. So for visuals this film gets a deserved 10, but sadly I don't think the story deserves more than a 3.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Does anybody else, besides me, believe this to be a total crock? Carrey was absolutely brilliant in this movie! He was cast to play the role of a loony, villainous caretaker out to inherit the fortune of the three kids that he has been granted custody of, and he succeeded! Doubters, will you please answer this question for me; who, besides Jim Carrey, could have possibly played this role half as well as he did? Let me know, so I can rightly disagree with you. I have a feeling that this movie is going to be branched out into sequels, and I hope that if so, Jim Carrey returns for them!

494,dillonp-1,Too tim-burton-ish for me,4,1 January 2005,"When I watch a Tim Burton, I almost always walk away with the same reaction: the visual world created in the film is fascinating and arresting, but the story lacks narrative force. When I watch a Tim Burton film, I am reminded throughout that I am experiencing the work of an art director, not the more traditional writer-director.When I watched Lemony Snicket, I was left with that timburton feeling. The visual world is stunning and inventive, particularly the sets, but I was not engaged. It felt a little bit like Fellini-for-children, in that the film unfolded like a dream sequence. Each stop in the film's sequence of sets is bizarre, and makes a great creative effort to lure the audience, but the range of emotions played out by the characters at each of those stops seems both limited and stilted. The characters are very animated, but are, ultimately, very flat and uninteresting. I never gave in to my willing-suspension-of-disbelief -- and, trust me, that's usually not very hard to win.As you would expect from an art director's creation, the set design and visual effects of Lemony Snicket are the real stars of the film. If that's your cup of tea, then you will probably like this film. It has received a number of admiring reviews, and I'm willing to admit that I might be rewarded with some interesting symbolic insights were I too study this film more closely. The star-sets do create an aura of dark intensity, with a sort of Freudian depth.Generally speaking, though, I have a very negative reaction to this film. It represents a class of movies -- most strongly typified by Tim Burton's films -- where too much energy is devoted to the purely visual elements of the work. The directors of this class of film are obviously gifted in the domain of creating unique visual worlds ... but the flimviewing world would be far better off if they would see fit to collaborate with equally talented storytellers.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
495,gunblademaster-1,"A beautiful, dark children's tale.",9,18 December 2004,"Has anyone noticed that children's films aren't that great anymore? Disney has succumbed to mediocrity (besides Pixar, their saving grace), and every other film that comes out follows the same kind of ""finding that I really love my family"" feel-good candy coated formula. It's getting boring. Enter Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.This movie is exceptional. It may draw many comparisons to Tim Burton films, but it still manages to carry its own style. It's rather morbid, yet still maintains a lighthearted tone. It deals with subjects such as murder, greed, and inheritance laws, but still manages to come off as funny. The set pieces are dark and moody, yet whimsical. The film is, for lack of a better word, beautiful. Some may balk and cry that it's not appropriate for children, but I couldn't disagree more.The movie covers The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window, three books from Lemony Snicket's children series. It chronicles the journey of the three Baudelaire children. Violet, the eldest, is a brilliant inventor. Klaus reads everything, and can remember everything he's read. Sunny, the youngest... bites things. They end up in the care of Count Olaf, an eccentric washed out actor with a hidden agenda. Jim Carrey does an amazing job at playing Count Olaf, and I personally thought he underplayed his role, not going to the level of sheer insanity he has in his other films. Lemony Snicket, the author (voiced by Jude Law), constantly breaks the fourth wall, making the film much different than just a straightforward tale.Be warned, this isn't the happiest film out, especially for a children's film. If it were, it'd be called Lemony Snicket's Super Happy Fun Time Land. But it's not. If you don't mind your children's films to be witty, funny, and a bit dark, then look no further. This is not your standard family film.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The more I love a book, the more protective I am. I find flaws in EVERYTHING about a movie adaptation based on books I like. The more I like the books, the more I tend to hate and criticize the movie. When I saw a movie, I was prepared to hate the hell out of it. And *shudder* NICKELODEON was attached to it. Not to mention the shameless marketing--ASOUE LUNCHABLES? The horror! I would leave in tears, I expected, at the first fart joke of the movie. But there were no fart jokes! I was pleasantly surprised at the movie. It wasn't bad. It was so not bad, in fact, I didn't matter when they changed things--and they changed a lot. However, they changed things for the better. I see fans here flipping out because of the train scene, (but the only thing I minded was that they DIDN'T BREAK THE EFFING WINDOWS). Sure, they added things, but it wasn't like how they added things in Prisoner of Azkaban (don't talk to me about Prisoner of Azkaban). The scenes were in character, keeping with the tone of the book. For the life of me, I will never understand the birdie or **** talking shrunken head scenes of PoA. ASOUE kept with the tone and plot. Mind you, they had to squeeze three books into one movie. Remember that. And they managed to capture the plot--and more--into the film. Which is more I can say for Prisoner of Azkaban, which had 3 hours to do one book, and they sold out major plot points (Animagi explanation, anyone? Marauder's Map, please?) for a few cheap laughs. But that's another story. Anyway, the point I was trying to make is, sure, the ASOUE movie changed things, but it was difficult to squeeze in every little detail. They had to add, subtract, move things to make the movie express all the points it NEEDED to express, and they did it well. It was VERY Snicketish. Did anyone notice, for example, the silhouette of Jude Law was like Jim Carrey? A theory in the books is that Snicket is in hiding because he's suspected of being Olaf. He cannot show his face, for example, because he resembles Olaf. I was AMAZED that they captured that. It was more than I expected from it. Much more. And VFD was not mentioned in the first few books, and they talked about--well, implied it, in several scenes. And--the thing that blew me away most of all--was Dustin Hoffman was in it.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The great ideas of it and the mysterious mystery of the fire and the spyglass and so on are just the reason for a parallel world that remembers us of Tim Burton's movies. Another reason for my rating is, that the movie doesn't waste time with explanations. When we see the Eye, there's just a shot that tells us who killed the Parents. The funny little child is :-) quite funny but Jim Carrey IS this movie! I almost forgot Meryl Streep who did a great job with her funny character that sounds like my grandma (""You could be killed by the fridge""). All in all the actors are quite good except Jim Carrey who's great. The FX are good, too.However, it remains the Jim Carrey Show!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
499,AlatatrielSeregon,bad choice of Liam Aiken,7,13 January 2005,"After having read the books, and then seeing the trailer, I was quite hopeful that the outcome would be similar to the Harry Potter books, although the first movie was kind of sucky, since the climax was the triumph over Voldemort, and that was all based on ""the power of love"" and crap. While A Series of Unfortunate Events wasn't disappointing, there were a few things that were lacking.Firstly: why Liam Aiken? He was cute when he played Susan Sarandon's kid when she was dying of cancer in Stepmom, and he was cute as the neglected, fatherless kid that Keanu Reeves befriends in Sweet November, but cute sometimes doesn't cut it. Especially not now. In terms of young male celebrities, I'll admit the pickings are slim. But Aiken was so wooden. In the scene where he and Violet and Sunny are upstairs in the dilapidated bedroom provided by Count Olaf, his performance is so wooden as he tries to convince Violet that she can't give up and they need to somehow figure out a way to get out. It's like he's reading of a giant cue card and doesn't know how to make it sound real. Other than that, I was very impressed by the settings. I was reminded of Tim Burton, and I commend Brad Siberling for portraying the bleak, unreal setting of the books in such a perfect way.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Loved the imagery and soundtrack, and loved Sunny best of all. (her reaction to Aunt Josephine's explanation of her husband's death was priceless)For some reason the bottom of the film was cut off ...we didn't see all of Sunny's subtitles!

The three Baudelaire children's parents die in a fire that burns down their home. From there, the there clever children, Violet (Emily Browning), Klaus (Liam Aiken), and Sunny (Kara & Shelby Kauffman), are taken from relative to relative in hopes of finding a new home. The first relative is Count Olaf, portrayed magnificently by the hilarious Jim Carrey. Misfortune and disaster follow the Baudelaire children as Count Olaf tries everything imaginable to steal the Baudelaire fortune.This movie was, to put it simply, amazing. From the wonderful performances of the children, to the funny, yet creepy, acting by Jim Carrey, this film certainly offers a little bit of everything. The music and set design fit perfectly with this absorbing world, so accurate to the books.This film really needs to be seen to be appreciated. Words cannot express enough. This is not another kiddie film, nor is it a Harry Potter movie. The performances of all the actors was truly spectacular and the children act in several heart-felt scenes that'll make you sniffle.

Though this movie is quite different than the books it remains along the same lines. As a fan of Lemony Snicket's series I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but I would have enjoyed it more if they included more things from the books. The actors were very well cast. They acted perfectly in their roles and Jim Carrey had the whole cinema (when I went to see it) cracking up. The only thing I wonder now is if they'll make other movies on the other books!

There were many pivotal occurrences that were edited out, and then other things were added in. I myself did not like that the plot strayed so far from the books. They mixed up the story lines and then completely screwed them over by tweaking them so much that they bore almost no resemblance to the books they once were. The fact that they took out Klaus' glasses really annoyed me because they are the entire basis for the fifth book, ""The Miserable Mill"". Sunny had too much hair, and Violet's hairstyle was all wrong. Obviously nobody involved in the production of the film much cared about factual correctness, they just wanted an instant box office hit.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The three kids that play the Beaudelaire orphans were awesome too! Little Sonny was so cute!! I loved how she bites things. Meryl Streep was good in it too. Her character is so stupidly funny.

Not only was the story not true to the books but the acting was shall we say less then par. Jim Carrey has never been the best actor and this movie is no exception. With different actors (i.e. Jim Carrey) or maybe a better director this could have been a good movie.

Jim Carrey's amazing acting keeps you wondering why he doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. The children, especially the infant, have played their parts remarkably well. The movie, of course, will be way over kid's heads. It does make a good visual treat, though.

508,aceofspades79,A series of nagging doubts...,6,2 February 2005,"As a huge fan of the books, I was incredibly excited about the release of this movie, and even (gasp) about Jim Carrey playing Count Olaf.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but there are a few things which continue to nag at me when I think about it. These are those things: 1) I don't know what the director was thinking when he cast Liam Aiken as Klaus. Aiken's acting is alright, but the look is so wrong. There were so many pains taken to make Klaus look ""hip"" rather than tragically Edwardian, like Violet and Sunny.2) The writing seemed to attempt to make the characters more accessible to modern kids, in that they were given smarmy, sarcastic lines to say instead of the hilariously juxtaposed intellectual banter they usually engage in. For example, Sunny saying ""Bite me""? It just doesn't work within the context of the movie. One of the selling points of the characters is that they are charming, polite children who respect their elders. They're very unique in the modern era of ""kids who are smarter than their parents"" stereotypes.3) Jim Carrey was given way too much free reign as Olaf. He goes for cheap laughs way too often and comes off as almost goofy and clumsy, rather than the lethal, threatening Olaf from the books. There are too few times when you'll believe that he'll do all the evil things he's supposed to have done. Olaf has been converted into the likable villain who makes a clever comment before a getaway, or who becomes too involved in a certain aspect (ie/ his acting career) to be taken seriously. He is ridiculous instead of terrifying.4) The movie contains a few spoilers from the later books. When I went to see the movie I had read books 1 - 8, and I came up with the answers to some of the mysteries which are central to the books. I won't say what they are here, but suffice it to say that if you intend to read the books, read them prior to seeing the movie.In the end, it seems like the director decided to take a highly original, witty story about the Baudelaires and their various tragedies and turn it into a commercial Jim Carrey vehicle.But that's not to say I didn't enjoy myself completely while watching it. I guess I'm just a bigger fan of the books.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
509,unfortunateventsfreak1,Way better than I had expected...,10,25 December 2004,"I went to this movie in not so big hopes, knowing that Nickelodeon was making it, and they had made some not so great movies. I went to the movie and saw it and came out of the movie amazed at how well they had done it. I thought that Jim Carrey would make the role of Count Olaf more funny when he was supposed to be sinister. He pulled this off perfectly. He showed his wacky self, but he also showed how sinister he could be when he left the children on the railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train. That part kept me on the edge of my seat even though I knew that the children were going to live. He also showed this in the marvelous marriage when he kidnapped Sunny and put her in a cage. I felt much pity for the Baudelaires at the end when they think they are home again. I thought the visual effects were awesome, especially during the hurricane scene where the Baudelaires escape the collapsing house. I also thought that the acting was decent. The kids portrayed the Baudelaires perfectly, and Sunny's lines were absolutely hilarious. Though the Baudelaires experience a series of unfortunate events, it is done so that it is not too gloomy and dark and depressing for people to enjoy it. As for the storyline, it was extremely fast paced and they kept the main key plots in the story, such as Aunt Josephine's note, and they even kept the Marvelous Marriage, which I loved at the end of the movie. I thought it made a great climax and it felt like no time at all before I was out of the theater. And finally, the credits were the most unique that I have ever seen. Me and my friend stayed for all of the credits, and we were the last people out of the theater. All in all, this is a great movie, although it might scare young kids.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

That brought out why Aunt Joe was so afraid of them.I personally love snakes. So the part with the giant snake was a real thriller to me. My little 2 cousin was so scared that he had to be taken out of the theater. The director did a good job of ting the part with the fire and Count Olaf together.

The movie is way too dark to be called a children's film, and not funny enough to be considered a comedy. The best thing to be said about this film is the art direction. The sets, and weather effects are superb. As for the story, it is a very sad and depressing one seeing these children be treated so badly by their evil uncle Count Olaf. Jim Carrey for once does not overact and is quite good in this film. Meryl Streep is the scene stealer for my money and steals the movie as the Aunt Josephine. There is little joy in this film and the ending needed to be much more upbeat. The children's performance are excellent and considering the downbeat subject matter must have been a trial to make this film.On the whole I hope this movie finds its audience, but who that is I have no idea. As for my 4 year old son, he enjoyed it but was keen to see a happier Christmas movie when we returned home. So I dug out 'Elf' for him.

513,cassiethompson341,My Thoughts On the Film,7,7 June 2013,"While this is one of my favorite movies, it has its flaws. For one thing, the movie goes a bit too fast. It goes from The Bad Beginning to The Reptile Room to The Wide Window too quickly. If the movie had taken its time, it would've been better executed. My biggest problem is Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey as Count Olaf?! I read the books before I saw the movie, so I knew what Count Olaf's character was. He is supposed to be a malicious monster, and Jim Carrey turned him into a goof that I had trouble taking seriously. The other actors are great in their roles. Emily Browning, Liam Aiken, Billy Connolly, Meryl Streep, and Timothy Spall are really good in this movie. Another thing, the train scene in the movie is no where in the books. They left out a lot of things from the Bad Beginning part of the movie, such as Justice Strauss saying she'll take them in after Olaf is revealed in the wedding, Violet signing the marriage contact with her left hand, the contract setting fire isn't in the book. One more thing, the heroic work in the movie is switched from Violet to Klaus. Klaus in the movie was the one who saved Violet, but Violet saved herself in the book. Though the movie had many flaws, it doesn't make it a bad movie. The movie is actually pretty good and enjoyable to watch, mind Jim Carrey. So, I give it a 7/10.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
514,nixfishing,"Cinematic ally beautiful, but unfaithful to the books.",7,19 December 2004,"From the eyes of a filmmaker, I saw that this film was definitely handled with genuine cinema savvy and strategic movie business decisions. It was visually stimulating and enjoyable. There were many memorable shots and scenes, and the actors portraying Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudeliere definitely did the characters justice. Also, the cast was top of the line, including wonderful performances from Meryl Streep, Billy Connolly, and Jude Law. The film, simply looked beautiful.However, although probably 60% of the dialogue was exactly as is in the books, I was disappointed when the order and situations were GREATLY altered. Also, Sunny's contributions to the series were not well proclaimed because it was stolen from Jim Carrey's extremely prolonged interpretation of Count Olaf. I felt that the filmmakers were trying to rush the Baudelieres' story; just because they had Carrey on the bill, they had to give him all of the lines. Unfortunately, they sacrificed the art, for the audience. Carrey, mind you is a great actor, but perhaps his ostentation in this film could've been cut down dramatically. Count Olaf, to the Unfortunate Series, is like Voldemort to the Harry Potter Series; Ms. Rowling knows how to keep everything balanced, as do the filmmakers who have proceeded to transform words into picture. However, Carrey did have many moments of accomplishment, and his zany reputation as an actor fits perfectly for the role of Olaf - just don't overbalance the equation.Nonetheless, it made me sad to know that they will probably end the cinematic story here, for doing so is like ending Harry Potter after The Prisoner of Azkaban - so many questions are yet to be answered; the audience will always ache for more, good or bad. If they do decide to continue the wonderful movie-making, I'll be there, opening day.

519,HAWKATNIGHT,I have seen thousands of movies and most of the great stars of the twentieth century but........,1,17 December 2004,"LEMONY SNICKET'S is the worst movie I have seen,......perhaps ever, BUT at least in recent memory. I was so disgusted with it I was speechless, but was just going to chalk it up to a wasted attempt at entertainment.AsI was leaving the theater everyone was talking about what a big waste of time and money this film was. This is truly a bad movie, with few redeeming qualities. The cinematography was very good but the total lack of plot,lack of excitement, lack of drama and the slow pace made it unacceptable. The baby was cute and the lines that were inserted had a certain amount of levity but it is pretty sorry when the non-verbal,distant supporting actor is the best that can be said for a movie.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
520,xmargiex,This movie was an unfortunate event,1,18 December 2004,It was hard to see Jim Carey through all that makeup.The makeup was marvelous. But no matter who played his part the movie stunk. The only funny parts were the baby's. And the baby didn't talk. There was no build up to the character ...I mean you couldn't get close to the character to feel for them. I was really looking forward to this movie .To tell the truth ... I would not tell even a stupid person to see this movie. Even Dustin Hoffman was in the movie if not for only 10 seconds. This Movie was not arranged right nor directed right. For kids that are suppose to be so smart they cannot even get an adult to listen to them. Have they ever heard of screaming or writing a letter? So the movie theater got us for $34. for tickets and $25. for popcorn and eats. They were the only ones to get something out of this movie.,A Series of Unfortunate Events
521,naiki,top recommendations,10,18 December 2004,"Hey. I read the first 8 books in the series before i realized i didn't really like the books at all. in fact i hated them. of course, then i had to keep reading, because i wanted to know what happened.Then they came out with this movie. i had great expectations from it...Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep, Cedric the entertainer...not to mention Liam Aiken. The cast was promising, though i had never heard of Emily Browning. And the girls who played Sunny? Superb.I went into the theatre with high expectations. I was not disappointed in any way, not with the Special effects and whatnot. That doesn't usually happen for me.It was a wonderful change from HArry POtter, though i must admit that i do enjoy those movies. Something different for the holiday season, the movie kept me laughing, having just the right amount of humour, while maintaining a melancholy undertone.Sets were wonderful, actors brilliant, story fascinating and just a little out of the ordinary, any sequel can only get better.And too all you people who said that it was to sad too be a children's movie, what did you expect when they told you it was not a happy tale?",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Tim Curry thought he may have the better voice doesn't look the part so maybe if they used Jim and had a Tim voice over that maybe would have worked but then again maybe not because that would have been too weird. But Jim Carrey though is funny and yes the books can be funny he doesn't have the right kind of humor he is hilarious happy funny, Olaf is serious and mean kind of funny. Carrey just doesn't have the right kind of humor for the movie.

Stuff that happened in the first book was at the end of the movie after the 2nd and 3rd book. Also a lot of the stuff in the movie never really happened in the book. I can't believe they did that. You can't just take things out of sequence, it screws everything else up. Anyone that has read the books will NOT be happy about the movie. I think it was a waste of my money to go and see this movie. I hope they don't make anymore in the series. If they continue to make more movies, they will just continue to screw everything else up.I give this movie a 2 out of 10.

It made me laugh and cry, the unfortunate events become so ironic that they make you laugh and Jim Carey plays a marvellously evil bad guy. The settings were perfect, both relating to the book and visually, they just brought the stories out very well. The over worried Meryl Streep and comfortable billy Connelly also became wonderful additions to the story. If the film did not have all three of the first books in i have no doubt it would not have been even half as interesting. Unfortunately film, as a media, does this to books, if you take something out of the book then make the book a film... well just look at harry potter!

525,lrahhal2,the bad beginning...and middle...and end,2,19 December 2004,"WOW. This movie was a an extreme letdown. The Lemony Snicket book series is an absolute masterpiece and to see such a masterpiece turned into such an awful movie is such a disappointment. Jim Carrey was most definitely not fit to play the part as Count Olaf. If you like the books, don't go see the movie because every time you think of Count Olaf you will think of Jim Carrey trying way too hard to be funny. Not only was this movie nothing like the book, it still would have been horrible if i knew nothing of the books. It is extremely boring, and this is absolutely Jim Carrey's worst role yet. Count Olaf isn't supposed to be a funny character, and if he was, Jim Carrey did a despicable job anyway. This movie is like staring at a brick wall. My only recommendation is that you stick to the extremely good books and don't waste your money on a movie that will have you jumping for joy when it is finally over.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I, on the other hand, have read 9 out of 11 of the books, and I was a little disappointed with it. I know they crammed books 1-3 into one 2 hour long movie, and tried to make it kid friendly, but come on guys. They left out a large amount of important details. Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but the books are better.When you read the books, and get all the details, you start to feel sorry for the children, and wish you could help them yourself. The books are impossible to put down and walk away from. The movie however, almost put me and one of my kids to sleep. I think if they would have made the movie about 30 - 45 minutes shorter, and only used the first book, then they would really have one major movie gold mine. Look at the Harry Potter movies. One book, one movie.My personal opinion is either read the books and skip the movie, or watch the movie, THEN start reading the books. Hopefully if they make a sequel or a trilogy, they will read the books first, and keep a lid on Jim Carrey's ad-libbing. 4/10",A Series of Unfortunate Events
527,bonky109,I loved it!!!!,10,19 December 2004,"They only people who could hate this movie are people who expect child actors to be perfect and the annoying people who expect the movie to follow every detail of the book. Like all those people who walked out of lotr. Stupid!!! It's not the book its a movie. If it was exactly the same what would be the excitement of the movie??? Anywho... Acting was great. The kids who played Sunny were just SO cute! Jim Carrey...Not a big fan of him but he was perfect for this role. Violet and Klaus didn't look like I imagined them to look or as the pictures depicted them but they were very good actors. The makeup, lighting, photography, costumes were awesome but the best part of the whole movie was the scenery. It was beautiful! All the oceans, houses, and cities in the movie made you feel like you were in them and Olaf's house was perfect. It made you hate Olaf even more then you already did. I think this movie would be scary for anyone under the age of 7. If you are a nitpicker who must have every detail the same as the book don't go because I hate to break it to you but you'll hate them movie because Klaus and Violet are the same height...Oh the world is over!!! They didn't pick the characters based on how much they resembled the book characters!!! They went by acting skills??? Oh no!!! The only thing I didn't like about it is that the clues for the mystery were so obvious. If Klaus saw something funny it would do a big fat closeup on it.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The only thing these reviews prove is that America has no culture. This was a very visually impressive movie with a great story (even though you were left hanging for more) and very good cast of actors. I sorry that this country can not think out of the box for a moment to enjoy a very good dark comedy. You think if Brad Pitt was in it maybe it would be considered good? All the people who wrote bad reviews about this movie know absolutely nothing about film-making and the things that are involved in it. Things such as the fabulous art department and the great lighting and cinematography that people fail to mention in their reviews for this movie. It really makes me want to vomit knowing that so many morons visiting this site. I think you should start screening the people you let registure to this site. So for all you people who gave bad reviews to this movie you should shut the hell up and go back to you place in the theater to watch Oceans 12 where you belong with the other idiots. P.S. Just wait to see how many Oscar nominations Jim Carey gets for this role. If not at least 1 for best picture.,A Series of Unfortunate Events
529,berryvale,A must for fans of Tim Burton films!,7,20 December 2004,"Although not directed by Tim Burton, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a film which should not be missed by fans of Tim Burton. From it's dreamlike yet unsettling Worlds, to the strange, disturbing but funny performance of Mr Jim Carry, the film is very ""Tim Burtonish"" in atmosphere , with the accepting of Johnny Depp's absence of course.The film is full of unsettling fantasy worlds designed for children that have been absent since 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'A Nightmare before Christmas ,both of which are films of Tim Burton.The performances a believable and not to over exaggerated. Carry's performance as Count Olaf takes the cake while Meryl Sreep played a memorable role as the jumpy Aunt Josephine.Liam Aiken as Klaus performs with an acting ability only found in older actors while the beautiful Emily Browning dominates the screen portraying the smart, witty character of Violet,I feel, with the right role, we will be seeing her at the Oscars in the years to come.

The cast was absolutely perfect, Jim Carrey was perfect for the part and looked as if he had stepped right out of the book onto screen.The children, did not in the least resemble there book counter parts but i though they suited the best to play the parts and i enjoyed sunny the most. No one should expect the movie to resemble the books i mean seriously. In my opinion a movie that copied the book word for word wouldn't be that fun. a Movie that is not like the book but is well written can pass as great entertainment. I think it was very true to the books even if the order of events were wrong and that true it is a bit dark and i wouldn't take a four year old to see it but I thought it was the best adaptation for the books with perfect scenery, perfect cast, and a really good score and i can't wait to get it on DVD.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I took ages 5-14 and three kids under 9 all requested to leave. Jim Carey portrays a horrible man and the child bride scene was most disturbing. Do not take your kids to see this movie!!!!!!!! There were many scenes that were frightening even to the 8 year old with me. The other mom with me was equally unhappy with the content of the movie and we both agree that Jim Carey is one of the worst actors in our history of movies. He is not appropriate for children of any age. Does he have any values? I was impressed with the little baby in the movie and how well behaved she was. Many lines they put in for the baby's words were how I felt about this movie. Please do not waste your money to go see this flick. Go see National Treasure instead.,A Series of Unfortunate Events
532,jcander,"Great casting/acting, poor adaptation",6,22 December 2004,"The books have so much more to offer. The movie was simply ""rushed through"" in my opinion. It seemed as though the movie had just started and they were already moving in with Aunt Josephine. Sadly, there are many things in the book that were passed over for the sake of fitting everything into a typical movie length. I really think this movie would have been more fun and perhaps more profitable if they would have simply made a movie out of the first book. I would much prefer that they embellish/add-in all the extras they wish, like the car on the tracks scene, and fill and hour and a half. My point is that there was so much overlooked.My ten year old daughter and I have read the books and my daughter was extremely disappointed that there were so many changes from the book. She came out of the movie asking, ""Where's Klaus' glasses?"" and ""Why didn't they show Captain Sham's business card?"" and ""Why did Klaus build the grappling hook and climb the tower?"" You never felt the love that the children had for Judge Strauss and the joy they had visiting her home. They never show how they acquired the boat to find Aunt Josephine in the Curdled Caves. There's so many things missing/forgotten that I could go on and on.The special effects and the acting are phenomenal.

The whole essence of a book is that it is something to savour, to enjoy. Look at Lord of the Rings and you can see that you can only shoehorn so much into a film in one go. Something's got to give. I haven't read the books (although having seen the film I shall now be tracking them down), so I can't comment on them. However, this film is well acted, with a collection of interesting actors and actresses in varied roles that are often unusual (Jim Carrey works splendidly as the off-the-wall bad guy, and Billy Connolly is a pleasant surprise) and yet seem to mesh very well indeed. If you've read the books and are very attached to them, then expect to feel ripped off. Yes, they've left a lot out. Yes, they've taken liberties with character casting. But you'll walk out of the cinema feeling impressed by the overall result - the visual style *feels* spot on, and the acting is impressive from the actors of all ages. It isn't for everyone - in terms of both plot and action - but those who give it a chance will find themselves pleasantly surprised and will no doubt find themselves picking up the books next year too!",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I must give them credit for scaring the pants off me with the snake. My daughter even screamed out loud in the theater and everyone got a big chuckle out of that. Other than that I would just rate it average. They seemed like they were chasing the coat tails of the batman movies with their dark foreboding homes and gotham like towns.

536,jpierce492,Save your Money.,1,22 December 2004,"Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events Do not see this movie; it is mean-spirited and nasty. It will frighten children and bore adults. Please stay away.If you have read the book on which this movie was based (actually, it was based on pieces of three books in the Lemony Snicket series), you know that the book also carried a warning to children not to read it, insisting they would not like it. Of course, that was just a promotional gimmick because, I understand, the book was actually quite good; the children in the story were subjected to a series of trying events but they stuck together and worked things out through their own ingenuity, and celebrated each triumph.That doesn't happen in this movie. And so my warning is not a ploy to intrigue you into seeing this. I am very serious when I tell you: this movie is terrible. It has no humor, no redeeming values, no credible situations, no characters who create any sense of empathy or interest.If it had been up to me to name this movie, I would have suggested other  and more appropriate  titles. For example, I might have called it 'Jim Carrey's Unending Embarrassing Situations'or maybe 'An Interminable Series of Increasingly Stupid Ideas'or even 'An Incredibly Unfortunate Movie Choice For Audiences'.Any one of those would have been a better description of what the movie is all about. This is a story of three children  Victoria and Klaus, two very young teenagers, and their baby sister, Sunny, all of whom have become orphans when their parent are killed in a fire. They are taken by their Uncle Po to a series of guardians  one of whom is evil (Count Olaf) who keeps resurfacing; one of whom is a kindly snake handler (Uncle Monty) and is killed, and one of whom is nuts (Aunt Josephine) and afraid of everything.Each of these guardians exposes the children to a series of events, most of which are at least frighteningly bizarre (a giant python ends up coiled around the baby; the kids are attacked by sea slugs) and, in at least one case, somewhat sleazy (Count Olaf tries to marry 14-year-old Victoria). There are good actors in this movie, but the director, Brad Silberling who did 'Moonlight Mile' doesn't put them to work. This is Jim Carrey running amok, behaving like a deranged idiot, without purpose, focus, or sense of fun.In some ways, this movie has a 'Tim Burton' feeling to it. But don't be mislead; Tim Burton knows how to create real characters and his sense of style comes with substance. His movies may be dark, but they are not mean-spirited  and this one clearly is. In fact, what I liked best about this movie were the stylish end credits. But, by then, I had made up my mind  the movie stunk  and it was too late to convince me otherwise.There are enough other movies out there for you to see. It would be an 'unfortunate event' for you to purchase a ticket to this one.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

If you have read the books you may relate to my dismay, still keeping an open mind I said I will wait and give it a chance.

The sets, costumes, and score were fantastic--the beginnings of a promising movie. However, the plot lacked all the makings of an entertaining and intelligent film, and depended primarily on the typecast Jim Carey character to carry the sub-sequential weight-which he did so unsuccessfully. Money, sensational effects, and a tired actor simply fail to fall in line in this movie.

It did not follow the books as well as say, Harry Potter, or Dune, but despite how much of the original stories were left on the editing floor, the movie flowed very well, it made sense and was funny, and as my entire family agrees with me, it kept the flavor of the books which made the movie good and true. Of course, they added and had to take away things. This is a movie. Lets keep in mind that there's budget and time constrictions. The Lord of the Rings is just about the one movie that spat in the face of time limits in a book to film conversion. But this is a kid's book series and therefore a kid's movie. And you can only hold a kid's attention span for so long. If you think they revealed too much of the mystery too fast that was in the books, try to remember that no one's sure they'll make a sequel, so they have to say enough to make it interesting, but they kept enough quiet to carry through the series. So lots of additions, yes. Lots of subtractions and editing, yes. But it was still fun, and as true to the books as I would hope Hollywood would be.

Casting was good, sets were outstanding, costumes were very nice.As an adaptation of the books, however, this was horrendous. It was as if the writer had torn a quarter of the pages from the first three books, a few pages from books 4-9, and pasted them together in a random fashion to try and create a cohesive movie. Now, had I not read the books, I would have enjoyed this movie very much, so I have to give that to them, but as a fan, it was just a slap in the face.If you've read the books, don't see the movie, it will just enrage you. If you haven't, see the movie. It'll be very enjoyable. If, however, you decide to read the books afterwards, be aware that they are far darker than the movie shows, and the mystery is certainly deeper than some magnifying glass in Count Olaf's house.

My wife and I (we have 3 children, 16 to 24 and love kids movies) walked out after about 15 minutes into this dreadful movie. Besides the acting - or over-acting, in Jim Carey's case - being some of the worst by any group of professionals, the ostensible ""dark"" humor isn't really dark: it is perverse, extremely aggressive, and breathtaking in its lack of any standard of sensitivity for the psychology of the age group for which it is intended. That is, movies can be powerful and compelling role models for children at impressionable ages. The impact of hearing a parent reading (or even reading oneself) the most violent of fairy tales pales in comparison to the impact of the modern movie theater experience. Do we really want our children laughing at the imminent death of the younger sibling (a baby, no less!) being used by the ""star"" of the movie to leverage marriage to a teenage female who probably has just emerged from puberty during the past few years. (Yes, yes, I know that 12 and 13 y.o. girls have babies - but does that make it OK?) The implications of the thematic elements of this film have deeper reaches into the psyche than many realize.

546,kksullivan365,the credits were better than the movie!,4,27 December 2004,"What a pity. The three children were quite brilliant, but they were overshadowed by the over-the-top performance by Jim Carrey. He was given all the good lines, which fit right in with his hilarious performances, but did NOT SERVE THE STORY. In the theater we call this selfish acting. Count Olaf is not, rather should not be, the star of the story. The adult characters and their comments which were meant to be funny, clashed horribly with the sadness that the orphans portrayed so well. They attempted to create a comical kid's piece and a creepy mystery at the same time and it didn't fit. It would have been infinitely better to keep the same bizarre dark comedy that the books had and throw out the strait humor they throw at you. Tim Burton, I think, would have done a better job at directing. The quirky humor in Edward Scisor-hands comes to mind. And Allen Rickman would have been a better Count Olaf; he tends to allow other actors more room to move and would have a creepier sense to his performance. However, the sets were beautiful and fit the mood dark mood the books had, they had the same twisted reality sense. This saved it for me. Truly an unfortunate event.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
547,cimourdain,Good adaptation of the books,8,28 December 2004,"I have to admit I find it funny to read the reviews where people are incensed that the movie didn't stick closer to the books. I love the books but the way they're written makes it almost impossible to faithfully copy them exactly for a movie. Do you really want all of the narrator comments? If not, then you immediately lose a lot of being able to faithfully adapt the books exactly.I thought the movie was great. I can forgive the gerrymandering of the plot lines of the 3 books. Jim Carrey was just the right amount of the over-the-top for Count Olaf, it didn't become a Jim Carrey movie and Count Olaf was just as obnoxious as he is in the books. The children, esp Sunny, were great and I loved Meryl Streep.2 criticisms - I do wish the makers hadn't been afraid to maybe add 15 more minutes to the movie to take a little more time to develop the characters a little better. Like scenes with the Judge or Uncle Monty or even Mr. Poe. But since the movie isn't geared for my age group but a younger one I can forgive that. Also, I thought the ending was a little too sentimental.The costumes and scenery and props are amazing. Enough to make Brett Helquist and frankly Edward Gory proud. And Jim Carrey has been able to translate Count Olaf exactly from the books.All and all a good adaptation of the books. Less antiseptic than the first 2 Harry Potter adaptations.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I guarantee you'll laugh, scream, and be itching to see what happens next. Jim Carrey should win an academy award for it. The credits were also just as good as the movie itself. And i have never read the books! It's dark, depressing, but still has a great plot. It's an artistic wonder and I will definitely see it when it comes out on video.

It is very different from the books, but not in a bad way, rather a very succinct abridgement of the first 3 works. Although obviously much cropping had to be done, the movie remains very true to the plot of the text, despite some shuffling of sequence.I definitely agree that Harry Potter fans will enjoy this movie very much. The cinematography is similar, although the plot and characters are not. Great movie for kids, and Meryl Streep or Jim Carrey fans, both of whom are outstanding in this film. Carrey is hilarious, but not in an over-the-top obnoxious way. His goofy style shines through, but it does not dominate the picture at all, rather the control of the child actors Emily Browning and Liam Aiken. Look out for Emily Browning, she promises to blossom into quite an accomplished actress.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I think Jim Carrey played his roll wonderfully as Count Olaf. I think Klaus is hot. I think they should have made three sperate movies instead of just the three books squeshed into one movie. I could have watched it for hours on end. I think sunny is cute but it is so obvious she is played by twins. I have seen the movie three times now cause it was so entertaining and i would see it again but i have no money. I think the ladies who hang around with Count Olaf are scary. I think the happy elf bit played a the begging was funny. I think i should summarise by saying everyone should see this movie.,A Series of Unfortunate Events

I have seen practically all of his movies, but for some reason I really liked this one the best. Not only because I liked the movie and how it turned out but because I think that Liam Aiken is HOTT!!! I also really enjoyed the Lemony Snicket books...So I have to give my props to him...but I have a big question. I don't know who is going to answer it but i'll ask anyways. The story is that I have always wanted to be an actress and so I tried out for drama and got in... and since I am only a year younger than Liam then maybe I could get an answer to try out for the part of Isadora from book 5: ""The Austere Academy"" ...

Though Liam Aiken was a bit stiff, he still did wonderfully as Klaus, and Emily Browning did incredibly as Violet, plus she is very good looking.

I was, however, disappointed with the movie version. I thought the beginning was very creative, but after a while, I noticed a few things that weren't quite right. Yes, I know that movies based on books and vice-versa are not always the same. They're naturally going to be different. But I thought the movie was too different. They seemed to focus too much on the villain, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) and not enough on the children. Jim Carrey put too much humor into his character. Yes, it was funny, but his character is just not funny. The positions the children were in didn't seem too horrible, not too unfortunate. By cramming in three of the books into an hour and a half movie, they seemed to miss some important points.The child actors were fantastic.

However, now that they saw the film they are all reading the series.The movie brought the characters to life for them. It also helped them balance the sadness in the books with the humor in the books. Carrey is wonderful in this film. He does a great job balancing the strangeness of the Count with the humor in the situation. The kid actors also do a great job. Sunny is too cute. Streep is fantastic.

Why ruin a fantastic series?And furthermore, why cast Jim Carrey, a comedian, as a man who is pure evil?

561,looneylovegood4,Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events was a HUGE disappointment!,1,7 January 2005,"Ever since about fifth grade, I have read Lemony Snicket's books religiously. I have loved every single book, and always wanted the next book right away. So when I was in sixth grade and was at Universal Studios Hollywood, and heard that they would be making a movie, I was overjoyed! Back then, I had thought the movie would be out very soon, like within the year, but to my dismay, it took about three years. So when I knew the date that the movie opened, December 17 2004, I found a friend and was first in line. I got into the theater, picked my seat, and got ready for the one movie that might beat the Harry Potter Series. The movie started and it was fine, until I started seeing things in the movie that were different from the books. The first things I noticed were that Mr. Poe never coughed, Klaus only wore his glasses for reading, and Violet tied her hair ribbon to her ponytail. Then I started to notice that Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) was very.... funny. Now, that fact confused me. I recalled the name of the book series... A Series of UNFORTUNATE Events. Hmm.... funny.... i never knew that unfortunate also meant funny. EXCUSE ME JIM CARREY, DID YOU EVEN READ ANY OF THE BOOKS?!!? I MEAN, IF YOU HAD READ EVEN ONE, YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT COUNT OLAF IS Mischievous, CRUEL, EVIL, VILE, WICKED, VICIOUS, and I COULD GO ON FOREVER. ANYWAYS IF YOU HAD READ ONE OF THE BOOKS YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT COUNT OLAF IS NOT FUNNY! THE AUDIENCE SHOULD NEVER HAVE LAUGHED AT ALL! Anyways, what was with Count Olaf locking the children in the car to have them killed? That made no sense because if they all died, what good would that do for him? He was supposed to get married to Violet first, then he could kill them. And in the first book, it never said that he was their legal guardian. So I don't understand that part of the movie, but I also don't understand the order of the movie. I mean, why would they ever have put the end of book one, at the end of the movie. Where did they ever get that stupid idea? And if putting the end of book one at the end of the movie wasn't enough, they didn't even do it right! They were supposed to have Violet sign in her wrong hand. And they found this out from visiting Justice Strauss' library, which they didn't do either... And what was with KLAUS making the invention and climbing up the wall to save Sunny? That is Violet's job! Other than those huge problems, the movie skipped many crucial parts of the books. They didn't show how in the second book Violet and Klaus proved that ""Stephano"" was Count Olaf. That was the best part of that book and they just skipped it. And my favorite part of book three, was when Klaus and Violet became sick from the peppermints to be able to go home and plot against Count Olaf. I mean why leave those good parts out? So the movie might become two hours long, but Harry Potter did it and did it well! And also WHY DID THEY POINT TO VFD SO SOON! THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO FIND THAT OUT FROM DUNCAN AND ISADORA IN BOOK FIVE! I MEAN COME ON! WAY TO RUIN THE STORY! Also what was with the spyglasses? And that picture Aunt Joesphine had? That gave the children a really easy way to see that their parents were with a secret organization! Another great way to ruin the order of the stories! And what was with the big eye glass that burned all the houses? In all the books, you never find out how Count Olaf did the burning of the buildings! It is supposed to leave you guessing, and hopefully in a later book you'll find out how he did it. I mean, this movie was a true catastrophe. So many things about it were wrong, and that makes me sad. I'm sad because all the actors were great, other than Count Olaf. He was poorly played by ""funny man"" Jim Carrey. My last question is why did they change the books? They didn't need to be changed! I say that if they make another movie, TAKE JIM CARREY OUT! Pick another actor. A scary and evil one. Maybe Jason Isaac's would do a better job. He sure knows how to be evil to Harry Potter! So all in all I hated this movie! Other than the children's acting, I hated every part of it. I will not buy the DVD or rent it. I am so disappointed!And from reading other peoples comments about how they wanted to see Jim Carrey in another funny role made me sad. Has anyone even read a page of those books? I mean they are sad from beginning to end. They are always depressing and never funny. So Jim Carrey was an awful choice. People also said that they loved the costumes, but uh, have you looked at the covers of the books? Violet wears a purple dress, not a raggedy black one! And, why would they be wearing ugly clothes? THEY ARE RICH! DUH! THE BAUDELAIRE FORTUNE! I MEAN COME ON! Anyways I feel so much better to get all these problems out to the public. I hope you read this and understand that the movie was a truly UNFORTUNATE EVENT.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

I have seen it around 25 times (15 of these at the cinema), and my enjoyment of it only seems to grow with each viewing. Anyway, I posted this because I wanted to discuss some of subtleties of the film. For instance, there is obviously chemistry between Count Olaf and Aunt Josephine, and it is made to appear to be the product of Olaf's cunning. Even on my first viewing I found this chemistry a little hard to believe, I mean, they had only known each other for five minutes...Or had they? After about my 5th viewing I began to suspect that these two characters were in fact the parents of the Baudelaire children. This would explain why Olaf murdered Josephine's husband, and the children's 'parents'. Parahaps he was simply trying to reunite himself with Josephine and his children??? Now, the only problem I see with this is that Josephine seems to have no memory of her relationship with Olaf. This brings me to my next theory: The watch-glasses are memory erasing devices. A watch-glass, which is obviously held close to the eye, would be an ideal vessel for such a device, providing a direct link to the brain via the optic nerve. Would this be a valid interpretation?

577,martisikes,This was an uncomfortable movie to watch,1,4 February 2005,"We just left the movie theater. I could not wait to leave. Mr. Carey had too much freedom. The movie was disjointed, without humor, uncomfortably like a crop of lectures to children and basically felt like it was not good for children to see. I have 5 grandchildren and will recommend that they pass on this one. No child giggled, laughed or found any humor in the theater while watching this movie with us. Every one left the theater somewhat stunned, not happy and not sad. Just stunned. Why? Two hours of my time is now gone, and on what? It is not wise to say much more as I am uncomfortable with the whole production. Clearly I did not care for this film.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Violet, Klaus and Sunny are these three orphans who have to face the problem of cope with their uncle Count Olaf, who received their custody in order to ""take care of"" them. Olaf (Jim Carrey) is an untalented and frustrated actor who wants to kill his nephews in order to get the Baudelaire fortune. This drama-comedy story told by Lemony Snicket, reflects the funny face of living under unfortunate events, such as loosing your parents and your home. I really love this film because of the message delivered to the audience: family love remains beyond tragedies. In addition, this film gives us very attractive and eclectic scenes where the music, light and costumes create a magical parallel world. I would strongly recommend you to go and see this wonderful movie.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
579,whitlas,Roller-coaster entertainment,8,20 February 2005,"My son loved the books and was enthralled by the film. He said it followed the character, but not the sequence, of the books very well. I liked the film even more than him. Jim C was at his best, the rest of the cast were also excellent characters. There was an undercurrent of threat to the main characters all the way through the film and this was supplemented by some dramatic scenery and action scenes, but the outcome was more exciting rather than scary, so the film should appeal to a wide age range of children and teenagers. The aura of the film makes it well worth a visit to the cinema. If you are going to watch it at home at least turn the lights out to get the best effect.

580,strangerrrrr,the book found its match,10,21 February 2005,"This movie is a talented improvisation made in the same spirit in which the books are written. In fact, it's so much in tune with the books that it seems as if the author himself was writing the movie script, and instead of methodically sticking to the text of the book, which would be so unlike himself, he turned on his brilliant creativity again and the movie became a masterpiece instead of becoming a snapshot. I have read the books prior to seeing the movie and found the movie exciting and full of surprises. Some of the surprises are prepared in a very ""Lemony Snicket"" way, especially for those who had read the books, and made the movie for them a completely new and yet familiar experience.

582,jduperon,Don't waste your time on this worse than tripe monstrosity,1,2 March 2005,"This is a bad, bad, film. I kept hoping it would get better, and it didn't. Here are the reasons:1. Bad acting. The kids can't act. Period. They just can't. 2. Jim Carey. I like Jim Carey in most things he does. However, he has done a few films where he merely plays an obnoxious, annoying person (think Ace Ventura or the Grinch). If that annoys you at all about any of the roles he's ever played, you will not like him here. This is Carey at his most obnoxious. 3. Point? This film just goes on and on without any point. Characters are introduced, characters disappear. The people wear Victorian era clothing, but then live in present day New York? but not New York where people drive cars from the 50's and modern day convenience stores exist? Some people are British, some people are American, while Connolly is Scottish? It was like some kind of bad drug trip. Take 4 good movies: Lost Highway + Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas + Harry Potter + The Mask and mix them all up and you have this movie. The first two because things just happen that don't make sense, Harry Potter because of the costumes and scenery and a few Brits, and The Mask because Jim Carey is hopping all over the place being obnoxious.It's hard to believe that so many good reviews have been written about this film. It seems to me that most of the people have read the books. I didn't know that it was based on a series of books until after I'd seen the film, so I don't have this bias. The only other reason I can imagine that anyone had anything good to say about this film was the fact that the costumes and some scenes are pretty. But it isn't as though they set a mood, like in the movie Underworld, but rather the costumes and scenes all clash with one another. For this reason, I wouldn't even say the costuming or scenes were well done.All in all, I have nothing good to say about this film. I felt cheated as I sat in the cinema watching it. Please don't give these thieves any more money.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
583,Lilithone,Carey Pulled it off,6,6 March 2005,"Without Jim Carey, I believe this movie would have been a disappointment and total flop. Carey was this film's saving grace and pulled it off, bringing the character of Count Olaf (and his other characters) alive, amusing and interesting. The plot was far too predictable, but it must be kept in mind that ""Lemony Snicket"" is more for a young audience and as that, was quite good. Unlike other children's movies, adults won't find it painfully boring. Jim Carey was, as always, outstanding. He proves creative genius with his character portrayals and was the only factor in my keeping my seat. I would recommend this movie to other adults for their children.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

And about those comments about missing something from the books, well, I haven't read them yet (but I'm going to!!) but I know that you can't compare the book with the movie 'cause you'll end up a little disappointed. I had that with the Harry Potter books-movies...I'm not a Jim Carrey-fan but he did a great job here!! and so did the other actors... Sunny was soooooo cute =D, and I liked Violet's clothes (the dress,etc.)By the way: the credit thing on the end was really nice, and creative! When everybody was already leaving the theater I was just still watching...Well I'm not a movie-critic or something and I don't really know a lot about actors (I'm only 15...), but this is one of my favorites! =D",A Series of Unfortunate Events
585,angusfighter,Gimmicks are not enough to rescue an film with no surprises,1,3 April 2005,"It is meaningless to tell me how good was the original novel, or how exciting it will be in the later chapters. As a film, of this episode alone, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events for me is just a story with tricks which are not tricky and mysteries which are not mysterious at all. The story happened all of a sudden but all under expectation, except it is unexpectedly boring and naive.It could be provocatively interesting if a tale for children is telling you explicitly that it is not a happy story, but not in an extremely repeated pattern. Just as a joke would not work when it is told the second time, nor even a third one. Unfortunate stories are not uncommon in children's literature, instead they are classics. Charles Dickens is one of them. That's why if ""unfortunate"" were to be a highlight, audience would probably wonder how unfortunate it is different from other stories. We would tend to stand aside, wait and see, rather than getting involve emotionally in the story. Such arrangement, thus, would turn audience into severe disappointment just because ""it isn't dark enough"".The content of the story is surprisingly simple and under expectation. It is not more than illustrating children fighting against something evil along the life road in the pursuit of eternal happiness. It is conventional, but details can make a difference. I agree with some comments using the words ""suspense is weak and no surprises at all"" to describe the film. The fire burning all of a sudden, for an example, is too easy to be explained and solved by our common sense, or any elementary popular science books. It could be funny to see the children, who are supposed to be smart, being fooled around for nearly two hours, calculated in our time of course, to discover such a stupid mystery ""Oh! It is the big evil who burn our house in this way!"". Well, who didn't know?It is also too naive to be a ""noir comedy"", if it is really what they claim to achieve, in psychological context. If, as Klaus Baudelaire said, everything arises must have their reason, what is the reason of Count Olaf become so greedy? It is out of nothing, except one big reason: he plays the role of evil. Script writers seem so eager to teach us a lesson that, before the impact of the tragedy (I wonder whether it has really come) crushed into our heart, we had already been told ""It is all your fault not to believe the children"". Everything is so artificial, without deeper struggles and complexity. Just like a man with full mouth of attitudes but he could do nothing in real. How could we blame the audience who leave the seats in front of the screen and leave without feeling anything?Not only audience, actors are also in the disasters. Facing flat characters, actors could do nothing but the conventional gestures. It is quite unfair to comment anything about their acting skills because they really don't need to. Not to mention how sexy dude Jude Law become a dark cloud of nothing, as a film highly publicized with the name ""Jim Carrey"", we see the clothes and the make-up rather than the talents of his, even worse than his last attempt ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". My attention is, for sure, redirected to handsome Klaus and pretty Violet, nothing to do with their acting, but mainly their in-born charming appearance. But it is so pity to mention, according to the reader lovers, that they are not like the characters the fiction intentionally described.Some would argue the emphasis of the existence of author is post-modern for its self- conscious characteristic but I do not agree. It is not so until the role of author is obviously interact with the story but in this case it isn't. It served just for effects, merely cinematic effects (although a nice one), to cover its shortage of exciting content. Some would argue it is just so dark that some people find it hard to enjoy as watching other dreamily fantasy stories. They would call what the cartoon played in the beginning as dark humour, but for me, it is just an unimaginative one, if I am forced to admit it is one. In fact, the gimmicks and effects just mentioned are ubiquitous in this movie. Good examples are Violet tying up her hair when she is going to invent something, as well as some books popping out among the bookshelf while Klaus is going to make use of certain kind of knowledge. They would make a good film more stylistic, but a bad film more irritating. With supposing a considerable budget, it could be easy to find the best props and settings, costumes and make-ups, images and styles, promotions and gimmicks but it cannot change anything if it is empty spiritually. It is what the film suffers most.Some say that novels are more readable and lovable. I am not sure. But for one thing I am sure is that, not every literature work is suitable for another kind of form of expression. For such a series of short-length story with lots of gimmicks, effects and repeated patterns, it would be more appropriate to be television series rather than a film work. (Co-incidentally, the director works for TV for long) However, as you know it is simply a project initiated by Paramount which just want to film a second Harry Potter, you will probably astonish for a while and pray for its stupidity. Another literature hit ""An curious incident of the dog in the night-time"" is heard to be in the similar fate. We will probably witness how entrepreneur, with no enthusiasm on art but numbers, ruin a classics again. This is a ""bad beginning"" of ""a series of unfortunate events"".

586,elizabethwu_15,A Totally Great Movie,10,11 April 2005,"A Series Of Unfortunate Event is on my Top 10's number 1.I read all the published books,1-11.My sister's P4 teacher introduced it to her,and she introduced it to me.She only read book 1 and didn't like it.I LURRVE it!!! Now that it has been made a movie,I am so excited and hope I can watch it a second time(watched it once)!The movie was not like comedy,but it was funny,a little.With the help of Count Olaf!Which was acted by Jim Carrey.He is such a funny fellow.My favourite character in the movie and books is Violet Baudelaire,acted by Emily Jane Browning.She has also acted Ghost Ship,Darkness Falls,and Ned Kelly(with a hunk which i do not like much,Orlando Bloom..)and some more.A character,Klaus Baudelaire,looks like he as all the attention.But I think it's because of his looks.OK,maybe I can take that.But I still think even Sunny Baudelaire is better than him.I wonder why he acts better in Good Boy!,which I have bought to see how he acts...Anyway,I must say a ""Good job,well done!"" to director Brad Siberling.It's not his fault if the movie don't seem depressing at all.It's Lemony Snicket's,the author.The books are not meant to be depressing,although the title sounds so.I read that in a newspaper review of the movie and told my elder sister that.She still didn't believe it.I think those people who say things like ""When I walked out of the cinema,I heard everyone saying they shouldn't waste heir money to buy these tickets to watch this movie"" are funny.I don't believe that people would even say it out loud!They can feel that way,but never would they say it out,especially loudly.Also,I don't think people would walk out of the cinema of such a GREAT movie.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

It's visual effects, over the top characters, and stunning production sets made this movie feel as well as look great. Not once during any of the scenes did i feel like Count Olaf was Jim Carrey, a masterful presence of evil that was still not too foreboding. I myself am a big fan of Jim Carrey and think he has mastered the ability to step into and out of his characters with ease.If anything he definitely has mastered the ability to hide himself within his character yet still maintaining the great Jim Carrey expressionism. I do think this film had some dark aspects and many people may not want their children exposed to this but i watched it with my young nephews, 3 and 6, and they thoroughly enjoyed this film despite its dark and despairing moments. 9 out of 10 Stars *********- and Kudos to Carrey for his skillful interpretation of this character.Great visual elements in this film, a must see if for nothing more than the eye candy.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
588,andrewe97,Three siblings try settling with distant relatives after their parent's death. A mystery keeps them on their feet while a certain kin tries to acquire their family fortune.,9,15 May 2014,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a movie that contains depth and mesmerizing segments of action. It follows three protagonists: Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire through a series of unfortunate events that blend harmoniously with each of the movie's abstract settings.The exploration of common human fears is not thematic in this movie. Flesh eating leeches, heights and snakes are only some of the disturbing scary things which enticed me to continue watching. These fears peppered the movie and stimulated reflection. Those leeches are the kinds that feast on wooden boats if they smell blood. When the characters had their near death experience with them, it roused empathy. The snakes sound deadly and look frightening, but actually play with toddlers. The heights are what stayed within the border of realism, and whatever went out of that border stirred up a lot of thought.This mystery, adventure and comedy film all begins with Lemony Snicket, a cryptic author retracing the steps of the Baudelaire children from within a clock tower.With each transition of location, a new mystery is discovered among the siblings that guides them closer to the answer to their parent's involvement in a secret organization, alongside their death from a fatal house fire. As the kids travel to different locations, thematic symbols about the secret organization are subtly scattered. Together with the mystery, the orphaned Baudelaires go from relative to relative while one kin goes to extreme measures to receive the Baudelaire family fortune.The antagonist of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey), was off-putting due to the over-exaggeration of acting in almost every scene. It seemed like his character lacked substance and drifted towards reliance on facial expressions to make him appear interesting. The Baudelaire siblings on the other hand were casted beautifully. Each was known as either a bookworm, the finest fourteen year old inventor in the world and a biter.The child actors played their roles to a high standard where in the end, some people like me were rather sad their journey ended. Those characters grew onto me. I desperately wanted to have a sneak peak into their future, whether it was going to be utopian or dystopian.The movie contains a variety of characters. Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep), a pessimistic and impulsive character who lives in a house above the ocean, on a plateau is humorous and irritating. If you think everything around you will hurt you, then you and her will most certainly relate.Around the time the Baudelaires see her home's observatory, the theme of the movie stands out. The large windowpane's borders portray the secret organization's symbol, and all those small subtleties become easily noticeable.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Superb costumes and sets, fine acting performances, and a series of really unfortunate events make this tragic tale of woe and alarm worth watching. The children's performances show careful casting and handling. They are sweet, funny, and intelligent. The adults, led by Jim Carey, have real spark. He's at his best here. Casting him in the role of an evil, over-acting thespian is perfect. When it comes to playing the role of a bad, over-acting actor, Jim Carey stands alone. Billy Connolly and Meryl Streep are wonderful in their roles as eccentric but loving relatives. The sets and costumes are Oscar-winning. The books are clever and funny. The movie, combining the first three books, does a fine job remaining true to the books, while delivering a complete and cohesive storyline structure. Read the books. Watch the movie.

It inhales very deeply ! ! ! really..... and I'm NOT a movie hater. Jim Carey does do a good job with the acting. IT's just the content of the movie. It's dark humor isn't there. It's just sad and depressing. You keep waiting for the big laughs and the laugh was on us. There were none. With all the characters that Jim does, you'd think there'd be some kind of whimsy, but no.

591,ganymede_44,You won't truly understand if you don't read the books,8,14 May 2005,"Let me inform you that I teach 4th grade at your local elementary school. I have read all 12 of the Lemony Snicket books (yes, there's a 13th soon on the way...), and so have the majority of all 8-11 year olds. From an educators perspective it is a pure phenomenon comparable to Harry Potter, yet much, MUCH darker. The movie you just watched/are about to watch is a brief overview of what actually occurs in the books - compare it to watching Lord of the Rings BEFORE reading the books; as good as the movie is, without prior knowledge you may be left in the dark at times.Yes, DO expect sequel(s). What was covered was merely the first 3 books (hopefully you will have already figured that out). However, as others who have read the series will explain, this movie is not in sequential order. Bits and pieces of storyline of the next few books are sprinkled in here and there; there is a scene or two injected into the story which actually never happens in the series. Much more description and development of the characters can be found by reading instead of watching the movie. Beloved characters are quickly introduced and passed upon, thus my only true complaint with this movie.Nevertheless, Carrey does a superb job capturing the essence of Count Olaf, and the Boudelaire orphans are also perfectly cast. What material they do cover is true to form - I could not imagine a better rendition. Beautiful settings, accurate text translations, and good acting. Wonderful cast (Dustin Hoffman in a 3 minute part? =), and great direction. I'll save final judgment for after the other movies complete the series, but it was a wonderful beginning.

Perhaps the only positive that can be gleaned from the soporific production is the vibrant set designs--unfortunately there is not much else to compliment in what could more aptly be titled, ""A Series of Unforunate Scenes"". Jim Carrey as the dastardly Count Olaf is at his over-the-top and hackneyed worst and clearly manages to portray Count Olaf playing Jim Carrey rather than vice-versa. The plot is very simplistic at best and nonsensical and silly at worst--at a great many point in the film all of the other protagonists (save for the three children main characters) range from unbelievably oblivious to frustratingly idiotic in regards to the persistent threat to the children. Add in an extremely confusing setting (various characters with British accents while others have American accents; some characters dress' is Victorian while at the same time driving by small-town convenience stores in late-70s model automobile, etc) and breathtaking talent such as Cedric the Entertainer and the Aflac Duck in addition to a stilted and goofy performance by Meryl Streep and you have yourself what is sure to be one of the hottest contenders at the Razzies this year.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Also the dark and creepy mood that is apparent from the start, was held properly and perfectly throughout the movie. The actors performances are great as to expect.

I didn't actually see the movie in the cinema but my Dad bought it for me on DVD. And i must say, its a wast of space on my shelf. (And to be honest, I'm glad i didn't waist £2:50 in the cinema to see such a poorly made film.) I am a big fan of the books, i adore them, But its a different relationship with the film. And the film did not give the books ANY Justice.I remember seeing it advertised on the T.V and i thought, ""Great! I can't wait to see the movie."" But then, I saw Jim Carrey as Count Olaf? WTF?! Jim Carrey should REALLY stick to COMEDY. Count Olaf is meant to be scary, serious and horrible. I can't see Jim Carrey as that. For Christ sakes?! In one of his other films, he was playing god?! The kid actors where good. But the boy actor, (can't remember his name) Was ""over acting"" In some parts. The baby, was really good. I thought she had a lot of attitude, which BY THE WAY, She is meant to have! (Heard idiot IMDb'ers say that its not right for a baby to say ""Bite me!"". If you have read the books, then you would know that she is a baby with spunk.) Costumes where amazing. The set were fantastic. I can not describe how happy i was to see the special affects and costumes. But, could not make up for a crappy plot.The plot i found, to put it bluntly, crap. It was confusing, stupid and messy. Some of the bits weren't even meant to be in the film!! (As they only did the first 3 books, they added bits from the 5th and 6th book.) The humor was unnecessary. The director tried (and failed) to add comedy. IS HE AN IDIOT?! The film is meant to be dark and depressing.

I have since read the first two and still like the movie.)The thing I am most grateful for is the movie's producers remembered that Lemony Snicket's books are for children and that they would be attending it. For example, Jim Carrey's portrayal of Count Olaf is terrific - he is a creepy and eerie villain without being terrifying. This film was perfect for my children who enjoyed it immensely without having nightmares.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
601,the_dude8,Truly brilliant,10,18 June 2005,"This is in my top ten list of movies for sure. It satisfies completely me as a fan of the books, and goes beyond that. It has everything; comedy, drama, strong themes, everything. Jim Carrey is the perfect Count Olaf; he captures his essence and brings new things to it, and is hilarious. The kids are very good, especially formost Emily Browning as Violet. She is completely believable, and beautiful as well. It has an edgy, Tim Burton-ish feel to it, which suits the story great, and has a stunning look to it. Brilliant stuff. It does depart from the books in places, such as the placing of the deceiving play The Marvelous Marriage in the story, and an amazing train sequence not far in, but as a book fan, they did not bother me at all. The special features on the DVD are the best I have seen, with tons of improvisation on the part of Jim Carrey, Craig Ferguson and others, including, among others, a bit Olaf likes to call the 'jealous girlfriend.' Some viewers will not understand the depth however, and despise it, but if your personal taste matches it, it's amazing.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
602,sammyboymattox,Best Movie Ever,10,15 August 2005,"From my point of view, this movie is a ten, but not all people enjoyed it as much as i have and do. I know some people who think this movie is the worst movie ever, well, ever since titanic. They say it is no good because it is nothing like the books. Sure the Marvelouse Marriage was supposed to be with the first book. I don't think that at all. I think Brad Silberling is a great director, and his decision to put that at the end of the movie and not near the beginning with the first book was a great idea. And Klaus saving Sunny. I hear people slaying that Violet was supposed to save her, and i always respond to them: "" How could Violet save Sunny if she was acting at the time. If she had left Sunny would ave died.""Or in Count Olafs words, FFFFWWWWWOOOOO CCCLLLLAAANNNGGGG PPPHHHHFFF EEEEEEEEE! I disagree with these people and I just think that nobody else could have done this movie better than Brad Silberling did.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
603,crisgvch90,Ignore all warnings and watch this movie!,9,5 July 2005,"I am a huge fan of Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler). As soon as the new ASOUE book hits the shelves, there I am waiting to get it. Although it was a disappointment that three books were condensed into 1 movie, I admit that the books are somewhat repetitive and 13 consecutive movies are not possible. The best parts: The costume and scenery are great, they mix things from Gothic to modern, the car used by Count Olaf is something worth looking at. Jim Carrey's acting is wonderful, even if it conflicts a bit with the eviler Olaf in the books, he plays a great villain. Liam Aiken and Emily Browning greatly surpassed my expectations, after Liam Aiken's movie with the talking dog, I had low hopes for him. Bad Parts: Some of the lines are a bit corny, the letter from Europe at the end was over the top as well as Uncle Monty's singing (terrible) and reminiscing about his children and wife (which, by the way, in the book he never had because it always slipped his mind). Also the movie seemed a bit short for 3 books, but all in all, it was great, definitely worth watching again. By the way, the credits are very worth staying to see! The music is also very original and fun!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
604,Velocistar237,An Excellent Film!,10,15 October 2005,"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It is suitable for all ages and great family fun. Although the movie is not as good as the books(The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room and the Wide Window which make up the film), it is still very, very good. With a superb cast and crew, what can get any better? At one point this was my favorite movie, but now it is one of my favorites. The DVD also has superb features and were rated 10/10. Lemony Snicket also great graphics and effects by Industrial Lights and Magic. I know I enjoyed it and witnessed the whole time A Series of Very, Very, Very Fortunate Events!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
605,davidbrinton,Bad casting and weak acting,1,6 August 2015,"A total waste of time spent hoping that at some point the movie might get better. It never did. Carey, who has the potential to play Count Olaf, instead played The Mask in a Count Olaf costume. The children were horribly miscast and neither of them could act, but the girl was especially dismal having only one facial expression (half open mouth, face shifting from side to side). To guarantee a bad experience, they altered the story line in such a way that it was of no benefit to the story whatsoever. A key element of the book series was an organization that never even gets mentioned in the movie. Of the entire book series, the book about their time with Aunt Josephine was one of the weakest, yet they chose that story to include in the movie. There simply wasn't a single aspect of this movie that was executed well.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
606,Moon_Sparkle,Great Movie!!!!,9,9 July 2005,"This movie is excellent!!! I loved it... I have read 6 of the books and found them extraordinary. The only bad thing about this movie is that it crams 3 books into an hour long movie. The movie left out a lot of details from the book. But of course, they could not put in every little detail, BUT there were a lot of details they could of put in. This is a movie with *unfortunate events* and people who do not like these kind of movies... there is a chance that you would not enjoy this movie. But for people who are up for any type of movie... this could be the movie for you. Jim Carrey is especially funny in his role of Count Olaf.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
607,rincewind90,A good evening wasted,2,5 October 2005,"My brother and I wanted to make a nice movie-evening and started with ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"".-I must say that I watched a lot of movies-, but this one was really boring and in the end I realized that 2 hours of my life were wasted...Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events was very bad, because it repeated itself endless and I nearly slept in the middle of it. It is clear that this movie shouldn't be that realistic, but I think it should be recommended to school classes,which discuss the subject: ""Children and the way they are treated by adults""!I did not read the Lemony Snicket books, but I address this comment to those, who want to have a nice evening and I tell you do NOT watch this movie, if you want to watch another one or do anything at all.M.H.",A Series of Unfortunate Events

The movie left out some key event with happened, and didn't have the events in correct order! The books are definitely better than the movie is, and i a sure you to read the books, but don't watch the movie! So i give you a choice, watch the movie and be disappointed, or do something else and less boring! Thank you P.S. this movie was very dull.

610,cast_blank,A good movie!,8,23 August 2005,"It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative! I recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art, if you like Jim Carrey, if you like unique plots.I never read any of the books, so perhaps I have an advantage here. First of all, the children are gorgeous and wonderful actors, which is something I marveled at and was drawn into from the very beginning. The baby (or I should say babies? I have just found out it was a set of twins) who played the role of Sunny, was so darling and such a unique sort of jester (I need to be cautious to not belittle the significance of her character, however).In my opinion, it was one of Jim's finest roles. I say that because this allowed him so much freedom to really be wild without being too outrageously goofy. The opportunity he took in playing this character is an fantastic and effective display of his talent. And we must not ignore the brilliance of Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine and Timothy Spall as ""the clueless banker (in his wonderful little idiosyncratic contributions I take great delight). However, I could praise each and every one of the actors/actresses because they were all flawless in their roles. And I can't forget to mention that the art and music involved with this film inspire me.I laughed, and I laughed, and I laughed. And yet, it was all while feeling pain, pity, compassion, frustration, despair (though Jude's voice did bring me a great deal of comfort). I'm in love with this movie. Well done!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
611,elijahgross,An unfortunate movie,3,26 March 2018,"This movie is terrible. It is like someone took the first 3 books and took random chapters out of them and turned it into a movie. The books are way better. And the show is way better. If you have never read the books, you will probably like it. But if you have read the books, stay away!!!!!!",A Series of Unfortunate Events
612,laurrifying,Ten million times better than the show,10,13 January 2017,"I feel like this perfectly captures the ambiance of the books. The characters, the feeling, the overall haunting fog makes it magical. Jim Carrey gives one of the best performances in his career-in fact it is a marvelously star-studded cast - and the children were perfect. This has held up incredibly well and I watch it still. Even more to its credit, the show is unbearably bad and so the movie brings round the good feels again. I really feel like it's time to stop tying to re-make everything (and thus ruining it) and maybe just do a wicked sequel. I would be more comfortable watching Carrey reprise this amazing role than having it shattered and stomped on.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
613,jmanp50,A story better than the books themselves,8,19 October 2005,"For the past few years, I have been reading the Lemony Snicket books. I was immensely excited when the film was announced and anxiously waited the 2 years or so for the film's release, and I must say it was worth waiting for.Most people, you will find, do not like to admit, or don't really realize, that the books themselves are so horribly written that it's a wonder they even sold. Don't get me wrong. I am very much one of those people who's at the book store the day that the next one comes out. I'm even currently reading book 12 at this moment. So don't say I'm not a big fan of the series. I am. But anyway, I had great expectations for this film, all of which were met and surpassed. I had hoped that they might take a cue from Tim Burton and make the film in stop-motion, to give the film an overly stylized look to fit the tone of the books. They accomplished that expertly with live action though.The film is beautiful in every way. Every last detail was taken into consideration to create a flowing piece of art. Costumes, sets, music, etc. It all fits into the puzzle.The cast was very well assembled, and those who complain about the kids not fitting the part simply because of glasses, age, character traits, or what-have-you are just nit picking. A main focus of comments is on Jim Carrey as Count Olaf and whether he fit the character or stole the show. Put simply, yes Jim Carrey did do a bit of scene stealing, which shouldn't be a surprise because...well, he's Jim Carrey. Going over the top is his specialty (the Olaf dinosaur). We can't deny that. But he really did fit the part, right down to the mannerisms and nit pickers should be happy with how they made him look exactly like Helquist's drawings.The combining of the first three books in the series was a great idea. After all, to be perfectly honest, the books just drag out the stories (sometimes painfully) unnecessarily. I have no problem admitting that the books could easily take up no more than a hundred pages each. Yes, I enjoy them, but I won't deny their flaws. The movie throws all of that out. The story is perfectly streamlined and covers everything in the books and then some. In the books, you'll read about 4 or 5 before you get anything on V.F.D. and even then it's only mentioned in passing. The film covers that right from the start, with small hints here and there before leaving us with some foreshadowing. Here's something else you won't find in the books- closure. Fortunately for us, there's that little bit at the end that's wonderfully satisfying.All together this was a great film. Sure it has its flaws, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. Fans of the book should be very pleased with this translation and those who haven't picked up the books yet are getting a wonderful introduction to this world, but they could end up a little disappointed if they try to read the books. I definitely recommend seeing this movie.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
614,moofis,I agree,7,8 March 2006,"this movie was very very good, but i think it needs a sequel. how on earth did aunt Josephine get to the curdled cave if she was scared of boats? did she fly over the water? but anyway, it was really really good and i agree that the credits were awesome. after we watched the movie we sat there and watched all of the credits, which we never have done before. i think it was worth watching it just for the credits.also, i think that Jim Carey was perfect, and that Violet and Klaus were just the way I pictured them in the books. It was clever to have subtitles for Sunny. This was all in all a wonderful movie, although it still bugs me that aunt Josephine magically appeared in the cave. And I thought it was kind of dumb that they said Count Olaf had to go through every trial he put the Baudelaire children through. But I think that Lemony Snicket was pretty much done justice.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
615,Jellybeaniesoo7,such a good movie,10,2 January 2006,"excellent, excellent film! Jim Carrey is so funny and plays the part of Count Olaf so well! I recommend it very highly. The kids acting skills is excellent! The actor who plays Klaus is well hot!!!! hehehehe Sunny is such a brilliant character with the subtitles of what she may be thinking! If you are going to watch it then i definitely recommend reading the books as Lemony Snickett is an excellent author and keeps the reader thoroughly entertained!!!! The way that the producers have included the character of lemoney Snickett to comment on the Children and there mis-fourtunes was a really good move, which was improved by the fact that they have kept his identity secret, which he tries to do in the book! Overall, an excellent movie! Highly recommended for families",A Series of Unfortunate Events

Liam Aiken and Emily Browning were very good actors and portrayed their characters well. Kara and Shelby Hoffman, who were the twins that played Sunny, were hilarious with their subtitles. Jim Carrey made me laugh my head off with all of his Count Olaf impressions. Stephano was my favorite. I think my all time favorite character was Aunt Josephine, who was played by Meryl Streep. She did fantastic and made the movie stand out. All of Count Olaf's theater troupe were very funny, especially the bald headed man. I loved this movie and recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it, go see it.",A Series of Unfortunate Events
