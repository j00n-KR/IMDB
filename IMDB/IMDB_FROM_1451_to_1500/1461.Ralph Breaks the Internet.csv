0,SnoopyStyle,BFF,8,2 March 2019,"Ralph (John C. Reilly) finds happiness with best friend Vanellope (Sarah Silverman). They spend all their spare time together whenever the Arcade closes for the night. Ralph accidentally breaks Sugar Rush and the duo sets off into the internet to fix the game through a newly connected Wi-Fi. Vanellope befriends Shank (Gal Gadot) from a different driving game. With fears of losing his best friend, Ralph cluelessly unleashes a virus which could literally break the internet.I love the friendship. I like the two characters. There are a few minor fun bits with the internet. I like KnowsMore and I like the Princesses. Those are the funniest parts. I'm less impressed with the more prominent BuzzzTube or Ebay. This is by no means perfect but I do like the more mature look at friendship. It maintains its visual appeal despite expanding into the internet. There is a logo overload aspect to the internet that cannot be helped. The surprise of discovery is no longer within the franchise but it is trying to take it to an interesting place. I appreciated this sequel as much as enjoyed it.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
1,boblipton,A Fine Sequel With Something New To Say,7,15 July 2020,"When the steering wheel on the Candy Crush machine gets broken, it turns out that the only replacement available in on the Internet, and too expensive for the owner of the Arcade. With the machine about to be shut down, all the characters will be left home, so Ralph and Vanellope go onto the Internet to get the spare.At first this animated cartoon appears to be more interested in Product Placement than in story or jokes, as the Internet is portrayed as a modern city with many real corporate logos revealed. As matters progress, however, story, character and jokes grow more important, as Ralph becomes a trending Internet star and Vanellope finds happiness in a rough, urban racing game. There's also a very nice section where Vanellope winds up on a Disney site, making friends with the Disney princesses, who are thrilled to spend their down time in tank tops and cut-offs.I'm not happy with this current era in Disney, when all the movies are either sequels or live-action remakes of classic animation. However, this turns out to be an amusing movie with some good life lessons.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
2,Prismark10,Ralph cannot handle cyberspace,5,13 February 2019,"Taking place six years after the events of the first film. Ralph and Vanellope are best friends. Vanellope though is getting bored of her Sugar Rush racing game. When Ralph makes a new track for her, the steering wheel of the arcade game breaks. The film never ponders why Vanellope managed to override the game player's actions.As a steering wheel for Sugar Rush costs too much money on ebay, the arcade owner is going to dismantle Sugar Rush.Ralph and Vanellope go into the wifi installed into the arcade and decide to get the steering wheel themselves from ebay. However they have no concept of money in this world. Even though in the virtual world, Ralph told the bartender all drinks were going to be paid by Fix It Felix.Faced with raising thousands of dollars for their ebay transaction in a short space o time. Ralph and Vanellope need to monetize their talents.Ralph Breaks the Internet starts off well in a world we are familiar with in the first Wreck it Ralph. It then becomes irrelevant and erratic with references to Disney properties that now incorporates Star Wars and Marvel characters. So Vanellope who is a princess spends time with other Disney Princesses. The film takes a sharp turn which is exacerbated with Vanellope wanting to stay and race in another more violent racing game modelled on Grand Theft Auto.It begins to feel a lot like Ready Player One, before the movie goes for a frenzied tribute to King Kong for its finale.At times this sequel lacked imagination. If Ralph really did go to the internet, he would had found various enhanced incarnations of Sugar Rush with more tracks and souped up cars. Vanellope would had no need to return to her arcade game.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
3,nogodnomasters,Friend,9,7 January 2019,"Ralph and Vanellope enter the Internet to buy a steering wheel for her broken game. While there, things get out of control.I love the voices of John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman in the main roles. Gal Gadot as Shank was a nice touch. Admittedly my favorite part was Disney poking fun at itself with the Princesses.While I loved this film, I liked the first one better.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
4,lee_eisenberg,Disney reminds us what it is,5,10 June 2019,"In the antihero's second adventure, he and his friend have a series of online adventures. Probably the most important scene is when Vanellope visits Disney's website (because apparently the Mouse House is a shameless self-promoter). The whole sequence is basically Disney's reminder to us that it's on a mission to swallow all popular culture.Basically, I got what I expected with ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"". Just watch it anticipating a bunch of corny stuff that the tykes will find entertaining and you won't be disappointed.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
5,jboothmillard,Ralph Breaks the Internet,6,9 December 2018,"The first Oscar nominated Wreck-It-Ralph movie from Disney was really good fun, I was looking forward to another dose of video game themed fun, which had received quite a bit of hype, and it was interested to see the popular characters entering the internet. Basically it has been six years since Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade was saved, video games characters Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) are still best friends and hang out every night after work. Ralph is content with his current life, but Vanellope admits that she is bored of her games, Sugar Rush, being predictable and wishes for something more. Ralph tries to cheer her up by creating a secret bonus track during a race, Vanellope overrides player control to test it out, the resulting conflict between her and the player results in the steering wheel controller breaking. The company that made Sugar Rush is now defunct, the only replacement wheel available is on eBay, but it is too expensive for Mr. Litwak (Ed O'Neill), and he may have no choice but to unplug the game, which would leave the game's citizens homeless. After Ralph converses with his friend Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) in Tapper's, he and all the other citizens are intrigued by the installation of a WiFi router, this allows access to the internet. Ralph decides to enter the internet to obtain the wheel from eBay, he brings Vanellope with him. They find eBay, and bid for the wheel available, but they get excited by the concept of bidding, and cannot afford to pay the amount they bid, they must complete the purchase within 24 hours or they will lose it. The two turn to a pop-up advertiser named J.P. Spamley (Bill Hader) to make money quick and are given the job to steal a valuable car belonging to Shank (Gal Gadot) from the popular online game Slaughter Race. Ralph and Vanellope manage to steal the car, and Shank and others chase them to get it back, but they are forced to return it. Shank admires Vanellope's driving skills and points her and Ralph to BuzzzTube, algorithm Yesss (Taraji P. Henson) knows all about what types of videos are trending, so Ralph decides to make a series of viral videos ripping off the popular trends to make money. Ralph's videos become a viral sensation, while an excited Vanellope joins Yesss's staff in spamming users with pop-up ads. Ralph is concerned about Vanellope and convinces Yesss to send her to a Disney fansite, she escapes from a group of First Order Stormtroopers, and meets all the Disney Princesses. Vanellope befriends the princesses and they encourage her to sing about her sense of unfulfillment, she does eventually reach a musical epiphany when Ralph calls her to confirm they have earned enough money to purchase the wheel. Vanellope does not meet him at eBay, Ralph calls her again, and he overhears her confessing to Shank she wants to stay in Slaughter Race because its unpredictability, challenges and sense of danger make her feel alive. Ralph is horrified about the thought of losing Vanellope, he turns to Spamley to find a way to make Slaughter Race boring for Vanellope by slowing things down. Ralph visits Double Dan (Alfred Molina), who creates an Insecurity Virus which will replicate any flaws it finds, this virus is unleashed on Slaughter Race, but it unexpectedly replicates Vanellope's glitch across the game, but Ralph is forced to rescue her before a reboot deletes her. Vanellope assumes the crash was her fault, but a guilty Ralph explains what he had done, she feels betrayed and throws away the hero medal she made him six years ago. While Ralph rushes to get back the medal, which has broken is half, the Insecurity Virus scans him and duplicates his personality flaws. This results in a legion of Ralph clones that destroy the Internet trying to find Vanellope. The real Ralph finds her, and they work with Yesss to lead the clones into an anti-virus software. But the Ralph clones combine into one giant automaton, Vanellope surrenders herself after seeing her friend in a losing battle, but Ralph confronts his clones, admitting to his insecurities, and saying that friendship between him and Vanellope will not end. With his insecurities resolved, the clones disintegrate, and the Internet is restored, and Ralph is saved from falling to his death by the Disney Princesses. Later, Shank arranges for Vanellope to stay in Slaughter Race, Ralph accepts this and returns to the arcade. Sugar Rush is plugged back in, and Ralph comes to terms with Vanellope's absence and socilaises with other game characters while staying in touch with Vanellope through video chats. Ralph and Velellope are also seen crashing and playing the game Pancake Milkshake along with a toddler player, and a supposed sneak preview of Frozen 2 is interrupted by Ralph rickrolling, imitating the video for ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" by Rick Astley. Also starring Jane Lynch as Calhoun, Alan Tudyk as KnowsMore, Sean Giambrone as The Eboy, Maurice LaMarche as Tapper, Alex Moffat as Jimmy, Futurama's John DiMaggio as Arthur, Rich Moore as Sour Bill / Zangief / Stormtrooper, Roger Craig Smith as Sonic the Hedgehog, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Brad Garrett as Eeyore, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Corey Burton as Grumpy, Vin Diesel as Baby Groot, Jason Hightower as Auctioneer, Nicole Scherzinger as Mo's Mom, Irene Bedard as Pocahontas, Kristen Bell as Anna, Jodi Benson as Ariel, Auli'i Cravalho as Moana, Jennifer Hale as Cinderella, Kate Higgins as Aurora, Linda Larkin as Jasmine, Kelly Macdonald as Merida, Idina Menzel as Elsa, Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, Paige O'Hara as Belle, Pamela Ribon as Snow White, Anika Noni Rose as Tiana and Ming-Na Wen as Mulan. Reilly remains suited to the cuddly voice of the big bodied and big-hearted character, Silverman is still funny as the slightly annoying young girl enthusiastic for new thrills, the special effects have been broadened, the familiar and new characters are fantastic, and the world of the internet is so cool, with clever jokes and satirising of the well-known companies featured and nods to how we lives our lives online, something for both adults and children to enjoy, a fun animated adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Good!",Ralph Breaks the Internet
6,Tweekums,A solid Disney sequel,8,31 March 2020,"Set six year after the events shown in 'Wreck-it Ralph' this film provides another adventure for Ralph and Venellope. Their arcade has been connected to the internet but the characters are warned to stay away; however when Venellope's game breaks the two friends must brave the internet to acquire the necessary part. They find it on eBay but after some reckless bidding they need to earn the money fast. This leads to many adventures, including taking part in a dangerous racing game, Ralph creating a series of viral memes and Venellope encountering the Disney Princesses while fleeing from Stormtroopers! As Venellope contemplates staying there, their friendship is strained and Ralph takes action that could damage the entire internet.I really enjoyed this film although it must be said that many of the gags are aimed firmly at older viewers and some moments might be a little scary for younger fans. These moments include times of physical danger as well as emotional worries as Ralph and Venellope's friendship is tested. The numerous references to various internet sites are likely to go over the heads of younger viewers and the way it is hammered home that Disney now owns Star Wars and Marvel franchises isn't too subtle... even though I confess to rather enjoying the former. The gags, including many visual gags, come think and fast... I'm sure one would have to watch the film a few times to spot them all. As one would expect the animation looks great; the depiction of the internet is impressively immersive; I particularly liked the scenes that took place in the 'Slaughter Race' game. The characters are solid, Venellope is the more fun of the returning characters, Ralph is a bit too clingy at times... although the plot demands that to create the interesting situations. There are several good new characters; personal favourites being Shank, a race driver; and J.P. Spamley a 'pop-up pusher'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to animation fans.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
7,paul_haakonsen,Better than part one...,7,19 January 2019,"I must admit that I did enjoy the first ""Wreck-It Ralph"" animated movie, but somehow this sequel had eluded me. But I got the chance to sit down and watch it, so of course I did. How could or would I not?The first thing that comes to mind is that the storyline in the 2018 ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" was somewhat better than the 2012 animated movie, so they definitely upped their game here. I think the fact that they were putting in so much pop culture and modern references was the selling point for me. This is also why it scores a 7 out of 10 rating from me, whereas the first animated movie scored 6 out of 10.Like in the 2012 animated movie, the animation and art style here was just wonderful. I loved the characters and all the detail they had put into almost every single scene. There were so many wonderful things to behold in the background of many of the scenes, which actually makes it worth watching the movie a second time just to pick up on the minute details.It was really nice that they got together the crew for the voice acting from the first movie, and they also expanded with a very interesting and good selection of voice talents for the new characters.""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is definitely an animated movie that is well worth watching for the entire family. I was genuinely entertained with this sequel, and I can warmly recommend that you watch it.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
8,tavm,Ralph Breas the Internet was quite an enjoyable sequel,8,2 December 2018,"I remember watching the original Wreck-It Ralph and enjoying it but I don't feel like looking back at my IMDb review of it right now. Maybe after I'm done with this one. Anyway, I watched it with my sister and her pre-teen daughter and we all enjoyed the further adventures of Ralph and his best friend Vanellope. Perhaps the funniest scenes involves Vanellope and the Disney princesses of which the original voices of many of them reprise them here. There's more but I'll just say that we all really enjoyed Ralph Breaks the Internet!",Ralph Breaks the Internet
9,studioAT,Sub-par sequel,2,24 August 2019,"While not being a classic the first 'Ralph' film was decent enough, and had a plot.This second instalment (was one even needed?) doesn't seem to be anything more than Disney showing off all the properties that they own (Marvel,Pixar etc) and having cameo's from those pop up.It has its moments (the Disney princess scene for example) but this is nowhere near as good as the original.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
10,Calicodreamin,Fun sequel,7,19 June 2020,"A fun sequel to wreck it Ralph that introduces the vast world of the internet. It was cool to see a ""behind the scenes"" look at popular apps like YouTube and eBay and even pop ups. The storyline was fresh and different from the first, though the ending with the glitch monster Ralph was a bit odd. Liked the new character additions.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
11,view_and_review,I Have Animation Fatigue,6,23 November 2018,"I do believe I'm suffering from Animation Fatigue. This is a syndrome that is brought on by too many animated movies and their sequels. The only known cure is abstinence. That is staying away from all forms of animations for good or until one's system has recovered which can take months if not years.Ralph Breaks the Internet is probably a good movie for a normal and healthy immune system. But for a weak one such as mine, I just couldn't find the joy and entertainment in the big dumb lovable Ralph as he gullibly ruins things just to have to fix them again. Nor was I much able to handle his best friend Venelope as she traipsed around looking for excitement. Perhaps when I make a full recovery I can stomach another cash-grab animation.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
12,AlsExGal,It seems like an opportunity lost,5,8 December 2018,"As a standalone film this was funny and nice to look at, but as a sequel it was terrible. Thus overall it was average. Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite animated films - it managed to be an homage to retro gaming whilst telling a story about a misguided but loveable 'bad guy' finding out what really matters in life.Ralph Breaks The Internet undoes all the good the first one did - Ralph is now an abusive (or should I say 'insecure') friend who has not one, but TWO cliche 'We were best friends and everything was perfect but now you did something that's upset me so I'm going to walk away and DON'T FOLLOW ME moments'. The film lacks any subtletly in dealing with its themes of toxic relationships (both personal and over the internet), and is far more comfortable in its amusing Internet references than it is in trying to make a statement.There were so many missed opportunities to link it with the first film. For example, it is made clear that the allure of modern games is that they're constantly being updated and feel new. This was the perfect chance for the film to show that retro games, that always stay the same and live in our memory, have merit too. But nope, that didn't happen. To me, it feels like a Disney exec wanted to tell a story of the dangers / joys of the internet, and the dangers / joys of clingy friendships, but forced these messages into Wreck it Ralph where it just doesn't fit. It's used as a vehicle for this message, weaving its way around a bombardment of internet references in trying to do so.I can understand why people enjoyed it - I laughed a lot during the first half, and one or two of the emotional moments were quite powerful. But in lacking any nuance or any reverence to the first film, I cannot recommend it to fans of the first.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
13,Mr-Fusion,The Internet may have broken Ralph on this one,5,20 June 2019,"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" seems like the poster child for ""what could've been"". I like the concept, and there are a couple of good laughs, but the execution is atrocious. I was really into the opening 30 minutes or so (everything inside the arcade is fun) but as soon as they actually make it onto the Internet, it's a downward tumble.Not gonna lie, I'm disappointed on almost every level. What was heartwarming about the original ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is lost here. Yeah, it may be ambitious, but it's a waste of the Ralph/Vanellope relationship, the inherent humor of the arcade culture is gone and Disney hijacked the movie for their own (horrifying) studio marketing. Seriously, the Rodent's footprint is massive in this movie.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
14,cherold,"cute, funny, and touching, consecutively, in that order",8,23 April 2019,"This sequel to Wreck-It Ralph starts as a cute little kids movie about a couple of cartoon characters chilling. Characters and relationships and a way of life are established, and then a crisis, and it's all perfectly pleasant.The movie hits its stride when the main characters leave the world of arcade games for the wild west of the Internet. It's very cleverly done, with pop-ups and eBay auctions and the like. The movie becomes increasingly hilarious as Ralph and Vanellope visit a dangerous GTA clone and Vanellope introduces all the Disney princesses to comfy clothes.While the last part of the movie goes big, it's really mainly about friendship and caring and has an afterschool-special kind of teaching to it. It's very sweet but not especially funny.While the movie seems unable to weave the cute, clever, funny, and heartwarming threads into a single garment, overall the experience is quite enjoyable. I'm inclined to say it's not as good as the first one, but I saw that years ago so can't be sure. Anyway, take a look.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
15,FeastMode,my notes,6,27 July 2019,"Good movie. most of the movie was only moderately funny, but there was a 20 minute-ish portion of the movie in the middle that was hilarious and awesome. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
once they entered the disney area of the internet, i really loved it for 20-30 minutes straight, i wouldn't mind rewatching that portion alone. also, hilarious post-credit scene with ralph performing the ""never gonna give you up"" internet troll video lmao. any die hard frozen fans out there probably got super frustrated",Ralph Breaks the Internet
16,Edvis-1997,9,9,31 December 2018,I don't get it those 1/10 reviews. It's as good as Wreck it Ralph. Really enjoyed watching it. Ending was really emotional and teaching that we can't keep people as things to ourselves but we need to let them go. It wasn't maybe as funny as first part but it was more interesting I believe so basically 9/10. Brilliant work.,Ralph Breaks the Internet
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"I sat down and waited for the adverts to end but, essentially, they never did.",6,3 December 2018,"When I arrived at the cinema, I sat down and waited for the adverts to end but, essentially, they never did, since so much of 'Ralph Breaks The Internet (2018)' feels like one extended piece of product placement, only a couple of steps above last year's 'The Emoji Movie (2017)'. Don't get me wrong, I'm not comparing the quality of the two films, just their concepts and, to an extent, the execution of those concepts. This picture's weak and scattershot story often comes second to a plethora of character and brand cameos that are usually, in themselves, the content, rather than the basis for it. There is some satire, but it's mostly surface stuff and some of it demonstrates a lack of understanding of the culture that it takes aim at, too. What does separate this from 'The Emoji Movie (2017)' is the fact that it doesn't feel like a completely soulless cash-grab, though it may have been made (with all its brand integrations) mainly for monetary purposes, and it does have a narrative with decent underlying messages and relatively well-developed characters, though these elements don't work as well as the more successful set-pieces. What I'm saying is that, to a point, the story of this feature has some merit beyond its function as a literal advertisement, which almost makes its ultimate handling all the more frustrating; if there wasn't the need to show off all of these brands, or even try to cash in on the apparently recent 'internet trend', the story most likely wouldn't have been as haphazard as it is. An imbalanced structure sees most of the juicy stuff rushed in the latter half in order to squeeze in all the 'wonders of the Internet' up front. It means that the picture's proper themes and character arcs don't really pop up until the start of the third act, before they're then swiftly resolved by the plot's end. There is also some occasionally bizarre characterisation (that sometimes backtracks upon work done in the first flick) and most of the musings about Disney princesses and their progressiveness (or, thus far, lack thereof) are kind of surface level, considering that Vanellope is always being saved by Ralph despite being a fairly strong and well-rounded character in her own right. Its central relationship comes across as a little creepy (not in an unseemly way, necessarily) and grating given how (somewhat uncharacteristically) 'clingy' our hero has now become. It would have been like this even if his 'best friend' wasn't a little girl, by the way. So many of pretty much every characters' actions are, well, out of character, even if you disregard the first film, and you have to suspend your disbelief quite heavily, even if you accept the established diegesis. It's not like there's no merit here, but everything feels very rushed and half-baked, almost like a couple of different screenplays were shoved together (or otherwise modified) once Disney had decided to make the movie into an internet advert. 6/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet
18,ThomasDrufke,Emotionally Resonating,8,8 December 2018,"What I love about this movie is it made a choice to focus more on character than it did spectacle. The relationship between Ralph and Vanellope is at the forefront of the movie and the story only progresses as their friendship develops. Whether its good or bad, the plot doesn't drive characters, the characters drive the plot. Disney/Pixar have always been great at that, but it felt particularly earned with these two video game characters. It's not a completely polished film with an ending that does feel out of place (in terms of spectacle) and a lack of a real villainous presence. But it's emotional heart and core is more than worth the price of admission. I'm down for another one of these. Oh and those Disney Princess sequences, flipping brilliant.8.2/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet
19,cricketbat,Wreck-It Vanellope,5,8 January 2019,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is a series of amusing references and cameos held together by a half-baked story. This movie is almost likeable, but it plays fast & loose with the rules it has established and undercuts the message of the first film. It also runs a little too long. I think the franchise has run out of continues.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
20,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,6,27 February 2019,"Ralph Breaks the InternetOne surefire way of crippling the web is to give your parents your WiFi password.Instead, the brute in this animated movie decides to immobilize it himself.When the steering wheel on his friend Vanellope's (Sarah Silverman) arcade game breaks, rehabilitated rogue Ralph (John C. Reilly) travels to the Internet to find a replacement. Out of their element at first, both soon learn how to navigate the net with Ralph memeing himself to make money for the part and Vanellope engaging in online gaming. But when it comes time to leave, one of them wants to remain online.While this obligatory sequel to the nostalgic original confronts concepts of change through pointed Internet humour and strong vocal performances, the non-stop website ads feel less about funny and more about subliminal marketing to kids.Furthermore, someone should tell Ralph that hanging out with underage Vanellope online isn't a smart move.

21,westsideschl,How the Net Works,7,28 February 2019,This was a rather fun introduction for all ages on how the internet works from computer to modem to web to sites and of course problems along the way. A bit of cameo spots for all the main players in the net. Humorous princesses-in-movies gathering. Good voicing; good character animations. Story had the usual morality tale although some may cringe at all the car crashes.,Ralph Breaks the Internet
22,ironhorse_iv,This sequel to 2012's 'Wreck it Ralph' broke my heart. It was not good.,7,27 January 2019,"While this 57th animation motion picture from Walt Disney Animation Studios was not as socially annoying like Sony Picture Animation's 2017's similar premise flick, 'the Emoji Movie' was. There was still many flaws. Let's start with the poorly written story. From all the three different scripts, the filmmakers, Rich Moore, Phil Johnston & their crew can pick from. They chose the wrong one. Much of this movie's plot is very similar to the first flick, in which, a main character is sick of their game, only to leave, cause chaotic damage to their surroundings, find themselves, & then step up to undo their mistakes. The only different is that, instead of going into other video game realms; it's now, on the over commercialism & toxic internet. It sucks. Don't get me wrong, if the whole focus of the film was about Wreck it Ralph (Voiced by John C. Reilly) & Vanellope von Schweetz (Voiced by Sarah Silverman) having to leave the nostalgia of arcade games to the current landscape of online gaming, in order to make enough money to buy parts for Sugar Rush. Maybe, I wouldn't be so hard on the film, but however, the movie doesn't do that. It abandoned the video game aspect that made the first movie, so endearing & instead, focus on stupid viral video meme culture & the blatant and shameless filler product placement of the Disney brand. All the inclusion of Star Wars, Disney Princesses and Marvel Characters don't really add much to the main plot. Nor does all these connections really related to the gaming world. It's no 'Kingdom Hearts', that's for sure. To add on that, I found the parts of the film involves Ralph making viral internet videos, highly annoying and not that accurate. Getting likes & views on any video sharing platform is not as profitable as it once was. There was reasons for that, such as copyright laws & companies not wanting to put their ads on anything that can hurt their image. Even if Ralph get enough hearts, most likely, the profit for those videos would go to the developer of the game rather than the titular character, himself. Also, if it did happen, how does that even work; is it a ""paper man in a paper house"" situation? To us, both the video game characters and people are CGI; however, in universe, are people seeing Ralph's viral videos as a computer character or a person dressed as Ralph? It's really jarring & confusing. Continuing on that, the money made from ad revenue is not easy to access within a common days. Normally, it goes to your direct deposit or written in check within a few weeks. It's never made out to anybody who doesn't have a bank account at all. However, the shameless prostituting to leech off of dumb internet meme culture is far from the worst thing, Ralph does in this film. Toward the end, he does something really awful, that seems out of character that is not redeemable at all. His endangerment with Vanellope really took me, out of the movie. I wouldn't root for this guy, anymore! Not only that, but in-story, Ralph probably doom himself, as well; now since, his image is known as a very dangerous computer virus. I doubt anybody will play his game, any longer. Despite that, even if, he didn't do anything cringe-worthy. I found his final decision, to allow Vanellope to continue on with her dangerous and destructive path. Not a great message at all. Look, I get that we should allow love ones, room for themselves; but honestly, would you allow them to join a dangerous gang, because that is what they wants!? I doubt that. Nevertheless, that's not the only problem, I have with this subplot. It's the fact that Vanellope abandoned the quest to save her game, midway through the film. This action from her, is very disturbing. I get that, she doesn't really like, anybody from Sugar Rush, as they were former tormentors, but she has to take responsibility for her actions. After all, she was the one that overrides the player control, resulting in her cabinet's steering wheel being broken. Not only that, but she is the ruler of that place. She can't abandoned her kingdom on the doorstep of staying unplug. Having her quit and go hang out at another game, because it's new & fun, is just not a good message for a children. Even if Ralph get enough money for the part. Her absent might still doom the game. Unlike her lame excuse, I believe the gamers would probably notice her missing. After all, she's the one with the really cool super teleportation move. Not only that, her face is all over the game's cabinet. Nevertheless, I also hate seeing that none of the characters care to abide to any of the in-universal rules. Everybody seem cool about anybody going 'Turbo', nowadays, even if it could end, with all their games being shut down. It kinda contradict the moral message of the first movie. I wish the sequel would focus more, on something else. A better message. Nevertheless, the movie does have redeeming qualities. The animation is nice to look at. It has decent voice acting; including the returning cast & the new inductees. Even the cameos were well done. However, I hate that some supporting cast were demoted to extra. As for the humor. The Meta Disney Jokes were funny. The expense on the internet not as much. Look, I know that this PG movie can't go to the crazy and insane jokes that the internet has, but many of film's meme jokes will lose their relevance & will feel dated in the next couple of years. Despite that, overall: While, this flick is not a total wreck. This sequel just did not live up to the expectation that I felt a good movie like this, deserved. It kinda bytes. It could had been better.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
23,Platypuschow,Ralph Breaks the Internet: Underwhelming sequel,6,20 January 2019,"I liked Wreck-It Ralph (2012), I found it charming and original with lashings of vocal talent to assist it but a sequel? Had big shoes to fill, and it didn't manage it.It tells the story of our heroes venturing from the arcade to the internet to save one of their games and *Sigh* does a plot really matter here? Ultimately that's not what its about.Full of goofy humor, the occasional adult-ish joke to keep the parents happy and lots and lots of product placement. A lot of people looking at the reviews clearly have issue with this but truth be told it would have been very difficult to show the internet in that fashion without showing off the big names. I'm sure a lot of money passed hands because of this, but I don't see why it's such an issue.The voice cast once again are fantastic including newcomers such as Gal Gadot. The trailers ""Princesses"" weren't as obnoxious as I expected and quite frankly the whole thing is passable enough stuff but nothing more than that. Somehow a lot of the original charm seems to be missing, the novelty value has diminished and the whole thing felt more like a cashgrab than a loyal sequel.That being said Ralph Breaks the Internet isn't bad, it's just not living up to expectations.The Good:Excellent voice talentA couple of nice ideasThe Bad:Pales in comparison to the firstLacks charmThe satire really spotlights how pathetic much of the internet community are with ""Trends"" and viewing habits.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
24,nairtejas,One-Line Review: Ralph Breaks the Internet (4 Stars),4,9 January 2019,"Ralph Breaks the Internet starts off really, really well with some very good animation about how the Internet looks as well as picking up from where the outstanding prequel ended in a decent way but it soon becomes a snoozefest consisting mainly of a Disney-themed musical montage involving one of the lead characters as well as a cliched (melodramatic) turn midway in the story that makes it look like an animated film of the early 2000s. TN.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
25,The-Sarkologist,From the Arcade to the World Wide Web,5,8 February 2019,"Well, now that I have watched the first movie I feel that maybe I can be a little bit more objective with this film. The problem was that since I went and saw this one (namely because my brother wanted to see it) without seeing the first one there were a number of rather confusing aspects, such as why this guy that sort of reminds me of super Mario, who goes by the name of Fix-it Felix is married to some woman that looks like she came straight out of Halo. Well, it now sort of makes a little more sense, even though it really doesn't have a huge impact in the movie.The thing is that Venelope is board, and Ralph tries to fix things by creating a secret level, however when Venelope takes over from the player, the steering wheel for the game is busted, and because they can't get a new one cheaply the owner decides to toss out the machine. That means that Venelope and all the other characters in Sugar Rush are basically homeless.However, something new has been plugged into the socket - Wifi - which basically gives the characters access to the wonderful world of the internet. They also not only discover the steering wheel, but also the Ebay action site and decide to place a bid without realising how it works. Well, it works by forcing them to pay something like $23000.00. So, now they have to raise that money, however another problem arises and that is that Venelope discovers another game - Death Race (or something like that) and decides that she actually wants to stay.Look, there wasn't all that much about this film that actually made it better than the original. In fact in many cases it felt as if it was simply a rehash of the original. Well, not quite because they don't have a hidden antagonist in the film. Well, they do, but it takes a rather different form that the actual bad guy in the first film. The other thing is that half of the film has websites made up specifically for the film, and they seem to sit alongside the real life sites. Then again, the real life sites generally don't play an important role and are only there for decoration.There is also this interesting thing where Disney actually seems to be laughing at itself, except that sometimes making fun on ones flaws does have a habit of trivialising these flaws, especially when it comes to workers rights and intellectual property. Look, I won't go into too much depth here, but in one sense they do seem to be making fun of themselves, but in another sense it is what they are making fun of.Still, the movie was enjoyable, though it really isn't one that really works all that well as a stand alone movie. It was okay, but really only if you have seen the original so that you sort of have an idea with what is going on.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

28,tomgillespie2002,"Fun and creative, but struggles to find its heart amidst the chaos",6,24 February 2019,"While 2012's Wreck-It Ralph is far from Pixar's most accomplished achievement, it was a fun tale of friendship and nostalgia as our two lovable heroes romped their way through a variety of games, both modern and retro. Despite the appeal of its characters, the ending hardly cried out for a sequel, but the world created by Rich Moore and his team of animators offered endless possibilities with which the story could be taken. With demand for 80's and 90's nostalgia at an all-time high, you have to wonder why a sequel took a whole six years to arrive. While one of the main appeals of Wreck-It Ralph was seeing a bunch of familiar characters from your childhood weaved into the story and placed into everyday situations, this follow-up takes Ralph and best pal Vanellope out of their pixelated comfort-zone and into a brave new world of pop-up ads and nightmarish comment sections.Six years have also passed for arcade-game villain Ralph (John C. Reilly) and glitchy Sugar Rush racer Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), who both enjoy a routine-based life of doing their video game duty by day and knocking back root beers together at night. But while Ralph finds comfort in familiarity, Vanellope longs for something different. In an attempt to cheer up his best friend, Ralph creates a special new track in Sugar Rush, but the stunt backfires when the steering-wheel breaks in the real world and Vanellope is left without a game. However, the shiny new arrival at Litwak's Family Fun Centre and Arcade - the internet - may offer a glimmer of hope in the form of eBay, where one user has a replacement steering-wheel up for auction. So, the two friends venture into this digital metropolis of corporate logos and dead-eyed avatars to buy the part, only they don't have any money to back up their winning bid.Of course, there's always money to be made on the internet if you know how, and with the help of Yesss (Taraji P. Henson), the algorithm at video site BuzzzTube, Ralph racks up the likes and hearts by becoming a viral sensation. Vanellope's friendship with Ralph is tested when she discovers dangerous open-world racing game Slaughter Race and finds a like-minded friend in bad-ass racer Shank (Gal Gadot). There's a message about the dangers of toxic friendships in there somewhere, but the sweet relationship developed more carefully the first time around is often drowned out by the sheer noise of this online world. There are many great ideas here, such as Alan Tudyk's KnowsMore, an search engine who is always over-eager to predict what you're going to say, and Bill Hader's J.P. Spamley, a click-bait pop-up ad who acts like a desperate, down-on-his-luck salesman. A detour into a Disney fan-site initially reeks of self-promotion, but the company sends itself up rather well, conjuring up an inspired moment involving the entire roster of Disney princesses. Ralph Breaks the Internet is fun and packed with creativity, but struggles to find its heart amidst all the eye-catching chaos.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
29,cruise01,A fun and visually exciting sequel that brings back Ralph causing havoc on the internet.,8,25 November 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet (4 out of 5 stars).Ralph Breaks the Internet is a fun family film that brings back fans favorite character Wreck it Ralph. And bringing back many other characters from nostalgia games and other pop cultures. This time Disney is going all out and bringing their characters from every princesses in their animated films, star wars, and bringing a lot of online apps when the characters are traveling through the internet.Ralph and Vanellope are bored doing the same thing in their arcade games. With Vanellope getting tired of the same predictable racing maps in her game. And Ralph enjoying the same daily routines over and over. When Vanellope's arcade game steering wheel breaks. The owner of the arcade only has a week until they junk out the game. Ralph and Vanellope decide to travel through the internet to shop for the steering wheel on ebay. Only they did not know that they bid a lot of money for it and has to earn it by playing an unpredictable racing game and trying to make funny trending videos.The film's plot was fun and great. The previous movie got the characters travelling through arcade games. This sequel puts these characters on the internet. Were they are dealing with many online people which has their avatars running around. From going to online bidding on ebay to walking around the dark web were there are a lot of shady characters that willing to spam you with a virus. And the fun part is were Vanellope travels to Disney. She meets princesses from every animated movie. It is a self discovering movie with Ralph and Vanellope. Ralph is a needy and clingy guy. Vanellope wants to experience something different in life. It is a great plot with a meaningful message.The visual effects and animation are colorful and vivid. And a lot of fun seeing all these online pop icons like google, ebay, Disney, ect. And shady characters that are spammers with cheap deals. New additions like an underground racer character Shank voiced by Gal Gadot was fun. Vanellope idolizes her personality.I feel like this film does lack on showing some fun gaming characters like the previous film did. And that made the movie way more exciting and entertaining for most nostalgia fans. Which the online icons and culture was not as flashy as the first movie. Still fun though.Overall, Ralph Breaks the Internet is a good family film which adults and kids will love. The goofy Ralph is back and Vanellope travel the internet, meeting new fun characters, and going through a new conflict of self discovery. The animation is colorful and cool. Definitely worth checking out if you enjoyed the first movie.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
30,zkonedog,"Perhaps More Entertaining Than The Original, But Not Nearly As Original",7,11 December 2018,"Upon seeing the first ""Wreck It Ralph"" film, I gave it 7/10 stars. It perhaps wasn't the greatest animated effort I had ever seen, but I was really intrigued and impressed by all the classic video game references and originality of the entire premise. After seeing its sequel, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"", I also am giving that one 7/10 stars, albeit for completely different reasons. Whereas this second effort might actually be overall more entertaining than the first go-round, it is severely lacking in the ""originality"" department.For a basic plot summary, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" sees a crisis develop in the arcade when the steering wheel to Vanellope's (Sarah Silverman) game breaks and threatens her existence as a racer. Eager to help out his best friend, Ralph (John C. Reilly) discovers that only one such steering wheel part exists--on Ebay--necessitating the first trip to The Internet. In discovering this vast land of the world wide web, Vanellope finds a new friend in Shank (Gal Gadot), which forces Ralph to confront his own insecurity issues as they try and complete their quest.Easily the hallmark of this film is all the clever Net references that it makes, whether being sight gags or outright jokes. Good-natured fun is poked at social media, massive Internet businesses, and Disney, to name a few sources. All these gags will elicit at least a chuckle from most audiences, and there are enough of them to keep that good-humor mode intact all the way through.The problem here, though, is this: How many times can a single franchise ""go to the well"" of Internet/gaming references in lieu of other more interesting material. I know that Disney/Pixar has set the bar almost impossibly high in terms of making animated movies that both children and adults can adore, but in terms of characters/emotions this ""Ralph"" effort fails to even approach it. They lean into the jokes, great, but seemingly at the expense of crafting really meaningful character scenarios (something I would argue the first ""Ralph"" did a much better job of accomplishing).At the end of the day, though, I'd call ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" and its predecessor about even in terms of overall enjoyment. This one takes more of a sight-gag approach, or going for the ""cheap chuckles"" (though legit chuckles nonetheless, for the most part) approach. If this franchise continues (and presumably concludes) as a trilogy, I would like to see a more even melding of character/humor in the third film, something this franchise hasn't quite accomplished yet.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

32,leonblackwood,"Great animation, and the first half was entertaining!",5,17 April 2019,"Review:
I quite enjoyed this movie, mainly because the animation was spot on, and the number of companies that Disney managed to use throughout the film added to the well-written storyline, but it's not the type of movie that I can watch time and time again. Although I thought that this movie was better than the original, it had that typical Disney feel, which I find quite patronising and totally unbelievable. With that aside, I did appreciate the depth within the storyline, and the relationship between Ralph (John C. Reilly), and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) was quite touching in places but it was Shank (Gal Gadot) that done it for me, even though she wasn't in the movie that much. The film is set 6 years after the first one, was Ralph and Vanellope have been friends, hanging out every night after work in Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade. While Ralph is content with his current life, Vanellope admits to being bored with her game's predictability and wishes for something new. One day, Ralph attempts to fulfill her desires by creating a secret bonus track during a race. Vanellope overrides player control to test it out, but the resulting conflict between her and the player results in the cabinet's steering wheel being broken. Since the company that made Sugar Rush is defunct, one of the kids finds a replacement for Mr. Litwak on eBay. However, Litwak deems it too expensive and has no choice but to unplug Sugar Rush, leaving the game's characters homeless. That night, after talking with Fix-It Felix Jr., Ralph decides to enter the internet via Litwak's recently installed Wi-Fi router to obtain the new wheel on eBay. Ralph brings Vanellope with him, and although they place a winning bid of £27,001 to obtain the wheel, they cannot pay and must make the purchase within 24 hours. The two turn to J.P. Spamley to quickly make money, receiving a lucrative job of stealing a valuable car belonging to Shank from the Slaughter Race. Ralph and Vanellope steal the car but are forced to return it. Shank compliments Vanellope's driving skills and points the duo towards Yessss at BuzzTube, where Ralph decides to make a series of viral videos playing off popular trends to get the money. As Ralph's videos become a viral sensation, an excited Vanellope joins Yesss's staff in spamming users with pop-up ads. Ralph convinces Yesss to send Vanellope to Oh My Disney, where she meets and befriends the Disney Princesses, being encouraged by them to address her sense of unfulfillment and reaching a musical epiphany when Ralph calls her upon earning enough money to purchase the wheel. When Vanellope does not show up at eBay, Ralph's second call causes him to overhear her confessing to Shank she wants to stay in Slaughter Race because its unpredictability and challenges made her feel more alive than she did in Sugar Rush. Horrified at the thought of Vanellope leaving him, Ralph turns to Spamley for a way to make Slaughter Race unsatisfying for Vanellope by slowing down everything in the game. Spamley takes Ralph to meet Double Dan, the creature of the dark web, who gives him Arthur, an insecurity virus, which replicates any flaw it finds. When Ralph unleashes the virus in Slaughter Race, it unexpectedly replicates Vanellope's glitch across the game, triggering a server reboot and forcing Ralph to rescue Vanellope before the reboot deletes her from the game. Vanellope assumes the crash was her fault, but a guilty Ralph confesses to her what he had done. Feeling betrayed, she furiously disowns Ralph as her best friend and symbolises it by throwing away the hero medal. While Ralph recovers the now broken-in-half medal, Arthur scans him and duplicates his personality flaws. this creates a legion of extremely possessive Ralph clones that cause serious damage to the internet on a rampant search for Vanellope. The real Ralph finds her, and they work with Yessss to lead the clones into an antivirus software district, but the clones combine into Ralphzilla, a gigantic Ralph automaton. Seeing Ralph is fighting a losing battle, Vanellope surrenders herself, but Ralph refuses to accept this. He confronts his clones, owning up to his selfishness and possessiveness of Vanellope in the process, telling them physical separation does not mean the end of their friendship. With his insecurities resolved, the clones disintegrate, and the internet is restored, while Ralph is saved from falling to his death by the Disney Princesses. Later, Shank arranges for Vanellope to respawn in Slaughter Race, allowing her to stay. Ralph gives her half of the broken medal as they both bid a tearful farewell. It's quite an in-depth storyline, for a Disney animation movie, but I personally thought that the first half of the film was much better than the second half. Once Vanellope went into Disney world, it felt like they were making fun of themselves, but when she burst into her Disney-type song, it fit right in with all of there other annoying movies. Although I thought that the movie was watchable, for such a high budget, I was hoping for an all-time classic, especially as the whole cast returned for the sequel. Basically, it just goes down as another typical Disney movie, which had a decent concept but failed at the final hurdle. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Rich Moore who brought you Zootropolis and the original Wreck-It Ralph. It's also directed by Phil Johnston, who was the executive producer of Grimsby, which doesn't say much. For two people who haven't had that much experience with directing, they certainly went to town with this film, in terms of depth and the excellent animation, but they failed in the comedy apartment, and the emotional scenes were just typical Disney.Budget: $175million

33,TheMovieDiorama,Ralph Breaks The Internet wrecks its way into the 21st Century.,7,1 December 2018,"Gone are the days of retro 8-bit arcade games, Ralph has catapulted himself into the Internet. It's rare for a sequel to surpass the original, so I'm starting off bold by saying this is unexpectedly better than its predecessor (only just...). Ralph and Vanellope explore the endless possibilities of the Internet, which inadvertently tests their friendship. The arcade's router has subsequently improved nearly every aspect in this sequel. The narrative flows more fluidly, integrating various famous websites such as eBay, Google and BuzzzTube (a knockoff YouTube) into a coherent story. However it's the intent focus on Ralph and Vanellope's friendship that gives the story a plethora of hearts, and surprisingly delivers some emotional moments towards its conclusion. The script manages to build on the foundations that the original created, and evolves with its online technology. Sure, the frequent use of humour will appeal to younger audiences (and made me laugh also!), yet it's the tangible bond between these two characters that adults can really feel. The obvious sentimentality during the third act is somewhat, well, obvious. But it's assured enough to bypass this popular virus that plagues many mediocre family animations. The animation itself was stunning, creatively portraying a physical representation of the Internet. The voice acting remains consistently decent, with even an ironic musical number for Silverman. I found the ""Oh My Disney!"" segment to be a lazy effort for self-promotion, and consumed slightly too much of the runtime (particularly the array of princesses), even if it is jokingly commenting on coincidental patterns from Disney classics. Never knew so many songs were sung from staring at water! However, the narrative avoids plenty of product placement pitfalls and captures the endless trends of its environment, whilst still building investable character development between two loveable individuals. That, to me, is a resounding success and I hope Ralph returns to break something else once more.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

37,matthewssilverhammer,Bigger and Better,8,1 December 2018,"I'm usually a sucker for reference-heavy, meta-based entertainment. It scratches a comfort itch I rarely even realize is there until someone exploits it. I'm also an easy-win for most-things Disney Animation. When Ralph promised plenty of both, including an entire segment dedicated to Disney properties (specifically the princesses), I was cautiously intrigued. What I didn't expect was to be floored. Not only do the references work (yes, the Princesses are hilarious, but they're also just incredibly emboldening), the movie itself is a big, fun success of heart and adventure we've not seen from Disney since Frozen.
When Vanellope's arcade game breaks down, she and Ralph try to find a way to fix her machine within the world of the internet. Much like Pixar's Inside Out, Ralph takes a non-physical world and puts digital flesh on it; and while it's not nearly as precise or genius, it still exhibits tons of imagination in clever and funny ways to bring the world of the inner-internet to life. It's an onslaught of web-based product placement, that in lesser hands could've been purely pandering and overpowering. Instead, we're given scene-after-scene of specific references and highlights that aren't only funny but (mostly) propel the story.
This is ultimately a kid's movie that will speak to parents at least as much as their kids. Not only because of the deep digital references, but the bigger points being made are complex and moving. The destructive power of jealousy, selfishness parading around as commitment, assumed male entitlement among internet users. It all adds up to a movie that's not only better than it's predecessor, but may help to raise a kinder generation of cyberspace users.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Once there, their friendship is tested when Vanelope discovers a new exciting online racing game and starts to wonder whether the arcade is where she should be.I really enjoyed the first ""Wreck it Ralph"", so it's disappointing to say that this sequel is, for me, a bit of a let-down. I think there are two problems with the film. One is that ""The Internet"" is too wide a target to take shots at. The jokes showing eBay as an actual auction house or Twitter as a number of birds in a tree aren't really funny enough, and were all there in the trailer. The section of the film that really works is the interaction with the Disney Princesses. Here Disney points some mild fun at itself and its tropes. It suggests a better movie that this one could have been, with our two principle characters manoeuvring around the Disney/Marvel/StarWars universes, like a funny ""Kingdom Hearts""-esque adventure.The second problem is that the plot of the film is ... odd, rather than playing against an antagonist, the film is almost an examination of jealousy within friendships, or a controlling relationship. It's doesn't have an arc to the story, just a bunch of things that happen, then it gets out of hand a bit towards the end. . bit of a realisation. Done. Even the plot's McGuffin, the new steering wheel, is sorted out off camera, and well before the films actual conclusion.It does look great. I never see films in 3D but time issues meant that only a 3D screening was possible, it was clear and crisp and doesn't use it in a gimmicky way (very often) - but this doesn't make up for the meandering plot and the fact it's not up to par in the humour stakes, which combine to make this a bit of a chore to sit through.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
39,Vartiainen,Self-serving pile of guano,4,25 August 2019,"It has been six years since the events of Wreck-It-Ralph. And things are pretty much like they were at the end of that film. Ralph and Vanellope are still friends, who like to hang out, riff on video games and occasionally get a drink together. Because that's what life is about. Nothing ever changes unless it's huge and dramatic. Imagine your life six years ago. Things were just as they are nowadays. Right?Because this movie can't even get timeskips correct.But then the Internet appears! And of course Ralph and Vanellope head down there. Because reasons, and because otherwise we wouldn't have a plot. And it's just as bad as you can imagine. Remember that joke in Moana about tweeting. That joke that was immediately dated, and which will make no sense ten years into the future. Well, picture a whole movie like that. Modern social media references galore. Mentions about companies, most of which will not exists ten years from now, let alone fifty. Do you think Snow White would still be viewed as classic if it referenced Sloss Sheffield or Bethlehem Steel? Both big recession beaters, but virtually unknown nowadays.And it's not like the actual plot is that bad. It's pretty basic and derivative of the original film, but I still like the dynamic between Ralph and Vanellope. I even kind of like the way they make fun of Disney Princesses with Vanellope meeting the actual members of Mouse Royalty. Sure, it's pandering, childish and makes a completely mockery of what these characters were like in their own movies, but at least it got a chuckle out of me. A dirty, awkward chuckle, but a chuckle nonetheless.But, I simply can't get beyond the fact that this is Disney selling out. This is the greatest animation company on Earth saying that it would rather sell tickets than tell a good story. This is the Black Mouse claiming that it's better to be feared than loved. Because, this film is Disney's big middle finger to all other media outlets out there. It is Mickey stating that it owns us and that it's not even trying to claim otherwise.And that's just sad.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

And we all learn a lesson about letting things go and letting our loved ones chase their dreams and be happy. But what I found particularly awesome about this was all of the crossover cameos. Well, they're not all actual crossovers, since everyone is owned by Disney, but still. You have the Disney Princesses, of course, and you have appearances by Kermit, stormtroopers, C-3PO, Baymax, and even the avatar of Stan Lee. Oh, and those princesses? Each is voiced by her original vocal artist, save for those no longer living and for Mary Costa, who felt that at age 88 she couldn't voice a 16-year-old Aurora. Kinda neat, right? The leads here (John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman) are both at the top of their game, and we also get to enjoy the stylings of Taraji P. Henson (as an algorithm) and Gal Gadot (as a racing-game character). This was a lot of fun from start to finish, no pun intended, and it's proof of the impact that a well-cast voice actor can make.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Reilly-Kong:Skull Island, Guardians of the Galaxy; Sarah Silverman-A Million Ways to Die in the West, School of Rock; Gal Gadot-Wonder Woman, Knight and Day and Taraji P. Henson-Empire_tv, Proud Mary.
This is an animated sequel to the 2012 Wreck_It Ralph. John and Sarah are best buds, living their days in the arcade gaming store when Wi_Fi comes to town. That's when arcade meets Wi_Fi. When an accident knocks Sarah's game Sugar Rush out of commission, the duo decide to travel to the internet, in search of a needed part to fix the game-they heard they could get it on e_bay. That is when they meet all kinds of characters-a lot of the fun is spotting characters that you know-including Gal, a race car driver and Taraji, a CEO of internet hot properties, such as kitten videos, baby videos, hot pepper tasting videos, etc. One of the interesting meetings is when they run into the Disney Princesses-there is a scene where the princesses get to wear normal clothes with hidden messages on their shirts. If you are watching closely, you will also spot a quick cameo by the late Stan Lee. As the end credits start, there is a scene that is something that was shown in the trailers but not in the actual movie. Plus, at the very end, there is a scene hinting a sneak peak of an up and coming Disney movie.
It's rated ""PG"" for action and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Where the first film seemed somewhat embarrassed of its central association, quickly discarding the gaming motif in a bold bait-and-switch, this one delivers on the promise of its trailers and delves deep into the guts of daily life within the internet. It's funny and creative about it, using the occasion to mash together all manner of licensed characters and website logos in a smart, clever fusion of pop culture iconography that's both delightfully surprising and directly relevant to the plot. A lingering stay in the Disney universe is where we encounter the most memorable bits; a wildly enthusiastic visual showpiece for the mammoth studio's huge stable of assets that leaves no stone unturned. That fan service is where a majority of this sequel's value lies, especially given its exceedingly simple storyline, and there's no great fault in that.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

50,r96sk,Marginally exceeds the original,8,26 August 2020,"Marginally exceeds the original, at least in my eyes.The internet setting works way better than the video game world. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed 'Wreck-It Ralph'. I just think this one feels much more relatable, the vast majority of viewers understand the internet as opposed to the smaller market for old arcade games. For that, it means you can do some much more with the premise. All the references are amusing, while the inclusion of the Disney world itself is pretty cool.I do have a few critiques, of course. The run time is about 20 minutes too long, while the final act isn't as great as it could've been. Everything else, though, they get mostly spot on. It's very entertaining, the end credit scenes are terrific too.John C. Reilly (Ralph) and Sarah Silverman (Vanellope) are again very good, Jane Lynch (Calhoun) and Jack McBrayer (Felix) are marginalised but I'd argue that's fine - there's not much more you could do with those two characters. Alan Tudyk returns too, albeit in a new role as KnowsMore. I'm not usually a fan of same actor/different character, but that newbie is fun. Taraji P. Henson (Yesss) and Gal Gadot (Shank) are two newcomers, Gadot's character is more memorable but both are up-to-scratch.I really like 'Ralph Breaks the Internet', it's a rare Disney animated sequel that has strong quality.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

In the first movie, we clearly understand what both characters want and why they have to work together. This time, Vanellope seems like she has a genuine concern, while Ralph is just whiny.

The voice acting is superb. I could listen to Ralph and Vanellope volley back and forth at each other all day. The world building is still great, even if it's not a perfect representation of the Internet but, really, who wants a perfect representation of that?The biggest flaw the movie has is that it spreads itself too thin for me. It's trying to hit on too many of the Internet things, locals and jokes, leaving it feeling scattered and unfocused. Maybe if it was all focused on the search engine, or the streaming service, or the gaming, or the seedy portions, or shopping, or the Disney empire and its princesses.

Tonight's movie decides to journey to the center of the internet looking into the world of cyberspace through the eyes of Disney. Yes, tonight the sequel many never thought would come to bear given the current movements by Disney (Pixar sequels, live animation, and Marvel). That's right! Out of Walt Disney Animation Studios is Wreck It Ralph 2: Ralph Breaks the Internet, which based on the massive advertising, holds the potential to be another hilarious adventure. Robbie K here to review:Movie: Wreck It Ralph 2: Ralph Wrecks The Internet (2018)Directors:
Phil Johnston, Rich Moore
Writers:
Phil Johnston (screenplay by), Pamela Ribon (screenplay by)
Stars:
John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Gal Gadot
LIKES:Animation: No surprise, Disney knows how to design and animate in the world of children's animation. Ralph's newest adventure proves this once more as the cyberworld comes to life in rich textures and colors, as the wonderful world of Disney's lens reveals a cleverly detailed world. All ages should appreciate the mood and characterization of each popular app and part of the cyber world, that adds the characteristic this series is famous for. Characters move smoothly in all sequences, and it still holds the personality of a video game.Comedy: Ralph's series is always known for the comedy and the dive into the internet immersed the group into new depths of comedy. This film broadens its horizons in terms of laugh factors and allows more people to laugh at the antics at hand. The same slapstick remains from the first film, while jabs at our popular culture, alongside quote worthy one-liners ring through the whole film. Many avenues are not safe from the ridicule of the movie, that will hopefully have you laughing in good fun like I did. Nevertheless, the film's laugh fest is still reminiscent of the first film, but bringing a new twist to the mix.Pace: A Disney movie is often paced quite well and this film is no exception. Ralph and company will be surfing at the speed of information exchange, having no problems with being deterred or hindered in its ability to bring the entertainment and story we so crave. With this faster pace, comes an energy that Ralph is famous for, which will captivate the attention of all the intended audience members.Cleverness: The movie works so well with managing to have geekiness imbued into the film, showing off the whit of the famous studio as they pay tribute to the nerds and nerd alike. Random cameos, details of buildings, and other popular culture references are well-established into the comedy and seldom forced upon you like some of the films they have made. Still, Disney's shrewd creativity and imagination continue to shine forth in their ability to make animated films.The Moral: The movie wouldn't be a Disney film if there wasn't a tried and true trail to remain at the center of it all. Ralph's first lesson was about self-identity and discovering yourself. This film expands the already deep characters to new levels as their relationship evolves into the next levels of growth. As both start to fan out into the cyber world and establish new adventures, Ralph and Venelope will go through their own trials as well. It's sweet, it's strong, and it jam packed with emotion that will have many getting sentimental, especially if it is relevant. Wreck It Ralph's moral driven plot may not be original, but it certainly is jam packed with the usual Disney magic.DISLIKES:Not The First Movie: Sequels have to be themselves and soar with open wings to establish its only flow. Still, the sequel lacked some of the creativity, uniqueness, target themes that it had established those years ago. I missed the video game focused references, and cameos of dad jokes with parodies to those games. In addition, it still lacked some other things I'll be mentioning to result in a still good sequel, but maybe not quite as strong as the original to me.The Other characters it was brilliant to allow other characters and gimmicks to unfold for this film, but a few other characters could have certainly had more involvement given how much a part they were of the main character's lives. Why the original characters didn't go on a journey more, I don't know, but I missed them in this film very much.New Characters Quite Not living To Full potential: Shank and the new crew might have been beautiful and bold in the film, but they were not nearly as integrated into the film as the previous installment. Disney has included them enough to give us future merchandising, but the cyber characters didn't quite have the adventurous involvement the previous one had. It would have been nice to pull them multiple times to help with facing the internet and I quite missed the sense of adventure the first film specialized in.Comedy In Your Face Moments: There are times where Disney still feels the need to force an idea or comedy style on them. Sometimes they work and other times are a little too intense for me to really appreciate it. The Disney princess moment is one of those moments that I felt was a little in your face, pushing too hard to get the point across for the sake of a laugh towards a certain subset of audience members. I get there is a place for a lot of comedy in this film, the goal of the producers, but perhaps working to integrate characters a little bit might have been the way to go instead of another princess service announcement.The Villain: Turbo was a great central antagonist that held many tricks in his arsenal to remain relevant and immortal. He was deadly enough to threaten people with darker tones, while still a force to brecken with. However, this one was missing a lot, often much due to underutilization of characters and a gimmick that seemed nothing more than a plot device trying to justify the inclusion of another big bad character. It's age appropriate, but not quite the full incredible splendor that the first one did, and I missed that challenge to their never-ending quest for fun, adventure and the truth.The Trailer Ruined Much: Hate when Disney over shows the trailers, making sure to show you so much of the movie without giving away the whole thing. Ralph has had a lot ruined, not everything mind you, but many powerful laughs and jokes could have held more life to it if they had been introduced in the film, instead of the billions of minutes on television. As such, some of the more popular jokes were stale to my viewing group.The Verdict:The sequel had a lot to live up for me, but Ralph's second film held plenty of the same magic that I fell in love with in the first film. Still a dazzling delight to watch with fantastic animation and design combined with the usual comedic references we've come to expect with this series. Still, the dive back into pop culture references still needed some software updates to maximize old and new characters, and design the film with the same standards the first held. Still the film is worth a trip to theater for many reasons and an enjoyable one at that.My scores are:
Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8-8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0",Ralph Breaks the Internet
59,invisibleunicornninja,Pretty fun movie.,10,15 December 2018,"This is a pretty entertaining movie with good voice acting, a nice message, and a lot of (while safe) fun jokes. While some things were clearly changed for the plot, it overall reflects what the internet is like. The plot is a bit meandering, but I don't really mind too much as Ralph and Venellope wandering around the Internet is pretty entertaining. I can't think of a single side character that wasn't amazing. Overall, I'd give this movie a 7/10.The reason I give it a 10/10 is because of the post-credits scene. It saddens me that so few people saw that. I was the only person in my theater who waited all the way to the end of the credits to see that scene, and its such a shame. That scene was pure art and needs to be cherished. I laughed so hard my throat hurt. It was beautiful.Also, the little animated Stan Lee cameo was cute. RIP Stan Lee.Also Also, that Ralph monster thing at the end is one of the scariest things I've ever seen. At the time of writing this review and seeing that movie I've been binging horror movies and I have to say that that Ralph monster thing at the end is pretty disturbing so just a heads up.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
60,rannynm,An Astonishing New Film Filled with Humor and Excitement!,9,23 November 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is an astonishing new film that's full humor and excitement. It is about Ralph aka Wreck it Ralph who goes on a trip with his best friend Vanellope into the internet to buy a steering wheel for Vanellope's game so it doesn't get shut down. The internet is a whole new thing for Ralph and his friends and they walk into some trouble while trying to get the wheel. A few of the inconveniences they run into are not knowing where to go and also not having money. Before Ralph and Vanellope find out they need money, they place a bid of $27,000 on the steering wheel. When they get to checkout and they don't have money, the cashier says they have 24 hours before their bid expires. That's when they embark on their journey through the internet.All the same characters from the original movie Wreck it Ralph are in this film and there are even some new ones introduced. Nathan Warner, the cinematography director excels at giving the movie a realistic cartoonish look. It really fits in with the whole video game plot and scenery. The theme is that friendships come in all shapes and sizes and that friends are forever.If you plan on bringing kids under 11 or 12, I strongly recommend that you watch the trailer with them and ask if they would want to see the full movie because there are a lot of puns about Twitter and a lot of jokes that I don't think younger kids will get. I'm not saying that you shouldn't bring younger kids, because they will still understand the majority of what's happening and enjoy the film, but the director geared this film for older audiences such as 12 and above. I recommend this for ages 10 to 18, as well as adults. It seemed that the adults were laughing more than the kids during the movie. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because it is a hilarious movie that kept me interested for all two hours.Make sure you stay for both scenes after the credits. Reviewed by Na'im S., KIDS FIRST!

61,rannynm,An astonishing animated film filled with humor and excitement!,9,18 February 2019,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is a colorful, fun-filled adventure that builds on characters and friendships. Going into this movie I thought it was going to be a predictable and boring washed-up sequel. That is not the case. The film builds upon the friendship that Ralph and Venellope have with each other. The climax of the movie is a heartwarming test of their friendship which brings light that friends don't always need to agree on everything.Ralph Breaks the Internet is about Mr. Litwack installing the Internet to his arcade and his ""Sugar Rush"" game breaking, which leads to their adventure through the internet. Mr. Litwack orders the parts on eBay, but it costs $200 which is more than the game makes a year. Ralph and Venellope overhear him talking and decide to go on a quest to find the part and save Venellope's game. They travel to the router and get transported to the magical world of the Internet. They awe at the vibrant colors and variety of the internet and go directly go to the search bar where they ask to go to eBay. When they realize they have to bid for the wheel, they bid the highest number they can think of, not realizing they have to pay. This causes them to go on an epic adventure to get $27,001 in under 24 hours or else the item would be re-bid. They find a pop-up ad that shows them how to make money playing video games. They decide to get a car owned by Shank. They race Shank until they get beat by her. She gives them a tip and tells Venellope she races well.My favorite scene is when they go to the Disney section of the Internet and we see a whole lot of cameos from favorite characters such as Eeyore and Stan Lee. I especially love when Venellope is being chased by Stormtroopers and goes into the princess lounge where she teaches them about modern comforts. I found that hilarious.This film has huge star power. Ralph is voiced by John C. Reilly, the man behind Step Brothers and The Sisters Brothers. Also, Sarah Silverman plays Venelope who started in SNL and has appeared in The battle of the Sexes.The message of this movie is that, even if you are best friends with someone that doesn't mean you can't disagree. This movie has nothing be inappropriate for kids. I recommend it for ages 7 to 18 and give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. By Abraham Finer, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",Ralph Breaks the Internet
62,Kamurai25,"""Ralph Wrecks his Relationship""",8,25 September 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.Even if you haven't seen the first one, you can watch this just fine.As much as I like this movie, the best part is by far the cg animated Disney Princesses: what a good tease for new CG movies, which they should have been doing instead of the live action garbage.Again, as much as I like this, it is a bit of a deviation from the first movie with a bit of a mixed antithetical message to it. While the first movie focused on Ralph and his quest dragging collateral damage in its wake to eventually bring the characters together in a spirit of inclusion, this movie scales up in a weird way, showing the internet as a place of connected inclusion and then ""wrecking it"". Even the main story line is about Ralph's mission to fix things so they can maintain a status quo and Vanellope's search for change and ""the new"". It's literally about how they shouldn't be together, or maybe that they're still together even if they aren't.It just gets weird real fast, and while J.C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman do a great job with their roles, you've got to operate with some suspension of disbelief that they can do any of what they're doing or that it makes any sense. They also deviated with how Ralph ""wrecks"" things.Once you get past some of the nit-picky stuff, they're on a well structured adventure filled with charm and wonderment with lots of interesting characters.I honestly would be surprised if anyone actively disliked this.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

64,mike48128,A Clever Sequel,9,9 March 2020,"Not quite as good as the original, but most enjoyable. Ralph breaks The Internet instead of just a video game called ""Sugar Racer"". Vanellape, the cute little ""girl"" from that game and Ralph ramp up the game so that the human user accidentally breaks the steering wheel while playing. Without a repair, the arcade game will be unplugged which may mean death to all the game members. Ralph goes in search of a ""new"" one, and finds in on E-Bay, of course! He accidentally bids up the part to the astronomical price of $2700.01 and has no way to pay for it, as a video game ""character"" has no charge card. The rest of the film is a giant misadventure as he systematically ""wreaks the Internet"". Filled with tons pf ""Easter Eggs"" and clever plot twists. Some examples: Vanellape meets the Disney Princesses all ""hanging"" together but out-of-uniform (""Batman"" theme playing). Ariel is wearing a shirt and slacks! They tell her that the only way to find a solution is to sing into a pool of water, which she does. (Olivia-Newton-John in ""Grease""?) Ralph's evil viruses form a giant King-Kong character. The characters in ""The Slaughter Race"" game are actually quite nice, but they are just drawn that way (Jessica Rabbit) and the race is not really that scary or graphic as the name would indicate. Too long for the attention span of most children (2 hours) and maybe not quite as well ""rendered"" as the original, as Pixar has been absorbed into ""Disney Animation"".

Here we have an issue led moralising story about the changing nature of friendship. In addition we have this strung out over lengthy palette of contrivances that is so thin no one cares.The animation was lacking in facial personality, the voice artists lacked variety and were largely stereotypical, there was no warmth and hence no magic.Just a casual glance at Missing Link shows the direction Disney needs to follow, stop with this formulaic emotion led rubbish and go back to Bedknobs and Broomsticks.

67,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Comparable to the original movie.,8,1 January 2019,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is equal-parts good-old fun and cynical, though it doesn't suffer from the same creative detriment The Emoji Movie suffered (the 'product first, film second' mentality). This is a fun, colourful and vibrant sequel to one of the first movies to understand the cultural impact of video games; it told a story through one of appreciation of games, as opposed to a story based off a game. The film's fun yet derivative, though it makes up for it with all its lively imagery and great characters; it seems that the film falls short when it comes to the ending (the resolution, while making sense, is resolved in a way that seems very 'deus-ex machina' to me).Its exploration of the internet and the theme of personal security/feelings about anything is handled very well and the exploration of the digital world (and franchising) is how The Emoji Movie wanted to handle it, though sometimes the internet references and self-reverence for Disney (and the internet) does come off as creatively narcissistic, tiresome and predictable (especially the eBay-stuff in the movie). The self-aware humour gives this film points that other films of its ilk tend to lack when using pop-culture as a jumping point.Overall, Ralph Breaks the Internet is rock-solid if somewhat flawed animated fun at the movies.

I liked the creativity that was put into the original and enjoyed it more than some of Pixar's work actually. The sequel is something where I didn't know what to expect but was going to check out just because. I don't think Ralph Breaks the Internet is as good as the first film but much like the first film the film keeps busy and has enough pop culture and video game references to keep it rolling.In this film, Vanellope's Sugar Rush game has been shut down as the steering wheel has broken and the money required to fix the game is excessive. Times are changing and the arcade now has w-fi. Ralph and Vanellope have the idea of going into the internet and exploring the online world, in hopes of buying a replacement game steering wheel from Ebay to keep Sugar Rush at the arcade. Along the way the duo encounter all the whips and quirks of the online world.I think the film has some pretty great moments and references. Namely, the Disney princesses segment. I thought that was funny and that's the kind of creativity and wit that makes the first film work. I wasn't overly fond of other aspects of the film especially the parts in Slaughter Race, as it felt drawn out. I think the film doesn't utilize the full extent of what it can do. The internet and everything that goes on in it is so vast but the references don't always deliver in a meaningful way.The animation and sound is obviously brilliant. Its a competent sequel to the first film and should please fans of the original with relative ease. I think the first one had a more memorable presence, despite Ralph Breaks the Internet having some fun moments. Not that bothered that a sequel for Wreck-It Ralph has come out because its one of the better Disney films in recent years as is so it was justified, I guess.6.5/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet
72,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A perfect balance of internet references and self-aware comedy.,9,14 March 2019,"Back in 2012, I was impressed that a movie like Wreck-It Ralph could exist. The amount of licensing agreements needed to bring together so many recognizable characters from famous franchises was a daunting task the likes of which I hadn't seen since Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988). Similarly, the sequel to Wreck-It Ralph, Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018) had the challenge of integrating so many brand names and websites into something that could work as a story without becoming too dated as time marches on. In both cases, I think the balance between brand-name recognition and original content helped to make for an entertaining film.In the lead-up to the release of Ralph Breaks the Internet, I was concerned that it was going to rely heavily on internet memes for its laughs-taking a somewhat similar tack from The Emoji Movie (2017). I also had concerns that this movie would also focus most of its time on the Slaughter Race sub-plot, which would make it almost too similar to its predecessor (which spent perhaps way too much time in the Sugar Rush game, overall). Fortunately, this film again managed to find the right balance, both in references and in sub-plots.While Ralph Breaks the Internet is coy in its self-awareness, I truly loved the segments that poked fun at internet culture (like the jittery movements of player characters in Slaughter Race), as well as the number of Disney tropes flipped on their head. I mean, I'd watch a whole movie with just the Disney Princesses interacting in the way that they did (and if Disney isn't selling the graphic T-shirts they were wearing in this movie, they're missing out on a massive amount of potential income). I mean, what movie has a ""princess song"" about wanting to drive in Slaughter Race? Hilarious.A perfect balance of internet references and self-aware comedy, I give Ralph Breaks the Internet 4.5 stars out of 5.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
73,RforFilm,Ralph Breaks the Internet is more then web jokes. it's a funny and emotional story about friendship and being a proper friend,8,21 November 2018,"Disney sequels are something that the company once tried, did for a while, and tried to sweep it up, trying to forget they ever happened. And now we're getting a sequel to Wreck it Ralph. So what does this mean for Disney? When people think about Disney sequels, they're referring to the direct to video movies that were made on a lower budget to continue milking the story further then it needs to. What surprises people is that some sequels like The Rescuers Down Under, Fantasia 2000, and Winnie the Pooh are sequels made by Disney Feature Animation (the direct to video movies were produced by Disneytoon) and were made with the same passion from before.Like the other sequels, Ralph Breaks the Internet continues the story from before. The only difference is that rather then gaming, the jokes and setting deal with the Internet. There's no denying that the Internet has become a major part of society, changing the way we communicate. Like how movies, television, and video games have changed entertainment, the internet has added it's own stamp with web videos, viral memes, and social network stars. Much of these subjects are touched upon in Ralph Breaks the Internet.Set six years after the events of Wreck it Ralph, Ralph (played by John C. Railly) and Vanellope (played by Sarah Silverman) seem to enjoy their lives within their arcade games of Fix it Felix Jr and Sugar Rush. Things go wrong when the Sugar Rush game becomes unplugged when an accident causes the real world steering wheel to break. Though the owner of the arcade Litwak (played by Ed O'Neill) finally gets a Wifi router, he can't find a replacement part and thinks it's time to get rid of the Sugar Rush machine. Ralph and Vanellope decide that they can go to the Internet to find that replacement part.Unlike the arcade, which was just that, the internet is a vast metropolis with various buildings representing famous websites like Amazon, Instagram, IMDB, and many more. Ralph and Venallope find themselves at Ebay where they bid and win the right part, they need to get the money to pay for it. A spam bot (played by Bill Hader) leads them to an online game Slaughter Race, where they encounter a group of street gang racers lead by Shank (played by Gal Gadot). While there, Ralph ends up becoming a viral trend where he's encouraged by Yesss (played by Taraji P. Henson) to continue while Vanellope questions whether she even wants to go home. Oh, and they also encounter the Disney princesses.When you bring the Internet as a setting, that's going to allow Ralph Breaks the Internet a lot of opportunity for jokes. Not only do they poke fun at the various online companies, but they even go after stuff I wasn't expecting Disney to do; popup ads, spam, violent games, dumb videos, and even the dark web are given a chance and each get a clever joke. I laughed a lot more then I thought I was going in.The movie isn't just internet jokes. In fact, it builds on the previous movie's theme of existentialism by having the heroes question their roles not only in their games, but as they are as video game characters. If the last one was about Ralph, then much of the emotion goes to Vanellope who sees that life doesn't have to be a constant repeat of candy races. It has her question her place and even her friendship to Ralph. Of course, Ralph too has his own questions, such as what happens when his friend wants too leave and whether he can be too clingy.All of this adds up to the movie's big climax in which I won't give away, but it does add up to the movie's title of ""breaking the internet"". It's both an impressive set piece and leads to an emotional realization. It's brilliant writing all around.If I had to nitpick, it's on two things. First, it's internet jokes, while funny, do make me wonder how this'll hold up in ten years. I still feel like Wreck it Ralph will have a bigger place then this will. The other problem is that it's a shame that the characters of Felix and Sergeant Calhoun don't play bigger parts in their journey as I loved them from before. Why couldn't they have gone with them and experienced their own joys of the Internet? Oh well, at least they are in the movie.I'll give this eight viral trends out of ten. Comparing this to the original is difficult as they feel like different stories. It has different agendas and different themes, and yet it doesn't. It'll help if you watch Wreck it Ralph first, but it's not completely needed to enjoy this. I think most people will find a lot to laugh, even if their not tech savvy. If anything, it might be funnier. Log in, go see it, and make it a trend.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
74,eminkl,"It's frequently indulgent, but indulgence is what's expected",7,17 April 2020,"An improvement over Wreck-It Ralph in most every respect. Where the first film seemed somewhat embarrassed of its central association, quickly discarding the gaming motif in a bold bait-and-switch, this one delivers on the promise of its trailers and delves deep into the guts of daily life within the internet. It's funny and creative about it, using the occasion to mash together all manner of licensed characters and website logos in a smart, clever fusion of pop culture iconography that's both delightfully surprising and directly relevant to the plot. A lingering stay in the Disney universe is where we encounter the most memorable bits; a wildly enthusiastic visual showpiece for the mammoth studio's huge stable of assets that leaves no stone unturned. That fan service is where a majority of this sequel's value lies, especially given its exceedingly simple storyline, and there's no great fault in that.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
75,bankofmarquis,"Come for Ralph and Vanelope, stay for the Disney Princesses",8,1 December 2018,"I'm pretty sure that this is going to be the only review of WRECK-IT RALPH 2: RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET that will draw a comparison between Ralph2 and DEADPOOL 2.Like, DP2, Ralph2 suffers in the first 1/2 hour of the film with an issue - it tries too hard to repeat what was successful in the first film. I spent the first portion of both films thinking ""you did this - better - in the first film"". But, like DP2, Ralph2 finds it's footing - and it's own voice - after a fashion and becomes a very entertaining film.And you can thank the Disney Princesses for that.Without giving too much away, the plot of Ralph2 has Wreck-it Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanelope (Sarah Silverman) heading to the Internet (notably E:BAY) to find a replacement part for her game. The main theme of this film is ""finding the place where you belong"" and along this journey Vanelope enters in the world of Disney and encounters all of the Disney Princesses backstage.Kudos to The Walt Disney Company - and Disney Animation Studios - for having a sense of humor and poking fun at themselves. These versions of the princesses are funny and don't take themselves too seriously, by taking themselves very seriously (if that makes any sense) - every character acts (and reacts) ways that make sense. It's a tribute to this extended bit that EVERY original voice of these characters (at least the ones that are still alive) agreed to contribute their voice talents to this bit. The funniest bit was the way Disney Animation handled the character of Princess Merida from BRAVE - a Pixar film.As for the film proper - it is fine enough. John C. Reilly (as Ralph) and Sarah Silverman (as Vanelope) reprise their roles and they are winning enough to hold our attention throughout (though Ralph is sidelined for long stretches as this is really Vanelope's story). Jacks McBrayer's Fix-It Felix is back (for small bits in the beginning and end) as is the great Jane Lynch's Calhoun character. I get that these 2 characters are not really in service to the story - and I applaud the filmmakers for not trying to shoehorn them in - but I can't believe ANY conversation that starts ""We have Jane Lynch, so we're going to push her in the background and use very little of her.""As for the other voice cast, Alan Tudyk (the voice of the King Candy in the first Wreck-It Ralph) is back as the voice of an overly-aggressive search engine. Tudyk is this generation's ""Man of a Thousand Voices"" and I had no idea it was him until the credits, which was fun (for me). Joining the fun this time around - and acquitting herself quite well - is Gal Gadot as an on-line game Race Car Drive that becomes Big Sister/mentor to Vanelope.One final mention, there are 2 credits scene. The first one is fun enough (and is a callback to the first film), but the 2nd one (at the very end of the credits) had me chuckling - and I was glad I stayed for it.Come for Ralph and Vanelope, stay for the Disney Princesses. You'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Ralph Breaks the Internet
76,Anurag-Shetty,"Another unique, nostalgic & unforgettable adventure.",10,25 November 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet continues the story of Ralph(John C. Reilly) & Vanellope(Sarah Silverman), 6 years after the events of Wreck-It Ralph(2012). When a Wi-Fi router gets installed at the arcade, Ralph & Vanellope set about on a new adventure.Ralph Breaks the Internet is a mind-blowing film. Directors Phil Johnston & Rich Moore, bring back all the ingredients that made the 2012 smash hit, so memorable. It's an absolute delight exploring the internet for the first time, through Ralph & Vanellope's eyes. It's super fun keeping track of the various evident Easter Eggs, scattered all through the Internet. The animation is flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The humor & emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout the movie. The scene involving the Disney princesses, is one of the highlights of the film. The voice acting is top-notch. John C. Reilly is spectacular as Ralph. Sarah Silverman is outstanding as Vanellope. Reilly & Silverman share this effortless & adorable chemistry, in all their scenes together. Gal Gadot is fantastic as Shank. Taraji P. Henson is brilliant as Yesss. Jack McBrayer & Jane Lynch are awesome as Felix & Calhoun, respectively. Alan Tudyk is amazing as KnowsMore. Alfred Molina is superb as Double Dan. Ed O'Neill is great as Mr. Litwak. Sean Giambrone is good as The eboy. The supporting cast is impressive.

77,fernandoschiavi,Good combination between arcade video games to the online and mobile world in a beautiful new world and also packed with important messages,7,28 May 2021,"The way directors Rich Moore (Wreck-it Ralph, Zootopia) and Phil Johnson (who co-directs his first animated feature) chose to personify the internet, as a gigantic city may not be new, but the way it presents itself is very smart. Disney has also dealt with a multitude of brands of websites, services and social networks, all of which appear in their original incarnations and portrayed to reflect their nature. As the internet is represented as a city - and eBay is a kind of shopping center - the film plays with many concepts, including modern events - such as Ralph trying to become an influencer. The way everything is represented is very fun and intuitive: a highly technological and brilliant city, where big companies have their value measured by the height of the buildings - the bigger, the more powerful the company is, with Google being the biggest of all. Representations of annoying and annoying pop-ups in search of a click, the reminders of the sites, the search for information on the site that alludes to Google and the way people in search of answers are directed to those sites. In addition to social networks (even the search for ""likes"" and criticism of haters on the internet are present), we have e-commerce sites that offer everything we need to survive. The way in which everything was imagined and represented is magical and should enchant the younger ones especially for its plasticity and the older ones, who will certainly sketch smiles with parallel lines drawn.If everything up to this point sounds just that easy, including the satire of the virtual environment - quite similar to Emoji: The Movie in several visual conceptions - the challenges faced by Ralph and Vannelope are, this time, more internalized than before and they reveal themselves discreetly in parallel with the initial mission of acquiring the steering wheel. As he ventures on the network, Vannelope is enchanted by the unpredictability of the place, especially when they enter the violent online game Rush of Chaos, fueling his curiosity for everything that is new and unexpected. Meanwhile, in a mixture of love and jealousy, Ralph, who struggles to preserve what is old and predictable, feels deeply uncomfortable.These different interests will collide at some point, and it is this clash that really strengthens Ralph Breaks the Internet. All the joking with the internet, the decoy of the sequence, does not even have such an essential role in the advancement of the narrative, only serving as a new map to be explored. The involvement is due to the relationship of Ralph and Vannelope, which was already one of the strengths of the previous feature and which here gains an amazing evolution, both in its sincerity and maturity - without wanting to give more details, but who would say that a sequence of Ralph Breaks the Internet would address the effect of toxic behavior and abusive relationships so efficiently. The movie's great message, by the way, is intimately connected to this whole metalanguage, as everyone has the ability to change and adapt to circumstances. ""Letting go"" maturing and living an emotionally and psychologically healthy life can also be important approaches shown between the lines of the film.Added to how intuitive and modern the feature film is, showing how the algorithms and business model of large companies work and how people behave when they are surfing, as well as the most dangerous and problematic areas of the internet; we have an educational and entertaining film for children. In addition to teaching them about the internet, it also brings important reflections for adults to remember and embrace. The only major criticism is the focus on the Internet in the United States. In summary, there is a great absence of Chinese companies, for example, which causes a lack in the way the world internet is represented. It lacked to show the Russian, Chinese and even Brazilian side of the internet.While it succeeds in capturing these content consumption habits, including the procrastination that leads to sharing memes and useless personality tests during office hours, the animation loses its hand in the friendship of its protagonists. On one side, Vanellope grows up and has memorable encounters with Disney princesses and legendary runners, on the other, Ralph is just boring. It is a dynamic created to take the great lesson of the feature - love is different from controlling - but it hinders the pace of the narrative. It gradually becomes disposable, constantly interrupting Vanellope's learning. Thus, in the same way that animators ingeniously transform websites and applications into environments and characters, Ralph becomes the personification of an old audience, who feels abandoned by the evolution of certain concepts - like that of princesses who do not need to be saved. It is, as said before, a relevant debate, but done to the detriment of the title character, who is only there to serve as an example.Something that also contributes to the strength of this arc is how its construction takes place, transforming Ralph Breaks the Internet into an unusual Disney princess film. In the midst of a parallel trip watered by various meta-references to other properties of the studio - including Star Wars and Disney Animation Studios itself -, Vannelope meets characters such as Snow White, Cinderella, Elsa and Ana from Frozen, Rapunzel, Moana and even Merida in its more casual versions, with the right to printed sweatshirts, and ends up reflecting on his role in this whole plot. In what is easily the most fun part of the feature, Vannelope sings about his dreams in an unusual and charming musical number, one that amuses him at the same time as he advances the plot to a new place.In fact, the whole visit of the kid to the Disney World was magical, as there are references in each frame of this passage. And when she finally comes face to face with the princesses, each girl's speech is self-critical - from what makes them princesses to the way they treat each other, with Merida de Valente being a kind of black sheep among the girls. Up to this point there is an important metalanguage, since the Disney Princesses behave and dress in a more formal and appropriate way, while Merida, being from another studio originally, behaves in a more colloquial, youthful and rebellious way, dialoguing more with today's young people than the rest. Going even further, even the film's ""musical moment"" can be considered a studio nudge in the formula for the history of older animations.However, the film has some serious script problems, ending up abandoning some pre-established concepts. If you watched the first movie, you remember that one of the main rules was that the characters could not abandon their games while the arcade was open, otherwise their game could be considered broken and everyone would lose their function as it would be turned off. Afterwards, Ralph and Vanellope spend virtually days on the internet and nothing happens at the arcade. Another problem is the charismatic characters of the first film that are practically forgotten throughout the story. Even important characters from the original, such as Felix Jr and Sergeant Calhoun, end up having empty and unimportant appearances in the new film, giving space to the new characters, most of them boring and without any charisma, like the businesswoman called Yesss, who it will easily be forgotten.However, many people do not go to the cinema just for the emotional message, but also for the visual confectionery reliably provided by Walt Disney Animation Studios. If some time ago there was a tendency to distinguish the aesthetic qualities of films in the studio from those produced by Pixar, today this differentiation is completely overlooked. That's to say Ralph Wi-Fi has jaw-dropping plastic care, traveling through different styles - the colorful candy world of Sugar Rush, the dusty Los Angeles crumbling of Chaos Rush, the sinister and somber representation of the "" deep web ""where Ralph orders a super powered virus - and delivering a satisfactory result to all of them. Another noteworthy aspect is the action scenes, which take advantage of this 100% digital world to perform dizzying tricks.Technically, Ralph Breaks the Internet fills your eyes. The contrast between cartoon characters like Ralph and Vanellope, with more realistic ones like Shank or even princesses is a cool thing to see, and everyone has found themselves wondering what the internet would be like if it were a place we could visit, even as NPCs from square heads. The soundtrack, in charge of Henry Jackman (who for the first time assumes alone, having worked in films like Captain America: Civil War, Kong: Skull Island and Kingsman: The Golden Circle in company with others) is very competent and rises at the precise moments.Ralph Breaks the Internet is a fun movie that seems to get it right up to the first 40 or 50 minutes of projection. Although he ignores most of the good characters in the first feature film, he manages to create a good environment for children and adults. But, unfortunately, it is clear that they have not yet reached the general tone of the production: after finding the princesses, the film gets lost, becomes unstable and does not decide what it wants to tell. There was a lack of greater coherence in the script and in the overall objective of the feature film. Anyway, technology, as well as the leap between arcade video games to the online and mobile world, is well represented in the film. The feature film enchants with the internet being shown in a creative and intuitive way, all of which is packed with beautiful messages about friendship and life transitions and passages.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
78,Animany94,This was a satisfying watch.,9,4 November 2019,"While I do think it overall lacks a little of the predecessor's character developement, I do think it managed to pick itself up as the movie progressed. The beginning of the movie seemed like a cliched and predictable plot of finding something important to fix something.BUT, like I said, the movie makes up for it as it progresses, because when Ralph and Venellope break through to the internet it really gets interesting. We get an amazing interpretation of the internet with everything from internet culture, personifications of well known web-sites, viruses and search engines of many kinds.And you can say what you want about the cameos of the Disney Princesses, but I thought they were hilarious! They do help out getting Venellope's character a purpose of her own instead of just letting her be left with that tiresome plot of finding that important thing. Disney has in recent years done a lot of self-referencing comedy which sometimes work and other times doesn't, but this one works all the way.And like Venellope, Ralph gets a very well handled character arc which comes into fruition the more the movie progresses, so as a sequel to Wreck-It-Ralph that focuses on the friendship between those two characters, I think it managed to keep that spirit while expanding on the world of video games.It may be lacking in the writing in the beginning and some of the earlier characters don't have much to do, but it was a satisfying continuation with high entertainment value.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
79,Rob-O-Cop,"Squandered good will, Who were they making this corporate constructed movie for?",5,31 December 2018,"Wreck it Ralph, The friendship movie with a heart doesn't deserve this executive round table constructed marketing strategy piece. It has none of the factors that made the original so good, instead opting for a confusing, ugly, shallow and over crammed edited to with in an inch of its life (arguably more than an inch, killing it) mess.
Watching it you have to wonder who the movie was aimed at, and it looks like they thought they were aiming it at everyone, but instead pleasing no one.
It's way to complicated and dark for the kids that loved the charm and fun of the first one, it's way to cynical and manipulated for adults who can see right through the product placement, maybe there's a sweet spot 12-13 year old group who will get the complexities of the internet jargoning.
Its overall message is just horrible and unfit for children. Vanellope was annoying but bearable in the first one but here she goes off the deepened into selfcentered brat territory. What's the message here? if she wants to join a gang you need to let her go and express herself?
Poor Ralph gets no space to show his heart this time. everything is moved along so quickly he's rushed trough his lines and scenes without touching the sides let alone anyone's heart.
This movie reeks of everything that is wrong with corporate made product. Ralph didn't wreck anything here, the producers, writers, editors and director did, and it looks like it cost a fortune to do it. A massive step backward for Pixar and Disney.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

83,abisio,A BORING SEQUEL FOR KIDS AND ADULTS,1,17 December 2018,"Disney has lately managed to destroy all the good things about is products. THE INCREDIBLES II a few months ago put me to sleep after a few minutes. My then 9 years old daughter woke me up a few times but the movie was unbearable. After the movie ended (and she woke me up one more time) I asked if she enjoyed and told me ""NAHH"".
I had already discarded all PIXAR movies because they are boring, more dramatic than fun and kids want to leave before the movie ends most of the time; but I loved the original INCREDIBLES so I gave it a try.
After such huge disappointment, I decided to see WRECK IT RALPH sequel; I movie I really loved. Well pretty much the same thing. All the fun of the original i s nowhere to be found there. In fact the King Kong's style finale is boring and not fun at all. In fact younger kids my get somewhat scared.
But the rest of the movie is mostly a DRAMA with very few stupid jokes that cause only shame.
DISNEY with his Political Correctness campaign is pretty much creating brainless kids; in fact the movie message is ""HAVE A FUN LIFE AND FORGET ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE "" I am 100% on individualism; but you have to think also in your family and friends.
My advice to everybody. DISNEY has become a MONOPOLY (did you remember when any other animated feature get an OSCAR or a good critic praise or publicity for the people to know is there to be seen ? Not even other studios dare to be serious competitors unless you serious resources. It is time to start boycotting DISNEY and force us to return the FUN in kids movies.

The story, directing, voice acting are all superb, concept through production.To those who rated this 1 or 2 stars because of supposed ""advertising"" or ""product placement""... have you never heard of satire? The movie is called ""Ralph Breaks the INTERNET"". The Internet is all about advertising and in-your-face product promotion. So what did you expect from this movie, Old Yeller? Why would such concepts surprise any viewer? It's like slamming a teen-oriented film because it contains... teens. (gasp!)Not only does this movie spoof those things in a humorous way (the pop-ups were creative and funny, as were the personifications of websites and users), it doesn't hesitate to use the actual names of companies in doing so. Did they make some bucks in the process? Maybe. Probably. SO WHAT? It was still funny. There are enough memes and tropes and Easter Eggs in this film to keep people re-winding for hours. (Anyone notice Qbert there?) :DRegarding the claims that Disney promoted itself: seriously? It's a Disney film about the Internet... so it's to be expected they're going to put some DISNEY into it. No big surprise there. But they didn't just do that... they actually made fun of themselves in the process. The room with the princesses where they're discussing their backgrounds and traits and powers and why they're princesses... does nothing more than make them appear to be a bunch of maladjusted psychos. That people, is humor and satire at its best. It was funny as blazes.This is satire, use of mega-tropes and self-deprecating humor. Did some viewers totally miss those concepts? It beats TRANSFORMERS hands down.CREDITS CLIPS: Be sure to watch those long, long credits, as there are TWO (yes, two) credits clips-- and one of them had me laughing my tail off.I'm pretty critical when it comes to rating films but I don't hesitate to give this a hefty 10 stars.

87,kjproulx,A Funny and Emotional Journey for All Ages,8,30 November 2018,"Due to the sheer notion that animated movies just simply take longer to perfect than live-action films (most of the time), it should come as no surprise that some sequels arrive slightly later than expected. That being said, six years has been a pretty long gap for this Wreck-It Ralph sequel. Ralph Breaks the Internet has been advertised as an advertisement itself for every app that kids and adults use on their phones and laptops, and that has scared from the very first trailer, but it's much more than meets the eye. I don't believe this sequel is quite as good as the original (which is a hard task regardless), but the emotional core and overall entertainment is absolutely still present. This is a very good sequel that deserves to be seen.Sugar Rush's steering wheel has been destroyed and Vanellope's game is about to be unplugged. With the help of Ralph, they venture into the internet in hopes of finding the seller on eBay in order to buy a new one. This premise is really just a tool in order to showcase the internet in a film, but unlike the film The Emoji Movie, it's done tastefully. Going through emotional undertones about friendship and what it really means deep down, this is a film that explores new sides to these characters, but I felt that it didn't quite go as deep as the first, which is what made me love that one immediately. I didn't quite feel blown away by this one, but there's no denying that it's well-done nonetheless.As I mentioned, my biggest fear going into this film was that it would feel like an internet advertisement, and while it does serve the story, I have to admit it was a bit much at times. From Snapchat to Twitter and even down to exploiting Disney's entire catalogue of characters (in a good and enjoyable way), it felt as though the studio was trying to showcase everything great that they own. That being said, these sequences are actually a blast to watch, as it feels like you're in Disney World. It does serve the story and the final act of the movie has a great payoff that I think many viewers will get a kick out of. Personally, I just believe they could've saved some of the characters for a third instalment.The best portion of this movie is actually the addition of the new character Shank (voiced by Gal Gadot). Not that her character has much to do, but the game surrounding her character, along with the relationship she forms with Vanellope, honestly gave this movie a much-needed layer. I loved every aspect of when this film entered her game, Slaughter Race. This game pretty much shapes the course of the entire movie and I was pleasantly surprised by this. This movie has many aspects that could've made this sequel even better than the original, but I feel it was slightly too overstuffed with characters to be able to say that.In the end, Ralph Breaks the Internet is a very good follow-up to its predecessor, even though there's a little too much going on at times. Ralph and Vanellope each have new character arcs and obstacles to cross throughout the course of this film and that aspect along almost had me saying this is an improvement over the first, but I have a few issues with how crowded the movie felt to really let that sink in. Overall, this movie should absolutely please fans of the first who are looking for a nice emotional payoff, and the journey this movie takes you on is fantastic, so I can't complain too much. Ralph Breaks the Internet is a great sequel.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
88,Neptune165,this is just an advertisement rather than a film,3,19 October 2019,"I was shocked when i saw the huge amount of advertisement for the famous web sites eBay, YouTube, instagram, etc. I do not know how much eBay, Google or Facebook pay Disney, but it is awful to see commercials all through the film. Honestly, I didn't like the ending. Don't get me wrong, it's sad but it felt kind of out of place. So what about Vanellope's game? Aren't the players gonna wonder where Vanellope is? Sugar Rush wouldn't be the same without the character that's on the side of the console and what makes the game. I also didn't like how they changed Ralph's character. He went from being serious and emotional into a funny, I actually really didn't like this movie. I thought they did a total disservice to Ralph's character and were very hypocritical about the universe they created. The first one makes such a big deal about how bad it is to leave your own game. This one shrugs it off. It was way inferior to the original. My problem with this sequel is how it kind of contradicts the original's premise where ""you have to stick to the program"". I mean Vanellope can leave her game but Ralph can't? I loved the first film. It ranks as one of my top 10 animated movies, but the second one... I will never watch it again. Ralph was so dumbed down, it's sad. He literally never makes a good decision the whole film. It didn't land so well for me It was bad by any means. It was just slightly disappointing personally. There wasn't much development as the first one. There were multiple subplots that made the first one so engaging from beginning to end, while this one sort of had one plot line and it had a lot of lulls",Ralph Breaks the Internet
89,Carycomic,"Not bad on its own merits. But, definitely not as good as the first!",6,25 November 2018,"Intellectually, I understand the moral of the story: even the best of friends eventually go their separate ways, geographically. Though, the same doesn't have to hold true, emotionally, if the friendship is that strong.Even so, the lack of a clear-cut villain (or, at the very least, tyrannical authority figure) to root against made this feel more like a remake of INSIDE OUT. Or, even worse, a self-parody. Especially, the part where Sarah Silverman sings about her longing to be part of a much-greater racing environment than ""Sugar Rush"" provides! I know that Alan Menken et al. intended it to be just as serious as the more classic Disney songs (like ""I'm Wishing"" or ""Part of That World""). But, it didn't come across that way.On the other hand, I did get a few laughs out of the role reversal, where the Disney Princesses worked together to rescue Ralph while simultaneously giving him a make-over to boot. And that goes double for the five-second homage to Rick Astley!All in all, then? A pretty good way to spend a dreary Sunday afternoon in November with your wife and kids.

Disney did it again with the sequel to Wreck-It Ralph by improving on its predecessor. From the voice work to the tremendously creative and imaginative screenplay, this is a blast of a movie! With a story filled with incredibly funny yet ""realistic"" concepts of how the Internet works (the way they introduce the audience to pop-ups or search engines is hilarious and teaches kids how to behave online), the audience receives pure entertainment from the first to the last second.Ralph and Vanellope are amazing characters who carry an important message about friendship not only to kids but to adults as well. That's my main compliment to this movie: it's fun for kids (as almost every other animated film) and amazing for adults because not only it's exciting but its unique exploration of the Internet elevates pretty much every single scene.

94,MrDHWong,An enjoyable follow-up with just as much charm and likeability as the original,8,16 December 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is the sequel to 2012's Walt Disney Animation Studios film Wreck-It Ralph. Featuring the voices of John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman, it is an enjoyable follow-up with just as much charm and likeability as the original.Six years after the events of the first film, Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) and Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) have become best friends, often hopping from game to game together at the arcade. One day, the steering wheel for Vanellope's game Sugar Rush breaks and the arcade owner decides to unplug the system for good, leaving her homeless and with no other place to go. However, Ralph comes up with an idea to enter the newly installed Wi-Fi router to search the internet for a replacement steering wheel. With time running out before the Sugar Rush machine is taken away, Ralph and Vanellope set off on an adventure into the mysterious world wide web.While it still retains the same amount of fun and quirkiness as its predecessor, Ralph Breaks the Internet unfortunately does get bogged down with some annoyingly obvious plotholes. There are a number of unresolved and unexplained elements to the story that seemed to be brushed under the carpet at the film's conclusion. This is a shame because there are several great moments in this sequel that certainly make it worth watching if you enjoyed the original. I particularly enjoyed seeing how the film explored the friendship between Ralph and Vanellope and the ways that it fleshed out their characters in more detail. Both John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman were once again great in their respective roles and it was great fun seeing the back and forth dynamic with each other. Just like the first film, this one is heavy on fanservice and references to pop culture. Instead of just video games, there are several allusions to internet phenomena and memes, done in a much better way than a certain film about emojis. Overall, this is definitely worth seeing if you loved the first film, which I fortunately did.I rate it 7.5/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Would Facebook dominate? Would all the big names - Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Netflix - be represented, parodied? As it turns out, the internet was depicted as a space-age cityscape. It looks like Ebay bought the biggest sponsorship since they figured prominently in the story, though later, Disney got its play, mainly in the Disney Princess realm, so let me just say it now, this film seems really aimed at the daddy-daughter set. Google was represented as a high-rise office bldg where Ralph thought you got goggles. And I'm sure, much to Google's chagrin, ""The Search Bar"" was powered by fictional KnowsMore, and they used BuzzzTube vs YouTube (though the latter was referenced), so it looks like you only see a real-world representation if they paid the movie's production company for the ad-space, and the big names mentioned before were barely seen in the background if at all. Back to the story or rather the theme. As noted before, the key demographic for this is daddy-daughter and the prominent theme was the vicissitudes of kiddie friendship.

There are quite a few funny moments and I still enjoyed a lot of this film, but it definitely didn't capture me the way the first did. Add in the shoehorned virtue signaling and this sequel falls short of the original.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
98,CANpatbuck3664,Solid Sequel but the Original Wreck-It Ralph has the High Score,7,22 November 2018,"Just like all big budget Disney animated movies, Ralph Breaks the Internet has all the visual eye candy to spare. The world they bring you into looks great, it doesn't break completely new ground (we've seen a couple of animated movies try to create the world of the internet) but the world is bright and beautiful nonetheless. It never fails to deliver fun character design or update previous Disney favourites and bring them into this world through some funny cameos. Ralph even boasts a couple interesting action set pieces and a musical number that did enough different to catch me off guard. While I was let down by a couple of other aspects of the movie, its visual style was consistent and brought what I wanted to the table.So much of the comedy of the original Wreck-It Ralph came out of nostalgic references to older videogames but the jokes worked more often than not. The potential for comedic gold is much higher in this one, you've got the internet and the whole of pop culture as your character's playground. The problem that I had with this is that the movie doesn't have either the story (more on that later) or the funny dialogue to really keep the viewer's attention (outside of the kids who may just be entertained by the references and the pretty visuals). The movie does have its share of funny moments but the only laughs I got were when the screenwriters were lampooning Disney tropes with the various Disney princesses that cameo in the movie. I will begrudgingly say that those bits were very funny, but it also felt like Disney picking at low hanging fruit when they went back to that well over and over. I'm also a sucker for meta jokes so while there were plenty of times that the movie hit the wrong comedic notes, during the parts where Disney references their own catalogue of movies, I was giggling along with the rest of the audience.They were able to rope in a few more stars to do some of the voice work in Ralph and they're used appropriately to help bring the movie to life. John C. Reily is still charming and affable as Ralph even though the material is a little weaker this time around. Taraji P. Henson does a good job as Yesss and although their screen time is limited, bringing back Jane Lynch as Calhoun and Jack McBrayer as Felix were nice touches. Also returning is Alan Tudyk in a different role as KnowsMore and he's so good at voice acting that he could have done it in his sleep. I also enjoyed whoever played Spamly (its rumoured it was Bill Hader, but the role is uncredited) who is appropriately slimy but in a funny way. The standout for me was Sarah Silverman reprising her role as Vanellope who was great at getting across the varied emotions her character was feeling throughout the movie. The only performance that stood out to me in a negative way was Gal Gadot. I like her as an actress, but her voice doesn't have much inflection and while I'm sure she was trying, it partially led to her character coming across as a little flat for me. I also liked Jason Mantzoukas in his small part as Hey Nongman.Getting down to what I didn't like about the movie, the story of Ralph Breaks the Internet doesn't hold water, especially against the studio's recent output. The through line of saving Sugar Rush is dropped 2/3 of the way through the movie, it relies on the oldest storytelling cliche in the book (the overheard conversation taken out of context) as a driving force for the climax of the movie and even though the message about Ralph and Vanellope's friendship is inherently sweet, the movie bungles it through clunky dialogue and a nonsensical ending (I get its a kids movie, but how the movie describes the inner workings of the internet left me shaking my head). I would never say the original film's plot was a wonder of storytelling, but they did a much better job of building up the stakes and the drama in the story. This movie was admittedly more about being a light and breezy couple of hours at the movies, but it felt closer to being some various skits involving famous online properties or services on the Internet instead of there being a story to tell. I also thought the pacing was pretty poor. I was happy they got into the internet quicker than I had expected but once they get there, there are scenes where the movie drags badly. I heard more than a couple of people behind me complaining about how long the movie was and how it dragged in the middle when I was leaving the theatre.Maybe I'm going to come across as a nitpicker for this review, but I left the theatre disappointed after having seen this movie. It never fell into being a complete wreck (pun intended) but it didn't have the same creative spark the first one did. You've got all the visual tricks and your favourite returning characters to help the movie reach its target audience. But the slack pacing, the absence of the funny dialogue (outside of cameos and references) and the lack of a decent story brought the grade down considerably for Ralph Breaks the Internet. I might be the outlier here but between this and the original Wreck-It Ralph, its a clear victory for the original. I still think kids will get a kick out of this however and I liked it enough to grade it as a 6.5/10 rounding up to a 7/10.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
99,cliftonofun,Funny (and more),7,21 January 2019,"I gotta hand it to Disney here. They easily could have just made a cartoon sequel. The idea of Wreck It Ralph and Vanellope visiting the internet is comedy gold (and they mine that concept for all it is worth - all the one liners, references, self-mockery, and grown-up jokes you can imagine). That could have been the movie, and it probably would have made just as much cash. But they decided to make this a reflection on friendship and loss and how we grow apart. That's heavy stuff for a cartoon, but the choice to go there really works. Instead of a movie of internet jokes, you get a real story about semi-complex characters. Sometimes I take the kids to watch a movie and think, ""This was mostly for them."" All of us enjoyed this one.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
100,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,27 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...One of the advantages to waiting to see the original film right after a sequel is released is that I was able to watch both films back-to-back, like it was one big movie. And that's how it played out for me. I had a great time with ""Wreck-It Ralph"". ""Ralph Breaks The Internet"" takes what the first movie did and doubles it!After the adventures of the first movie, we find our two new friends, Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), hanging out together, as good friends do. Ralph has found happiness and satisfaction with his arcade life, but Vanellope is starting to get tired of the same old thing - over and over again. In an effort to bring some variety to her game, Ralph instead contributes to the game going out of order forcing them to venture out into the internet through a Wifi connection to try and, once again, save Sugar Rush. Through a new set of adventures, they learn more about each other as they battle to save the internet from melting down every server around the world.Both John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman were charming in their roles once more in this 2nd installment of the Ralph series (and I say this in the hopes that they continue to make more of these). We are taken on a visual and imaginative journey outside of the video arcade and out on to the world wide web - complete with all its little annoyances (pop-ups, viruses, search engines that suggest things you aren't looking for, and internet connectivity issues to name a few). The scenes with the Disney Princesses were classic also.This movie was even better than the first one and is a very high recommend. Very entertaining, endearing and emotional in parts.

103,statuskuo,It's Enough,6,27 November 2018,"Not to take anything away from its decidedly adorable scamp Vennelope, but this movie lingers way too long in virtual world whose message is about the toxicity of the internet whilst parading Disney princesses around like they are strong role models. Though behind the scenes, it does paint a rather grim tone when it comes to them being the saviors of a oaf in distress (Ralph).
It also desperately wants you to like the characters. Though very hard, since they are still guided by programming. For kids, not a big deal, for analytical adults you may walk away wondering why either of the two have any ""free will"" at all. It's also about friendship growing and parting. A universal theme prevails where we do have friends who prefer their lives in more fast paced, dangerous worlds. But that thrill doesn't exist for a simple sentence uttered by Vennelope minutes before which is that she can re-generate even in death. Whoops! Isn't the idea of thrills is that you CAN cheat death. Whatever. The movie is fun enough and if you don't start to dissect the vast world of Ralph and V immersed in the ""new tech"" all is well. However, it also draws light on the more darker sense that the internet isn't a nice place at all. Though this is new tech to old school video game den, everything seems too facile for old tech (Ralph and V). This goes against any logic considering they aren't meant for the internet world. Again, too much world to cram in for a kids movie.
I would not consider this movie ""fun."" Though it has moments of levity, it seems it doesn't necessarily nail what the underlining feel is. Which I suspect is they want to empower women into going out into the big bad world without having a strong man have to protect them. Which is a fine message, if it didn't take two over imaginative men to direct it.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

108,PyroSikTh,"Kinda Creepy, Mature Themes, and Jam-Packed Full of Internet Culture",8,4 December 2018,"Took my six year old to see this one for his birthday yesterday. It was the next film on the docket and the days just so happened to line up. Perfect. He seemed to really enjoy it, so I guess for a kids film that's it. Mission accomplished. Thank you for reading my in-depth review.Wreck-It Ralph 2, or Ralph Breaks the Internet as Disney seem intent on calling it, is one of those rare Disney sequels that earns a full budget and cinema rollout. After Wreck-It Ralph took us on a gaming nostalgia fuelled trip about loneliness, showing that bad guys aren't always bad guys, and characters finding their worth for who they are rather than trying to be someone else, what could a sequel have delivered us? What other gaming-related media is there rife with referencing potential? The internet! Let's be honest, it was a pretty natural route to take. So natural that I'm not even sure where a third one could go, if a third film were to materialise.Ralph Breaks the Internet also decides to toe the line with something a little more mature than the previous film, or any other Disney movie really. There's no villain to defeat in this movie. Instead it deals with emotions and relationships. Ralph and Vanellope share a friendship that borders pretty closely into father/daughter territory. He's happy with his lot, working as Wreck-It Ralph by day, and having fun in the arcade with Vanellope by night. She's not quite so happy though, finding her own game boring, and desiring some sort of way to freshen things up, so when a Wifi router gets plugged into the arcade, she jumps at the chance to explore and find something new.Ralph and Vanellope find themselves in the internet after Vanellope's arcade machine is broken and leaves all its inhabitants homeless. Their quest is to find the parts required to fix the machine in order to restore everything back to the way it was. It's a quest that takes them from the online auction-house of eBay, to the darker underbelly of dodgy clickbait ads, to an online racing game reminiscent of Twisted Metal, a riff on YouTube and memes, and a whole website packed full of Disney references. And it all ends with Ralph's insecurities laid bare.As with the first Wreck-It Ralph, the movie is packed with pop culture references and in-jokes, but carefully ensuring they never cloud over the main story between Ralph and Vanellope. My personal favourite scene in the whole movie is when Vanellope accidentally finds herself in a room full of Disney princesses, from Elsa and Anna from Frozen, to Mulan and Pocahontas, all the way back to Snow White and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, most of which even have their original voice actresses return. Many a joke is made from their individual ailments displayed in their films, to their common traits such as always being saved by a big strong man, being inspired by staring into a body of water (or a horse trough, as befits Mulan), or randomly breaking out into song. But there's also a few Star Wars and MCU references, as well as some more generic internet ones like the Screaming Goat, or the oversaturation of Unboxing videos and make-up tutorials on YouTube. They even cast Gal Gadot to play a character based on her Giselle from the Fast and Furious franchise. The in-jokes run deep.But Ralph Breaks the Internet also has a darker, scarier side. Some SPOILERS follow here, so go on at your own risk. The big climax, without a villain to defeat, creates one out of Ralph's insecurities, manifesting as a horde of needy Ralphs that act not unlike a horde of zombies (particularly when Ralph and Vanellope are holed up with them banging on the doors and windows). Eventually the army of Ralphs come together a bit like World War Z before going full Matrix Revolutions and forming a creepy, giant Ralph with empty eyes, and a constantly writhing appearance as the smaller Ralph copies keep moving around. Eurgh, it sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it. I thought for sure that my six year old would get terrible nightmares from this monstrosity. And truth be told, he did wake up in the night from a bad dream borne of this movie, but it surprised me that it was about something completely different, and the giant creepy Ralph hadn't actually phased him at all. Shows what I know.In all I think Ralph Breaks the Internet was absolutely a worthy sequel to make. It built on the original and took it to it's next natural steps, opening up the world but keeping the focus solely on Ralph and Vanellope, as it should be. I felt it also took quite a few risks by not giving us a hard villain, but instead focussing the story on something far more intimate and relatable. It's a movie about the hardships of life and the relationships we keep and how abusive they can be at times. Uber-Ralph was also just about the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in a Disney movie as well so, massive props for making him super creepy and not just chickening out. When you see the PG rating for this movie, definitely take it seriously this time, because this is a much more mature outing than what people may be ready for. I loved it though, and I give it a solid 8/10.P.S. Never thought I'd hear a Disney Princess singing about a Slaughter Race.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
109,sweidman-28016,Cute Movie But Disappointing Sequel,7,5 December 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet Review:Ralph Breaks the Internet is the sequel to Wreck-It Ralph, a Disney film that I adore. Ralph, John C. Riley, and Vanellope, Sarah Silverman, go to the internet in search to find a part for her game after it breaks. I was excited for this movie but also nervous because if looked basically like The Emoji Movie but better. That's exactly what we got. It was a cute movie but I was disappointed. The story lacked in areas. The main goal of the two characters is to find a way to get the part for the game. In order to get that part they have to do something that I thought was dumb and wasted a good 30 minutes of the movie. I was also disappointed in the climax. It brought some emotion but it could've been better. There were a lot of enjoyable scenes, especially the ones with the Disney princesses and a different racing game. I thought the voice acting was great once again like the previous film. The animation has gotten increasingly better by each movie. It was very colorful and detailed, especially the stuff at the internet. The score was one of the most memorable things from the first and it brought back the nostalgia. There's not much else I can say about it. It was enjoyable and cute but failed as a good sequel to me. Had the story been a little better and more interesting I would've loved it more. It was also a little long too. The story kind of bothered me a little but too because like The Emoji Movie, it just had a bunch of references to different media platforms and games. I'm not saying it was terrible just that it could've been better. It'll probably earn a Golden Globe and Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, though we all know Incredibles 2 will win.

110,JakeBrinkman,An entertaining advertisement,3,26 February 2019,"The original was filled with interesting aspects: nostalgic cameos, hilarious jokes, and very touching emotional scenes. Aside from the Disney princess scene, this film lacked all of that. That scene was truly a shining star in this film, but everything else really missed the mark.On humor, the film had a couple of solid laughs, but not nearly as many as the first movie. It actually didn't even attempt half as many jokes as the first film, and cutting the number of jokes so drastically actually made it feel like an entirely different film rather than a sequel.The emotional scenes were there, but they were small emotions compared to the original. The first movie had at least 2 true gut-wrenching scenes: a truly dream-shattering betrayal and a life-giving sacrifice. In the sequel, both of those heavy issues were replaced by one ""touching"" scene that was actually meant as a joke and another based on friends moving physically apart. Neither of these lived up to the seriousness of the first movie's issues, which again made this feel like a much more childish and different film rather than a sequel.Another notable difference is how, aside from one cool scene with Venellope, it was pointless for the video game characters to be there. There were no more video game jokes, and even Ralph as the titular character never once used his Wreck-It powers. Instead, the only thing they ever did with him is make at least 30 jokes simply about his large size. It really made the movie feel like there was no need for this to be a sequel rather than just a new standalone movie.FInally, there was very little nostalgia or even jokes about internet companies; it simply showed their icons, name-dropped, and then moved on. Perhaps this is all it takes for a nostalgic film, and maybe future viewers will find it nostalgic. However, present-day viewers will probably wonder how much each company paid to appear in the film rather than actually caring about the story line. It truly felt like a very long advertisement, and even the best advertisements are not something that most people care to watch more than once.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
111,Offworld_Colony,"An inoffensive, fun, but dramaless, mid-tier, post-Trump children's computer animation.",6,10 February 2020,"Overly animated and with an under-utilised premise and plenty of goofy kid's humour. The film ultimately raises too many questions to be seamless; why is his computer so old, the internet installed so late, and yet snapchat exists? Why is there some dirty product placement and then some Grand Theft Auto-style komedy brand replacements? Why doesn't ebay bidding work the way it does in real life? And so on.But I looked around to see my girlfriend grinning like a lunatic so I'm clearly too pedantic. Music, backgrounds, storyline and actors all seem on autopilot. The jokes are flat and the film has nothing clear to say and has a lame drama-less premise.It could have touched on immigration or microtransactions or esports, instead it tackles the internet as if it was made the year of The Lawnmower Man, making jokes about YouTube and pop-ups and viral videos and Twitter as actual birds as if this was all new.I like the title though.

116,Magow-Intermean,Ralph Breaks The Internet Review,9,22 March 2019,"When a broken steering wheel threatens the decommissioning of arcade racer Sugar Rush, lead character Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) and her best friend Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) head to the internet to try to secure a replacement via eBay. For a film about a fictional '80s arcade game character, Ralph Breaks The Internet sure raises some weighty issues. We're not ten minutes into the Wreck-It Ralph sequel when a broken video game cabinet creates the displacement of several hundred pixelated characters, all looking for a new home among Litwak Arcade's other coin-op machines. It's an interesting set-up - could this brightly coloured, sugar-coated cartoon be a modern-day fable, about to slyly educate its young audience about the world's current refugee crisis? Sadly, no. A couple of scenes later it's all but forgotten, the film far more interested in sending its two main characters - best friends Ralph (Reilly) and Vanellope (Silverman) - on a pop culture-crammed adventure to the internet. The internet - with its high-rise representations of the world's biggest online brands - represents the big city to Litwak Arcade's small town, and it's here Ralph Breaks The Internet finds both its central conflict and its message. There are lessons here but - with Vanellope enchanted by the possibilities suddenly open to her, and Ralph set on achieving their task then returning home to his usual routine - it's about the nature of friendship. Not a bad thing to learn, it's just a well-trodden set-up and, in the context of the film's opening, a missed opportunity. Still, it's an entertaining and rapidly paced adventure, which takes its heroes from eBay to a dangerous urban MMORPG, to YouTube substitute Buzztube, to (a sanitised version of) the dark web. They're hassled by pop-up advertisers, get distracted by clickbait and try their hands at loot hunting. The highlight, however, is Vanellope's trip to 'Oh My Disney' (a real website) - it's the funniest section of the film, especially her encounter with the studio's roster of Princesses, as the studio sends up its own creations but also fights back against the most common online criticisms of its female heroes. Sharp and knowing, it's also a triumph of animation and characterisation. For example, the original, hand-drawn Ariel (The Little Mermaid) was slightly more manic in her movements than, say, the stronger, more noble Pocahontas (Pocahontas), and that's mirrored here. If only all of Ralph Breaks The Internet was so inspired, instead of being mostly content to make funny but first-base jokes about social media culture. These characters have lived in isolation at the arcade - wouldn't their escape leave them faced with questions about the nature of their being as they discover thousands of other similarly segregated versions of themselves exist? It's not the case that its target audience couldn't handle it - Toy Story was smart enough to tackle such existential crises, and that was over 20 years ago. But then, that's the difference between an enduring masterpiece and something that just achieves being funny but forgettable. This is resolutely the latter.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
117,Mike_Devine,"Not dial-up, but not fiber optic, either",6,20 July 2019,"Six years after first gracing the big screen, Wreck-it Ralph returns for a big adventure on the worldwide web for 'Ralph Breaks the Internet.' While it's another sequel and cash grab for the mouse house, it's able to stand on its own.We get to see the same cast of videogame greats from the original, whether it's Fix-it Felix (Jack McBrayer), Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) or Ralph himself (John C. Reilly), as well as a number of newbs from the net like Taraji P. Henson's Yesss, Alan Tudyk's KnowsMore and Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot's badass racer Shank. As you can imagine, the majority of the film takes place within the network fibers of the internet, which is a big, huge expanse of anything you could ever expect a movie about the internet could be (with cameos from nearly every big online brand imaginable).As for the story, it's average at best. For an animated film, it makes sense to be simple and formulaic, given the target audience, but the important thing is that there are plenty of easter eggs and references to things that are geared toward adults, as well. Perhaps the highlight of 'Ralph' is the Disney princess scene, which brought together all of the original voice talents to make the scene come alive - this has nostalgia written all over it. But where 'Ralph' falters a bit is how it really tries to fit too much into its runtime. Sure, this is to be expected given all that's going on online, but it's a shame things couldn't have been more confined.It's not a classic, but 'Ralph Breaks the Internet' is still a fun, wild ride that's worth taking for anyone who spends too much of their time online (which is probably most of us).",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The character growth we didn't need, even further flourishing of a relationship that isn't really that interesting or liked and a finale that is boring and expected.I'd give it a 4 or less, but all the princess scenes were simply on point, and it makes me think this movie was simply an excuse to put all those little ideas on film (come one, that bat-transition was so out of place, but BOY am I glad they put it in).

121,kgprophet,Not a Straight Sequel but a New Adventure,6,4 December 2018,"My reaction to the first Wreck-It Ralph film was that it was a fun variation on the ""Toy Story"" theme, where game characters become self-aware. I also thought the casting of John C. Reilly was great. Wisely, the follow-up to the first film is not a typical sequel, where they follow the same formula and explore the same arcade games. This is a new story, new characters (except for Ralph and Vanellope), and a new world. There is a relatively a good balance of action and character development, perhaps at the cost of humour. There are a steady number of gags, but for me only a few of them stuck.The primary macguffin is soon sidelined as other temptations of the internet steer our main characters elsewhere. The 'world' of the internet is fun to explore, such as the character who mans the search bar. As our protagonist starts to describe what he is searching for, the man begins to rifle through possible items Ralph is about to ask for. It is a funny take on the annoying 'Autofill' when your are typing in a search box. This Disney film also likes to take a chance and throw some snark at Disney, like the stereotypical Princess characters. Also explored are the dark parts of the internet, with a shady character befriending our heroes with a click bait ad.There were enough clever ideas to cover over the lack of real funny gags (the best was Ralph doing his interpretation of viral video star Bob Ross). The story is short and tight enough that it doesn't overstay it's welcome. It does not rise to the level of a good Pixar film, but it is competently put together enough to be a worthy second outing of the Wreck-It Ralph character.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
122,jamiedarlow-37510,A pretty sweet sequel that holds the same emotional heft as the original,8,29 February 2020,"Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) are living in harmony in their respective video games; as much as they enjoy it, Vanellope feels she's ready for something new and a different routine. One day her game breaks in the arcade and is in danger of being shut down. With the internet being a brand new inclusion into the arcade, both our heros hike their way into the internet and search for the replacement controller that will save Sugar Rush! What impressed me about this one is that it managed to hold all of what made the first one so special; the core friendship between the two characters is just so sweet and lovely and it really projects on screen. The animation is superb as always; some great visual gags and fun with the concept of exploring the internet. There are certain sequences that are just pure joy; a particular section with Vanellope conversing with the Disney princesses is fantastic and reinvents the princesses in a very fun way! A musical sequence in the world of Slaughter Race is amazing! I thought the message of this film was genuinely moving; it's ultimately an exploration of friendship and how insecurity can badly affect relationships. An exciting family film that has a good message to children and adults alike",Ralph Breaks the Internet
123,Puroo,"Good movie, bad sequel",9,24 June 2021,"I really liked Wreck-It Ralph back when I saw it. Ever since then I had been waiting for a sequel. Somehow I had a hunch that one will be made. And here it was: Ralph Breaks the Internet. I was expecting it to be something about gaming again but since it was more inclined towards the internet instead of gaming and also seemed to be more targeted towards children than the OG fans, I decided to skip it. Then 2 years ago I suddenly decided to watch it and now I really like it. Of course it's not as good as the original, but that could be said about any Disney movie.Ralph Breaks the Internet is set after the events of Wreck-It Ralph, except that Felix is divorced and Ralph continues to hang around with everyone else outside the games, until the point where he pulls a complete Disney character and ends up breaking Sugar Rush arcade's steering wheel. Now Ralph and Vanellope are out to get the steering wheel from eBay to stop the arcade game from being thrown out. It's what The Emoji Movie could have been like if it wasn't bad.Disney movies always have good animations, those which can make anyone go nostalgic. And here there are several Disney characters shown on the internet in 3D like the Disney princesses (they gave my little one a rush; if you know what I mean XD), MCU characters, Star Wars etc. So in case you wanted to know what they'd look like as 3D animated characters, this is the best place you can see them. The sense of humour was also very good. Character development, however, is the bad part. It was only driven by ""Ralph didn't want to lose Vanellope"". The story isn't that good either; it's plagued with product placement. Plus there are many popular game characters like Sonic (yay!), Eggman, Bowser, Pac-Man ghosts etc.I'd have been happier if the sequel to Wreck-It Ralph was about gaming more instead of the internet, since that's the community among whom the prequel liked. It's a good movie, just not a good sequel. Let's hope the third movie gets back to the roots, since this looked more like a PSA for kids on how to use the internet.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
124,shawneofthedead,"Not as utterly wonderful as the first film, but the big, beating heart embedded in this story is a true delight.",8,13 December 2018,"THE LOW-DOWN: Ralph Breaks The Internet is the sequel to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph, one of Disney's most inventive and beloved films. The first movie mined comic gold from nostalgia, bringing to life a host of video-game favourites from the '80s and '90s. This new film addresses the technology we have today: Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) and Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) head into the crazy wilderness of the Internet in a bid to save her game from being unplugged for good.THE GOOD: The film smartly keeps its emotional focus on the wonderful friendship between Ralph and Vanellope, and is all the better for it. There's a great deal of wonderful comedy in Ralph's desperate efforts to save Vanellope (who, as it turns out, might not want to be saved anymore) - including going viral. Ralph Breaks The Internet is unexpectedly mature in reminding audiences about the value of unconditional love between friends - that your friends can make you better, smarter, and more loving than you ever thought possible. You might find yourself sobbing at the grief and the growth that both Ralph and Vanellope experience as their friendship deepens.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Much of the film's commentary on the social-media age in which we love works quite well, from over-eager search engine Knowsmore (Alan Tudyk) to sassy algorithm queen Yesss (Taraji P. Henson). But why are some well-known elements of the Internet given new names (Buzzfeed and YouTube merged into BuzzTube, for instance), while others aren't? It ends up feeling like product placement - for eBay, in particular. Also, the sub-plots for new character Shank (Gal Gadot), as well as old favourites Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) and Calhoun (Jane Lynch), work, but also feel somewhat inconsequential.KNOCKOUT MOMENT: The Disney Princesses win the Internet! This is definitely product placement but it works beautifully because it's done with so much tongue-in-cheek affection for the entire Disney Princess franchise. The first Wreck-It Ralph film introduced Vanellope as the Mouse House's most intriguing princess yet - full of spunk, fire and a refusal to abide by the usual princessy tropes - but didn't really do much with it. Here, Disney deconstructs itself: gifting Vanellope with her own 'I want' princess song, while giving its other princesses (from Elsa and Anna to Mulan, Belle, Snow White and more) the chance to comment (and act) on the not-always-very-feminist stories of which they were a part.WATCH OUT FOR: The easter eggs in the credits - the one at the very end is pure genius.RECOMMENDED? Absolutely. It's not as utterly wonderful as the first film - the script is a little clunkier and the nostalgia factor replaced with a world-wide-web-weary cynicism. But the big, beating heart embedded in this story is a true delight. The Princesses alone will be worth the price of your ticket.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
125,renegadeviking-271-528568,Ralph Breaks the Internet,7,4 February 2020,"There has already been some fan speculation over whether this film marks the end of Disney's so-called ""New Revival"" era that we're currently in, but it's a little too soon to tell. Ralph Breaks the Internet is the first fully computer-animated sequel in the canon, but it's the fourth sequel overall following The Rescuers Down Under (1990), Fantasia 2000 (1999) and Winnie the Pooh (2011) and will soon be followed by the fifth, Frozen 2. Given the way these latter two have been rushed into production within the same decade of the releases of the original films, it was certainly great to hear recently that Pixar, at least, has no plans for any more sequels in the immediate future. Let's just hope Disney's Feature Animation branch follows suit.I must admit, I'm cautiously optimistic about Frozen 2 based on the one teaser trailer we've had so far; then again, my expectations were lower anyway, since I'm one of those oddballs who wasn't blown away by the first one. Toy Story 4 is another matter entirely, as I'm much more invested in that franchise and the trailers aren't nearly so promising, but I still won't judge it until I've actually seen it next month. It's just that when I look at films like Ralph Breaks the Internet, I'm filled with a sense of panic at the thought of how badly wrong these sequels could go...Characters and Vocal PerformancesI've talked before about Disney films being overcrowded, but nowhere has that problem been anywhere near as noticeable as it is here - as you can see above, there are an astonishing seventy-seven named speaking roles in this film, many of whom get only a line or two of dialogue. The army of characters is mostly down to the film being a massive crossover project, intended to showcase the many, many, MANY properties which now fall under the Disney umbrella after their buyouts of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Twentieth Century Fox. Some of the cameos work better than others, but for the sake of space I'm not going to talk about every last one of them or we'll be here for weeks; this discussion will be focused on the characters who actually play some role in the plot.
The original Wreck-It Ralph was a compelling and relatable character, because he started out as a victim of discrimination and went through a great deal of personal growth - by the end of his story, he learned to accept himself for who he was and outgrew his selfish insecurities to become a true friend to Vanellope. I'll leave you to read my review of the first film for a fuller account of Ralph, but for now, all I can do is lament the horrific butchering of his character that this sequel commits.This is a textbook example of a process known as ""Flanderization,"" whereby the writers zero in on a particular trait of a character and exaggerate it until it consumes their entire personality, leaving them as a shallow shell of their former selves. In this case, Ralph's earlier naïveté has been ramped up to eleven and he is now utterly stupid, a clumsy, blundering fool who seems to mess up everything he gets involved in. He was always heavy-handed (no pun intended) and rather tactless, but he was not this needy and pathetic, especially not by the end of the first film - where's the strong, secure and self-sacrificing Ralph of yesteryear?Granted, it's somewhat plausible that he would be a bit clingy given his lonely past, but the sheer stupidity he exhibits has nothing to do with that. It's just a cheap and lazy way to try and draw some laughs from the crowd, even though the audience for the original film have all matured and will thus be looking for more nuanced comedy, if anything. Ralph in this incarnation is little more than a child, incapable of understanding anyone else's feelings and selfishly trying to force everything to go his way like a spoilt brat. The tender-hearted ""bad guy"" of the original has been replaced by a possessive doofus, and while he does go through some development over the course of this film, his portrayal still doesn't feel true to the character - especially surprising given that most of the same writers were involved with both films.Ralph concocts plan with SpamleyRalph Breaks the Internet is set six years after the last film and he and Vanellope's lives have settled into a comfortable pattern, with each performing their duties in their respective games before hanging out together all night in other ones around the arcade. The conflict of the story is that Vanellope is growing bored of this routine and longs for a new challenge, whereas Ralph is perfectly content with things the way they are and is frightened of change (perhaps a nod to his age, as he must now be well over thirty years old).While it's clear he does care for Vanellope and does his best to make her happy early on, for instance by creating a new track in ""Sugar Rush,"" he also tends not to listen to her properly and comes uncomfortably close to viewing her as his property. In one early scene just after Vanellope's game has been damaged, she opens up to Ralph about feeling a new lack of purpose when she's not able to race and questions her identity without it; Ralph's response is to try to define her as his ""best friend"" and she (quite rightly) points out that this is not enough, but he's offended by this and whines to Tapper about it later that night. Since he now views Vanellope as the centre of his whole life, he expects her to feel the same way about him and is genuinely shocked at the idea that she might have higher aspirations than simply being his sidekick.Ralph complains to TapperAre we supposed to feel sorry for him here? I get that he has spent a lot of his life with no friends, but the previous version of Ralph was still not this emotionally dependent; these early scenes simply make him appear selfish and unlikable, suggesting a failure of execution on the part of the writers. I think I get the angle they were going for, but he just doesn't come across sympathetically here. Still, I will give the film credit for calling Ralph out on his insecurities; it might not follow on properly from his earlier arc, but at least he does eventually get the message and makes a change. In that sense, at least, Ralph's portrayal is more successful than Vanellope's... but we'll get to her shortly.After Vanellope's game is broken, Ralph does set out on the trip to the internet with her to find the required part to fix it, which felt more like something the old Ralph would do. While he doesn't understand her desire to keep ""working"" in her game when he'd much rather laze around all day, he accepts that fixing ""Sugar Rush"" will make her happy and so works hard throughout the film to help her get the part - that's admirable.What's less admirable is his jealousy after Vanellope takes a shine to a cool racer character, Shank, who they meet in a modern online videogame. I understand him being afraid of losing Vanellope to someone else, but the lengths he goes to trying to keep her and Shank apart are ludicrous; in fact, him sending Vanellope to OhMyDisney.com to keep her out of the gaming district is what prompts her realisation that she'd rather stay in ""Slaughter Race"". Now, granted, Vanellope doesn't handle this well, neglecting to tell Ralph her intentions and simply leaving him in the dark until he begins to panic, but even this is because she's afraid he'll overreact to the news - and he does, proving her right.You see my problem with the writing here: Ralph's insecurities are so bad in this film that they make Vanellope reluctant to trust him with important information, but what's worse is that her reluctance is justified because his later actions do indeed prove disastrous. Once he does find out that she plans to leave the arcade, he concocts a hasty plan to infect ""Slaughter Race"" with a virus to ""make the cars go slow"" and turn Vanellope off the game, but this winds up endangering her life when the virus copies.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
126,renegadeviking-271-528568,Ralph Breaks the Internet,7,5 February 2020,"Like most films I go to see at the cinema, I at least want to like them. I feel somehow cheated paying for something I didn't get any enjoyment out of. Sadly Ralph Breaks the Internet was one of those rare cases.Wreck it Ralph is one of my favourite Disney films to come out in the past decade, it was a story that felt completely fresh for the animation studio, focusing on the bad guy, a father/daughter-like relationship and young girls with ambition. It was beautifully animated, had some genuinely funny moments. It was a cohesive film that knew exactly what it wanted to achieve.The second film, however, was the polar opposite. Apparently, in this day an age the only logical way to go with the story was 'make it about the internet' it's the best way to stay 'current' and, you know it could have worked. It didn't and consequently, we are left with the mess that is Ralph Breaks the Internet.Like I said, the internet as a new playground for the characters is an obvious route to go down, and it is enjoyable in parts the design of how certain apps would look if we were able to walk around them is innovative and fun to see. I was a particular fan of Instagram and Pinterest. The overall design of the internet was pretty obvious and all I could think about was a cross between the city planet of Coruscant in Star Wars and the Emoji Movie. I guess it worked.As ever, visually, it was well done, but I don't think that watching Coco the night before was a good decision because all I could think about was how beautiful it was in comparison. But even in the first Wreck it Ralph, there is that absolutely stunning moment at the end with the Mentos/Coca-Cola volcano sequence. It was so visually striking, although the animation was top notch in Ralph Breaks the Internet, nothing wowed me.I am all for things being self-aware. Deadpool pulls it off perfectly. Disney has had its moments. Ralph Breaks the Internet takes it to a new level. A level that sucks all of the humour out and just feels awkward. We all know the Disney Princess scene, it has been all over the internet, I will admit it was part of the film I was most looking forward to, because they all looked so great, especially in their loungewear. It was just so cool! But then the scene came around and I was cringing throughout. I couldn't help but think how much Disney, this billion dollar empire, are attempting to 'make fun of themselves' to make more money.It just feels so weird and embarrassing. The princess scene was just a carbon copy of a Tumblr post that points out how 'problematic' Disney princesses are. And really shoves the whole 'our princesses are now saving themselves thing' down our throats. The thing is, we don't need to be told, we can see this very clearly watching the films. I hate that Disney thinks that they need some kind of award for writing powerful female characters. The thing is, I can't help but feeling like I am being overly cynical I should have loved this, I couldn't help but feel like I had fallen for their trick with absolutely no pay off as the writing was lazy. It was a case of 'lets put these beloved Disney characters in this film and not really do anything interesting with them because their very presence will be enough'.But it wasn't just the princess thing. Disney's whole concept of the internet felt like parents who think they understand the internet because of their kids. It was filled with cat videos, Fortnite references and hot chilli tasting videos. Yes, this is what the internet is....The big meaningful message that was being conveyed, again felt like it was Disney fishing for pats on the back for being 'progressive'. The insecure and possessive man on the internet who behaves problematically towards a girl, ultimately leading in disaster. It was weird and messy not at all like the first film, which I thought built Ralph and Venellope's relationship wonderfully.What I will say is that Shank (Gal Gadot) is such an amazing character, and was shamefully not explored as a character as much as I would have liked. One of my favourite scenes in the film was a car chase involving her and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) it was so much fun, and I loved seeing two female characters in a car chase together, which resulted in a mutual respect, rather than a silly rivalry. It was so good, I wanted more of this writing, not the silliness that followed!The film was really trying to do too many things at once. It was, for me a mess and couldn't even wish to match the first film and it is such a huge shame.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

128,kermitkid,Disney's Lego Movie,9,31 March 2020,"If ""Incredibles 2'' beats this for Best Animated Film at the Oscars next year, I'm going to be so ticked! I'd say not only is this one of the best animated films of 2018, it's one of the best films of 2018, period. The plot was not predictable, there were lots of in-jokes and Easter Eggs. This is what ""The Emoji Movie"" wishes it could be. The film doesn't have much going for it in terms of plot, the plot is pretty simple, but I don't think that was the point of the movie. I think this was supposed to be more ""Let's see how many jokes we can make in 100 minutes."" Do all the jokes work? No. Some of them actually fall really flat, and there were some elements I think could have been expanded more. This is more akin to ""Lego"" movies than anything else. The scenes with the Disney princesses being exaggerated parodies of themselves is worth the price of admission alone. (It actually makes me want a Disney Princess ""Avengers"" type movie.) And there are plenty of other jokes for Marvel and Star Wars. This is probably the hardest I've laughed at a movie this year. It's the rare sequel that in some ways is slightly better than the original.

129,themadmovieman,An absolutely delightful sequel full of imagination and heart,8,1 December 2018,"I utterly adored Wreck-It Ralph, so to have a sequel that matches and often even surpasses the original is absolutely brilliant, retaining the same beautifully heartfelt atmosphere that goes hand in hand with an immensely imaginative and vibrant world created before your eyes. In its premise, Ralph Breaks The Internet may occasionally resemble other recent films like The Emoji Movie and The Lego Movie, but it still hits pretty much every beat spot on, with gorgeous animation, a wonderful story, and endlessly hilarious comedy from start to finish.There's so much about this film that makes it such a wonderful watch, and I was absolutely beaming right the way through, not least because of the film's beautiful and stunningly imaginative story and worlds.The first film was a brilliant throwback to all things retro gaming, ingeniously crafting a riveting and equally delightful world inside a small arcade, but this sequel takes things to the next level, taking on the vastness of the Internet and somehow creating a pitch-perfect portrayal of pretty much everything that goes into the web that's both hugely entertaining and just as wonderful to look at.The Emoji Movie was a little soulless in its metaphorical portrayal of the Internet, so Ralph Breaks The Internet is instead a lot more reminiscent of how Pixar's Inside Out so ingeniously created a magical world inside a little girl's head. It's vibrant, colourful, and full of endless possibilities, and as we follow Ralph and Vanellope as they break out from their day-to-day life at the arcade into such a vivid world, the film's portrayal of the Internet as a physical space becomes more and more awe-inspiring.And again much like Inside Out, Ralph Breaks The Internet uses all manner of small details and in-jokes about the online world to bring the setting to life - with personified pop-ups, braindead, drone-like internet users, and even a dive into the dark web, the film is so jam-packed with references and jokes about life online that you'll surely be laughing non-stop.There is an argument that some of the film's product placement (namely that of eBay) is a little heavy-handed, and while it does serve to make the Internet setting all the more relatable, it is occasionally somewhat of a distraction when you're trying to fall into this magical world.On the other hand, the film features a genius sequence in its middle act that sees Vanellope end up in what is effectively Disney World online, meeting all manner of characters from Stormtroopers to Winnie The Pooh and all of the Disney Princesses. Again, it may seem a little heavy-handed, but what the film does so brilliantly throughout is continue to roll back all of the Disney clichés you know and love, with a wonderfully self-aware sense of humour throughout that sees the screenplay take aim at everything traditional Disney, and have a whole lot of fun while doing it.In that, Ralph Breaks The Internet is an absolute riot from start to finish, and I'd probably posit it as Disney's funniest film ever, beating out Wreck-It Ralph to the top spot.But as well as being so hilarious, this film is also an immensely heartwarming and delightful watch throughout, as the story still retains that old Disney magic, even when it's trying to break out and make fun of the traditional formula as much as possible.While I can't say that it packs quite the emotional punch of the first film (which had me in floods of tears), it's a movie that's so full of heart throughout, and with a story that both delves into the real world as we know it, while still keeping a good bit of fairytale innocence, I couldn't help but have the biggest smile across my face from beginning to end, as Ralph Breaks The Internet proves one of the most delightful films of the year.Overall, then, I loved Ralph Breaks The Internet to bits. Much likes its predecessor, it's a film that's full of life, imagination and heart at every moment, but as it takes its setting onto a much bigger scale, it also steps up its vivid portrayal of the virtual world in a way that few other films have ever been able to match. On top of that, it's an immensely funny film, and one that features a brilliantly-written screenplay with some hilarious self-deprecating humour, providing two hours of undeniably wonderful Disney fun.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
130,adampkalb,"Well, well, well. It looks like Wreck-it-Ralph found a way to have better execution of The Emoji Movie's plot of traveling through product placements.",10,1 December 2018,"While there are a lot of internet product placements in the first hour (of 1 hour and 52 minutes), it doesn't bring down the plot in any way and there are reasons for the products of eBay and Buzztube and Pinterest to be placed. It's kind of strange that it's less about video games than the first Wreck-it-Ralph (like Cars 2 with cars), but Vanellope and Ralph have a reason to go into the internet since they have to get a new steering wheel for the Sugar Rush game. Ralph Breaks the Internet is everything I expected it to be and more: the admirable version of the Animated Atrocities films Cars 2 and The Emoji Movie (which are, by coincidence, 100 atrocity video numbers apart). Not to mention that the same conflict of interest that didn't work in Mulan 2, worked here in Wreck-It Ralph 2 for reasons you'll find out if you watched both sequels, which have a 14-year gap between 2004 and 2018 like the first 2 Incredibles movies. I hope Ralph Breaks the Internet will be Mr. Enter's next Admirable Animations film in 3 years since Meet the Robinsons, because he could really use another movie in Admirable Animations after The Emoji Movie was in Animated Atrocities. Sure, it was a risk to teach a moral about letting your friends to want to do something different than you which would be counterintuitive in the world of a film where it's a danger to leave your game for another because you can't regenerate if you die outside of your own game and some would think you are going Turbo, but Enter's video about The Animation Genre taught me a thing or two about taking risks, and what risks work and what risks don't work.The really admirable parts of this film are Ralph's emotional conflict with Vanellope wanting to leave Litwak's arcade for Slaughter Race since it has gotten too predictable and easy for her after 6 years, and the Disney princesses address the problems and cliches with their own stories, which this film manages to make work with Wreck-it-Ralph's own Princess Vanellope as she sings her emotional song, and the princesses play a very important part in the climax. It was clear that the film is so good that it doesn't want to end so soon, as there are 12 minutes of credits and 2 additional scenes within the credits. Not bad for the first Disney sequel for 2 decades to be released in theaters. It was way more impressive than The Rescuers Down Under. Who would have guessed we would hear Sarah Silverman and Gal Gadot sing together? They're a surprisingly good duet. I doubt Ralph Breaks the Internet will quickly become outdated in 10+ years. Since Amazon, eBay, Fandango, Gmail, Google, Imdb, Twitter and YouTube have been around for more than 10 years before appearing in this movie, they will likely still be active for another 10 years after this movie. Even if I'm wrong and Ralph Breaks the Internet doesn't age well by the trends of 2018, the moral of the story that your friends should be allowed to want something different than you will be a lesson for all ages, for the ages. Here is hoping Wreck-it Ralph and Ralph Breaks the Internet stand the test of time and become classics in the future. I recommend you watch this movie so Disney will not have advertised their entire Oh My Disney website in the movie theaters for nothing. I'll get to work on ideas for Wreck-it Ralph 3: The Spinoff. It would be about a Fix-it Felix spinoff game where Wreck-it Ralph is the hero. I promise that Ralph Breaks the Internet is every bit as good as the first Wreck-it Ralph, but even greater. I swear to Disney, it is twice the movie Wreck-it Ralph was.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
131,ilovefoodcoma,Cute animation movie,8,31 December 2018,"The Story: Such a cute movie to watch. Seeing all the social media that I am using daily in this movie and I could totally relate to it! They use different kind of humor to showcase the internet we use nowadays. It is entertaining but didn't give me that much ""awwww"" moments.The Animation: It is good but not the best animation in Disney movies.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
132,patriciogl10,A very fun animated film!,7,5 November 2019,"This film presents a highly interesting visual artwork, featuring an inspiring concept of how the internet functions without the system mechanics and the dullness of technical specifics but instead with fun animated characters walking, travelling through and interacting with everything referring to the Internet at their reach. Big domains are represented as malls, search engines as libraries; which is fun to see, because you sort of expect it but still aren't quite sure how is going to be carried out visually.Apparently this film received much underserved hatred; in my opinion the first half is a lot of fun, and the second includes a bit more drama without necessarily hurting the fun of it. It's a decent film overall, it displays a wonderful scenery of the internet as Disney imagines and features many enjoyable references which you'll be pleased to understand.It's no secret that its predecessor ranks much higher than Ralph Breaks the Internet, but it is by no means a bad film. Don't listen to the unflattering reviews and make up your own mind.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
133,pranayjalvi,The sequel pleases us as well,9,21 November 2018,Ralph Breaks the Internet gets a thumbs up from the critics as well as audiences which includes me. With a colourful and vibrant effects and a technical storyline the sequel is as better as its predecessor was.

134,austin0731,A fun ride through the internet,7,28 December 2018,Ralph breaks the internet is a fun ride with an interesting look at internet culture. Building on the success of the first film the sequel to Wreck it Ralph discusses issues of friendship and looks at the viral video culture of the internet in a very interesting way. Ralph Breaks the internet manages to not only take audiences on a fun ride but also present larger ideas. Personally I feel that the sequel is aimed more towards a younger demographic group with lesser references to classic arcade games and more focus on the internet. Nonetheless a worthy sequel to Wreck it Ralph.,Ralph Breaks the Internet
135,FelipeCarrillo,"Cyber-""Inside Out"" meets ""Once Upon A Deadpool"" PG-13 meta-humor",7,20 February 2019,"Pixar Animation Studios, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, bursting with ambition, won't apparently ever fail at sequels. ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Toy Story 3"" were progressively more poignant and iconic than each predecessor; ""Incredibles 2"" updated its themes always keeping untouched its spirit and heart; ""Finding Dory"" ended up being an overly cheerful work but quality-lower than the 2003 underwater adventure classic; ""Cars 2"" was openly a kind-of bump in the road, yet deep down, it was an over-the-top spy flick; ""Cars 3"" picked up a visual simplicity and a digestible narrative which worked better; ""Monsters University,"" far from reaching the original, was a somewhat sinister but widely friendly buddy-movie that entertained worldwide audiences with iconic characters and interesting settings; under the circumstances, ""Toy Story 4"" and ""Frozen 2"" - reference titles - are in the making with an eye to being released in the next few years, two pics with billion-dollar siblings and feasible awards and nominations.""Ralph Breaks the Internet,"" the latest animated wonder, is a flat-out improvement over the original, adhering itself to new technologies without losing sight of its two central figures, unfolding another riveting, clever family-friendly journey that commits itself to compete head-to-head against the most acclaimed movies of its subsidiary; it doesn't win the day, but offered something Pixar has overlooked all this time.Don't get confused, this second part does transcend all-time great arcade game's limits to venture into this binary world, developing a refreshing representation of the mechanisms and processes taking place in our everyday devices. This setting's side goal is to raise a human lesson on friendship and sacrifice, to be happy not harming the happiness of those you love, and in that sense, we stumbled upon a fairly mature and grounded resolution, like the ""Toy Story 3"" kind, which enriches the scope. It also disposes of knotty storylines by not adding up new protagonists, Ralph and Vanellope remain the leading characters, although it does incorporate supporting roles that hilarious look and behave like their voice actors such as Gal Gadot, Taraji P. Henson or Alan Tudyk; however, two key agents from the first story lose importance this time: Felix Jr. and Sergeant Calhoun; taking into account the stripped-down plot the writers want to maintain all along, this is the healthiest decision.Storytelling-wise, Disney will always succeed on his moral and ethical task, but for that, it'll always need the corresponding tear-jerking scene, this time pretty close to that devastating farewell for the pink cotton candy nougat-filled elephant-cat-dolphin hybrid from ""Inside Out,"" they are hands down geniuses achieving it. But the greatest improvement doesn't come from right there.Much as Spielberg's ""Ready Player One,"" ""Wreck-It Ralph"" meant a glowing, nostalgia-fueled journey through the childhood of many adults bolstered by some of the most beloved game characters; now, it's fantastic and a kind-of weird to know that this sequel will mean, several years from now, the same nostalgia-packed journey for us, a new generation. The writing team understands that most of us stopped going to fun-breathing 80's arcade game rooms a long time ago in the face of the comfort and easily accessible high-tech gaming consoles and, of course, the all-powerful Internet; so as things stand, they decided to place their two protagonists into the WI-FI cosmos in as simple as fanciful way. First of all, the story, immersive and efficient in its purposes, is simply interesting, symbolizing it as a dark tunnel, a world where the most beautiful and horrific things live side by side. As soon as our giant-fisted destroyer and hyperactive racing girl manage to get in - in a sensational way, by the way, - wonderful landscapes unfold before our eyes and we beg for seeing on screen the representation of one of our favorite sites, because inherently we're the Internet generation and therefore will love this setting made up by clicks, 'likes' and 'dislikes.'Despite the thousands of screen-time-eager companies, the film wisely does not overstuff its compositions, of course, there's enough product placement to know this is more than a family-friendly film, but after its first act, it mostly centers on storytelling. The Internet takes the form of a sunnier ""Blade Runner"" metropolis, where millions of avatars restlessly go and come. The many high-rises and high-tech buildings that show the companies' logos off deserve more than one viewing in order to catch the myriad easter-eggs all around the footage. YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Internet Movie Database, AlloCiné, and Instagram are some of the sites spotted in broad daylight, but the plot settles in BuzzTube - a hybrid of both companies - a multiplayer online game called Slaughter Race, eBay and Google for the cinematic finale.Filmmaking-wise, comparisons are obnoxious and in some instances needless, and even so, it's quite obvious to draw parallels between this buddy-comedy and the creative structure of the Pete Docter y Ronnie Del Carmen-directed magnum opus ""Inside Out."" Switching Riley's five emotions and behaviors for pop-ups, web sites, links and search engines, the depictions here are magnificent, especially the extremely sinister, somewhat disturbing dark web and its creepy, ugly-looking apothecary overlord. Some cybernetic, internet-related processes also got fantastic representations, trying to make easy to understand the universe of algorithms an e-mail or a Google search involve; thus, posting a video, getting a ""like,"" writing a comment and closing specious ads become an imaginative ride.Owning the rights of the most known companies nowadays is a task largely impossible, consequently, big missing brand-names will come up if you realize them automatically; hence, the quickest and easiest move was to get into its own terrains, and indeed, so it was. Catching a glimpse of Star Wars' Stormtroopers, Marvel's Baby Groot, Stan Lee and the classic Disney princesses is beyond price, because of this the film is unique in how succeeds on weaving its own plot threads re-visiting officially characters from other films for the very first time. The most unexpectedly brilliant sequence of the movie happens to be killingly funny and oddly self-parodic; watching how they interact with each other and even amend one of the oldest, most rooted Disney princess rules in order to give a cleverly uplifting feminist message is sheer joy; thus this wildly anti-Disney moment turns out to be one of the key sequences in the modern history of animation.But without Disney's routine visual perfectionism, none of this would have been possible. ""Zootopia"" director of cinematography Nathan Warner hits the mark with the thousands of cards on the table to craft such an ambitious animated world, choosing, along with the huge design and art departments, vivid colors, transparencies and animations that enclose the general meaning of each company. Each branding depiction is vigorous and catching, however, these don't reach the complexity and depth of ""Inside Out,"" thus weakening its creative scope. Prolific composer Henry Jackman unveils a score that lives up to his name, following the lines of the company's usual compositions, introducing the corresponding melodies of happiness right before the arrival of the saddest climax.""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" by Phil Johnston and Rich Moore is an exhilarating, fast-paced, high-concept voyage into the most dangerous addiction humankind is facing right now and at the same time is a tender, light-hearted fable about friendship and sacrifice that wholly enhances its means as for the original. It's sweet, harmless and funny like a cute cats video compilation, however, just wait to know a fantastic dark web and everything gets one more layer of meaning. Cinema has gradually adapted to the advances of humanity, for this reason, and although ""Incredibles 2"" proved it cryptically with its cunning modern-day villain, Disney's latest 2018 release is as necessary as inevitable before an audience living through screens, a generation that has left behind real interaction.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

137,ariqakbar,Why everyone?,8,2 December 2018,"I dont get it why people gave bad rating to this movie. i mean i got it there's a couple things that make this second movie looks like his own movie not like a sequel one. it's too sad for a kid who watch it. yeah i know but beside all of that fact..this movie was genius. the way they explained about internet,virus,and some tech stuff. for me every detail was incredible. let's talk about the scene when Venellope got her song, i mean did you realize that they make it precisely like other princess song. after a couple line they hit with a the turn back part and then back to the main line. and that lyrics, it was pretty genius for me.people said they can't feel the sense of the first movie in here. i mean the reboot and virus scene. that pretty represent the first movie for me. againand the fact that they put that really strong emotion. maybe for people who think this movie was for the kid and kid only yeah maybe they will be disappointed because of that. but for me, i'm 22 years old and yeah this movie really got my heart. i must say this is what i expect from this franchise",Ralph Breaks the Internet
138,FairlyAnonymous,Clever at some points but lacking direction at others,7,28 November 2019,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is a little better than I was expecting. I heard a lot of bad word of mouth about the movie so I had my expectations fairly low. However, the film starts off pretty strong and does well for a good while until it hits the third act.My fears when walking into this movie was that it would be another ""emoji movie"" that is essentially a big corporate product placement movie. And Ralph Breaks the Internet is. People complained about the Emoji Movie having its plot revolve around specific games, products, or internet pop-culture references and this movie does exactly the same. One of the most egregiously distracting scenes is the ""Oh my Disney"" skit which comes out of nowhere and just exists to get Disney Princesses in the film. It doesn't add to the plot and doesn't have any real pay-off but I'm sure it was fun for the artists to make. It's a cute joke in concept but it also comes across as a bit... er... egotistical? It's like Disney advertising their own company within the movie. I'm sure this movie will not age terrifically well in 30 years as a lot of the jokes are referring to modern cultural trends and jokes, but for now it works. It is what it is, so enjoy it for that.There were some good jokes in the film that I really enjoyed and the animation is top-notch (as always). There are some fun characters (Spamley and Gord), some clever visual concepts, and good gags throughout the course of the movie but the biggest issue with the movie is it's plot and some poor dialogue.The overall core conflict of the movie isn't a bad one. Venelope finds a game on the internet that she likes more than her own game, but Ralph doesn't want her to leave due to Ralph liking their friendship the way it is. This isn't a bad start for a movie, but the movie wanders around in an aimless manner for a while until you get the obligatory ""the friends need to break up"" scene that happens around the beginning of the third act which then leads right up to the finale where they are back together again. This is a predictable Disney formula that they have used in EVERY ONE of their CGI renaissance films. It's not original and it's not entertaining because you can just skip the ""friends breaking up scene"" and within 5 minutes you will have them back together again.The other issue is that the ending conflict is shockingly similar to the last movie's ending: A giant swarm of creatures that Ralph accidentally unleashes into a new world that multiplies at a huge rate and causes mayhem? Granted, with this movie they manage to tie the finale into the film's core theme of insecurity being monstrous, but the way it is handled is very on the nose and obvious to the point where the characters even openly tell the audience what it represents.And this movie does this a lot. There are a good number of scenes that have characters flatly telling the audience what the plot is and what character arcs they are going through. Sometimes characters even give exposition to plot-points that have already had exposition. One example is Ralph states: ""Oh no, if Venelope dies on the internet she dies forever!"" and then later on a similar statement is stated... and then a minute later Shanks says, ""Venelope, we need to get you out of this game because if you die here you will die permanently!"". This plot point is brought up three or four times and it's really confusing as to why the script is like this.However, for all of its shortcomings, it isn't a terrible movie. It is visually entertaining, has some good jokes here and there, Venelope gets her own song, and the emotional scenes are still great regardless if they were probably built up to.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

140,sirwillisiv,"A fun, fast-paced, and touching story about friendship...",6,21 November 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is one of those rare films that tries to be something but does one element so perfectly it works against the other. Pandering as it may seem with the cluttered internet humor and numerous Disney cameos, which all has its moments of style and charm, there's still a motivation and a character chemistry to explore.This sequel to Wreck-It Ralph is a fast-paced, fun, touching, and relatable story about friendship, conveying poignant and critical messages about how friendship works, what harms it, and the hardship of letting someone go. This is all backed up by endearing vocal performances and some of Disney's best-looking animation yet.I especially love that there was no outright antagonist, just characters dealing with their own insecurities. A much-wanted break from Disney's streak of twist villains. I do wish Fix-It Felix and Sgt. Calhoun had more screentime, though.Even with the whole internet element being shoved in your face, Ralph Breaks the Internet has substance, something most animated films are sorely lacking these days. I had a great time with this sequel and highly recommend it. Ralph and Vanellope's relationship is more than worth the price of admission.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I just think you should treat the value as an inviolable part. If they were family, that makes sense. But they were just friends. If you want new stage, you must make a choice. Sometimes it's just nuisance to be nosy to someone too much. It works just only for you.But, even if you understand that, everyone cannot see off pleasantly. That's quite human. When you hope for his happiness and safety and tell him to stay with you, you can get a good relationship. If you couldn't understand the feeling of Ralph at all, maybe you would be a true psychopath.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
142,pinkarray,Good film but missing something from the first film,6,21 November 2018,"The film starts off continuing the establishment of Ralph and Vanellope's relationship and we can really see their sibling-like bond with them playing around in other arcade games. One thing that bothered me about that though is did Ralph let Vanellope drink alcohol? She's like 9-12 years old and I was surprised she didn't get drunk off of it but Felix seemed to get drunk off of it for a split second. There's a few other things that bothered me about their relationship but we'll talk about that later in the review.I felt that the film gets a bit contrived after that, well, the first film was a little contrived too but there are other moments of the film that seemed contrived. Vanellope gets bored with her monotone race tracks, so Ralph makes a new track (is that supposed to be referencing like when games get updated? I know this is not real but I just want to know). Suddenly, the wheel gets out of control and then breaks, I don't know if the steering wheel moving by itself was Vanellope controlling her own car or was it because of the new sudden update in the game with the new track.Ralph and Vanellope take a fun high-speed ride to the Internet, now this is where the film really shines. Its representation of the Internet was fun, creative but still believable. It talks about how videos go viral, how google search works, and the different sites they visit yet it's not afraid to touch on topics like mean comments. These aspects of the film can bring humor. Additionally, it was nice to see all the Disney princesses come back and the inclusion of Pixar and superhero characters. When Vanellope first comes here, she's disappointed because she'd rather be in the intense, action game ""Slaughter Race"" and this is the start of where the film drags down and leads to a disappointing ending. Vanellope has decided she does not want to be in the innocent, sweet Sugar Rush anymore and would rather be in the risky Slaughter Race, despite the fact that it may be too dangerous for a kid her age, yet it's up Vanellope's alley because she's a tomboy who loves action.Before Vanellope leaves Ralph to advertise his videos, Ralph becomes clingy in not wanting her to leave. I dislike when films make friends and lovers so clingy to the other, like I know Ralph was a lonely bad guy in a video game where he didn't have many friends but he needed to let Vanellope advertise his videos so that they can get enough money to buy the steering wheel while he makes more money off of making videos, he shouldn't make a big deal out of Vanellope leaving him for a while.Now, onto the third act, the third act made me mad at the film's protagonists. They had made some bad decisions that had kind of just ruined the whole film's message about good friendship. Vanellope becomes so attached to this Shank character that she starts ignoring Ralph. All Ralph wants to do is get her back to Sugar Rush but she wants to stay in a different racing game, and this leads to them arguing and Vanellope throwing the necklace she once gave him in the first film. That was a bit cliched. What's even worse is that they end up going their separate ways at the very end so they're not best friends anymore. They spent all this time building them as good friends only to have them fight each other like they did in the first film and then they eventually separate.The film didn't have the tight, cohesive structure that the first film had and is missing the wholesome, consistent fun and hilarity the first film had. When I watched the first film as a young teenager, it was one of the most entertaining films I've seen and it became my favorite, making me want to watch it over and over again. This film was a disappointment, it did not make me feel the same fun I had watching the first film and it did not make me feel like I want to watch it a bunch of times again. The movie doesn't have much of the nostalgic classic games aspect that the first film had (makes sense because it takes place in the Internet), Fix-it Felix Jr. and Sergeant Calhounen are now relegated to minor characters and they're not even shipped anymore in this movie , and the Sugar Rush racers didn't seem to change much from the annoying brats they were in the first film. The movie didn't even establish much of Felix and Sergeant feeling the pressure of having to take care of a bunch of kids. There's no Moppet Girl (the freckled little girl who likes Fix it Felix Jr. game) or Mario, which I was eagerly waiting for.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

145,MinistryofDoom,Ralph Breaks what could have been a good Pixar Franchise,3,22 January 2019,"This film suffers from not being able to determine who is it's target audience. The first film was enjoyable because it had a solid plot and although it existed in a world of video game references, it didn't heavily rely on them. This film barely, if at all, has a plot and focuses entirely on making as many pop culture/internet references as possible in an hour or two. I judge Pixar films on how well they captivate the attention of my children. This one didn't cut it. They enjoyed the first one. They hated this one. Little kids don't care about Ebay, Google, Twitter, Facebook, how many likes or followers something or someone has, etc...so these references are lost in the ether if Disney/Pixar's aim was to target young children. While the visuals and animation are stunning, there's very little else to rely on and so the film is one big gigantic commercial for Silicon Valley, the Tech Industry and others who probably aren't even watching this film. I get that Disney/Pixar wanted to do something innovative and fresh but...this wasn't the way to do it. All the respect in the world to Sarah Silverman and John C. Reilly though. They were the only two shining in this overall stinker of a film. Back to the drawing board with you, Pixar. Focus your efforts on good story telling (like the Toy Story series) and spare us the shallow pizzazz.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
146,n-kefala,A lot of fun,8,25 November 2018,"This movie is a spirited, very imaginative and funny sequel to ""Wreck-It-Ralph"". The clever ideas in the script and the strong friendship between Vanellope and Ralph carry things through. The cute characters and the pretty colors will amaze the kids with just the right amount of adult humor sprinkled on top for the older ones. Here, Disney give us once again big action, funny moments and spectacle. Also there is so much attention to detail, that it is truly a feast for the eyes. It is a creative family-friendly adventure that's a clear step above most of the other animated options we currently watched. A bold and smart, a story about what it means to live online. It's in the level of the classic Hollywood cartoons and in that it provides entertainment for all ages.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
147,Semisonic,Made with love you don't need special skills to feel,8,16 March 2019,"Seven years ago Wreck-It Ralph wrecked my heart with its sweet and touching story. Now, it's time for Ralph and Vanellope to find something new to explode. And we're talking about something big, like... the whole modern internet pop culture!Basing your narrative on something as familiar and natural to everyone these days as breathing and web-surfing (whoops, reflexive puns detected!) is both a blessing and a bane. To get all the deeper level references from a certain superhero-based animation, you'd need to be a fan of that character and its universe. But you don't need any special training to be a fan of Google, Instagram or Disney princess movies, so the entertainment should find an easy way from the studio to the viewers' heads, while their cash finds an equally easy way in the opposite direction.But, just like the case with the first LEGO Movie, being easy to digest doesn't make RBTI a shallow film. Under the disguise of the big e-brands and popular memes, this is still a story of two very different personalities who are trying to learn to really agree to disagree and pursue different dreams while still remaining close to each other. You might think it's quite impossible to deliver a serious message via an arcade game character, but here we are: what Ralph 2 did with the ""loving is not possessing"" idea is as believable and sincere as it's relevant for a lot of real world people here and now. So if you call this a cash grab, then shut up and take my money!But there's more to RBTI than just what's explicitly delivered. If you take your time to just let it all seep in while the ending credits are rolling, you might come to feel the love for that big wide world Internet has become during our lifetime. It might seem scary or contrived at first, but it's the magic that lets virtually anyone to become a part of something unifying, something endless, something... liberating. We're no longer confined to where we live or whom we've been born, today just a few taps on a screen and a green light on a WiFi router would bring us anywhere and make us anyone we want. A great power, something that imposes a great responsibility too, but a power nonetheless. What better time for that gentle reminder than just a few days after the 30th anniversary of World Wide Web?So, if one has to get rickrolled to get this far, then I call it a fair deal!

148,nethy-nho,I want more this! \o/,10,12 January 2019,"First movie of the year. This is a amazing animation, with a lot of Easter eggs. And see all the princess off the Disney together, was fantastic. Talk about the plot, for me surpass the original movie, is wonderful see the friendship of Ralph and Venelope and all the adventure on the internet.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
149,AnishMisra,Ralph Breaks the Internet Review,9,17 February 2019,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is a film co-written and directed by Phil Johnston and Rich Moore. I loved the first film and have been waiting for a sequel for quiet along time. So when the trailer debuted, I was on top of the world. And at the end of finishing the film, I was just ecstatic.Plot: Ralph and Vanellope decide to seek help from the internet world when the game Sugar Rush faces danger of shutting down.Story and direction: While the first film honoured the traditional video game parlours which now-a-days have almost gone extinct; this film shows the diversity that the internet has to offer us. Since this is a Walt Disney film, it's really hard to fault the animation. So much of hard work has gone into the animation with ample amounts of detailing. The internet world looked so beautiful and amazing. I liked the way the makers had depicted spams, pop-ups, ads and viruses. Each and every scene is a wonder to look at. Also, we have the voice cast that is amazing and never for a moment its felt that they have miscast the voices. But the most important thing that the film has is the correct and apt story. This film not only has some amazing character development which makes you feel for them and makes you understand as to why they take certain decisions, but also beneath that has wonderful messages which I found quite relevant in the modern times. One big takeaway for me was that you should learn how to move on and not stop someone when someone decides to. The comedy is just spot on. I laughed at every joke that was cracked. Like the previous film, this one too has a lot of pop-culture references (with Disney being quite a focus). But these references don't dilute the film in any way. The score by Henry Jackman is just awesome. This man doesn't fail to surprise me. Also good is the song which comes at a quite crucial moment in the film from Disney's favourite composer Alan Menken (I especially liked the way at how its hinted as to when a song comes to one's mind). With all that being said, this film does have certain pacing issues. Like the first half is quite racy and energetic and the second half being interesting but not as racy as the first half.Favorite Scene: Not to spoil anything, but there is a particular scene between Vanellope and Ralph towards the end of the movie which strung something in my heart. Those who have watched the film will surely understand which scene I am talking about.Verdict: Year 2018 has been a good year when it comes to animated films. I am still trying to figure out as to which one is my favourite. As for now, I can say that I loved this film and even more than the first instalment. If the makers are surely planning the spin-off and sequels (according to some news reports and media outlets), I am in for it. Do watch the film till the end as it has both a mid-credits and post-credits scene.I am going with a 9/10.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
150,bastille-852-731547,OK but Somewhat Underwhelming Sequel,6,24 November 2018,"I really enjoyed the first ""Wreck-It Ralph"" movie, and was looking forward to this sequel. While it's amusing enough and inoffensive, it's certainly a bit underwhelming compared to the original. It's great to see John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman's undeniable voice talent back on the big screen, and the film admittedly does have a good concept: a plot structured around Ralph and Vanellope heading to the internet to find a missing part for the latter's ""Sugar Rush"" game. The animation is generally pretty good, and there's a fair amount of reasonably fun humor. While some of the jokes don't really work (Ralph asking if goggles are sold at ""Google,"") many do.The main problems with the movie are two-fold: its attempt at messaging satire over the potential dangers of the internet comes off as too heavy-handed and surface-level, and the film can sometimes feel repetitive. The film attempts to show excessive fame on the internet as a (rightly) dangerous force, but it borders on being preachy while trying to do so. Additionally, many of the film's attempts at satire of internet and pop culture do come off as too undeveloped. Just like ""Ready Player One"" (a film I did not like,) the filmmakers here attempt to go for quantity rather than quality when dissecting pop culture references. Just having blue birds that make tweeting noises to take a jab at Twitter isn't particularly original or funny. The pop culture jokes are better than ""Ready Player One,"" but certainly not as profound as the first ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" where they were more developed (such as the Q-Bert scene.) I also thought the new characters weren't all that interesting. The Slaughter Race game and Gal Gadot's character felt fairly meh, and simply don't compare to ""Hero's Duty"" and Jane Lynch's character in the first film.It's certainly not bad, but ultimately ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is a slight miss. If you have kids that are clamoring to go, it could make a OK family matinee, but all others (including fans of the first movie) can wait to rent this. 6/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The plot simply didnt work and all the character plugs were shallow and a wasted a lot of screen time. It felt more like a string of short comic strips than a coherent film. As many mention there is a ton of advertising in this one hidden under the veil of nostalgia and comedy except that it was neither.The story revolves around Ralph and the little girl trying to fix her game so it is not removed from the arcade. They go online to find the parts needed only to find out that they need money... apparently they had no idea that things cost money because in the 1st film there was never a mention of gamers putting quarters into their machine nor the fact that they work for a living... oh wait, wasnt that a part of the premise of the 1st movie?

157,samyoung-82648,Made me feel very uncomfortable,1,26 November 2018,"There's a maliciousness in this movie, it makes you wonder why a supposed ""family friendly"" company would hurt and marginalise little boys. Never have I seen a movie aimed at an audience so young with such an ill manner.
This movie has no redeeming male characters. The Disney princesses are aggressive (eg. Using weapons in a threatening manner) and complain about the patriarchy, so much so, that there is a reference to the need to emasculate strong men.
Is this the new Disney under new (inexperienced) leadership? I'd suggest not. It's far too calculated.
While I'm glad to hear my children were turned off by the trailer, I would honestly struggle between choosing between this and SouthPark for my children to watch. Cartman's malice is often balanced by good story and extenuating circumstances that moderate the malice. There is no balance here.
If you respect the inclusiveness and empathy of the old cartoons like the 60s/70s Scooby doo or 80s He-man and She-ra, this is not your children's film. If you take to sexism and marginalising attitudes veiled in sporadic humour, this may be your flick. I'd take the over-the-top ""wholesomeness"" of old Disney any day over this new malicious propaganda. It's a new low for Disney. I am shocked somebody wanted to send this message to such a young audience.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

A lot of people hated it for obvious reasons, and I kind of hated it too at times, but at other times I was laughing my ass off! There were some really clever jokes in this movie, and I don't want to undermine any of them. Clearly there was some effort put into it, but the story definitely suffered (I did not like how it ended and both Vanellope and Ralph seemed as though their characters regressed in this film. Definitely NOT a good thing....). It did feel like a big advertisement too, but still better than the Emoji movie. At least the ""advertisements"" were used for something more in this movie.Overall, it was an ok movie. Worth the watch if you aren't looking for anything incredible, but it's a big step down from the first movie. I don't recommend if you really enjoyed the first film.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
159,Paynebyname,There is some clever invention but then the politics becomes so heavy handed,3,28 October 2019,"When the film starts, it's great to see the old characters, hear the iconic music and revisit this clever world. And when the characters go into the internet, it's truly magical to see the nods to the websites that we all know and the imaginative ways that the makers have envisaged the internet.And then the politics start and they are far from subtle. First you begin to notice that all the cool characters are female and all the boring or evil ones are male. Then whenever Ralph and Venelope enter a scene it's always Ralph that is ridiculed and made to look a doofus and Ven that is hip and cool. How about some equal ribbing of both characters?This then continues as you realise that Ralph is the object of toxic masculinity that has to be quashed. He's the virus, the patriarchy is the cancer. He's strong and big and wants to protect Ven but there's no good in that. That isn't something to be celebrated. Oh god no, let's smash that, let's portray him as a selfish man child (like all men) and let the women make things better.None of this is more painfully revealed in the multitude of Princesses whining about how they are always rescued by strong men and they are tired of it. I have to laugh at their inability to recognise that they are the 'stars' of all of their films. If you had a room containing the male leads of their films, you wouldn't recognise anyone but no, even though these female characters have whole films about them, they're the under appreciated and overlooked ones crushed under the boot of the evil patriarchy.Now some might say I'm bitter and being divisive but when this agenda is pushed into every film and no longer even attempted in a subtle manner, is it any surprise that one begins to notice and question this continued identity politics?You shouldn't need to promote women by denigrating men and this is ultimately what Ralph breaks the internet was doing.So it has great visuals and invention but the identity politics is slapped on with a brush so heavy, you feel yourself choking.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

In doing so it also makes some good commentary on social media, and provides some laughs regarding pop-ups and shopping online in general.There was one shameless plug from Disney, regarding Disney+, but it brilliantly manages to re-introduce all the Disney princesses, and give Stormtroopers some air time, so it was worth it!All in all the story isn't quite as strong as in the original.

IF this movie is a 1/10, then I would love to know how these people view their movies.There is plenty of product placement in this movie which is glaringly obvious and very 'in your face'. As well as this, there is much social commentary and social media references and plot lines, however this is all done in a relative way to the story of the movie. It isn't just there for the sake of being there, none of it felt shoe-horned in. The eBay storyline was perfectly fine for me.The movie feels a little long, the run time isn't excessive as it is only 1hr 45minutes in total, but it feels much, much longer. The pacing is off and when you think the story is coming to an end, there is another twist and another section of story. This happens 3 or 4 times and does start to get repetitive and tedious.The movie is funny, its heart-warming and its incredibly creative. They integrate the internet aspect into the film very well and some of the scenes in the internet world are very clever and inspiring. The relationship between to two lead characters is pleasant, with a few predictable clichés thrown in along the way.The movie looks stunning, with great colour and animation - Pixar just keep getting better and better in this department.Overall, I enjoyed this movie.

We see the same thing over and over. We just wanted to see something new.

This sequel is all about advertisements and is a letdown.",4,11 July 2019,"I have watched Wreck-it-Ralph the first movie back in 2012 and I loved it, there were video game jokes, Ralph lost his temper much like Donald Duck, Vanellope rules over her video game, Fix-it-Felix helped out Ralph and Calhoun was a strict tough woman and I liked the hoverboard scene.However 6 years later we finally got the sequel and first of all what the heck happened to Ralphs bad temper? I want to see him explode in anger like Donald Duck, however he's mellowed out and suddenly is just a nice guy. This isn't Ralph I know, he would be quick to anger. Why is Vanellope leaving her Sugar Rush arcade game in favor of an online racing game? I'm disappointed Fix-it-Felix and Calhoun isn't featured very much, what about them babysitting the girls?Yes Ralph and Vanellope do literally surf the Internet to go to ebay after causing the customer to breaking the steering wheel. They bet a little too much money and they have to race in the slaughter race which they fail at, so Ralph decides to make youtube videos and make himself go viral and become famous but reads the cyberbully comments which made him sad.Anyways Vanellope goes on a visit with all of the Disney Princesses and goes back to Slaughter race, Ralph causes a virus to spread all over the internet world and the zombie clones of Ralph take over and tries to kidnap Vanellope and becomes a giant Ralph zombie. The real Ralph stops the zombies and they save the day and Vanellope moves on to play Slaughter Race and Ralph goes home.First of all I did like the Internet world that Ralph and Vanellope visit. I liked the Disney Princesses including the mice Jaq and Gus. I did like the music, I also liked Suger Rush and Slaughter Race.Where's the Internet jokes? The Emoji Movie was full of jokes that made me laugh, but this movie sequel didn't hardly have any jokes. I didn't like that they changed Ralph's character from being bad tempered to a mellow guy. Fix-it-Felix and Calhoun are cameos and they didn't have any story which I was disappointed. Also Ralph hardly broke the Internet except with the computer virus which the title should've been called ""Ralph surfs the Internet."" This movie was more about advertisements for almost 2 hours and I was bored to death, it did deal with issues with cyberbullying but there wasn't much story for Ralph which was a big letdown.I didn't like the surprise ending with the pancake eating disorder app game causing the cute rabbit to overeat and explode right in front of the little girl in the car and have her screaming. Seriously Disney, this is supposed to be a family film. I can't believe they would imply a violent scene with the rabbit exploding, that made me sick, I hope they remove that scene in future re-releases.What I would've done to fix this darn disappointment is rewrite the script, have more online gaming and Internet jokes that'll make people laugh, have a better story for Ralph and Vanellope, have Ralph wreck website buildings or online games and keep his bad temper, have Vanellope still rule her Suger Rush arcade game. It could've been a great movie but nope it was a movie that I can't remember very well.

174,datautisticgamer-74853,Fanservice: The Movie,8,22 December 2018,"After a month, I received an opportunity to see this movie with my mother and grandfather when visiting my great aunt in Urbana. I had already expected this movie to be full of easter eggs from Disney and elsewhere, and I wasn't expecting it to be that good considering how low I would place its prequel among Disney's Neo-Renaissance films. So now that Ralph has left video games, why do I feel this is an improvement?To be fair, while the story isn't too ground-breaking for Disney standards with its formula, its approach to the Internet does assist it in manifesting itself within the world of its predecessor. Its approach to spoofing popular apps, again, isn't very original, but its execution was done creatively with the Dark Web and malware. Coming to the ""fanservice"" part, Disney tried really hard to inflate (oops) this movie with as many references to their properties as possible, including the dedication of two scenes to Disney Princesses. Surprisingly enough, the self-aware writing in these scenes makes them rather pleasing. Finally, for once Disney doesn't try to pull off a twist climax with the way they ended this one. For characters, Ralph and Vanellope aren't that much different from Wreck-It Ralph, though seeing as the film took more time developing their relationship than themselves individually, I personally could live with that. As much as some characters who aren't there for cameos could be developed more (like Yesss), they don't feel pointless and do prove the inevitable: when a movie has potential like this to explore an indefinite quantity of ideas, you don't have to explore or even glance at all of them, for that would just waste time. I don't have much to say about the animation (it's WDAS depicting the eternally extended Internet mixed in with their old ideas, very hard to fault), but I received a most pleasant auditory surprise with its music. Alan Menken once again nailed it with his piece for Vanellope, and the petite trinkets of other iconic songs (Disney or not) were enjoyable to my accompaniment.I do recommend this movie more than its predecessor to regular Disney fans, but I will say that parents may need to take children with them to understand some of the cameos, easter eggs, and ideas this film presents. If technology isn't your thing, I would actually say this isn't a movie for you. For a casual audience, I can't really make up my mind on a recommendation since there's so many variables. From your opinion on the first WI-R to your opinion on technology to your opinion on Disney in general, I am utterly torn and honest when I say it's all up to you on whether you want to view this movie. Children may enjoy the cameos from video game characters and get into the mindsets of Internet users, while adults may enjoy the Princess scenes and earn some information on how the Internet actually works. Just don't say anything about the BPCM game at the end, because with fanservice comes fanart, and...OK, sorry. But if you're just picking an animated movie at random, this is another solid bet Disney has brought us.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
175,mbhgkmsgg,Nothing groundbreaking,6,28 October 2020,"It's another Disney film, what else can I say. Like most Disney films, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Ralph Breaks the Internet feels exactly like a Disney film should. There is a lesson about life for the slightly older viewers and there is a lot of fun for the kids.The biggest annoyance I had with the film was its tireless efforts to try and educate, I guess the parents of the kids, about the internet. We got a crash course about meme culture, about why the internet can be a bad place, and also about how it can be a wonderful place filled with endless possibilities. The reason this bothered me, is that I assume that the average viewer probably knows more about the internet than those making the film. And if parents are already against the internet, this movie won't be the thing that changes their mind.With that being said, there are also a lot of good things in Ralph Breaks the Internet. The environments and visuals being one those things. I very much enjoyed the depiction of the internet as a city-like structure. It made for some gorgeous shots and scenes. I also really liked how they crafted the dark-web as a sort of dodgy neighborhood.
I was also surprised and quite bemused by how self-aware this film was. The references made to other Disney films were quite fun and, as mentioned, unexpected.All in all, I think that Ralph Breaks the Internet is as Disney as it gets. There is a musical type of performance, there is a lesson learned and there is fun to be had. Don't go in expecting anything groundbreaking because you won't find it here.

179,brianjohnson-20043,A typical sequel that doesn't live up to the original,9,21 November 2018,"Sequels typically have a tough choice of determining how much they want to establish new characters and locations at the expense of the established origins of the original which people feel in love with. I think the Toy Story Movies do a good job of balancing this out. Each of the sequels establish many new characters and locations while also providing some extra exploration and insight into the characters which were already established.The wreck it Ralph movies are sort of like Toy story movies but for video game characters. And sadly this film didn't work nearly as well as something like Tony story 2. It had almost no story or involvement for any of the original characters besides Venelope and Ralph. It almost never existed in any of the locations established in the first film except at the very beginning and end. The timeing didn't seem to make sense all the time. How could Ralph possibly make a ton of viral videos in a few hours? Some involving him over-cooking pie. And he is supposed to be in the internet world for a full day. If he isn't in his game for a full day isn't his game going to be in trouble just like it was in the last film when Rallh left his game for a while while the arcade was open?I didn't have too much of a problem with the internet world they created. But I felt it would have been more interesting and agreeable to the world they established in the first film if they had to involve more arcade characters and time in resolving the problem with the sugar-rush game.The highlights of the film were the Disney princesses and the internet world and jokes. I'm not saying the internet shouldn't have been the bulk of their film to tell their story. But they seemed to forget too much the environment and characters of the original which we loved so much and bought into in order for the drama of the first film to seem real.Also, how did Venelope ever leave her game? I thought as a glitch she couldn't leave. I missed the very beginning of the film so maybe they established an answer to a few of my issues there. But even if they did. The story wasn't as fleshed out cogent and heartfelt as the original even if they fixed their plot holes.It was still a fun adventure kids movie. But I always get upset when a fabulous movie is followed by an average sequel because it seems to bring tbe entire world they created down a peg.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
180,brianjohnson-20043,A mixed bag,9,6 January 2019,"This film has a lot of interesting components for a sequel. I see the first film as a story of Ralph finding purpose from depression by making a friend, and in the process discovers and rights a conspiracy which was wronging his friend.The sequel is more about how to deal with a friendship where one friend wants to shart a new chapter and the other friend doesn't want things to change. I like Disney addressing this kind of dilemma. I suspect the critics like it too. And this is one of the reasons the critics like the movie more than the audience overall. It's a lot more risky of a narrative than the first one. And a lot of the adventure components are fun and work.But is the original or sequel better?I like them both. But there are a lot of things established in the first film which were ignored in the sequal. I like the story idea of the 2nd movie more. But it seems out of place. And the first one is better executed.It's sort of like if the 2nd Toy Story movie was a movie about Buzz deciding he should leave Andy and live with another kid across the street while visiting the neighbor to recover a possession of Andy's that blew over into the neighbors house. But the the other kid has more friends for Buzz that Buzz feels more at home there. Meanwhile, the movie took place almost entirely in the room of the other kid. And we saw almost nothing of the supporting characters from the first movie. It's an interesting story dilemma for Woody and Buzz, but it isn't very compatible with the priorities established in the first movie about being there for Andy.Overall I'd say the first one is better because it only has to be consistent with itself and succeeds. And although the world in the 2nd movie is great, both films really created interesting, fun, and amusing worlds. So that's just a wash.I think the sequel could have worked better if the entire arcade was being saved by the journey of the protagonists as opposed to just one game. And if there was some substitute for Veneloppe's character in the arcade at the end. Maybe there could have been some slaughter-race character that didn't like its world who switched with Venelopee. That way their game isn't shut off because there is a missing racer. It's just a change in the look of one of the racers in the same car.I feel the sequel is better if you didn't see the original much or at all.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The part of Wreck it Ralph I loved so much, was looking back on the games I enjoyed as a child and picking out the characters.
This film has become very commercial and instead of 'spot the lovable characters' it's become 'spot the social media platform' which is very dull.You hardly see anything new regarding characters and games and my kids weren't that thrilled after watching it either, they could have made the film so much more.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
182,CriticalOfEverything,Very disappointing.,5,7 February 2019,"This is not a terrible film by any means, but it just doesn't compare to the first Wreck it Ralph. Sure, it has some good morals, but what else is there? Well the animation is great, but can that really be considered something that makes the film good when it's by Disney? It's filled with a lot of internet references and jokes that either work or don't and unfortunately most of them don't. Please don't get me started on the viral video scene because that legit made me want to die. This film just feels dated by like 5 years ago, and even then it would come off as cringe-worthy to most of the internet. I honestly thought this film was gonna be good because the trailers seemed promising, but unfortunately it falls into the same trap that every corporation has fallen into when trying to tackle the internet. Really couldn't enjoy this that much, damn shame too because I love the first Wreck it Ralph. But calling this ""Disney's Emoji Movie"" is a bit much.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
183,valen060,Enjoyable. Disney Levels Up Ralph Into Cyberspace with Flawed Quality,7,30 November 2018,"Ever since the first Wreck-It Ralph back in 2012, I was dazzled and awe-struck of the nostalgia with familiar 80s and 90s video game characters cameoing and crossing over together in a Disney film. The moral lesson about valuing oneself as someone who doesn't need to stick with the stereotype as a ""bad guy,"" but can be something more was what made the original great. For Disney Animation to now produce an official sequel to one of their canon films (not since Fantasia 2000), this takes those morals by moving it up to a whole different level.Six years have passed after the events of defeating the rogue Turbo and Ralph (voiced once again by John C. Reilly) enjoys his company with his pint-sized friend Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) at Litwak's Arcade by having fun in each other's game cabinets and then some. However, when the latter's game is unplugged for service, Vanellope ponders over the value if there's more to life than just being a pro racer and staying forever in the confines of an arcade.It was brilliant that directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston decided to widen the scope of Ralph's world from being inside a simple arcade and venturing into the World Wide Web via a wi-fi router. Familiar original characters from the first movie like Sgt. Calhoun and Fix-It Felix return reprised by stars Jane Lynch and Jack McBrayer respectively (albeit less screen time). Not to mention returning cameos of Sonic the Hedgehog and the other arcade inhabitants. These were great and even hilarious at the same time.I was overwhelmed seeing the many visuals blatantly shown in the cyberspace setting with its real-life websites (i.e. Facebook, Twitter), famous online stores (eBay, Amazon), and humorous side gags usually found on popular streaming sites like YouTube. I was nearly at the point of yelping excitedly at my local theater. And writing in additional cameos that feature several familiar Disney characters and notable princesses from past and present flicks with its many affiliates and distributing studios into the movie made this go meta instantly!New members to the cast like Bill Hader, Taraji P. Henson, Alfred Molina, and especially Gal Gadot (who is no stranger to fast cars herself in her past work) are welcoming additions that performed splendidly as likable characters. A few songs featured are also a plus, especially finding out veteran composer Alan Menken was involved with one for laughs.Overall, underneath many of these multiple references in lifestyles and trends layered with laughable moments, it doesn't hinder the film's moral compass. Yes, it's possibly inferior in terms of content and quality. And although it doesn't acknowledge the events of the 2012 original, Ralph still has his insecurities and Vanellope still retains her eager, mischievous personality. But it's about how these two handle the ups and downs of their friendship in a new environment. It's an adventure into finding that friendship isn't about being together forever, it's about strengthening that bond no matter where you are and not losing sight of it. I enjoyed it, flaws and all.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
184,margulanabutrlov,Ralph Breaks The Internet Review,9,22 March 2019,"When a broken steering wheel threatens the decommissioning of arcade racer Sugar Rush, lead character Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) and her best friend Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) head to the internet to try to secure a replacement via eBay.
For a film about a fictional '80s arcade game character, Ralph Breaks The Internet sure raises some weighty issues. We're not ten minutes into the Wreck-It Ralph sequel when a broken video game cabinet creates the displacement of several hundred pixelated characters, all looking for a new home among Litwak Arcade's other coin-op machines. It's an interesting set-up - could this brightly coloured, sugar-coated cartoon be a modern-day fable, about to slyly educate its young audience about the world's current refugee crisis? Sadly, no. A couple of scenes later it's all but forgotten, the film far more interested in sending its two main characters - best friends Ralph (Reilly) and Vanellope (Silverman) - on a pop culture-crammed adventure to the internet.
The internet - with its high-rise representations of the world's biggest online brands - represents the big city to Litwak Arcade's small town, and it's here Ralph Breaks The Internet finds both its central conflict and its message. There are lessons here but - with Vanellope enchanted by the possibilities suddenly open to her, and Ralph set on achieving their task then returning home to his usual routine - it's about the nature of friendship. Not a bad thing to learn, it's just a well-trodden set-up and, in the context of the film's opening, a missed opportunity.
Still, it's an entertaining and rapidly paced adventure, which takes its heroes from eBay to a dangerous urban MMORPG, to YouTube substitute Buzztube, to (a sanitised version of) the dark web. They're hassled by pop-up advertisers, get distracted by clickbait and try their hands at loot hunting. The highlight, however, is Vanellope's trip to 'Oh My Disney' (a real website) - it's the funniest section of the film, especially her encounter with the studio's roster of Princesses, as the studio sends up its own creations but also fights back against the most common online criticisms of its female heroes. Sharp and knowing, it's also a triumph of animation and characterisation. For example, the original, hand-drawn Ariel (The Little Mermaid) was slightly more manic in her movements than, say, the stronger, more noble Pocahontas (Pocahontas), and that's mirrored here.
If only all of Ralph Breaks The Internet was so inspired, instead of being mostly content to make funny but first-base jokes about social media culture. These characters have lived in isolation at the arcade - wouldn't their escape leave them faced with questions about the nature of their being as they discover thousands of other similarly segregated versions of themselves exist? It's not the case that its target audience couldn't handle it - Toy Story was smart enough to tackle such existential crises, and that was over 20 years ago. But then, that's the difference between an enduring masterpiece and something that just achieves being funny but forgettable. This is resolutely the latter.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
185,El-Ak,Smarter than the first but not better!,6,1 December 2018,"I really enjoyed the film which contained tons of fun, joy, sadness and little laughter and tons of easter eggs. However, the story is very weak with not much to show and stretching the events and deviating from the incident and breaking some rules the movie set for itself through the movie.
The story played more on the relationship between Vanellope and Ralph and the screenplay was kinda not powerful and both were playing on the emotional feeling between the two characters which was the most focused on scenes throughout the film including the end too trying to stimulate the emotions of the audience to sympathy with it leading to more stretching. The story is only based on much details and creativity but neglecting the story itself with fast progress and overracting in those emotional scenes. The music written for the film wasn't bad but should have been better. the comedy wasn't much powerful in the film and the plot was very easy to predict and the only thing that lacked creativity,
overall a fun film to watch with much creativity presented in a modest story but professional in it's making especially in the scenes regarding social media and loves with more beautiful animation and should be
respected for that effort that many sequels did it worse. 6/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet
186,ajzeg,This movie was okay.,6,15 September 2019,"There was a lot that I liked about it, but there were also a lot of serious problems I had with it. The animation and voice acting are still excellent, but the story is pretty unfocused and kind of jumps around from location to location. There isn't much of a goal or as good of a story, which is a shame. I love the first movie. There were also a lot of serious plot holes and inconsistencies that I won't get into here since those would be spoilers, but they really bothered me. Overall, this is a good movie to take your kids to. It has some good jokes, some creative animation, and a good message, but it is not as good as the first movie and you are probably better off just watching that again.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
187,twpain,It's ok but not great,6,26 June 2020,Overall Ralph Breaks the Internet is just ok. There is some funny moments and the idea of the film is pretty cool. Also you've got two pretty fun main characters. On the other side of things this movie feels like it should be a lot shorter and feels really boring in some scenes. So overall there is some good things about the sequel but there's also some bad to go along with that.,Ralph Breaks the Internet
188,Benslie,Great family movie with great message,9,26 November 2018,"First of all, the friendship between Ralph and Vanellope in this film is excellent. It felt like a real-life friendship between these two. They have their highs and their lows but in the end, they're still the best of friends. Everybody can easily relate to these two's friendship. I also really liked the animation in this film. Mainly with the little people in the internet. It was a really unique look in the film but was well chosen. The way the film showed the internet was fantastic. They didn't hold anything back when it came to showing what happens online. Everything they experience everybody who uses the internet will have experienced at least once or twice in their lifetime. The humour in this film wasn't overpowering which was great. There is humour in this film it's not overbearing like some other animated kids films have. The final good thing I want to mention is the emotions this film brings. This film had me nearly crying towards the end. This once again can circle back to being able to relate and connect with these characters. Now onto some of the bad things in this film and to be honest there wasn't a lot. One of my things is the pacing in the film. In the beginning of the film, it felt a bit to slow for me. Compared to the end which seemed a bit to fast. Nowhere in this film did it feel the correct pacing. Now I get and it's a kids film so it has to quick to hold the kid's attention. The other thing was it including things that could have been taken out. I'm not going to say what it was but they showed stuff that could have been easily removed and it wouldn't have affected it in the slightest. The last thing is the subplot. The subplot could have been taken out and made the film probably a bit shorter. In the end, Ralph Breaks the Internet is a great family movie with a great message.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

191,wrightiswright,"For anyone else other than Disney, this would be exceptional.",7,1 January 2019,"Must like Incredibles 2, Ralph Breaks The Internet is a MORE than acceptable sequel, but it still ends up not being a patch on the original. The reasons are simple: It's not quite as fresh, the internet jokes aren't nearly as funny as the retro game gags in Wreck It Ralph, and two great supporting characters from the first movie get mainly sidelined here.What's left is a touching and charming adventure, with some unexpectedly edgy moments you wouldn't expect in a Disney movie, however not quite enough to give it the label of 'classic'. A big selling point seems to be the appearance of all the Disney Princesses together, and indeed their scene in the middle portion is one of the highlights.Then though they extend the joke too long, by giving us an entirely pointless encore during the ending. It's fine to joke about about modern princesses not needing a 'Big Strong Man' to help them out, but there's a moment when the moral is so overused it merely becomes straight out pandering.Like a lot of recent Disney movies, the writers seem to think they have to 'modernise' everything from their past, in order to give us a more 'revisionist' view of the old cliches they put in their films. The problem I have here is that they might just as easily accept that the dated beliefs were a product of their time, and could be treated as such in a subtle, clever way in the screenplay that wasn't overbearing.Instead, the writers give us line after line of characters flat out telling us that this old system was 'wrong', rammed home with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Whether they're contractual obliged to 'make amends' for alleged past missteps or if they're trying to rather futilely appeal to the vocal Twitter crowd who are NEVER happy about anything, who knows?The point is, such blatant overselling of the message does not add to the watcher's experience an iota, and instead weighs it down by giving us virtue-signalling baggage which feels completely unnecessary. It also links into a bigger issue I have today: STOP APOLOGISING FOR EVERYTHING. Especially when you're doing it on behalf of people who probably aren't even offended. Thank you. 7/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet

193,Animated_Antic,A funny and very heartwarming sequel.,9,27 November 2018,"We don't tend to see a lot of sequels from Walt Disney Animation Studios. Since the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" back in 1937, the studio has only released about a handful of sequels. This is not including the infamous direct to DVD sequels put out by DisneyToon Studios from 1994 to 2008. Now after almost seven years, Disney Animation brings us back into the world of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and brings us to the world of the Internet with ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"". Going into the film I had very high hopes due to how much I loved the predecessor and how funny the trailers looked and came out very satisfied. This is not only yet another fantastic film from the Disney Animation Studios continuing their fantastic revival they've had this decade, but also a great animated sequel as well. This really was such a fun film and I really enjoyed watching it.Six years after the events of the first film, best friends Ralph (John C. Riley) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) have been hanging out during closing hours at Litwak's Arcade. Their lives seem to be perfect until one day the steering wheel breaks off of Vanellope's arcade game Sugar Rush. Because the company who made the game went out of business years ago, Litwak unplugs the machine which renders the people of Sugar Rush homeless and without a game. Hoping to get a steering wheel for Sugar Rush before Litwak sells the game for parts, Ralph and Vanellope venture into the world of the Internet in hopes to find the steering wheel in time. Along the way, they come across some interesting characters including a clickbait pop ad user named J.P. Spamley (Bill Hader), a racer in a game called Slaughter Race named Shank (Gal Gadot), an algorithm on a website called BuzzTube named Yesss (Taraji P. Henson) and many more that will help in their quest for them to get their steering wheel and get back to Litwak's before it's too late.This film really was a lot of fun and I feel a lot of that comes down to the story. This movie is funny, clever, has lots of heart, and knew how to make a world where the characters were likable. Yes, this movie does have some memes in it as well as some websites, but at least they do serve a purpose to the plot. When Ralph and Vanellope go to eBay, it actually serves a purpose to the plot and actually does do something funny. For the most part the movie does tend for the characters to go to fictional websites or apps that don't exist in real life. It's how I feel animated movies should be done. Being driven creatively by filmmakers and not by greedy executives. As for the animation, it's once again amazing for Disney. The world of the Internet has lots of unique places and is so vast and open that I wanted to see a lot more of it kind of like the worlds of ""Inside Out"" and ""Zootopia"". As for the characters, they were easily the heart of the movie. The new ones were fun with my favorite being J.P. Spamley. I do love how although what he does is essentially annoying and will drive people crazy, he actually ends up being very likable and pretty friendly to Ralph and Vanellope. There's also a hilarious moment involving the Disney Princesses from Snow White to Moana and having the voice actors who originally played most of them come back to reprise their roles really was a bonus. Their appearance even led to a hilarious song number written by the legendary Alan Menken. I laughed pretty hard during the entire number. Though the real heart of the movie comes down to Ralph and Vanellope's friendship. It was something I loved in the first movie and seeing it be developed even more and fleshed out was something I really wanted to see. Even a scene at the ending involving them actually nearly made me cry. I think the duo really has developed since the first film. As far as problems go, I do think the movie is a bit too slow at times especially during the climax. I also did want to see a little more of Felix and Calhoun (Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch) as I really liked them in the first movie but were barely in this movie. Though since the movie is really Ralph and Vanellope's story, I think that's really only a nitpick.I still think ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is still a very fun sequel. The story had lots of heart to it and was very fun and clever, the animation was gorgeous and the world of the Internet was very creative, and the old characters were all lots of fun to see again while the new character really did make me laugh. I really did have a lot of fun with this film. It may not be the best animated movie sequel of the year as I think ""Incredibles 2"" is still the best, but it's still a pretty close second.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

This is about the Internet, not arcade games, and it does handle it pretty well, I do admit. I love the Easter eggs to Disney's movies - such as Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the scenes with the Disney's Princesses (one of my favourite scenes in the entire movie) and it certainly has its emotional weight and good themes.

It starts off okay if slowly, then rapidly descends into a shill piece for Star Wars and the other Disney franchises--mostly any movie with a princess in it.Ralph was the hero last time, this time he's just Penelope's idiot sidekick. Take that for what it's worth. He's basically used as a foil so the movie can ultimately deliver it's lame ""if you love something, set it free"" message. It seems Disney is afraid of strong male characters.The first film had a wealth of interesting secondary characters, this one just has lame parent and Internet jokes and no depth. I really wish they'd left well enough alone. There's a couple of laughs, but mostly just tears for what they did to this. Even the music is substantially inferior to the original.Despite all that, it's shiny and topical, so I'm sure most kids will like it. Until they grow up, that is.

In reality, both films are scrounging at the bottom of the barrel as far as kids flicks go. I can't totally pan either one because they, unfortunately, both kept my daughter's attention to varying degrees. But I'd flip the script and say that The Emoji Movie is slightly better because its insane premise was conjured first. The bar is low. Sorry, sweatpants princesses. Ideally, one would stay away from both of these on the general principle that they--apart from trying to ruin your brain with their maddeningly fast-paced content--they fall prey to being straight-up, pro-consumerist garbage; I think the viewer is literally subjected to the freakin' Pinterest logo at least 100 times in the final fifteen minutes of Ralph Breaks the Internet for no reason whatsoever.

I'm gonna make a Wreck-It Ralph very soon, so I can get deep through all of that. So let's leave Wreck-It Ralph for its review and let's get to Ralph Breaks the Internet, shall we?Ralph Breaks the Internet is honoring its source material, but deeper and funnier than the first one, with lots of Easter Eggs, even more than Ready Player One! It's still not that confusing deep for kids, it's about friends and how we must just let them go forward with their life, I'll stop here for not spoiling anything. Anyways its message is so clear, obvious and easy to get, and it's so important for everyone's life: kids, teenagers and adults. This movie's so valuable for everyone, liked it or not, you gonna see it's point and it will touch deep into your heart.I enjoyed Ralph Breaks the Internet as must as I did with Wreck-It Ralph, beside how deep it was, there wasn't any hidden stuff for adults, it was so obvious, Shank (voiced by Gal Gadot) was just saying the point and the message of this movie so out loud so kids won't be confused, but it's not like Zootopia which had lots of hidden messages beside it's main obvious one. It's also so emotional, it actually made me cry a lot, that's a thing the first one didn't do.Also sometimes it was so fast, but still it explained enough. Anyways, don't go exacting a twist like the first time, because this one is so direct.There's another message about how negatively can the internet goes, and how you hurt everyone's feelings by your idiotic and rude responses. It's so valuable as well, but it's more effective for adults.The characters are so good, the voices are amazing, especially John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman and Gal Gadot, they were amazing! The story is very good, fast and valuable, but my only issue with it, is that I wanted a twist to surprise me, but I didn't find one, for that I'm gonna give Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 an A.Alright, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, and supporting my stuff.

Six years after the events of the first film, Vanellope von Schweetz had become bored with her game Sugar Rush, having won so numerously, that she no longer felt that since of thrill at the prospect of there being any unpredictability in her life. After an accident causes Vanellope's game to be unplugged, Ralph and Vanellope decide to travel through the internet after they had noticed that the owner of the arcade had just installed wifi.To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to the movie because I was worried that since the film concerned the internet, I thought this was going to be another Emoji Movie disaster. And the fact that they were showing off all of their subsidiaries through ""Oh My Disney"" from Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, I thought they were making another movie to show off their brands. But, this film was actually pretty good. For the most part, the friendship between Ralph and Vanellope is as strong as ever. The film also makes a point with showing how you shouldn't be too clingy with your friends, and more importantly, if you feel that your friend has any issues with you, the best course if action is to speak with them about your concerns. It shows that even if you have a friend that doesn't share your interests, it shouldn't interfere with your friendship.
The animation of the film is great as always when it comes to Disney. When people log into the internet, they are represented by a blocky sprite, and they are then placed into a hovercraft to travel to the source of where the website they had found would be. Oh My Disney is also very well-designed.As for the rest, Ralph and Vanellope are given more spotlight as they were the leading characters which does come with its issues such as making characters from the previous movie such as Fix-It Felix and Sergeant Calhoun minor characters when I felt that it would've been more interesting to see how they managed to take care of 15 racers from Sugar Rush. The new characters are interesting such as Shank who is one of the characters on an online game called Slaughter Race. Her purpose is making Vanellope realize just what she was looking for, and then there's Yesss, who is the physical manifestation of an algorithm for a fictional website called BuzzzTube, a parody of YouTube. Unlike with the first film, there is no bad guy in the sequel. Instead, the main conflict is the result of Ralph's rash decisions and clinginess when it came to Vanellope. It is amazing at the level of restraint that Disney had to have probably performed to have no villain in the film other than the antagonistic force being the result of circumstances that go out of the characters' control.
Overall, I enjoyed Ralph Breaks the Internet, and I feel that its themes on friendship are more pronounced in this film as it speaks on things that most films would tend to look past. If you enjoyed the original film, this is a fun little film to see.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Wreck it Ralph is a well crafted, well paced, rich nostalgic adventure of interrelations between varying diverse characters.

204,ElliesWonder,"Pop culture movie: It's good, but it can be better.",7,23 December 2018,"Watched in the theater on thanksgiving day with family, and the movie wasn't as good as I expected, it lets me down because we made this movie into the schedule after the dinner, otherwise I would just go to shop on the thanksgiving day.What I like:
The movie usually started not bad, the first half part was fun, the introductive internet world is cute, everyone can find common online things we use daily. I even spot the Ads like Purple the pillow brand. The car racing is exciting, and the adventure in Disneyland is fun, the princesses talk is hilarious.(The princess theory is so sarcastic funny, good job Disney, but I think I watched this part in the trailer. So it's still funny but not surprising.)What I dislike: The main storyline was simple, kinda cliche with the misunderstanding the mad at each other and be friend again story, I can not say it is so very intriguing. The visualized internet world is nothing new either, I was not amused after watching emojis movie and the Ready Player 1, those pop culture background settings are similar by visualized internet features into a 3D world, made 2D characters lively and interacted with each other.In summary, even the storyline is weak, but who cares, it's good enough to be a holiday family movie, perfectly suitable for kids, no harms no bad influence. And Adults can also entertain ourselves by checking out pop culture Easter eggs. Ticket worthy, but i expected the movie can be better.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

209,Clank_Zoka,Disney's Better Version of the Emoji Movie,10,2 December 2018,"I thought the first Wreck-It Ralph was a fantastic animated film, it has good heart, great characters, a enjoyable story, great animation and a nice tribute to video-games, one of the best Disney 3-D Animated films out there, but when I heard there is going to be a sequel to the movie, I was very excited to see more adventures of Ralph and Vanellope, however the idea is about them about going to the Internet, hmm..... okay that does sound like a great idea, it could be the better version of the Emoji Movie, so when the film got released on the 30th of November in the UK, of course I had to go and see it, saw the movie yesterday and...... well I also really liked it, maybe not quite as fantastic as the first but still, let's talk about it.So it takes place six years after the first movie and the plot is that Sugar Rush's steering wheel is broken, so that means Vanellope and the citizens of Sugar Rush will have nowhere to go, so when a new plug is put in called the Internet, Ralph and Vanellope decide to go in to try and get another steering wheel before Sugar Rush gets unplugged, so that's basically it, but there's a lot more to it then that, first off the friendship between Ralph and Vanellope is still present and it is relatable, the humour is really good and also very clever with all the references, self-awareness and even feeling somewhat of a satire of the Internet, so it does play around with the idea of what the Internet would really be like inside, at the same delivering a good moral, all the different places Ralph and Vanellope go to are creative and fun to watch, like Slaughter Race, Buzzztube, Oh My Disney and many more, it's also not all that predicable which is good for me, granted the ending is somewhat questionable despite the fact I like the ending, but I didn't really know where it was going, other issue is that the subplot involving Fix-It Felix and Calhoun is really pointless, didn't add anything to the movie, it could of been funny, but lasted about five minutes, it may not be all that original, but the writing, the humour, the heart, the clever references, cameos and a interesting idea, it gives the movie a lot to work from and bring a lot of great stuff together.The animation I think is Disney at it's best, it's attention to detail, from the video game world, to the Internet, and the many websites that are there, the backgrounds look colour and beautiful, the characters are all each identifiable by design and all look great, Slaughter Race looks like a really deadly GTA game, Buzzztube is full of colour and the licensed websites like eBay, Google, Facebook, YouTube and Amazon all look pretty great as well, all the famous video game characters are still there and the Disney characters too and they are very well designed, the new characters look great also, the animation from Disney always finds a way to impress even more and this one is no exception, it's properly Disney at it's best.The characters are still great a second time and the new ones are just as equally fun, Ralph and Vanellope are still great as they were before, Ralph is still lovable, sweet and funny as ever, Vanellope is still the enjoyable, fun and cute little brat as she was, she's properly one of the best characters in the film, Felix and Calhoun don't appear in the film that long so not much to say about them, as for the new characters, they are also lots of fun and great, Shank (Gal Gadot) is cool and is pretty helpful, Yesss and her assistant Maybe are great supporting characters, Spamley and his friend Gord are really funny characters and also my favourite characters in the film, Knowsmore is really funny and clever, but then the princesses that appear a lot in the trailers are not in the film that long, granted they are funny in one scene but that's about it, oh and there will be lots of cameos of a lot of Disney characters..... so if you are like me, you'll geek out, the voice acting is still great a second time, John C. Reilly is still excellent as Ralph, Sarah Silverman is cute at Vanellope, Gal Gadot is cool and fitting for the tough Shank, Taraji P. Henson is fun as Yesss, Bill Hader is a national treasure so of course he'll be great as Spamley, everyone also do a great job with their roles, even the well known princesses have got their voice actresses back, the characters old and new are fun and the voice acting is top notch, but Ralph and Vanellope certainly are great main characters.Maybe not better then the first movie but on par of the first movie, granted it may have me leaving questions by the end of the movie and one character may do a one thing that is considered bad, but besides that, I had a blast with this movie, it has a great plot, with clever Disney, Internet references, funny, touching, enjoyable moments, amazing animation and some great characters along with great voicing, if you like the first movie, you'll like this one as well, if you like Disney, or anything related to it like Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars or even the licensed websites like YouTube, Facebook and all that, then you'll like it, if you think the idea of the movie will just be like the Emoji Movie then you won't like it, but I can happily say it's waaaaaay better then that pile of garbage, because come on.... it's Disney what can go wro-oh wait..., but none the less, do check this movie when you can.I'm going to give Ralph Breaks the Internet a 10/10.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
210,ACollegeStudent,Subpar sequel with a creepy main character dynamic,2,12 June 2021,Rating: 2.0The relationship between Vanellope and ralph was so cringe and creepy it tanked the whole movie.

212,hiraishinnojutsu,"Good for adults, enjoyable for kids, (a little bit) relatable for millenials",8,24 November 2018,"In the realm of referencing and paying homage to another franchises, ""Ready Player One"" is still the absolute monarch of all, but that's not the point of ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is, it's about having a dream, adventuring to a whole new bigger world by dealing with the fact that you need to sacrifice some or more things to achieve that without losing the other more important things that makes us who we are (like family and friendship, which constantly become the apparent theme among disney movies). Despite the message, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" doesn't fall to far in front of the firs movie, which means, it's not overwhelmingly good, it's a little bit better though, and has a more mature, clearer moral of the story. still, some important characters that made the first movie feels so alive were disproportionately off screen most of the time. I know this franchise doesn't bear their names on the title, but still wouldn't it be more interesting if Ralph and Venellope venture the unknown and dangerous realm of the Internet with them?",Ralph Breaks the Internet

215,RileyOnFilm,Not Wreck it Ralph but is it Better?,6,16 December 2018,"It's great when you see a sequel with your favorite character doing more of what you loved the first time. Due to mediocre writing and an attempt to be flash over story, this film quickly veers away from the first film. All is not lost though, the visuals are indeed amazing and enjoyable.One reason this film might have appeared out there and disjointed was because there are two directors. I really don't see that much. It could be like having 2 kings or 2 cooks on one stove. Like they say, ""too many cooks spoil the broth.""Vannelope and Ralph have a complicated friendship. In a way, it appears to go beyond friendship and at the same time, he has a unselfish affection for her that allows him to not be possessive and let go. It's probably out of place for me to compare their characters to romantic lovers because they act like young kids. Still, the promos with all the Disney princesses along with that scene in the film allude to a woman's success in life owing to a man. It's sort of #metoo and sort of not. I didn't like the foggy lines of their relationship. I wish it were more clearly defined. It made the story uncomfortable at times and I forgot I was supposed to be having childlike fun. But there is still lots to enjoy in this film.The visuals in this film come at you non-stop. I had a feeling about the visuals like I did when I saw ""Trolls"" for the first time. It was all inventive technology with a human element. In other words, it wasn't just like a strobe in your face. There are so many amazing visuals but probably my absolute favorite was at the end when all the little Ralphs form on monstrous one. That most have taken tons of code and animation science to pull off.To close, this sequel is highly visual and very exciting. The story and it's character dynamics are very flawed in my opinion. I really felt they though the visuals were enough and so they skimped on story. It is rather good though and I would recommend you take your kids to it. It is nowhere near the masterpiece of the original ""Wreck it Ralph"" and that was a let down. 6/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet

217,dineshaishu,Ralph breaks the internet,10,21 May 2019,"The movie still has a lot to show through their adventure...The best part as everyone who watched the trailer knows it.. none other than the most ambitious Disney crossover... Honestly, the movie would've been nothing without their involvement. I really hoped they had shown more of it... It left a great potential for a sequel or a spin-off where Disney could make a great use of it with all their fan-favorite franchises!!!The only flaw I felt was like Disney again making the same mistake they've been doing for the sequels of most of their animated movies, Incredibles 2, Finding Dory, Monsters University, like all these movies were just to bring back the fan favorite characters on screen again but the story is just small... Even though they're entertaining to watch... all these movies kinda drag their story till the end and just finishes off like that!!! Hopefully, we might be getting a good potential sequel where they could do it better with the story!!!But most of us are just gonna ignore those factors... Wreck-It Ralph 2 has everything you need, it's really entertaining, stunning visuals, dramatic, groundbreaking sequences and I've enjoyed it so much!!",Ralph Breaks the Internet
218,JTurner82,Disappointing and inferior sequel reeking of commercialism.,4,25 November 2018,"The original WRECK-IT-RALPH was hardly a Disney classic, but that film was nonetheless a clever commentary on videogames and provided a sense of comical, imaginative, tongue-in-cheek humor. RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET, on the other hand, has only the occasional clever moment and at least one compelling concept. That concept, the visualization of the internet world, a sort of futuristic city straight out of one of the STAR WARS prequels, is admittingly impressive and imaginative. Sadly, that's the only good thing about this sequel, which otherwise ranks as one of the weakest Disney animated films I've seen in a long time. In trying to top everything that made the original so great, it ultimately trips over itself. It also reeks of commercialism as well; there's a painfully unnecessary sequence in which the princesses from previous Disney films show up in cameos. The primary reason seems to be to sell more merchandise and cheap laughs more than anything else. The film really hits rock bottom when Venelope sings a song clearly belonging in a better movie. Her deliberately shrill, tonedeaf singing voice -- intended for laughs -- again, falls flat, as do most of the jokes in this movie. Even the chemistry between the two leads doesn't have the same sincerity or heart as the original. This is mostly a noisy, frantic, emotionless, soulless mess with no heart. The filmmakers attempt to redeem this mess by shoehorning a ""toxic friendship"" message, but that moral has been done better, and is nowhere nearly as lame as this. Kids might get a kick out of this, and I can see why some internet nerds would gravitate to it, but on the whole, this is a major disappointment from the House that Walt built. Even the original was far more fresh and entertaining than its successor.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Then Ralph picked up all the sense of loss and continued to work life. Even if it's all without Vanellope.Maybe this is growing up.

222,CrazyCockatoo2003,THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE BY ANYONE,1,23 February 2020,"This movie has so many flaws and plot holes that I may as well write it all here. Sure, the original was a great movie and one of Disney's best projects. Even the tie-in game to the original game made for various Nintendo consoles was enjoyable. But this.... this was a total abomination. This is a movie that tried to cash in on the success of the original and Disney in general but failed and they even failed trying to straight-up copy and paste one of the best-worst movies I have ever seen: The Emoji Movie.What went wrong:There are record breaking amounts of product placement seen in this movie from start to finish. Literally. The amount of product placement in The Emoji Movie is nothing when in comparison with this. While the product placement in The Emoji Movie starts from the 20 minute mark until the 1 hour and 5 minute mark, this has product placement from the 1 minute mark until the 1 hour and 52 minute mark. Meaning that The Emoji Movie has 40 minutes of product placement when in comparison with this movie having around 1 hour and 30 minutes of product placementWhy would a small girl like Vanellope be allowed to drink beer at her age. Must I explain more about why drinking underage is illegal?The product placement here ranges from brand names, video game references and anything Disney related.Forced in burping jokes in the opening scene.Felix and Calhoun hardly appear in the movie at all.Ralph is out of character and is reduced to an insecure idiot. This makes his character development in the original now invalid.Ralph going turbo during game hours and no one calling him out for doing so like they did in the original movie.Many of the jokes here are very unfunny.The way the internet has been interpreted in this movie is a straight up ripoff of The Emoji Movie even though people made claims for The Emoji Movie ripping off Wreck it Ralph 1 but the way I see it, The Emoji Movie took major aspects from Wreck it Ralph 1. So basically, Sony's animated movie, The Emoji Movie ripped off Wreck it Ralph 1 and Disney decided to get revenge by ripping off The Emoji Movie in Wreck it Ralph 2(this movie).Plenty of outdated memes can be found here like the cat videos and the Rickroll in the second end credits scene.Poor representation of celebrities like Beyoncé.Ralph and Vanellope are portrayed as dumb in the Ebay scene with them bidding way more then they are supposed to and Ralph guessing the credit card number.Slaughter Race is a straight up ripoff of Grand Theift Auto Online.Overuse of such references to the game Fortnite as seen with the Fortnite logo appearing on the globe of locations, the Battle Bus appearing on Maybe's screen and Ralph doing various Fortnite dances in the disco barn from Fortnite including Ralph's own dance: The Hot Marat.The Shank theme song is unbearably bad.Yessss is a horrible character because of her behaviour. In fact, she is worse than Gene ever was.Horrible character names like Yesss and Maybe.It teaches people bad life lessons. One of which teaches kids to take selfishness over friendships as shown with that a-hole Vanellope taking Slaughter Race over her best friend, Ralph.The god awful bee puns that make you cringe on every corner.This film tries to capitalise on trends like the screaming goat, Rickrolling, Fortnite and more.Vanellope is more annoying than ever and her ""Steering Wheel Song"" being way beyond annoying.This film takes place around the same time as the real world, back when this film first released. HOW ORIGINAL!The Oh My Disney scene is full of shameless as hell self promotion, containing almost every property Disney ever owned at the time.The terrible remix of Let it Go.The Disney princess scene is possibly one of the worst scenes in the entire movie, consisting forcing in cameos of every Disney Princess ever created, a plot hole involving this film forgetting about Vanellope wanting to be a president instead of a princess as conveyed in the original just so they can make the ""Are you a Princess?"" joke, the steering wheel song that Vanellope sings, the quick tune that Snow White sings and Vanellope turning all of those princesses into Tumblur stereotypes.Around the 1 hour mark, after Ralph gets the steering wheel, Vanellope then turns into an a-hole by wanting to stay in Slaughter Race rather than be with Ralph. This turns into two more plot holes: as Vanellope leaves Ralph and moves into Slaughter Race, this film ignores that if this was done in the original, this would be considered as Vanellope going turbo and that if she was to die outside her game, she would not respawn.The main villain of this movie being a Giant Ralph virus is the single most bland villain ever created.The tie-in game to this movie on mobile is just a Pacman Mobile spinoff with Ralph characters. This game also shows how greedy the company Disney is by only giving you a demo set of levels charging you $3 each for just ONE set of levels.The scene where Ralph wears a princess outfit is only there as an attempt to get a cheap laugh out of everyone.Too many emotional scenes.Ralph is even more of a ""diaper baby"" than he was in the original.The ending here is good enough to end the series but the problem here is that it caused the same splitting up ending to happen in every animated Disney sequel from now on.The first end credits scene where the rabbit blows up is mainly put in for shock value, like how Jailbreak imagined Gene blowing up in the Candy Crush scene in The Emoji Movie just because she wanted to match him with the yellows but in reality, Gene was sent to the jar where the special candies were stored.
Redeeming qualities:At least the first 10-15 minutes of this movie stays true to the original source material.Use of the Die-fi joke when the security guard tells the video game characters not to enter the internet or they will die.Some of the score music is impressive.At least some places like Knowsmore is original unlike everything else.Some references to the original have been made in this sequel.The animation.The racoon speaks the truth about Vanellope's steering wheel song as it is a horrible song.There is a scene where Ralph reads hate comments and gets offended, which proves that you can't please everyone and how you should ignore the haters.At least Ralph understands that Vanellope was willing to ditch everyone in Sugar Rush and go turbo just so she can live in that GTA Online ripoff while he was only trying to prevent her from doing so.Although Felix and Calhoun did barely appeared at all, they made the most of their appearance, with these characters ONLY having the same charm as they did in Wreck it Ralph 1.So overall, this so called ""film"" is not really a film at all but rather a 2 hour ad with endless plot holes. Even The Emoji Movie, being a 90 minute ad has a more pleasant story than this film ever had. This is a shameless sequel to Wreck it Ralph and I am over the top disappointed. I only decided to watch the movie a second time because I was dared to and I wanted to write a very negative review for this movie. The first time I watched this, I DEEPLY regret not walking out of this movie before it finished as this was THE WORST MOVIE I have ever seen in my entire life. This makes the film it ripped of: The Emoji Movie look like a masterpiece when in comparison with this movie.After this, Disney started to release more pointless sequels and even more pointless remakes that no one asked for. They even bought FOX and ruined The Simpsons as shown in Seasons 30 onwards. This is what made me lose faith in Disney. I swear to never go to another movie in theaters directly made by Disney ever again although I will still watch Marvel movies in theaters with other people. I might never want to PAY for anything Disney related ever again. After watching this film, I gave away EVERY piece of Wreck it Ralph merchandise I had ever owned to one of my friends who used to be a hardcore fan of Wreck it Ralph and he also thought this was the worst movie he ever watched. I had given all my merchandise to the ex-fan of Wreck it Ralph except for the Nintendo DS game based off the first movie of the same name. Why the hell did I waste 6 years on this sequel only to be let down massively. Glad I borrowed the movie off someone for free just so I can watch this for the second and final time just for reviewing purposes. I will never watch this abomination ever again.First time I watched this: I wanted to leave the cinema during the movie and not come back.Second time I watched this: I wanted to click the stop button during the movie, click X to exit the movie and delete the movie right after I stop it so that I never had to watch it ever again.Although Wreck it Ralph 1 is a great movie, Wreck it Ralph 2 is simply the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life so far.In conclusion, if you are a Wreck it Ralph fan still wanting to see this sequel, either: re-watch the original movie instead, watch The Emoji Movie(the movie this film ripped off) or watch this sequel on Disney+ so you don't have to pay up to $7 to rent this movie to most likely be left disappointed after waiting at least 6 years for this sequel. Better yet, I recommend that you avoid this sequel at all costs to avoid disappointment or worse. Thank you for your time.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

224,Blazehgehg,Not really what I expected,6,18 June 2019,"There are a lot of ways you could write a movie about retro video game characters launching themselves in to the internet. A lot of retro video game culture lives on the internet for a lot of different reasons (history, preservation, let's play videos), and there are fun ways to play with that idea.Ralph Breaks the Internet instead aims for the lowest common denominator, with an extremely basic story that's more interested in reminding you how much pop-culture Disney owns.The problem as I see it is that Ralph Breaks the Internet kind of feels like a mediocre episode of The Simpsons: the opening minutes often see Homer Simpson do something dangerously stupid, causing the family to go on an adventure as he also uses his stupidity to solve the same problem he created. Except here, the stand-in for Homer is Wreck-it Ralph, who, along with his friend Vanellope, seem to have been made dumber since the first movie, because dumber is funnier.That's the theory, anyway.A lot of the movie is way more interested in flashing endless internet brands in your face while selling an outsider's idea of internet culture. Ralph stumbles through most of the story, both causing and solving every problem with the same clumsy luck. Every now and then there's a spark of something fun or interesting, but it's usually instantly buried by surface-level ""Remember this?"" references to pop culture, or weak gestures at vague internet memes.Meanwhile, concepts like unscrupulous banner ads or clickbait are brushed off as funny, charming (and maybe even friendly!) quirks of the world wide web, even when they possibly lead you to legitimately destructive malware.When the movie stops being ""a tour through the internet as told by someone who only reads Facebook"" and actually focuses on a real plot, namely Ralph's unintentionally abusive behavior, the movie finally finds a stable footing to tell a story. That story still managed to pack an emotional punch for me, but it would have been nice if it had more room to breathe in the first half of the movie. Ralph Breaks the Internet definitely ends stronger than it starts.Ultimately, it doesn't live up to its full potential. There's a better story to tell with these characters and this concept, but Disney instead chose to front-load the movie with 45 minutes of pop-up advertisements. Ironic considering the themes of the movie, but not always the most enjoyable thing to watch.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

There are some that do it on their own cool but to claim the ones who did need someone there for them then claim they were just stepping stones is uncool af.I'm not normally the type to look into SJW stuff but when its blantly obvious and pushed down my throat especially one specific scene of them springing into action most know what I'm talking about.Stop forcing strong women in this stuff, do it naturally like The Boys did. That was how girls get it done. I loved how they were just hardcore/idgaf girls who beat the heck out of anyone else.

226,ty-jensen,Decent Movie,4,2 December 2018,"I seen Ralph Breaks The Internet today although I haven't seen Wreck It Ralph yet. If it were on Netflix Canada, I would have seen it by now. I'm not a huge Disney fan and I rarely watch family friendly animated stuff. I'm writing this review because I don't feel like making a video review, I'm a YouTuber and seeing a random review link motivated me to write this.Ralph Breaks The Internet was fine, it's entertaining but forgettable. The story was fine, Ralph and Vanellope are exploring the Internet searching for a new steering wheel for the Sugar Rush arcade game. Disney is family friendly so the Internet can't have any edgy stuff including the Dark Web. There isn't a lot of advertising, at least I don't think so. I guess The Emoji Movie shoves product placement down your throat.The animation is beautiful, I heard it's better than the first movie's animation but it looks the same to me. The humor was fine, I mostly smiled. I laughed out loud only three times. The kids in my theater laughed several times.
I don't regret seeing Ralph Breaks The Internet and I'll definitely see Wreck It Ralph eventually. If you love Disney, you should like this. Kids can easily enjoy this, the virus can scare any kid.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
227,Rat_27,How to love the friendzone,1,10 March 2019,"This is a garbage tier movie. It only serves as product placement for Disney, and it will not survive the test of time. All of the pop culture jokes will be lost over the next few years, and that is half of the movie.There is not a strong plot, and it is hard to separate Venelope from Sarah Silverman's voice, and that gets to be annoying and grating.No one needs to watch this tripe.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

229,Lost_In_Translation_,A mediocre follow-up to a mediocre movie.,6,27 March 2019,"The first movie is one that I enjoyed decently. It wasn't the best, and compared to the Disney renewed renaissance with their princesses and Zootopia it lacked very much the same quality of those. I enjoyed the video game references as I've played them since I was a kid.Now after seeing the trailer for this one I was skeptical that it was just The Emoji Movie Part 2. In many ways it is and does take the whole internet jokes a bit too far sometimes. And much like the first one, the plot revolves around them yet again fixing a problem that they caused. It just made it that less interesting when yet again Ralph must fix a problem that he created in the first place. The first half of the movie is just them trying to earn money through odd jobs to buy a replacement wheel for Vanellope's arcade game. The 2nd half is Vanellope realizing that she may want to stay in the Internet and not return to Sugar Rush.Disney referencing itself was a hit or miss. The princess scene is the only thing worth seeing the movie for in the long run. As a huge TRON fan I was ecstatic that there was a big reference to it, but it's short and at the beginning. A few annoying YouTubers make cameos, but to those not knowing who they are it will just be another random character. It's easy to see the first movie was more for the older people with the arcade references, and this is for the kids with their internet meme references.As for the side characters, these ones lacked quite a bit. Felix and Calhoun were funny and endearing. Yess was just annoying, and Shank with the other Slaughter Race side people weren't anything interesting. Vanellope is actually less annoying in this one than the first, so that is a plus.It's a bit of a mixed bag that is an alright and somewhat entertaining movie. It's just not on the same level that Disney has been at for the past decade starting with Tangled and the rest. The TRON scene and the princess scenes are really the only must see parts of it if you're a fan of either, but a visit to YouTube can get you everything you need to see out of this movie.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
230,SebMoz,Damn you Disney,3,28 October 2020,"I am a big fan of the original Wreck-it-Ralph, and while I do think it wrapped up its story very nicely, I was still excited about the sequel. Having a movie centered around video games gives you almost endless possibilities when it comes to expanding the world the characters traverse. Unfortunately though, this movie takes advantage of none of that. The internet isn't presented in an interesting way, it's just a blue wasteland with a lot of product placement for big corporations, as well as brands Disney own. The movie does have some good element, namely the animation and the princess scenes, which unlike everything else actually gave me joy. This isn't enough to save the movie though. The thing that bothered me the most was definietly the complete destruction of the characters. Ralph went from a likable everyman who was tired of not getting any recognition, to a slobbering baby who does all kinds of stupid stuff just because Vanillope isn't doing exactly what he wants. Meanwhile Vanillope goes from an energetic little girl to an egoistic brat who doesn't consider other peoples needs when she acts. And Felix and Calhoun, who were greatly entertaining in the first movie, are practically non-existent in this movie despite there being set up a great subplot where they adopt the Sugar Rush racers. This subplot happens entirely off-screen, which was a big dissapointment to me. I also think that the movie does not deliver its main message very smoothly, and the climax feels a little unearned. There are also a few REALLY bad plot-holes here and there. And on top of that, the humor isn't even good. Overall, I didn't really find this movie very good, and it's only a few really good scenes that keeps it from being a complete disaster. Still, it's not a movie I recommend to people who likes animation as an artform.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The story turned sweet when Vanellope decided to pursue her dreams in a kind fashion, leaving Ralph to accept the fact that relationships change. He's had Vanellope as BFF for six years, although I didn't quite catch that in viewing that it had been that long. The remarkable wealth of references made me dizzy in a happy way, the animation astounded, and the Disney princesses, er, ruled. They were worth the price of admission alone; to get them all interacting must have been daunting in both ""pajama party"" and ""action girl"" scenes.

The story talks about the friendship of Ralph and Vanellope (two video games'characters). They make everything together. But Ralph acidentally breaks the Vanellope's game and they must go in the new ""game"": Internet, to find a spare spart. We enter in the fabulous world of Internet! In the movie, we can see lot of applications, games or websites (all things we can find on Internet) like Facebook, Twitter, eBay, Youtube or Pinterest but unfortunaltly the dark net too. The animators made a really good job to find the representations of the diferent websites and this is what I loved. The birds for twitter, the virus, the Pinterest tower... It's interesting to see how they make and we can think it's the same in the real life. The movie make me laugh at some moments and it was so great. It's the film to see!",Ralph Breaks the Internet

238,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Stunning and hilarious but ultimately a let down for me,6,21 November 2018,"Wreck it Ralph 2:
I don't wanna be negative Nancy on this one but I have to be honest. Wreck it Ralph 2 or Ralph Breaks the Internet, was a let down for me. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good stuff in this movie, but in the end it fell short. It didn't deliver the promise of a true sequel to the things I personally enjoyed about the first film. It actually made me wonder if a sequel was even a good idea to begin with. The story tackles some real questions about friendships and growing up but not in a very comforting way. It makes me worry if this is not the best movie to send a message like this to younger audiences. Disney is known for being subtle when it comes to real world lessons but they've been more on the nose recently and it's starting to show some cracks. The movie doesn't carry over fun characters like Felix or Calhoun for anything more than cameos and that was super disappointing. They're replaced by new supporting characters like Gal Gadot's Shank and while the character design is spot on , she doesn't really add much to the story other than to move Vanellope's character along. All the best parts are in the trailers, in particular the Disney Princess cameos which is still hilarious but would've been more impactful if you didn't anticipate the jokes they had already shown. I actually hated the way they treated Ralph and Vanellope's characters in this movie. Granted they needed new obstacles for their relationship but it's almost like they're totally different characters from the last movie. Their personalities are inconsistent and I personally felt they said things that were totally out of character. It's hard to not like parts of this movie as it displays some stunning animation and carries plenty of good humor to keep you entertained. I just had to be straight up about how disappointed I was with this one. The first movie was appealing to me because of its love letter to gamers and the retro nostalgia in all of us who grew up with arcades and old school gaming. Yet at the center of it is a nice story about outcasts and accepting yourself for who you are. This movie took that away from me a little bit and I'm bummed I didn't love this movie more. It tried something different but it ultimately got too realistic for me and it made me emotionally unsettled. But not in the right ways. I still recommend you go see it as it has awesome animation and fantastic jokes but I don't know if I would buy this one. I'd like to just pretend it ends with the first movie. 6/10.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
239,andrewtisler,"Ralph Breaks the Internet-an energetic, colorful, and well-paced sequel that improves on its predecessor by expanding its virtual universe with new fantastic locations",10,9 October 2021,"Back in 2012, Disney's ""Wreck-It Ralph"" released to overwhelming positive reception and commercial hit. The animation, humor, characters, and storytelling all made it a strong win for Walt Disney Animation Studios. Six years later, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" gets released, continuing the adventures of Ralph and Vanellope. This was a really great sequel, full of funny humor, stylish, colorful animation, and a surprisingly poignant message about toxic friendships.Set six years after the events of the first film, Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz are now best friends, and frequently hang out outside of their own games after the arcade closes. However, Vanellope has recently been questioning her life in ""Sugar Rush"", as the game is becoming too easy for her and everything about it is the same every day. The next day when the arcade opens, Ralph and Vanellope find out that a Wi-Fi system has been plugged into Litwak's Arcade, leading to all sorts of websites, social media platforms, and online games. After taking a detour to a new track built by Ralph, the steering wheel of ""Sugar Rush"" gets broken off of the console, and so Ralph and Vanellope head into the internet to find a new steering wheel on eBay, but tension soon arises when Vanellope and Ralph attempt to steal the car of a lady named Shank in a dangerous online racing game called ""Slaughter Race"", where Vanellope wants to stay in the game because Shank relates to her insecurities. The story is well-paced and full of hilarious humor, earnest emotion, and some well-chosen pop culture references.I love Ralph's character development in this movie, too. At the start of the film, when Vanellope questions her role in her game, Ralph does not believe there is more to her character, having remembered that he once attempted to become something he is not, and is now content with his job as a wrecker. I also relate with his insecurities a lot, from the tension built up in his and Vanellope's relationship and when he has a hard time letting go of her and allowing her to achieve her dreams. The new characters in the movie are funny, quirky, and emotional, especially Shank and the head BuzzzTube algorithm Yesss, voiced by the scene-stealing Taraji P. Henson.The animation is incredible, even more realistic than the first film's. I love how quirky the designs and color palettes are, as well as the way they depict the internet in this movie as a big metropolis, compared with ""The Emoji Movie""'s portrayal of the internet as a singular device.The scenes with the Disney Princesses are also fun to watch, especially when they all work together and save Ralph from falling to his demise. It's a rare occasion to see them all together at the same time, so it was awesome that they were included in this movie. I especially love it when they decide to wear comfy clothes like Vanellope does.Overall, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" was a fun sequel, and a huge step up from the first ""Wreck-It Ralph"". I would definitely recommend it not only to Disney fans, but fans of pop culture gags and colorful imagery. Please check it out if you haven't done so yet!",Ralph Breaks the Internet

244,derangedxzombie,"Brilliant, but I have to address faults in some of the negative reviews",8,11 January 2019,"Disney did a pretty good job of making their physical interpretation of the internet that Ralph and Venellope venture to. I want to avoid giving any real spoilers away, so will just give vague references to parts in it.I quite enjoyed the movie, and there was many good cameo's squeezed in from popular culture and the net (references of memes to YouTube trends or challenges). There were a few moments that had me burst out laughing (probably the more adult moments involving a GTA styled game and the dark net which I'll get to in a bit). Plus the movie has a large host of characters you've seen elsewhere (some in the Disney universe itself). But there are some things mentioned by a few unjust low star reviews I'd like to expand upon.Possibly very mild spoilers ahead:
1) ""it's just a product placement cash grab"" I find this one quite humorous. If they made a film about the internet, why wouldn't it include websites from the net or references to them, that's what the whole film's about. Granted, Disney could've perhaps used similar but made up names for all the websites (as they did with YouTube in the movie, renaming it to Buzztube) and everyone still would've got it, but this makes no odds and doesn't detract from it at all, if anything makes it more authentic and relatable.2) ""it's not really for kids/my kid didn't like it"" I can partly understand this one for 2 reasons. Firstly there's some mildly intense moments, i.e parts from the films interpretation of an online GTA styled game (called Slaughter Race) with mild violence, plus the dark web. And in the 3rd quarter mildly heavy leanings to I don't know, friendship/SJW lessons? More on that in a minute.
Secondly, the fact some younger kids may not understand many internet references and sites, unfortunately not much can be done about this as the internet is what the movies about. Kids aged 9+ will probably get most of it, teenagers and younger adults especially. Some of the jokes or the song in Slaughter Racer made me laugh (I'm 27) but are geared more towards teenagers and adults also.3) ""it becomes a virtue signaling/SJW man hating thing"" This is yes and no. The 3rd quarter the film does start leaning a little heavily towards a lesson in friendship and being too clingy. Friendship and loss/rekindling of it are always a big underlying theme in Disney movies, their power I feel stems from never really mentioning it much, but being shown through actions and small cues shown to the viewer. Here it felt a little too authentic and obvious, or took out some of the enjoyment for a moment and I feel it could've been played down a bit instead of playing on the whole your enemy is your clingy self vibe. The SJW/misandry claims, well the main character is immature like his little friend but also quite emotional, I can't remember if this was as much the case in the first, and there are references from certain female characters about men being weak or turning round the idea of ladies always needing to be saved. These didn't really feel malicious or forced to me as with many other get woke go broke media we have currently. It felt a lot more light hearted here and to be humorous, and the end turns the tables with this message in a sweet way, so you can't really stay irked by it.Overall I really enjoyed it, I felt the first film had more variety of environments, and as mentioned above the 3rd quarter dampened the mood a smidge, but otherwise a very enjoyable film for me. An extra scene in the credits also had me burst out laughing.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

As a parent I hate that trope.
The good thing even though Ralph messes up his actions are the lesson for kids. Do what's right and fix your mistakes.

The spark of greatness that was in the original movie just isn't there. I'm not sure if it's because the video game aspect doesn't feel as strong in the game. Maybe because the plot didn't feel that strong.

I honestly did enjoy the film itself but what I go see this film again probably not unless it was a free ticket. What I buy this movie probably not because like I said I enjoyed the first film but the second film just didn't make me want to go out there and buy it the minute that it comes out on Blu-ray. No I did enjoy the princesses part of the film and there is a scene at the end of the movie which was in the trailer for pancake and milkshake believe that's what it was but you have to wait till the end credits to see it because they didn't put it into the movie that is kind of a spoiler but not really.

264,RustyShacklefordd,"OK Sequel, But Not as Good as The First",6,2 January 2019,"I really enjoyed the first Wreck It Ralph movie. This one is alright, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first.I thought the concept here was great, but the jokes and references just weren't quite as clever or funny and felt like they have already been done before or just plain outdated. Kids will probably find them funny, but for anyone older than 13 I don't think there is a lot here for them. This was clearly aimed more for kids than the last film was.On the good side, the animation does look great and there are still some funny moments and the film has a great message that I can appreciate. It wasn't by any means a bad film, but I expected more based on how good the last movie was. If you have kids then they will enjoy this, but for adults this is one you can probably wait to rent instead.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
265,paq5528,Downhill from the first,4,9 March 2019,"It would be difficult to recreate the novelty and nostalgic comedy of the first film. And this film doesn't even try. It looks firmly to the future of WiFi and social internet, the death knell of arcades everywhere. There is no optimism and comeraderie in this film. The entire premise is negative emotions like jealousy and insecurity. And it also throws on a great big dollop of men are bad, women are always good revisionism. While Ralph is loyal and caring, he is the anchor.
I somply can't recommend this movie on several levels. There is really little entertainment, there is not much of a happy ending, and the movie is completely rife with product placements, making it look like a hi-tech commercial more than a movie at times. Can you guess 3 of the major retail and e-commerce brands that showed up? Sure you can, completely obvious.
The film also seems to encourage poor and stupid online behavior as a way to make money. A lot of money.....simply by doing and posting stupidity. I absolutely hated that aspect.
In short, it lost the charm of the first, it has a bad plot, it is biased, and it encourages stupid behaviors for unrealistic financial gain. It had some moments of amusement and it has a high production value, but I'd rather rewatch the first than ever watch this one again.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

This film succeeds in being different, not making the internet entirely cliche and making it quite fun, the movie is fun and entertaining, and it has stakes.

A shocking advertising campaign for some of the biggest and some of the worse things on the internet. It must have cost Disney nothing to make this after they charged all the companies who are splattered all over the screen.

270,Ryan_Barbakins,Internet Movie Surprisingly has Heart,7,18 May 2019,"Ralph Breaks The Internet is an emotional roller coaster filled with cameos from your favorite Disney and Pop culture films.
The amount of internet and pop culture references in this film are quite high, however they do it in a way that is not only hilarious, but also works with the entire film's premise. If you are going in expecting a non meta film, you won't have a good time. This film is probably the pinnacle of Disney making fun of itself. The scenes with the Disney Princesses are genius and will make any Disney Fanatic like myself. The Princesses also do make a return in the end which I do not want to spoil for those who haven't seen it, because it is just so great! There's a certain part in the middle of the film with Vanellope that I certainly was not expecting to happen, however I think it is such a genius way to not only make fun of themselves but also advance the plot of the story!
The setting design of the Internet is not only colorful and flashy, but probably the most fun way of interpreting the internet. Everyone online feels so connected despite not physically being there. The animation of course is great, but nothing too spectacular.
I was caught by surprise with the heavy friendship themes within this film. I don't think anyone was expecting this Internet film to be filled with such healthy and positive messages about friendships. Ralph and Vanellope feel a lot more close in this film compared to the last, and it makes for a fun and almost emotional experience seeing these characters back on the big screen.
Overall, a fun experience for that shouldn't be missed. Think of this as the Emoji Movie if it were actually a well organized and GOOD film.
Do not forget to stay for the 2 end credits scenes, because the last one is probably one of the greatest end credits scenes ever!",Ralph Breaks the Internet

272,kailomonkey,"Great sequel, loved the original, love this!",10,2 December 2018,"The trailers and Disney's history with sequels had me worried that Wreck-It Ralph in the Internet might let me down. I was wrong and the film is great, full of comedic technology references to games and sites. Ralph and Venellope's friendship is the centre of the story and every detail is entertaining and ingenius.The only point I would seriously make in criticism is that before the finale Ralph and Venellope conflict in a way that appeared to me a little reduced for simplicity and younger viewers, undermining their characters a little. It resolves the (controlling relationship) theme mostly in said finale but cops out a bit in terms of drama and kinda does throughout.This is the first Walt Disney Animation Studio animated movie sequel that uses the same writing/directing team as the original and it shows in that they ditched 2 less good initial scripts and went with one that was more true to the characters and the original. It also shows in the highest quality in most every detail right down to the credits.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
273,cinemawithcj,Ralph Breaks The Internet - Cinema with CJ Review,6,3 December 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is the sequel to the video game cameo-filled Wreck It Ralph that tries to do one better (and also dunk on The Emoji Movie) by taking things to the Internet.Now, I haven't seen The Emoji Movie to compare how effective or different or similar situations are with the interpretation of things like social media and the internet, but Wreck It Ralph does well to smartly translate a cartoonish interpretation of the workings of the internet.Both Ralph movies do get by a lot through clever twisting of cultural reference, whether that's a smart implementation of a character from a video game or a fun way to portray the way we interact with different media online or otherwise, but they are also helped by the heart that runs through its storylines.Ralph Breaks the Internet is full of heart. It carries the friendships established in the previous movie and runs with it. By that I mean mostly just Ralph and Vanelope. From an emotional standpoint, Ralph is great but also alienating to its younger audience with its musings on friendships and psychological explorations into insecurity of losing friends to their different paths in life.That alienation stands out a bit with Ralph Breaks the Internet. It's a bit like how the ideas behind The Incredibles - or any Brad Bird Disney/Pixar project - are definitely not for younger audiences when you strip away the bells and whistles. In Ralph Breaks the Internet, you get musings on whether a character should go to therapy, or references to the dark web, or the repercussions of buying without thinking on eBay. Hell, the best characters - the Disney princesses - are only at their true peak of humour when you've grabbed the concept of self-referential parody. The entire Oh My Disney sequence is brilliant...to the older audiences. Kids in my screening reacted strongest to Fortnite references and slapstick, but when things begin to feel like the ending of the video game The Matrix: Path of Neo, you could feel the room being lost.There is a feeling that with more modern, more aware Disney projects, you're catering to the older audiences. The Wreck It Ralph movies seem to be the prime target. And maybe it's good that we're playing with convention. Hell, one of the best sequences is a Disney musical number turned on its head perfectly.There are themes that truly resonate. Growing up, going in different directions from your friends, still being friends in spite of change and trajectory. Self consciousness, greed, jealousy, selfishness.So much humanity is seen in the digital avatars of Wreck It Ralph. So many funny turns of the mirror onto us and our use of technology.Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong audience. The audience I'm thinking of really is more Emoji Movie than Ralph Breaks the Internet. There's just something about so much brilliance going over kids' heads. Which admittedly is true of all good family movies. I feel a bit muddled, much like how muddled the motivations actually are in this movie. Both Ralph and Vanelope's journeys seem a bit lost, and a bit off. Where things must be contrived to make things work. Where the narrative feels like it hits the rock bottom moment, but then breaks through and goes further down before the climb to the top.The jokes are truly inspired, the new characters are quirky and fun, and the spirit of the film isn't lost from the change from video games to the internet. There are some truly thrilling animated sequences that make good use of the medium. Where Ralph breaks is in the storytelling. It, like Ralph in this film, is unsure of what it is. It overcompensates. It misdirects. It's saved by the Disney Princess All-Stars.And it has a brilliant mid-credits scene that works so darn well in context. So at least wait for that.Even if your little sister doesn't quite get why it's so funny.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

276,sonicheze8,Caught up by its own narrative,5,8 December 2018,"I loved the original Wreck It Ralph, it was fun and enjoyable, it didn't take itself more seriously that it had to be. The sequel unfortunately falls short from what made the first movie good, and suffers from its own narrative.While the beginning served only as a typical foreshadowing, it wasn't quickly fun from the get-go. It only became fun in the middle part when they reached the internet. With them serving up new ideas and often to-be-expected jokes on our favourite tool. But that was it, there was no villain and the movie ran out of ideas for the internet. So what they did just as every movie is forced to do nowadays is to make a bloated villain in the last act and try to make the audience care about it. Of course, that's not going to work as well as they thought because we have no reason to care that much about this finale because we already know that everything is going to turn out fine.Furthermore, the message in this movie is pushed really blatantly on the viewer. This being a Disney movie, often than not it appeals to a large spectrum of age groups. When the message of the movie is subtle, the children might not realized it until they are older but that's okay, because it might not affect them as much when their younger. But when the message is literally spoken out in the movie I can't help but wonder who this message will resonate with if it comes off so strongly. I don't know.Overall, even with all these flaws, the movie can be quite funny, with meta humor as it's main force. Personally, I am disappointed that the last act felt forced. But it's not a bad movie, just not great.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
277,natsuka_arei,Deeper than you thought it would be. Give this movie a chance,10,25 November 2018,"I LOVE IT. Ralph Breaks the Internet turned out to be a great movie. Disney did a great job here. The animation was so smooth, full of expression, and a lot of lovable characters. For example: the Disney princesses brought back to life and triggered nostalgic feeling along the way for the fans, the cyber world was told in clearly detailed picture which showed us so many things that can be so relatable to our day to day life within the cyber world. It is without doubt, a piece, rich of imagination. They really did a wonderful job in depicting the whole world of internet.Set aside from the visual, the story itself is deeper than I thought it would be. It is a sweet and tear jerker story about friendship and about oneself growth. No need to say, that this movie is enjoyable for all ages. Even for us, the adult. As an adult, I think you will feel the moral of the story is compelling and reminding us the meaning of growing up and be a grown up. The meaning of living a life in which, instead of being bounded with the past and status quo, we are moving forward into the future and accepting changes in a positive way. Changes after all is a constant thing and unavoidable. It is an inherent nature of life and Vanellope realizes this, the movie reminds us and encourage us through the story.So, enjoy the movie!",Ralph Breaks the Internet
278,trebordjackson,Why didn't the Arcade owner question the brand new steering wheel!!!!!! It makes no sense!!!!!!,3,2 December 2018,"All the gags are hilarious and extremely creative, but the plot is absolutely terrible. The first Wreck it Ralph was one of my favorite movies but this movie taints it. This movie Really makes you hate Ralph as a character. The characters acted way too selfish, stupid ,and reckless especially Ralph in the first movie he acted like this but here it's way too exaggerated. Venelope Von Sweets acts pretty reckless too she drove off coruse when a kid was playing as her so much for keeping it a secret they are actually alive. And when she moves the Wheel moves the kid fights with it then it breaks. Then when Venelope wants to leave Sugar Rush to join Slaughter Race Ralph decided he wanted to ruin slaughter race and put a virus in it seriously didn't you learn anything from the last movie about messing with other people's games. And to over compsate for not having a villian the virus made an army of Zombie Ralph's as the villian and it was all Ralph's fault. The movie would have been good if they simply had a villian like normal movies do and had the main characters not be so reckless. Also I can accept them going to eBay to get the steering wheel for Sugar Rush, I can get Ralph becoming internet famous and earning money from getting a lot of hearts, but I was wondering oh boy how are they going to explain the arcade owner putting in the new wheel after it randomly shows up at his door step and then they didn't. What the heck I know it's a fantasy movie but there is a difference between cartoon logic and major plot holes. Me and my brother actually thought of a way to fix that plot hole. They can have Venelope and Ralph walk up to a keyboard at checkout they can press gift package then they can. Have a thing where gifts come with cards and you can type what ever you want on the cards. It can say from your secret admirer meet me at the fancy restaurant, The owner could say some one must love me wow put in the steering wheel then go to the fancy restaurant then get stood up. You get an explanation and a joke win win. And since eBay doesn't do that make up a fake place like they did with Buzz tube. Like EasyBay.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
279,devojonesy1977,"GOT IT, BUT WISHED I HADN'T",3,29 January 2019,"I agree with many of the earlier reviews posted here that the first half of the movie was decent, but the second half? Not so much.It definitely had some sort of ""message"" attached to the second half that left me a little disturbed if not a little pissed off.I mean the whole point of the original was that Ralph basically didn't have ANY friends and he went out of his way to prove his worth in his own way which I liked a lot.
In THIS film he's portrayed almost as this needy boyfriend type who's only friend from the ORIGINAL film is Vanellope...really? Why didn't the writers showcase more of the relationships with the other friends that Ralph had made from the original film? Why couldn't Ralph had found a love interest or calling of his own at the same time that Vanellope found her calling?
It's simple, the writers had to throw in some feminazi propaganda about the strong female no longer needing the ineffective men in their lives, and that common stereotype ruined the latter half of the film for me.
Too bad that the writers/producers or whatever couldn't tell a great story without adding their personal politically correct agenda/perspectives into the story.Six years of writing to come up with THIS?",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Film took the trailer funnies and expanded on them. There's your expected internet jokes and memes, all integrated well into the retro characters from your favorite video games.
The part, however, that really stuck out to me was the amazing story underneath all the humor. Movie tells a heartfelt tale of friendship, letting go, and the true bonds we make with those we love. Also loved how all the extra characters from other games and films were integrated in without damaging their respective stories and/or morals previously established. Job well done.

In a sense, the film has succeeded in creating a new female image that is more in line with the times for Disney princesses.

So after R&V build a great friendship last time what will happen this time to threaten their lovable friendship? Well, I cannot tell you that. Let's focus back on the quality of this movie.
For building a well background of this movie, writers sure do a great job of research, anthropomorphic and cartoonise the internet in a perfect way for understanding.
When you set a story on a bigger stage, what do you want? Definitely fully using it! Well this movie not using those wonderful factors, the story still to small, comparing the bing stage. It is like if u tell this whole story without internet, this still can work! I felt pity that this movie did not dig more about the part when Ralph saw the comments about him. That is the true internet! Internet got good people and bad people. Every thing have a dark side.
I do believe that Disney does not want to show how dark could the internet be, especially they are using so bright colour to describe this world, after all this a Disney movie.
Anyway, I fully recommend this movie, laugh and tears, relax yourself in the cinema for 2 hours. Just go.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
286,ashleighabsurd,Great Sequel,10,3 June 2019,"I love that Ralph Breaks The Internet continues on from the first movie really well and tells us that it has been six years that the main characters have been friends for and how Vanellope is starting to get bored of her game and wants more excitement in her life. By also showing how Wi-fi became a part of the arcade and how scared the games are of it as it has the chance to close down the games as online games are becoming popular with a younger crowd. I also thought by having Vanellope get bored of her game and when going into the internet finding a game in which excited her and that she wanted to be a part of it was good in showing how people change and sometimes people need to find something new and break their normal routine so that they no longer feel stuck and sad by doing the same thing all of the time. Not only this but by showing how Ralph didn't want Vanellope to change and how it took him a while and to see just how jealous and bad a friend he was being to see that he was no being the friend in which he should be and was instead holding her back from who she really wanted to be. Showing that sometimes letting someone go is actually the best thing to do for your friends and that not seeing them all of the time isn't a bad thing and that people are able to communicate in other ways such as through a video call and can enjoy their time together more after they are reunited. By having the wheel of Vanellope's game break and them try to make the money any way that they could through the internet was something I thought was a cool way of introducing the internet the characters and how there are also virus's which are able to break games but are the dark web, having the different sides of the internet was something I thought was really cool and really made the internet come across as more real. Not only this but I thought it was enjoyable seeing how streaming sites worked within that world where pop ups are just characters with jobs and how they get money from the people who go to the site and give love on others while also able to drag people to their videos. Showing how the people in real life also liked the videos of Ralph and made them remember their childhood as well as only last a couple of moments I thought seemed real as it shows how people are able to get noticed however people will forget very shortly afterwards and you will become yesterdays news. Not only this but by showing how negative the internet can be was something I was so glad they showed within this movie from showing how happy Ralph was about his videos and the people watching them to seeing negative comments which made him feel not good enough and that people didn't actually like him when there was actually people who loved him as well. Showing how people need to stop focusing on what people they don't know and online say about them and just do what they feel makes them happy and focus on the people around them. Finally, I loved how Ralph made videos for viral videos and showed what they were as well as having the final end scene being a Rick Role which was a huge viral success in the past and how he made it his own. The animation within Ralph Breaks The Internet is brilliantly done and I love the music as well as the script for this film making it a great success for the whole family.Personally, I can't fault this film and I really enjoy the work that Disney have done with the Wreck-It Ralph movies. This is something that the whole family is able to enjoy and I would highly recommend to people who liked the first movie as well as those who are looking for a funny adventure movie. I will definitely be seeing Ralph Breaks The Internet again.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I understand if people think the original story is better, because the underdog story often relate to us that touch our hearts.

Ralph himself felt like he was a side story rather than the MAIN story. I loved the idea of them breaking into the internet however it could have went in 100 better directions than the one it does go into. Yet another movie that failed to deliver the hype and didn't live up to the OG film. Very disappointed overall. I still enjoyed it.... and by no means is it terrible and that is why I gave it a 7. If I had to rate it directly comparing it to the first it might be a 5/10. I still like Sarah Silverman's characterization and she steals the show from John C.

While undeniably well animated, Ralph Breaks the Internet fails to reach the comedic heights of its predecessor. Some of the jokes land, but most are mistimed or simply unfunny.

291,Weirdo-Magnet,I LOVED THIS MOVIE.,7,7 August 2019,"I don't understand all of the low ratings for this movie. I have read so many reviews mentioning ""advertising"". What were you expecting? Did you expect Disney to project the visuals of the internet as a blank space with nothing inside? I thought this movie was made really well and very clever. Yes there is a lot of advertising, but that is what part of the internet is used for. Did people really expect these company logo's to not be shown? Even if Disney was paid to advertise these companies then - 2 birds, 1 stone as far as I'm concerned. If they weren't shown in the movie then I would have been asking why. Every logo shown is a company that is HIGHLY popular on the internet and are used on a daily basis for some people so, it would be a bit silly if they weren't included.ANYWAY -
This movie made me laugh. The animation is brilliant (as usual) and I loved seeing the retro gaming characters again. Yes the storyline is a bit poor and predictable but its a kids movie. I know I have written it in other reviews but - Why people dissect movies like this always confuses me.

What went wrong in the studio when you were working on it?Now Wreck-It-Ralph is one my absolute favorite Disney movies, it really spoke to me with its message on how to cope with what your role in the world is and how you can deal with the hardships of the negative feedback you get from people. It had a creative setting, likable characters, cool video game references, and just an overall good story. 6 years later I hear they're finally making a sequel, I was hyped for it, then when I sat down and watched it I felt disappointed, but as time went by, the more I thought about it, the more I started to see the film as a disaster.The references to all the brands Disney owns are completely in your face, the motivations of the characters contradicts their motivations in the first movie, the premise felt like it came out of nowhere, and it showcases the fact that Disney simply doesn't care anymore.

Everything else seems pointless and forced into making a movie for the sole reason that someone thought ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" sounded like a really cool title for a sequel.....so let's make it and assumed the rest would just follow. The animators did a great job and the casting of Gal Gadot was inspired. But to what end? By the ridiculous third act it's clear they ran out of ideas and just killed time to get to the credits.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
300,riteshk-71503,Not up to the expectation,6,6 January 2019,"I was looking forward for the sequel, especially because the first part was such a masterpiece. But, I was very disappointed after watching this. It lacks in the story which was the most strong element in the first one. For me, the movie introduced too many new characters while ignoring old character like 'Fix it Felix'.
It's a fun movie but when to look it as a sequel to the master piece which 'Wreck It Ralph' was, it stands no where.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
301,mtrburrows,Forgettable fun,4,4 January 2019,"Ralph breaks the Internet is a clear step down from the first film, offering so much less impact regarding character development and a memorable story. The audiences main fears ragarding the inclusion of the Internet in this movie came true in my eyes - the story is secondary to the force, easy, and obvious jokes regarding the film's depiction of the Internet, which makes the film appear like it's target audience is an older generation that doesn't understand the World Wide Web, rather than the family audience it's actually going for.While it can be fun at points, and the animation is spectacular, with each actor still giving it their all, the story is meandering, uninteresting, and the stakes feel relatively low and uninteresting, overall providing a harmless, but forgettable sequel to a great Disney concept.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
302,cruzwindt-46534,"Terrible sequel, horribly delivered moral messages, out of character and lore breaking.",2,6 January 2019,"Like many people people in the coments, I loved the first movie, like many people in the comments, I also was greatly dissapointed by the sequel. I'll be honest, I was worried when looking for info about the movie I read good descriptions of it in Polygon and Saloon, but I still wanted to believe that even liers would tell the truth sometimes, how wrong I was, for those not aware what those websites are, they are fake news websites that take things out of context to astounding levels, for example putting someone who hates videogames to make a note about a new videogame, and the guy expends all his time whining about how videogames are bad and his life is so superior to anyone who plays videogames instead of talking of the game he was making the note about, or taking a notice like '' One guy saved a drowning girl '' , and then saying that the patriarchy patronizes women for thinking that they need saving, THAT kind of website.
As a standalone movie, the plot may work, as a sequel, is horribly played out. And this is, objectively a sequel, thus I will judge it as a sequel and not a standalone movie. First of animation is pretty good, together with music, but, the most importatn thing for me, is the plot, and this is what I will deconstruct.
The movie commits a grave mistake, and that mistake is the one of adjusting the movie to a message, instead of adjusting the message to the movie, and thus, like any other movie who does the same, plot suffers because of it.Let's start with the characters.Ralph has become a scaredy cat, he never was this scared in the first movie, all for the reason of give more thunder to Vanellope, but depreciating one character is not a way to elevate another, you can't ponder things to the lowest common denominator and expect a higher quality. Ralph has become selfish and self centered, when that was never the point of the character, we are talking of a guy who continually putted himself into more problem than he should for the sake of others, the trope about Ralph is that he was a villain who was not a villain, the writers seem to have forgotten that in this movie, they also have seem forgotten that by the end of the first movie, Ralph was in pretty good terms with everybody, he was in good terms with Felix to the point of going to his wedding, he was in good terms with the other inhabitants fo his game, he was in good terms with the villain help group, but for the sake of the movie, all of them were cast aside for the sake of making Ralph a clingy loner, the character has becomed a shadow of what it once was.Vanellope has become extremely selfish, as someone who has many distance friendships let me tell you something, one thing is wanting to pursue your dreams, other is leaving everyone behind for your own sake. The movie tried to paint this like a clingy relationship, but this again is a bad example of the movie adjusting to the message, instead of the other way around, the writers seem to have forgotten that outside their games, characters DIE PERMANENTLY, so what Vanellope is doing is not the equivalent of someone following his dreams, it's the equivalent of someone leaving all his family and friends behind , even when some of those needed her for sustenance, to go risk her life in deathmaches in the poor neighborhoods of France just cuz she needs a rush, if any friendship of mine were to do something like that I would criticize them nonstop, as one procer of my country once said ( Jose de San Martin ), A real friend critics my mistakes.The New Character, the girl who's name I don't remember cuz I don't care, she had far too little time on screen, yet half of the Movie's plot goes through her, big mistake. She had potential to be either a good villain, or a good second character, but was wasted. The instant hero usually is used as a way to make a character realize that what they see it's not what they want, in this movie, that trope has been used to reinforce a character that the guy they meet five minutes ago is as important or even more than their entire life cuz it looks cool, and that's what they REALLY wanna do. They could have either made her a good villain, sub villain, or at the very least a good support character for the movie, yet, they completedy wasted her in shallow life guidance scenes.The characters have been flanderized, made out of character, and worse of all, dennigrated. Which takes me to my next point, the Disney's ''Princesses'' , oh god what have they done with them .... I have loved MANY of the movies of those ''princesses'', and the only thing I can wonder when I saw them is, did the writers watched the same movies I did ? Or were they trying to push some dumb feminist extremist political agenda ? First of all many of them weren't princesses, Mulan is a goddam soldier for once, many of them weren't rescued by big strong men, they RESCUED big strong men, Mulan Saved the EMPEROR OF CHINA, and what's this nonsense of wear comfortable clothes cuz princess can wear something besides dresses ? Many of them wear dresses cuz they liked them over their ragged or servant clothes, Pocahontas and Mohana wear tribal clothes that had nothing to do with dresses, and I could go on and on, and the ending where they rescued Ralph ? God, I thought that only internet chanles of political extremists could make so much cringe, like the political correct raps of the white privilege or so, but dear god, this movie managed to be as cringey as them '' A big strong men that needs rescue ! '', well ... is that supposed to be a surprise for many of you ? Mulan ? I'm looking at you. They not only ruined Ralph and Vanellope in this movie ,that wasn't enough for them, nope, they had to ruin all Disney's Princesses too.The movie seems lost, it looks like they had to make a two hours long movie and only thought a clear plot for half of it, it gives you shallow messages about criticism dividing critics in both praises and simply insults, which is not true, critic is the reason society advances, if it wasn't for critics, we would still be thinking that blood transfusion are against God's wishes and that thunders are Zeus's rage onto unworthy mortals. But the politically correct seems criticism as all wrong, you don't only find insults in the internet, some critics, that are against you, are actually useful, I've had many sane debates and arguments with people who had criticized my believes , and even when some of them insulted them , I looked behind that and grabbed the knowledge they were trying to impart me, and I growed as a person and recognized I was wrong. The movie tries to give too many shallow messages, and delivers them badly, as explained by trying to adjust the movie to the message.Honestly it's a huge left down, I awaited this movie restlessly, since I finished watching the first movie for a third time, yes a third time, I awaited for a sequel, whelp, seems I got what I ''wanted'', careful with what you wish.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
303,EderR28,A creative and refreshing animated film,7,1 December 2018,"Probably my favorite animated film of the year (till Into the Spider-Verse) I just love how creative of an idea it is. The first half of this was really fresh and entertaining but I thought the final act kind of dragged and didn't inspire much awe for me. The vocal performances are all spot on and I enjoyed a lot of the minor characters as well. Shout out Baby Groot for his cameo, it doesn't matter what film he's in he'll still steal the show. While not one of Disney's greatest entries, it was still very well made and there was no shortage of fanfare and crowd pleasing.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Sure it's not quite on par with the original, but rarely a sequel is anyway. It's definitely worth a watch, especially with kids, and personally I find it far better than all the other CGI/superhero garbage that's overproduced as of late, at least this is original.

306,femkemvs,"Extremely creative, but lacking in charm",6,13 April 2020,"While I do think that a film about the internet personified would be better and funnier as an R-rated one, the creativity in this movie is through the roof. Practically every shot in the middle of the movie is filled to the brim with in-jokes, Easter eggs and creative interpretations of popular sites. I particularly enjoyed Instagram as an art gallery and of course, the Oh My Disney scene was just as amazing as the trailers made it out to be.However, aside from the creative interpretation of the internet, this film is a dip in quality and charm compared to the first. A big part of that comes from the focus being entirely on Ralph and Venelope. While their relationship is very strong and dynamic, the choice to focus almost completely on them is to the detriment of the film. Felix and Calhoun appear only briefly at the beginning and end and it feels as if their characters were wasted. A funny joke was set up with them looking after the racers and the movie never followed through, save for a cop-out joke at the end. I feel they could have been utilized more, particularly given their important roles in the first film.The charm especially does not compare to the first. Though an important lesson is taught, Ralph comes across as extremely unlikable throughout most of the film, making it feel like his development in the first movie meant nothing. Vanelope suffers as well for two reasons. 1. Her entire arc is contradictory to a major plot in the first film. Ralph left his game and caused major repercussions for everyone in it, leading to a change in attitude from everyone. Here, Vanelope leaves her game and nothing bad comes of it. See the problem? 2. The lesson taught in the process is a really bad one. Her arc comes about because she's bored. So leaving her friends, family and job because she's bored is a viable reason for her to do it. It really takes away from her character and makes her seem extremely selfish, even more than she usually is.Another element that I think could have been used better was online gaming. While it does feature, for a film series based on video games and revolving around them, I think the film would have benefitted from utilizing them more. Slaughter Race was only touching the surface of online gaming and I think it might have fit better with the established world and narrative to have the movie revolve around that rather than social media, especially considering that the latter will likely make it quite dated in the future.This by no means means that this is a bad movie. It's funny, creative and can be entertaining at times, but suffers from a slow start, underwhelming climax, underused characters and a poor script. With some tweaks, it could have lived up to the first, but what it ended up as pales compared to the first. The creativity is there, but the charm certainly has taken a dip.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
307,joshtill-98100,An Heart-Pumping Adventure That Is Just Not As Good As The First,7,20 November 2019,"Ralph Breaks The Internet was one of my most anticipated films to watch in 2018. The first Wreck-it Ralph movie made me cry like no other and is in my top 10 movies of all time bracket. This movie was 6 years in the making, showcased the audience a compelling story about friendship and overall growing up. However something is just off with this movie. It just doesn't feel as wholesome as the first movie. Overall it is still a great movie.The movie opens to find Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope Von Scweetz (Sarah Silverman) just happy with life. Wether its getting a drink from Tappers or sneaking into the old classic TRON, they always manage to have fun before the arcade opens the next day. Vanellope tells Ralph that she is bored with the tracks presented in Sugar Rush, so Ralph creates a new track called Rocky Road. Vanellope takes the new track without the actual players permission. The two fight until the Sugar Rush steering wheel breaks off, causing Litwak to unplug the game. The other racers are adopted by Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) and Calhoun (Jane Lynch), while Ralph and Vanellope try and find a way to fix the game. That night, Litwak buys and installs a Wi-fi Router for the arcade.Ralph, having heard about the internet, drags Vanellope to come with him to try and find a replacement wheel for Sugar Rush. The two are exported to the internet, which is filled to the brim with different people of different races. Vanellope remembers that the player offered Litwak to buy it off of Ebay, but the cost was too expensive. The two arrive at Ebay and presume it to be a guessing game of numbers, not understanding that it is just a bargain deal. The two ask a pop-up ad outside how to win great money and JP Spamley (Bill Hader) responds by stating they have to steal a Shank's car from a game called Slaughter Race.The two enter Slaughter Race and Vanellope admires it for its ""edge-factor"". The Game appears to be an unfair game, which seems merely impossible to win. Nevertheless, Vanellope successfully steals Shank's car and rides off with Ralph, heading for the exit. Shank (Gal Gadot) and her crew barricade the exit, as she acknowledges Vanellope for her driving abilities. The two tell shank their dilemma and Shank uploads a viral video of Ralph to Buzzztube. She tells them to ride off and offers Vanellope a race at anytime.At Buzzztube, Shank refers them to the big boss known as Yesss (Taraji P. Henson). Yesss creates a viral video campaign for Ralph to keep him viral and to turn around his debt so he can buy the wheel. Vanellope offers to help out by being a pop-up ad and Yesss sends her to Oh My Disney. She attempts to interrupt another user, but is chased down by stormtroopers. She stumbles upon all of the Disney princesses, who show her that in order to find her true passion, she must stare into water and a song will come out. Ralph contacts Vanellope stating that the loan was turned around and the purchase was successful. Vanellope, in sorrow, looks down at a puddle and realizes that Slaughter Race is her true passion as she sings a song about it with Shank called ""A Place Called Slaughter Race"".Outside of Ebay, Ralph eagerly waits for Vanellope. When he calls her, however, he eavesdrops on hers and Shanks conversation about Vanellope's choice. Ralph, infuriated, returns to Spamley and asks if he has any connections to hackers and viruses, and Spamley brings him to the Double Dan, who connects him to a virus to plant into Slaughter Race. The virus turns out to be much more lethal than Ralph anticipated, which causes the game to go into a severe reboot. Ralph accidentally tells Vanellope that he is the one who implanted the virus, and Vanellope leaves infuriated. The virus escapes from Slaughter Race and scans Ralphs insecurities.The virus creates clones of Ralph, who all go chasing after Vanellope, creepily saying the word ""Friend?"" on several occasions. Ralph contacts Yesss and asks for her help to escape. Before Yesss's arrival, Vanellope and Ralph hide in Knowsmore's (Alan Tudyk) office, where he gives them the plan on how to stop the ""Wreck-it Ralph Virus, which shuts down the internet. He states to make them pass through the firewall. Upon arriving at the firewall, the clones create a giant version of Ralph and knock down Yesss's jet. Ralph is captured by the monsters but talks to it and lets go of his insecurities. The clones disperse and the internet is put back online, as Ralph is rescued by the princesses. Vanellope and Ralph bid adieu as Vanellope moves in to be on Slaughter Race.This movie is just a standard Disney movie but with a unique twist. The movie offers an insanely thought out devised plot that you can tell took 6 years to make. However, I think that this movie is wrong on two reasons. One is its plot. I think its just too mature for a kid to really enjoy, which is why they try to throw in as many action sequences or cameo's as possible, and personally, I think this is where the move really falls. Disney movies have turned on a slightly darker level in recent years, creating mature themes for kids. Think of Maleficent from 2014. That movie featured no action until the very last few minutes, and even then it was not the focus point of the movie. The movie also really falls in the portrayal as Ralph's character. Sure he is not the smartest, but they made him so increasingly dumb in this movie that its like almost eye-roll worthy. Nevertheless, it is still a great film.The film gets a 7.8, lower than most Disney flicks, but a definite watch.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
308,Watcher42,A film of two halves,5,20 February 2019,"I have rarely seen a film that shifts tone so hard.The first half is a light, fun and interesting romp. The story showed potential and I was definitely enjoying it as much, if not more, than the original. But suddenly we take a hard left turn in to a Disney advert full of virtue signalling.We get it. Disney has charged itself with being some paragon of virtue dead set on ensuring young females grow up independent and strong; but does it have to be at the expense of showing all males as idiots, needy or inferior.The combination of Disney advert and ramming the heavy handed message home sucks all the fun out of the movie. An interesting and entertaining premise devolves in to a lazy mess and a huge missed opportunity.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
309,rustydalek-37911,Aging Like Milk,3,4 May 2021,"While 2012's Wreck-It Ralph was far from being one of my favorite films, it felt different, and the retro gaming atmosphere was a very unique take for an animated Disney film. However, the decision to trade that out for a bland, emoji-movie style internet setting was a poor one. The film feels slimy and self-congratulatory, lacking any real heart or meaning. The constant referencing of off-brand websites and memes is no real substitute for the 8-bit video game feel of the original, and it's decision to entrench itself so deeply in trends of the time is causing the film to show it's age already. Even taking the numerous aesthetic problems aside, the story is a disaster. In the first film, it is established that switching games, or ""going Turbo"", as they called it, was a dangerous and selfish thing to do, as it risked destruction of the entire game world you were entering. However, Vanellope does exactly that here, not caring if her game is in jeopardy in her absence, and not caring about the new game at all. No attempt is made to justify why it was okay to go turbo here; in fact, the only character who does not want Vanellope to go turbo, Ralph, is painted as pathetic, needy and selfish for trying to prevent it. As a sequel, it's a disaster, and even taken on it's own merit, it's largely a disastrous mess of Disney reminding us how much of our childhoods they either created or bought out. With terrible character development, terrible humor, and a terrible setting, this one is better forgotten.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

This time? I'm utterly disappointed with the storyline.As far as I can understand, this movie talks about insecurity which puts their friendship at stake. The typical classic Disney's way of establishing insecurity is to let us audience feel and experience what the characters feel and experience throughout the story. This time Disney truly fails me for they are trying to show what the character's feeling through
DESCRIPTIVE dialogue. TRULY UNBELIEVABLE!
What an innovative and ground breaking move, Disney!
The only heartfelt moment I can recall is when they have to be separated. That's the only truthful moment in this movie. The rest? CHEESELY FABRICATED!

I love how the movie handles more serious topics such as cyberbullying and the toxicity of dependency, but it handles it in a way children can understand as well. it may not be as great as the original, and it may be much more predictable, but it's still a decent movie, and good enough for a rewatch.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

1. Huge companies advertising - just why? Ebay? Google? Amazon? etc. Half of those were there for no reason at all. I know it's the internet but it's made in a very shallow way. Almost like a very cheap music video.
2. Disney references all over - once again why? They could have just named ""ralph breakds the disneynet"". On that note, he did not break anything so the title of the movie was quite misleading
3. This movie was decent until halfway and after that it just sank to the bottom of the Mariana trench.

And it's hilarious. I went at a time and day that meant everyone in the theater was 21+, and we were all cracking up.All of the characters have evolved somewhat since we've seen them last, but not in ways that will surprise you; which is exactly what you want from off-screen character development.Over the course of the movie, we learn a lot more about our main characters. They change in ways that mean this isn't simple a repeat of the first one, but all of the changes feel true to who they originally were.Vanellope is still a soul searching youngster, full of energy, who longs for more from life; she especially desires challenge and change. Ralph is the loveable goof he always was, but held back by insecurities owing to his rough life that he must overcome.In the end, what we get here is a story that is nostalgic, impressive in its visual aspects, hilarious, and heartwarming.But most importantly this movie does something incredibly hard to do in a fun Disney movie: it speaks to the human condition and the trials we all face as we attempt to discover both who we are and how we fit within the world.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

336,hetalkstoangles,That'll teach that misogynist Ralph to wreck stuff...,5,30 November 2018,"I'm a bit torn about how to rate this movie. My normal schtick is to put a basic number value based on how much I enjoyed the movie, and then go back and try to figure out why.There was some stuff to enjoy, but it really was nowhere near as good as the first. It just felt rushed and disorganized. The first one was a real movie with plot, character development, clever, inspired dialogue and a lot of laughs.In the sequel, it seemed like the producers ordered everyone to make it just like the first but MORE, BIGGER, FASTER, BRIGHTER, BETTER... AND THEN DOUBLE IT... instead actually developing a story and sticking to a plot.The plot, such as it was, again centered on the friendship between Vanellope von Schweetz and Ralph but they crammed so much product placement and distraction into the movie, (feeling the need to waste screen time on every meme since the dawn of the internet), that they settled for a disappointingly simple 'friends go on adventure, friends fight and they are friends once again by the end credits'.It wasn't terrible but it did seem very light weight compared to the first. The Disney Princesses were ok but you don't get more than what you see in the trailers.One thing that did get on my nerves was the heavy handed SJW text. I can't call it subtext since it took up more screen time than what was supposed to be the plot. Basically, every male character was bad, an idiot or both and the women were universally awesome, extremely clever, flawless and just obviously better in every way.In the first movie, the hero was a teeny girl and Ralph was basically her sidekick but each brought something to the table.*****SPOILER ALERT*****In RBTI, (It really should have been Ralph Wrecks the Internet), Vanellope was being held back by the insecure man, (100% insecure compared to Vanellope's mere 30%, according to the movie), and didn't act like a good friend. But... neither did Vanellope. It was her reluctance to tell Ralph the truth about her intentions that sparked Ralph's breakdown. Ralph finds out his that one friend is going to abandon him and snaps, and does something stupid and mean.There was a good chance for a lesson on balance there but instead, they painted normally kind and caring Ralph, as a destructive, spurned spouse. All is only solved when he gets woke and becomes happy that Vanellope was going to follow her dream which includes, literally, waving goodbye to him.After thinking about it for a while, it has dawned on me that my major gripe stems from the realization that RBTI feels like the money grabbing second movie in a trilogy.The voice acting was excellent but the actors were let down by a mediocre finished product.I really wanted to like RBTI but in the end, the best I can give it is a half hearted meh.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

339,lunalovitt,Please No,2,28 February 2019,"The way Ralph and Vanellope's relationship was written made it feel more like an abusive relationship instead of friendship. You have a creepy old man being overly clingy with a young girl and controlling her life and their relationship (and while I know they're not real characters and they don't age given that they are essentially immortal game characters it still doesn't change the fact that it was written in such a way that just creeps me out).And Ralph is so dumbed down in this movie. All the male characters are. It's so obvious that this was done to build up the female characters. You don't make a strong female character by making everyone else around them weak. (Here's an idea, instead of putting down other characters in order to build one up, why don't you actually just write a strong character in the first place? If you're having to nuke all the others to make this one good, then there's something wrong with that character in the first place.) Especially when you're focusing on Vanellope, a character who was barely tolerable in the first film due to her lack of maturity and selfish nature. While Ralph wasn't exactly Einstein in the first movie, he did have a level of maturity about him and actually learned how to be a better person and gain acceptance. All of that was lost in this film and he was basically reduced to the level that Vanellope was at in the first movie.Ralph's sacrifice in the first movie was genuine and heart-felt. The sacrifice in the end of this one was just forced and felt more like the writers were trying to make Vanellope's potential sacrifice feel a LOT like an abused victim agreeing to go back to a controlling abuser and it was just icky to watch (especially when she does actually go back to that abuser and we're supposed to pretend like that's completely normal for a victim to end up in a good relationship with the person who was trying to control their life and nearly killed them). The entire undertone of this movie felt wrong and poorly handled. I've never walked away from a Disney movie thinking that a topic was so badly abused in a film, but this one takes the title of the first that makes me incredibly uncomfortable.Please no more sequels.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
340,onemillionpapercranes,"Good Movie, but not necessarily a kid's movie.",8,10 January 2019,"I honestly get the feeling that the people giving this movie low reviews either based their review off the preview (I admit I put off watching this movie until today because of the cringy preview), or they are too young to understand some of the humor and the more dark parts of this movie.I thoroughly enjoyed it, the cringey parts and product placement you see in the preview was actually a very very small part of the movie, and Disney made up for it by poking fun at themselves.I've also seen some reviewers saying that this movie is basically a copy of the first movie. I have to disagree. There are some similarities but the same can be said for every marvel, star wars, or Pixar sequel. I mean you have two main characters with certain powers, so obviously the plot is going to revolve around that a bit.The only reason I am not giving this movie a nine or a ten is because it might be a little too geared toward an adult audience, as far as the plot and climax.

Actually, just the opposite: They treat Ralph as the villain for trying to stop her.All this after a boring, uninspired and completely disjointed slog of a movie to sit through. The plot is bipolar, the characters come in two varieties -- cardboard, and despicable -- and the ""jokes"" felt old and dated even on this movie's theatrical release.What we have here is an exercise in Disney magic: An experiment to see if a movie with no redeemable qualities whatsoever can still rake in big bucks, big acclaim and big rewards just because it has a shot of the Disney castle in the opening sequence.We used to hold Disney to a higher standard.

They create an authentic and satirical world of internet.SPOILERS AHEAD!The whole satire on click bating, being famous on the internet and pop up ads, and darknet are subtle as hell.

347,MovieTim14,Surprisingly Strong Sequel,8,1 July 2019,"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" truly surprised me. I was resistant to watching it during its theatrical run, despite being a big fan of its predecessor and knowing the pedigree of Walt Disney Animation. The marketing for this movie, which focused heavily on its new internet elements gave me more ""Emoji Movie"" vibes than classic Disney. ""Look, we have Twitter references! Snapchat! Oh, and Star Wars and Disney princesses!"" While I'm sure this strategy successfully got the butts of a lot of kids in theaters, it kept the butt of this cynical-but-otherwise-Disney-loving adult, firmly out. So, when I gave ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" a watch recently, I was pleasantly surprised to find it contained all the consistent world-building, charming characters, and genuine heart of the original.The sequel finds Ralph, and his best friend Vanellope living a charmed but otherwise stagnant life after the events of the first movie. While this stagnancy doesn't bother Ralph in the slightest, Vanellope (in true Disney princess fashion), makes it clear she wants more, and it's this tension that forms the root of the struggle of the story, including causing the catalyst that sends them on their journey to the internet.I found myself as charmed by the movie's handling of the physical manifestation of the internet as I did by the original's handling of the lives of video game characters. (Side note: although the focus isn't nearly as high on video games as the original, there are still some fun elements there, such as musings on the grooming habits of a certain ""Street Fighter"" character.) The internet is a living world here, and the filmmakers clearly thought about all the ways they could have its well-known quirks inhabit themselves in the form of characters. Standouts for me were the pop-up street salesmen that aggressively touted their click-bait articles, and the search-engine worm character whose auto-fill was ""a tad aggressive.""More than the handling of the world though, what I found truly surprising and compelling about this movie were its themes and the way it handled them. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" was a movie about identity and self-acceptance. ""Ralph Breaks the Internet,"" far from being the cheap cash grab I thought it would be, actually continues those themes in ways I didn't expect, ways that I even think might even be new and challenging for kids.Overall, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" was a much more worthy successor to the original film than I anticipated. If you're looking for a fun, humorous, imaginative movie that you can turn your brain off for, it provides all the necessary thrills. But it rarely loses sight of the characters and the heart that make these particular thrills so special.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
348,christonr-64261,They didn't Wreck It!,9,14 January 2020,"The sequel to 2012's Wreck It! Ralph, sees a more mature, yet less conventional sattire which seems to have been given license by Disney to pretty much break the internet (as the title promises).The faux parent-child(esque) relationship between Vanellope and Ralph is once again put to the test here, as the young princess looks to break the cycle of boredom the two have become trapped in.Queue a Ralph-orchestrated disaster putting Sugar Rush in grave peril and a quest for the two heroes into the unknown as they navigate the web in search of ways to save the game.As the pair enter 'Wifi' they embark on a journey of Discovery and intrigue, touching on everything from spam (courtesy of 'Spamley'), clickbait, code, cookies, comment sections, viral sensations and viruses. If nothing else, it'll engage young kids with some of these concepts which may otherwise prove difficult to fully imagine.Add in cameos from some very famous disgruntled princesses and you get a film which is smart, satirical and sweet in equal measure.A couple of minor issues see some of the supporting characters from the first film sidelined heavily; but this is offset by Ralph and Vanellope's interactions with everything from 'Eboy' to 'Eeyore'. The final showdown -minus spoilers - also lacks a real final element of peril in terms of trying to vanquish a seemingly insurmountable foe.But on the whole this film is a real, unexpected treat which echoes and evolves themes and attitudes from the first film, whilst cranking-up the social commentary to 11.Oh and make sure you stay for the two post-credit scenes!!",Ralph Breaks the Internet

My 4yr old was not really entertained. (Very fidgety as a result)
I thought it was ok, but not a patch on the first film; which hit every note brilliantly in my mind.Like others, I do not want to be negative, as I am such a fan of the first one and the characters therin, but 6yrs of development time has not appeared to have helped this story.It is possibly that they are targeting the now, older kids that watched the first film. This would allow for an older, slightly complex look on friendship.Many have mentioned the branding in this film....the problem sits with how much branding we see everyday on the web, so if Disney is to give a 'realistic' representation of the web in this film, brands are going to loom large. This said, it felt occasionalally nauseating to see them, and to such an amount, in a film of this sort.Ultimately, when we asked ourselves ""what was the best bit for you"" to eachother after the film, we had to think a little too hard.I'd like to see another film made in the future, so we'll wait and see.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Almost everything I loved about the first Wreck-It Ralph is present here with the humor, animation, well told narrative, and a still fantastic bond between Ralph and Vanellope. Rich Moore truly did his homework as the film did not pull an Emoji Movie by using the Internet as shameless promotion; it's just there for reference to show what is on set server. I really think it's Disney's best sequel in a long time. I just wish Felix and Calhoun were in it more though.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
351,ma-01629,massive missed opportunity,5,20 August 2020,"I love the first Wreck it Ralph but sadly, this sequel did not capture what made the original great in any way. I guess I should start by saying I liked: the voice casting and animation and details were perfect, Shank, Yessss and Spamley were pretty great characters and this movie has a nice message and the princess stuff is awesome and I loved the Slaughter Race stuff. Ok, that's it:What is wrong with Ralph here? He's nothing like he was in the original? He'a cranky, whiny and super dumb and treats Vanellope like he cannot live without her. What? Also, Vanellope is kind of selfish. Plus, this movie puts style over plot. It's not very funny, the BuzzTube stuff is massively unrealistic and an insult to YouTube creators and a bad message for kids and the movie has little direction: it starts off with Ralph and Vanellope getting a steering wheel to save Sugar Rush and then it jumps to Vanellope trying to follow her dream and Ralph trying to ruin it, which is completely out of character and that Ralph monster is so over the top. The direction is not very clear. It's like 2 plots into one. The steering wheel stuff is basically forgotten.This movie also does not work well as a sequel. The first Wreck it Ralph was about gaming and this one ignores that and about the Internet. This movie could have focused more on mobile gaming or console or handheld gaming as the first was focused on arcade.And where are Felix and Calhoun? They were great original characters in the first one and now they are left all alone, forgotten. What's worst is there could've been this subplot of the two raising the Sugar Rush racers but no, we don't get to see it.This movie could have been good but it's overall painfully average, almost bad.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I saw one comment saying that it was a dangerous way to look at friendship but I must disagree. It showed how you must love, respect and value the people around you but not smother or try to control them, which frankly, is a lesson for both kids and adults. It was also great to see Vanellope get In touch with her true self and chase her dreams, even if it isn't popular, which is a great message for all. Lovely sweet film.

The CGI, voice acting and the animation style were all top notch and I have no complaints there.
The main issue is with the plot itself, which was all over the place. The whole thing was basically a bunch of smaller mostly unrelated subplots glued together to create the main story. And the subplots themselves weren't.. bad I guess.. but not all that overly entertaining either. They were just average at best. The movie as a whole still comes out as slightly above average, but it could have been so much better in my opinion.
The first movie I could just watch over and over again, I have seen it many times. This one I watched once and maybe I will watch it again sometime, in couple of years perhaps, when I mostly forget what it was about, but that is about it.

However, when comparing it to the first movie, this one seems a bit dull? Don't get me wrong, it had a lot of good moments but I just feel as though so much happened yet nothing happened at all? It's always hard to create a second movie when the first one did so good because everyone is automatically going to compare to see if the next one is up to par and does just as well if not better.
The story line was based off of the fact that the steering wheel of the game broke and they went on a mission to get it back, but it mainly ended up just being all about the toxic friendship both Venelope and Ralph have. Not a horrible concept, I just think the movie could've added more depth into other things like what was going on back in the arcade with the other characters.

Dir: Phil Johnston, Rich Moore
Runtime: 1 hr 52 minsSynopsis: Ralph and Vanellope embark on an adventure inside the internet to find a spare part to fix a video game.I will openly admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie. At first I honestly couldn't pinpoint what about the film that didn't set well with me. After seeing the sequel I think I've figured it out. At times Ralph as a character some of the things he does and says is soooo idiotic that it kind of throws me off. With that being said the sequel follows the same character structure but I guess it was a little more reasonable. The story follows the same formula as the first, the mission for the main characters are set up the have an adventure to execute said mission and somehow Ralph makes a stupid decision that causes the story to take a detour that ultimately they have to work together to fix. The story I will say flows well enough that you keep anticipating what they will discover next in the world of the internet because we all know how fun that is. Still amazed at how fantastic animation looks now. Coming from films like the first Toy Story they've come along way in animation. There are scenes when you get a close up of Vannelope and you can see the stray hairs from her pony tail. Although the film is completely cartoonish the details like that is what makes it stand out. The characters are great with the exception of how annoyingly stupid Ralph is but I suppose it's needed to complete the story build and give a peak point of the film. You get a great array of characters from Disney, including all of the princesses, handful of Star Wars characters, and even some of the Marvel heroes including an small cameo from everyone's favorite Marvel hero. If your taking a child the story is simple enough that they will enjoy it without getting too bored. If your a Disney collector it would be a nice addition to the list of films.

I found the first one a very good movie and this one is a worthy sequel. Digital artists achieve nice sequences with very good rhythm. Not all ideas are new but the presentation is quite good. The mixing between universes are very well achieved and of course action sequences deserve a praise. I don't like sequences with multi particles composition and for me is one of the parts I didn't like. My family like it a lot and truly believe this one deserve to be in the 8 range but maybe will finish at 7.4-7.6 and the end of is run.

Characters are so poorly animated, too many pop culture references, and super annoying. For those who think Wreck It Ralph should have won over Brave, what's the use? This one lost to Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse, so get over it. Brave deserved it's Oscar and so did Into The Spider Verse.

It had plenty of internet references and jokes for my wife and me, and my kids had plenty of funny and exciting parts to keep them entertained.I was really impressed with the outside-the-box ""moral"" or ""message"" of the show, that is, that friends don't have to be interested in the same things or be close to each other to still be friends. That's a big theme with internet and social media and resonated with me deeply.The movie had its moments of cliché plot points and some parts that were sappy just like all Disney movies nowadays, but overall I was very pleasantly surprised at the depth of the movie and just how funny it was.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I deal with wifi and internet everyday of life and this movie had me in stitches. The attention to detail was out of this world and the online humor was just pure class.I rated this a 9 out of 10. Not many movies get that from me let me tell you that but for the pure entertainment that it brought to me and my family when we watched it I just simply had to give it.P.S. I have never seen the first movie and quite personally I hate when people rate movies based on the original. That's not what IMDB should be about.Dont listen to all the negativity. This is cinema at it's best. Theres something it for everyone.The part that everyone seems to be hating on (all the disney characters scene) I thought was excellent. I have a 3 year old daughter that is obsessed with all these characters and I known them all well. It was refreshing to see such a different take on all of them. Some of the the hashtags were brilliant.People are lost in this world I think. Theres no way anyone could rate this lower than a 5. If so you dont deserve to be reviewing movies.Hope you enjoy.,Ralph Breaks the Internet

Movie builds up to the climax really good and trust me you won't get a time to move your eyes off the screen. I know there are some people who didn't like the film, well everybody has their perspective & I respect. Movie have bit of some emotional moments too, where you would need a tissue to wipe your tears. Trust me I cried a bit too, that's the power of animation movies.

380,The_Dog_Father,"So looking forward to this, and it sadly disappointed",6,17 March 2019,"I loved the first one, and was probably my favorite Disney movie of all time. Ralph breaks the Internet had some wonderful ideas, but the story fell flat, like stale warm soda left out, and disappointed me with great sadness. I realize there is a huge demand for children to hurry and grow up, due to marketing, but a great opportunity was missed to make this movie as lovable as the first one.In Toy Story 3, the transition of growing up and the rite of passage that all children must take was done with care, love, and told in ways every one can relate to. Ralph Breaks the Internet rushed to take a child and say, okay, hurry up and grow up, leaving innocence of life cast aside. Children don't need a movie to tell them to make that leap of growing up so quickly, there are too many examples of that in every day life for them. That is where Disney missed it with this one. Disney was a safe haven for children to be children for a little while, and this movie skipped from pre-teen to, okay you're done, welcome to the adult world theme. The messages were mixed, straining the characters into a chapter of, how could they mess this up?The hurry up and grow up message, obliterated any connection with the other characters, which made the show so funny and lovable in the first one. There were some funny moments with the bots from the internet (which to me made the show bearable and entertaining), to the humor side of all the Disney princesses. We get the out with the old iconic 80s video games, and in with the new, but that is what made the first one so enjoyable. This movie was themed with, ""okay, were done, time to move forward."" If you have seen Ready Player One, you can understand where nostalgia is done with class, which adults can really appreciate.The over complex issues with Ralph seemed to be more obsessive than just a part of growing up, and went over board with the innocent friendship between the two friends. In the first movie, a grown man, with awkward social issues, and a young girl, who was unloved and unwanted gave way to a movie about friendship, love, and kindness which made the first movie spectacular. This movie, went into too much detail of the mental issues associated with attachment issues, and removed itself from what we loved about their characters in the first movie. It was antithesis of the friendship which again, made the first movie lovable, endearing, and funny.I was waiting for more of a climatic harmony, but it was more like food without taste. I so wanted there to be fun and humor like the first one, enough for entire families to enjoy with a lively cast of various characters, but the characters never materialized. Instead of friends, it shadowed a clingy parent child relationship, which was not the bond and trust they had in the first movie. Sad Disney, very sad indeed.Disney really went off the rails on this one. Just make movies fun for kids, and some adult humor that parents can appreciate too. You don't need to make grandiose transitions about growing so quickly. Walt Disney never had that in mind. Children are children for such a very short time.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
381,Doeh,A perfect example of a sequel not living up to the first,5,24 November 2018,"The second part in Ralph's adventure was, disappointing, to say the least.I was so looking forward to this movie because I absolutely loved the first one. But, when I say this movie let me down, it REALLY let me down.It's a very boring movie from start to end. The relationship between Ralph and Vanellope is cringy at best.

382,watrmeln,Better than the original and I usually hate sequels!,10,1 April 2019,"Rarely do I find myself completely enjoying animated movies. They tend to be too Pollyannish (""kids can't learn about death!"") or too edgy (""animation is but an art form - here's a film about the holocaust!""). Ralph Breaks the Internet walks the fine line between the two extremes while managing to parody modern society, all at once!Yes, this Ralph Breaks the Internet is ""darker"" than typical Disney movies. But only if you deliberately live in a escapist world of gumdrops and lollypops. This movie incisively points out the flaws of the modern internet world. Many of us behave like clickbait sheep - witness the popularity of Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, etc. We waste precious time and money on frivolous pursuits or following celebrities who lack any notable talent beside self-promotion. We let our kids spend hours making virtual pizzas, feeding virtual pets or learning virtual dances by spending actual money.My kids (9,11,13) couldn't stop talking about this movie afterwards. Not about its creativity, action, or humor, but about social issues! Social bullying, fake news, and safe browsing were just a few topics we covered.

However I didn't have very high hopes for this to begin with... the princesses stole the show but otherwise the trailers made it look like Disney stealing the LEGO Movie's thunder with endless cameos and cheap jokes.It ended up being pretty much just that... a bunch of cheap internet jokes thinly wrapped around a confusing plot and a really lousy ending that probably sounded much better on a written script, one with an enormous plot hole that may undo the entire plot...

390,zerone23,Disney version of Emoji Movie (?),8,25 November 2018,"Six years after the first movie, the sequel of Wreck-It-Ralph is breaking in. Is it coindence that Disney released this movie the same year as Sony's Hotel Transylvania franchise? Guess not. I see what you did there, Disney. This sequel takes place six yeas after the first movie. It is the same amount of time that's passed in real time life. We can see that from the sign outside the arcade.Assumed by the trailer back then, this movie seems like a cooler version of Emoji Movie which was failed badly in rating and revenue. The fact is, Wreck-It-Ralph 2 is suprisingly better than the Emoji Movie. Either from its plot or easter eggs. We will see about the revenue later. But, considering it is a Disney movie, well you guess it.Before talking about the plot, let's check the newcomer casts. Gal Gadot is perfect as Shank. The character is based on her character in Fast Furious franchise, after all. They said that the movie is Gal Gadot's first animated film. And one thing I didn't expected that SHE CAN SING. Next, Taraji as Yesss also great. The character resembes her much. And Alfred Monila as Double Dan. You recognized him as Doc Ock in the original Spiderman. Moreover, there's also Vin Diesel and the original VA of Disney princesses, except for Aurora. Nostalgia at its best!The movie has a complete plot structure. Six stages with five turning points. In general term, its plot is easy to understand. Duh, it is a PG-13 movie. The climax is executed beautifully yet predicted. No wonder if there's someone out there would choose Vanellope as their favorite Disney princesses after this movie.As expected, the movie is full of pop culture stuffs. You can measure your pop culture knowledge by searching the easter eggs. A113, princesses' casual clothes, Zootopia, Twisted Metal, and so many to mention. There are two EGs that become my favorite. The imperial march song and the usage of Internet/Wifi word. Even they said that this movie is the first movie that uses 'Internet' in its title, it still can't use 'Internet' and 'Wifi' word inside the movie. Maybe because of intellectual property thing. Instead, they changed those words into Interneat and W1F1.In a whole, Wreck-It-Ralph 2 is a movie that challenge ""problematic"" Disney princess stereotypes. Even the movie looks like an advert for Disney's brands like Ohmydisney and others, Ralph 2 is changing our perception about Disney princesses. Also, congratulations for Vanellope von Schweetz become the first Jewish Disney princess.Ciao.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

397,Tina_V,Disappointing OK Disney sequel,5,23 November 2018,"We loved ""Wreck it Ralph"", we love Disney movies, and maybe that's why it's difficult to watch an ""OK"" movie like this, which has the good moments, the ""near-tears"" scenes and funny jokes, and then give it a good grade. I give 5, because it is ""OK"" but we tend to expect more of Disney.A good strong storyline, a clear objective, is the problem, or better, is what is missing.For a Disney, you can't just make it as you go along.I feel the creators of this story, without a logical sequence flow, just kept adding more and more unconnected ideas, just to get to the next scene, the next joke, and then next drama.Without this clear line, filmmakers just joined together a sequence of unrelated events, then gave them a weak connector for flow.All threads of the main story were real short with no implications, nothing for the audience to wonder, or remember, like hints in the beginning that must mean something in the end but never connect anywhere, no difficult decisions for the characters which can make a different and change how it all ends.Looks like a team who were given a task: ""make a sequel"" but couldn't really think of anything, so just started nearly without a script, under the idea ""let's make it up as we go along... so much potential, so many unnecessary appendices in the main story - leaving you with a shallow feeling of incompleteness...",Ralph Breaks the Internet

There are some parts of this movie that will be very scary for young children. Older children will enjoy these parts, younger children will not. My nephews had to sit on their aunt's lap and hide their faces during more than one instance. They were terrified and asked to leave. I also noticed many children in the laps of their parents looking terrified as I glanced around the theater. The scenes are too intense. Ralph and Venelope end up at an internet game called ""Slaughter Race"" and many of the characters are far too menacing for young children. I do not recommend this for children under 6, honestly. Wait for them to get a bit older. I was quite surprised Disney made some of those choices, but I think they were trying to appeal to the fans of the original, and with those fans being 6 years older now, they were thinking about them maybe. I'm not one who is usually so sensitive about things being a bit gritty for kids, but when you go to a Disney animated feature, you shouldn't have to worry about consoling scared children.
The movie was touching and I enjoyed it, but I just feel like it was missing something there. And ultimately, too scary for the little ones.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

401,watcher-99197,"Lazy, predictable - another Disney hit, of course",5,2 December 2018,"Just seen Ralph Breaks the Internet, on the third day after it opened in Britain.What can I say? I know this film is for kids - granted, it is probably better for older kids because certain nuances will be lost on the little ones - but there was something for parents too; in the showing I was at there were outbreaks of stifled laughter at certain points from adults rather than the children. And yet it was all so predictable - plot spoiler: a series of Ralph-created mayhem scenarios that get sorted out by (mainly) Vanellope until the end.But some (a lot?) of the characters will be lost on one or other age group - I couldn't identify all the princess cameo characters, and I'm not sure my six year old would either. And the song: totally out of character for Vanellope, or the franchise I guess; my young daughter did become restless at that point - her brother was still stuffing popcorn into his mouth, so it was difficult to tell.In many ways this film is totally an in-joke for the studios, maybe in the same way that things were hidden in the movie for geeks to find - ""isn't that the car from...?"", ""who was that in that scene...?"", ""that character has a slightly different voice/wearing the wrong shade of blue shirt/just wouldn't do that..."" etc.
Someone somewhere will be feeling very, very smug, and it's not me.Lots of internet brand name placement too, and I'm guessing that no one was too upset because they were all shown in a positive light (Ebay, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Google all spring immediately to mind - although YouTube obviously wouldn't pay the asking price since the video site, probably a major plot device in the film, was given a different name), a nice little advertisement for when the kiddies have some money (catch them young?). There was a lot to see in the internet scenes, but other than one mention for 'sassy housewives want to meet you' by a pop-up there was no reference to one of the big things that the internet has made available to all; even phishing was up there, although without any demonstration that this is a major internet problem - but then this is supposed to be a children's movie.And my kids said they loved it; just not enough to hang about until the end though - I convinced them both to wait a little while (although I didn't know anything was coming, but there always seems to be something in the credits these days) until the exploding bunny skit, by which time we were the only ones left in the theatre other than the cleaner.
The youngest subsequently gave it (I think, but don't hold me to it) 700 million out of ten, while her brother gave it a firm 10/10; me, I believe it was lazy, and that Disney is not terribly bothered whether you enjoyed it or not - they've already got your money. But it kept the kids entertained for about two and a half hours on a rainy afternoon, and therefore I'm giving 5/10.And talking of money... I believe we sat through a solid half hour of adverts before the film actually started, especially when we were told it started at a specific time: why the hell are we paying so much to watch advertising before viewing a product loaded with what was essentially adverts?",Ralph Breaks the Internet

This is supposed to be a kids movie, they don't need to even hear about that let alone think that's its ok to venture there or to go looking for it. Big thumbs down for Disney on that one.

They owe an obscene amount of money to pay for an arcade game part on Ebay--not because it cost that much, but because they made the bid themselves... Self-inflicted conflicts, though sometimes relatable, aren't so great when you're trying to get the audience to empathize with the characters and invest in their conflict.Not sure if its the same writing team as the first but the the plot and the laws of the new internet universe got kind of convoluted. Unlike the first movie where the rules of the arcade world were clearly defined and the story structure was solid. There were areas that did need defining that were unclear, and yet there were moments that didn't need defining that were way too spelled out (i.e. the climax was a virus monster literally copied from ralph's insecurities... That is way too literal, and yet I have so many logistic questions about that).Unfortunately the gimmicks of the trailer were some of the most fun parts.

I also thought it was fun seeing every single Disney princess in CG.All I can say is that haters gonna hate. People were also complaining about dialog that went nowhere. I have to disagree, I never felt the dialog went no where. All in all I thought this was a very creative movie.Also, don't listen to the idiots saying this movie didn't have a plot, it had a plot.The Plot was that Vanellope's arcade machine's steering wheel broke. The owner of the arcade found one on eBay but it was too expensive and the game was to old and not worth the fix. So Ralph and Vanellope go into the internet to get it from eBay.

The story was excellent, the voice acting was outstanding.The sequel here - some of the best parts unfortunately were what we saw in trailers, as it often is. That's not to say there aren't other funny parts - there are. But overall it just left me, and my son, with the impression of them trying to cram far too many bits into the movie. It really stuttered along in parts.We had a lot of eye rolling at the deluge of Disney when they first got to ""the internet"" and began looking around. This was the first part for us that started to detract from the story, which is, at it's core, actually an EXCELLENT story.I wish they had focused more on what made the story flow well, what brought it out the best, rather than just try to cram as many bit part cameos as they could from other Disney franchises.Voice acting was again well done. I think this would have been a much better movie had more things ended up on the cutting room floor, but it's at least worth seeing once.

415,nielw,Much better than the reviews indicate,8,29 December 2018,"I really don't understand all the hate this movie is getting. Sure, it's not as good as the first one. Sure there's a ton of product placement. And it tries to shove a message down your throat. But it all works together in my opinion.It's hard to tell a story about the internet without referencing things that happen on the internet. For some people, this was a huge turn-off. But that's kinda what this movie is about, so if you don't like a movie that lampoons internet culture, then you should probably stay away from a movie that has the word ""internet"" in its title. If you don't get the jokes, then you probably won't like this movie.At first glance, it may seem like there's too much product placement, but then you realize that it actually all works. The internet products are part of the story and not just tacked on. You can't talk about the internet without Google. And Twitter. And YouTube...I mean BuzzzTube.Also, I thought the Disney princess scene stole the show. They turn the whole helpless princess idea on its head in a way that I found refreshing. I LOL'd plenty during this scene and I'm a 38 year old male.Also the Slaughter Race song had me ROFLing. Too clever!Overall, a great sequel to a great movie.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
416,ashil-john-,Disney Wrecks the Franchise!,1,4 March 2019,"The title of this movie should've been ""Disney Breaks the Wreck-it Ralph Franchise""! There was no plot, absolutely no plot! Some kid breaks the steering wheel of Vanellope's ""Sugar Rush"" game and Ralph & Vanellope sets out on a journey into the internet to buy a new steering wheel from E-bay.At best, this could've been a 10 minute short, at worst, well, at worst, this movie IS the result. All that happens from the moment they go on the internet, is Ads. Lots and lots of Ads ranging from the different brands that probably paid Disney a fortune to be animated, to showcasing the characters that Disney owns, ranging from Star Wars, Marvel, Disney Princesses; you name it, they've got it all. And for some reason, we're supposed to enjoy watching all the characters in a single movie?Since this is all they had done for the first and second acts, they needed some sort of conflict and resolution in the third, so they just make Ralph do something stupid and cause a conflict which is later resolved in the dumbest possible manner with Ralph wearing a princess dress. I have no idea if they really hired writers to come up with this lame-o-rama! It could just as easily have been written by an 8-year-old kid.Wreck-it Ralph is an all-time favorite animated movie of mine; it had sugar, spice and everything nice in just the right proportions. This movie had great visuals, but it can't hold a candle to the original and is without a doubt, one of the worst Disney movies I've ever seen.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I ended up leaving the theater with about 30 minutes remaining because I simply wasn't enjoying myself.I think now, because of this movie in particular, I've realized that my perception of the ""family-friendly"" genre has changed? I didn't really like The Incredibles 2 and now this... I'm just not feeling the comedy, which these movies are littered with (and I look forward to). I smirk, smile and Maybe chuckle a few times throughout. The villains are typical, the drama is black and white...I don't know. I want to say I'm done with these pg family movies, but that sounds a bit extreme. I Loved the likes of Shrek and Toy Story.

There's an actual morale of the story AND realistic depiction of the internet, as in it's very simplified yet faithful to how some parts of the internet is.

423,AnnTWillis,Much worse than the original,5,18 February 2019,The promise of a continuing adventure in the gaming world was so exciting and the way that WiFi was structured was amazing-but the story was severely lacking. Penelope is portrayed as the one in the right the whole time but she is being just as selfish as Ralph is. But because she's a girl ahe doesn't have to apologize to everyone like EVERY SINGLE MALE CHARACTER does? They are brainwashing our kids to think all men have wronged all women and that's just not true. I want my son to grow up in a world where men and women are equals and apologize to each other for being selfish and impulsive. Not recommended for families with boys.,Ralph Breaks the Internet
424,dupregalaxy,Ralph bores the internet!,3,4 January 2019,"When the best part of a movie is the end credits, you know something is wrong!Whilst trying to make his best friend Vanellope happy, good old Ralph makes a boo boo contributing to the unplugging of Sugar Rush Racer. Ralph and Vanellope embark on an adventure to acquire a part from the world wide web. As per what we expect of Ralph he creates more problems whilst trying to find a solution.There are a few little quirks in the film. Vanellope enters Disneyland / Disneytown within the World Wide Web. My inner child definitely kicked into high gear, by seeing various characters from storm troopers to Disney Princesses. This short lived moment is probably where joy started and ended in the film for me. That is...until the end credits started!The film and it's concept had much potential, however there is only so much extended depressed toned dialogue one can handle throughout an animated movie.In Wreck it Ralph, Vanellope brought balance to Ralph's attitude and personality. However in Ralph Breaks the Internet we are faced with two main characters that appear to need a healthy dose of anti-depressants (even though I must admit Ralph does start off chirpy at the beginning of the film).Unfortunately this film did not live up to the wonder of Wreck it Ralph. If great animation, bright colours and a boring dose of Ralph is all you're after then definitely go for it.Signing offSilly D",Ralph Breaks the Internet
425,josephsmarkey,A Disney lecture with ads,5,22 June 2021,"Unfortunately, it's woke. Also, the title is misleading. It's not about Ralph. It focuses on Penelope and some feminist view of girl empowerment. (For those that don't understand, a ""feminist"" view of female empowerment means that if a girl wants certain things feminists think is good then it's empowering, if they want other things that feminists disapprove of, then it's some kind of wrong-think.) I don't know why this is content of a kid's movie, but I guess they are all like this now.The parts that weren't woke, but just light hearted and fun, were packed full of advertising.The first Ralph was fun and clever. This one is a feminist lecture with some heavy sponsorship. No, not a feminist lecture... It feels like a college-indoctrinated women-studies major who has some really deep but unconscious bitter roots wrote the story but doesn't even see how her warped sense of things oozes onto paper.A lot of eye rolling...

429,arogalsky79,I desperately wanted to love this movie,6,16 June 2019,"For a while, Disney looked like it took a turn in their animated feature films. After the Renaissance of the 90's era, they took a dip when there came less of a focus on the Disney films and more on the Pixar films. Then movies like Wreck-It Ralph came through, which had the heart of Disney till attached to the story and awesome plot twists which literally made me go ""no way!"" When Ralph Breaks the Internet came, my expectations were high. Although it still was fun, high energy and had our favorite characters, there's just something missing to it. I'm still trying to put my finger on it. but one thing for sure is the biggest thing I loved about the first is I never saw the ending coming. Disney has started this habit of churning cookie cutter movies with similar plot lines and fairly predictable twists, and Wreck-It Ralph didn't follow that format. Internet Ralph still doesn't, but it didn't have the same lovable quality that the first did. I think my predictions were just too high and the movie couldn't deliver. Is it a bad movie? No. It's entertaining still, just wasn't the same charm I was hoping for (also A LOT of pop culture references, which is annoying after a while)
I give it a 6, because the story is still good and the animation is great, but a weak sequel compared to its predecessor.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
430,mary-wilkinson1,Dragged on a bit,3,1 December 2018,"I took my sons to see this today. I loved the first film but this one was quite dry and, dare I say it, boring.
The film is slow to get going and once it does it becomes predictable, limping along from one scene to the next. Characters appear but it doesn't make sense for them to be there. Disney princesses just laying around together doing nothing? It was just a gigantic Disney advert really.
The premise was good and there's a few laughs but nothing great.
The woman who voices Felix 's wife is criminally underused and when she did speak she's been turned from a strong woman into a grinning loved up ninny.
There was so much they could have done with this film but they lost so many opportunities for a good storyline.
I was waiting for it to end about 90 minutes in. A couple of times I thought it was wrapping up but then it took another turn into a new adventure.
All in all I was disappointed in this film. I know a sequel is often not as good as the original but this just didn't do it for me.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

We even get the shady side of things with pop-up ads and viruses. You may want to get every reference on screen as you watch the movie, but the animators pack so many scenes with Disney characters and homages, you won't catch them all. That's also due to watching the story unfold. Ralph and Vanellope are fish out of water when in the internet. Seeing them find their way through the confusing world makes for a pleasant but not exceptional story. Giving both Ralph and Vanellope some fears and dreams helps amp up the emotional side of things, leading to Vanellope, after meeting the Disney princesses, singing what every Disney princess sings: a princess ""dream"" song about what she really wants.The voice work in this movie is outstanding. Reilly and Silverman deliver their character's emotional undercurrents. Gal Gadot as the leader of the racing gang in Slaughter Race and Taraji P. Henson as the talent expert fit perfectly with their characters. A multitude of actors and YouTube stars get their moments in this movie. It all makes Ralph Breaks the Internet an engaging story that has fun with its premise.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Dissing cheery children's films can feel a bit like kicking a kitten and we all know how that would go down on social media, even in animated form. But sadly this, while not as irredeemably, horribly awful as I was expecting, is still pretty rubbish.One wishes that this movie could be erased from existence - but for now, let's hope that the burning wreckage acts as a warning to never, ever do this again.Let's hope this isn't the future of animated features.Plotless, joyless and cash-grabbing, Ralph Breaks the Internet deserves the brunt of our wrath because it showcases everything wrong with Hollywood.

438,The_Invisible_Dog,Ralph 2 Breaks The Magic Of The Original,4,9 December 2019,"**SERIOUS SPOILERS BELOW**I loved Wreck-It-Ralph - one of my top ten Disney movies, in fact. Its message was warm and positive: outcasts finding true value in their uniqueness. More than that, what you remember the original for most is the real, enduring friendship between Ralph and Vanelope.Well along comes number 2 and blows that out of the water.Like so many others here, I agree it began well, but then it turned and all the warm-hearted friendship set up in Ralph 1 was replaced with a cold-hearted, lecture full of modern social-political cliches. Yawn.Vanelope doesn't just leave Ralph to go live in 'Slaughter Race', but she rejects her origins, her family, and all the children/fans who loved to play her in 'Sugar Rush' - she was their favourite character! She rejected a happy, fun world to go live in a dystopian hellscape.Yes i get there is a message about 'growing up' time to leave the nest etc. But unlike Ralph 1 lingers in its end message of embrace your unique voice within a loving family. Ralph 2 leaves a nasty aftertaste where friendship and loyalty are portrayed as clingy and obstructive and selfish abandonment of them in pursuit of wild danger and 'living the life'.Basically an advert for consumerism at its worst: forget the origins that nurtured you and all those annoying responsibilities to fellow humans that love you - Life is all about YOU!!Bah.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

They sometimes become so protective that they don't realize when they should step back a bit. It's not that they don't want you to follow your dreams. It's only that they are too scared of losing you in the process, especially if they have cozied up in their own lives.There are two friends: Ralph and Glitch (Vanellope), both inside an old gaming system.Ralph enjoys the daily life. He enjoys repeating the same thing everyday, and thinks that not doing anything would in-fact be an ideal case scenario.Glitch, on the other hand, is ambitious. She is looking forward for new challenges.They absolutely enjoy each other's company nonetheless.Ralph loves Glitch so much, that in the process of serving her up with challenges, he contributes to Glitch's life being at the verge of collapse. This is shown as Ralph trying to make up new racing tracks which leads to the breakdown of the gaming system they belong to.To reclaim the game, they go to the internet. Glitch finds a new game which is much more challenging, in the process of them trying to make money by making funny wreck-it-Ralph videos. The act of Ralph going through all the trauma to earn money to reclaim the game for Glitch shows his love for her.Glitch wants to stay in the new and challenging game... But Ralph's insecurities regarding losing his only friend makes him act like an emotional-demon. The insecurities(called as in-security) have been shown as security-threat which are copied by a virus, leading to almost-collapse of all of the internet.Finally Ralph realizes that he needs to let Glitch go, and not stop her from following her dream.Ralph goes back to his normal life.

Seeing real video game characters come to life and interact with each other was a childhood dream come true. The plot was good and the lessons about acceptance and overcoming labels were done in a terrific fashion. By using the characters from my past and a solid story for kids, they created a movie for people if all ages.
The same can't be said for Wreck-it-Ralph 2.The movie it geared more for teens. Most of the jokes will go over the kids heads and one of the main characters obsessions with wanting to live in a GTA inspired slaughter game isn't the best message for children.

Funny,
lot of great interesting ideas,
unique interesting message,
amazingly animated (duh),
fun references and fan-service.Cons:
references and fan-service (if you aren't into that),
scattered plot and characters,
blatant product placement,
retroactively distorting the first movie's ending.Additionally I should note that some of these points may differ for some as while I personally like the message and the ending I have seen some reviews that didn't, I enjoy the ending as it's a bold move yet a real and interesting message, however it is quite on the nose.Honestly I say see it and compose your own thoughts, definitely not a perfect movie by any means but not even close to terrible either.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The part, however, that really stuck out to me was the amazing story underneath all the humor. Movie tells a heartfelt tale of friendship, letting go, and the true bonds we make with those we love.

446,thetick-65848,"Would have been a great ""package"" animated film",6,18 March 2019,"From the trailers giving alternate and standalone scenes to the disjointed credits scenes, I got an impression that this movie was written with the overall plot being considered last. To the point that I think the plot could have been completely removed and it would have made the film better. A package film, made up of a series of shorts with just a bit of frame narrative, would have fit just right into a movie about Ralph making short videos for streaming sites. This should have been Ralph and Vanellope traveling over Wifi just because and having adventures on the internet during the night when the arcade is closed.The shorts should have been:
-Vanellope turns out to be really good at racing in a gritty modern racing game
-Ralph opens a toy box that turns out to be full of bees
-Ralph tries to play a prank with a virus and accidentally makes a giant King Kong of himself
-Vanellope convinces the princesses to wear normal clothes
-Ralph and Vanellope explore Ebay to look at how the vintage merchandise based on their game is selling and accidentally bid way too much on an item
-The princesses create a bizarre Rube Goldberg device to rescue Ralph and/or Vanellope from somethingThere were a lot of good jokes and fun sequences that could have easily been rounded out with a simple story and turned into shorts. This film could have been the compilation of those shorts, a commentary about how entertainment has come full circle and how the modern viral video is essentially the same as the first shorts and serialized films.Instead we got a weak plot that gives little more than a cursory glance at the first film and completely changes the characterization of its two central characters. The heavy handed lessons don't match the character arcs of the first film and there is almost no expansion on the first film's supporting characters.Overall, this film is mostly humorous and entertaining and works well enough as a standalone film. Unfortunately it is not a good sequel and falls far short of living up to the expectations set by the first film.

I was really surprised by that! All that was presented in a cool adventure. I laughed a lot in this movie. It was extremely funny & very entertaining. Also the script developed the friendship between Ralph and Vanellope and made it deeper than the first movie. If you loved them so much and felt connected with them in the first movie then I guarantee that this movie will make you cry as I did. It worked so well on the emotional level. I liked that there were more space this time for Vanellope. This thing and the development of their friendship as I mentioned gave more space for John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman and they did it again! They were great! Also I really liked Taraji P. Henson as Yesss, Gal Gadot as Shank and Alan Tudyk as KnowsMore. He also played King Candy in the first movie and was awesome.Rich Moore and Phil Johnston topped themselves! The movie is visually stunning and they created the internet world in a very unique way. There also some memorable scenes here like the Disney Princesses and Slaughter Race.In my opinion Disney scored a strike by this movie. We have a movie that tells kids about the internet with it's negatives and positives. We have a movie that has strong and powerful messages about friendship. We have a very entertaining adventure from start to finish without a single boring moment. We have cool characters, excellent humor and emotional moments. What do I want more than that? . The movie was 100% satisfying to me. One the best times I had in a movie theater in 2018. Go see it and don't forget to stay through the credits 😉",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Short cameos that excite you as you see references that maybe not all kids would see. Its message so clearly seen and portrayed, sad that it's only in focus for a brief part in the movie.

464,geekygirl-11825,"Ralph Breaks the Internet: Decent Movie, but a Poor Sequel",1,23 November 2018,"There are two ways to look at Ralph Breaks the Internet (or Wreck-it Ralph 2, as many will inevitably call it), and that is as its own film, and as a sequel. As a film on its own, this would be a fairly good movie. Fun worlds, a solid main cast, and a good lesson on friendships, though a bit ham-fisted at times.
However, as a sequel this movie does badly, not only not being a good follow u, but straight up breaking the first movie's logic and characterizations entirely, in ways including but not limited to:
Vanellope can leave her game: A smallish issue that represents a larger problem. If Vanellope still glitches, why can she now leave her game? The first movie clearly establishes (as a major plot point, no less) that because she is a glitch Vanellope cannot leave Sugar Rush. Yet in this movie, this is apparently no longer an issue.
Breaking World Rules--Don't mess with the Player: The whole catalyst for this movie is that Sugar Rush breaks when Vanellope resists the commands of a player. While the player wants to turn one way, Vanellope keeps fighting against them to turn another. In WIR, this kind of action is shown as a major no-no, but this movie doesn't criticize Vanellope for these actions at all, instead wanting viewers to be sympathetic towards her for this.
Out of Character Vanellope: Remember all of the hard work and struggling that went into making Vanellope a real racer in the original? Remember how complete and happy the ending was when she actually achiever her goal? Well the sequel doesn't. After only 6 years of living her dream, V is ""bored"" of Sugar Rush. Yeah, all of that hard work and suffering, and she's tired of it after only 6 years. Plus, her relationship with Ralph portrays her as a jerk, but more on that later. Not to mention that she shows no awareness or regret that she made everyone in Sugar Rush homeless with her selfish actions.
World Rule Breaking--Going Turbo is ok now, I Guess?: The worst part is the resolution. The entire point of Wreck-it Ralph is that going Turbo is bad. Everyone tells Ralph not to do it, and it's said over and over that it;s a terrible thing to do. The worst, even. But for some reason, in THIS movie, it;s ok for Vanellope to go Turbo, and abandon her game for her game for Slaughter Race, even encouraged and praised by the movie! It makes the whole lesson about ""friends can have different dreams"" sour, as it implies that it's a good thing for you to allow your friends to do immoral actions. This also makes Vanellope's character in this movie even worse, as she essentially ditches Ralph in order to commit a crime to fulfill her own selfish desires, and even worse the movie puts her in the moral right for this! That's a terrible lesson, given the context of the original, akin to ""if your friends wants to be a drug dealer or criminal you need to let them to be a good friend"".
Dropping other Characters: Hope that Ralph and Vanellope were the only characters you liked in WIR, because they're all you get. Virtually NO Calhoun, Felix, Sugar Rush racers, any video game characters, or pretty much anyone. It's the Ralph and Vanellope show. And while they're good characters, not including anyone else is a bad idea for a sequel movie.
So that's the general review for the movie as a sequel. A its own movie, if you had never seen the original, this makes for a bit better of a movie. Without the context behind going Turbo, this actually has a pretty good moral about friendship, and how friends can do different things but still be friends. The internet world is fun and colorful, and Ralph's character arc of dealing with insecurities is touching. Of course, it also has it's minor faults even beyond sequel ones, ones like:
Too much Meta humor: From an entirely subjective stand point, I'm just tired of Disney using so much meta humor. This is like the 4th or 5th film they've done this in, and it's getting old and unfunny.
Hamfisted dialogue and slow pacing: ""show don't tell"" is something that this movie struggles with. A moment will be emotionally impactful. or even profound, but then a character SAYS what the feeling of the scene is, or tells the audience why this scene is important. It's annoying, and demeans the audience. Also sometimes this movie can drag and feel padded, especially around the end.Overall, if you've never seen the original, or at least don't super like it, then this is a fairly good movie.
However, if you're looking for a good Wreck-it Ralph sequel that continues the world and character building of the original, you'll be left with a lot of confusion, plot holes, sour morals, and lackluster world building.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
465,ladyviola80,What is this foolishness?,1,1 January 2019,"Nothing new to see here, folks. Typical Hollywood fare: emasculate the men because, ya know, women are better. I am so sick of Disney shoving their ideals down our throats. Is it too much to ask for a film devoid of agendas, personal opinions and convictions of the producers/writers/directors? Something that is, oh I don't know, mildly entertaining? I may have been willing to forgive them putting Ralph in a dress if it actually served some purpose, but no. This film was a super hot mess.

It's a story about fitting in, finding your place and finding friends. Ralph's work in helping Vanelope getting back into the game she has been locked out of.
This film kills that in ten minutes, as she is no longer content with her life, and want to go to a new game, also, she does. So after working the whole film getting the money to save Sugar Rush, she still goes off and joins another game.
Add to that the useless and quite unnecessary mid-credit scene with an exploding rabbit and this film just dropped to the bottom of what is worth watching. Instead of being original and fun, it's a wasted opportunity and useless cashgrab that not only is a bore to watch, it kills the fun off the first film.Ignore and avoid this film at any cost.

475,lyy1992,Don't be serious on the commercial. Just take the story.,7,23 December 2018,"There are mixed bag of comments. Some says it's good like heaven, some says it's bad like hell. But you should know one thing, animation is all about storytelling. Trying to make the story sensible to the knowledge of internet while making the story emotional is a feat already. You know, knowledgeable people usually don't really know how to tell a story, and story teller usually very creative but not scientific. Nonetheless, this movie just did it right. They cherry picked the right elements of internet to make the story emotional. Development from stranger to friend is hard, from friend to best friend is even harder. You can have a lot of friends out there, but best friend, maybe none. If you have, please cherish yourself to the most, not all people can be as lucky as you.
Well, to be objective, it is not as good as the 1st one. Even so, the 1st movie still very heavily underrated. So why bother expecting it to be better right. Well they should not directly refer to the real world naming in their story settings, that's the only things that disgusted people.
The technogical elements are inferred correctly, that's the best part. Story wise, they tried to make it emotional, but it feels like disconnected at some points, in short, not as fluid as the 1st movie, but I've seen even worse one, so I don't mind.
Actually I think they can make the movie longer to perfect the development of the characters. Nonetheless, go watch it. It may be able to enlighten you some way. What and how you see is all about you, not the movie.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

486,sac-47138,Meh,5,22 December 2018,"It was a relatively cute movie, with some great characters and potential. Some problems were the level of ads, the climax, and to some extent the characters.
There were so many ads like a ridiculous amount. Even so the things actually important to the plot weren't real apps, odd.
The climax was literally just King Kong. A virus in the form of a giant Ralph picks Vanelope up and climes the google tower with her. Than a couple minutes later it switches to Rapunzal in the ""let me save him and I'll go with you"" type thing. It's like the same script Rapunzal used to plead with Mothwr Gothel to save Eugene.
Finally characters. There is a scene where Ralph admits to unleashing a virus into the Racing Game Vanelope loved. She forgives literally five minutes later. It's unrealistic and quite frankly a bad lesson for anyone. Someone can try to destroy your dreams, but you should forgive them with 0 issues about doing so before they even really apologize.

487,lesliejk,Brilliant and Mediocre - All at once.,7,25 November 2018,"This movie does some things quite right, but leaves some to be desired. The depiction of the internet and the it's various intricate mechanisms in place is portrayed surprisingly well and beautifully.Though it may not be quite as spectacular as Nolan's depiction of the 4th dimension, it is certainly comparable - and that is saying something something. The way servers, social media posts, going viral, packets of data and online avatars are explained - it is in a format where kids of any age can definitely get a good idea of how the most significant tool of the 21st century works under the hood. It is smart, funny and though provoking. There is also a brief, but relatable depiction of the dark-net which was a pleasant surprise.That being said, the movie does not raise any hairs and lacks a bit of the 'vibe' that the first one had. The plot seemed a bit feeble and changing and the storyline was just not deep enough to match with the wit and foresight with which the theme of the movie was made in.What was a surprise and a good feature of the movie - was Gal Gadot's character (Shank). Her character seemed cool, mysterious and I really wanted her to be more involved in the movie an have a bigger role than the one given.In a nutshell, the movie will remind you of arcades, mad max, facebook, insulting internet comments, death race and wreck it Ralph (1).It is good, but not great, It is not memorable, but definitely a fun family watch for a time or even two.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

There is SO MUCH product placement (eBay is the MAIN plot device, and is nearly an internet relic itself). It could have been good as a satire on fickle internet culture, but the events of the film have Vanellope latching on to a fad that will be gone in a few years. It basically forgets to do any satire, and resorts to ""Ralph does this meme, do you remember this meme?"" While there are some funny moments that kids now will get, most of it is so cringey, and will not even make sense to those kids in a few years.Also - very strange, almost 90's level representations of viruses and (?) pop-up ads. Does anyone still have to deal with pop-up ads?For all the pretty good representation of women (they have the best jokes in the movie, they're fierce and independent, etc.), these things make it clear this was created by old white men.

495,ienosretep,Surprisingly good and really funny.,8,19 March 2019,"Before I begin, I just want to apologize for marking this as containing spoilers. I'll try to spoil as little as possible, but I have to at least hint at a couple major plot points to get to the best stuff.So, I was never a fan of the original Wreck-it Ralph. I didn't dislike it either; I enjoyed it, but it wasn't any masterpiece in my eyes. Still, I'm a big Disney person (I'm even currently a ""Top Fan"" on Disney's Facebook page), so I was super excited when I found out about Ralph Breaks the Internet. I was especially excited to find that they were planning on including a Mario cameo, but that feeling was overtaken by disappointment when I found that those plans were scrapped. But that doesn't matter. I'm here to discuss my opinion of the final product, not complain about what didn't make it into the film.Summary: It's been 6 years since the events of the first Wreck-it Ralph, and Ralph's (John C. Reilly) life is pretty much perfect. When the arcade closes, he gets to spend the night goofing off with his best friend, Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), from the nearby racing game Sugar Rush, whether it's chatting over root beer at Tapper's, or racing each other through Tron. Ralph is perfectly happy, but Vanellope is starting to wonder if there's more to life than this, as she wishes something new and exciting would happen once in a while. ""But that doesn't mean I didn't love (Sugar Rush),"" she explains in one scene. ""Sure, it was kind of predictable, but still, I never really knew what might happen in a race. And it's that feeling, that 'not knowing what's coming next' feeling... that feels like life to me."" Soon, an important Sugar Rush part breaks, and the game is unplugged. While the other arcade citizens take the new homeless people into their homes (resulting in much hilarity when Fix-it Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) and Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch), now married, adopt 15 children), Ralph and Vanellope travel through the newly-plugged-in Wi-Fi router to the Internet, with the intention of purchasing a replacement part from eBay. And that's all you're going to get out of me for now.Where to begin? I really enjoyed the film. The visuals are top-notch, including the attention to detail, with references to many locations all over the Internet (the IMDb logo can even be seen in the background at one point), as well as various Disney properties at one point. Speaking of which, the Oh My Disney sequence is a love letter to movie buffs like myself, filling itself with references and quotes and jokes and even a Stan Lee cameo, because, as you know, Disney partially owns Marvel. The Disney Princesses' scene is absolutely hilarious. When my dad saw the film, he said he wasn't thrilled with it, but the Princess scene was worth it. Not to say the rest of the film isn't funny. On the contrary; the film is stuffed full of with moments to make you laugh, including a blink-and-you'll-miss-it Bob Ross parody that made the audience in the theater I saw it in applaud. However, after the musical number ends and the movie makes its way into its third act, it takes on a heavier tone and the jokes are significantly fewer.""Wait... did he just say something about a musical number?"" Yes, you heard me right. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Ralph Breaks the Internet is the proud home of yet another catchy Disney song entitled ""A Place Called Slaughter Race"", and by ALAN MENKEN, no less. If you don't know who Alan Menken is, look him up. Partway through the film, Vanellope, in a continuation of a joke made in the Princess scene, takes a few minutes to sing this touching but also quite funny song about how much she'd love to stay in Slaughter Race, backed up by resident NPC Shank (Gal Gadot) and various other people from the game. She then realizes that Ralph might not be very happy with the idea. Here's a sample of the lyrics: ""Welcome back! Watch your head! Hate to see you end up dead."" ""Let's get this party rollin'!"" ""Was that appliance stolen?"" Yeah, it's kinda goofy. Seriously though, it's a great way to explain an important plot point to the viewers....Which brings me to the message of the film. Upon reading other reviews on this same site, I find that many have noticed various flaws throughout the story, from how Ralph's character has been messed up, to a few plot holes here and there. Here's the thing: THEY'RE RIGHT. However, sometimes you just have to look past things like these before you find a nice, enjoyable story that actually is a pretty good movie anyway. Yes, a film may have its flaws, but sometimes you can just excuse them, either because they're necessary in order to convey a message or are small enough that they don't really matter. Or sometimes they do matter to the plot, and you can choose to ignore them anyway. That's what I like to do. Ralph Breaks the Internet's message can best be summarized in the words of Shank: ""There's no law that says best friends have to have the same dreams."" (SPOILER ALERT INCOMING) Vanellope realizes that she really wants to stay in Slaughter Race while Ralph, as you may recall, thought life was perfect until now and wants things to stay that way, being too attached to Vanellope. You familiar with the Dick van Dyke Show episode, ""Selfish Love""? Look it up. It's good. That's basically the gist of this movie. An even better way to summarize it is in Ralph's own words when he tells himself, ""It's not right to hold a friend back from her dreams. You don't own her; that's not how friendship works. You need to let her go. I know, it's gonna hurt a little when you do. Oh, who am I kidding, it's gonna hurt a lot! But you're gonna be okay. No matter where she goes, or where she lives, she's always gonna be your friend. You just gotta trust her. Because that's what best friends do."" Soon, he decides to follow his own advice. And I cried. That's right, this movie made a sixteen-year-old boy cry. Toy Story 3 is the only other movie to have that honor. Yes, the message feels a little bit forced, but it fits into the plot well, so I'm okay with ignoring it. (END SPOILER)In the end, I really liked this one, enough to have watched it 3 times within a 24-hour period, believe it or not! This movie joins the ranks of movies like Toy Story 2, Spy Kids 2, and Sister Act 2 as a sequel that's actually better than the first. My only real complaint is that Wreck-it Ralph and its sequel have a higher amount of what the MPAA classifies as ""rude humor"" compared to most other Disney films, and I rarely find rude humor funny. Oh well.Also, a word of advice. Near the end of the film, Felix and Calhoun will share the secret to parenting, having discovered it themselves. Listen closely to what they say. Their strategy is REVOLUTIONARY.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

497,elijahz,A complete utter disappointment,2,27 November 2019,"When I first heard this movie was coming, I was somewhat excited because I quite enjoyed the first one. But as soon as I started watching this movie I could already tell I was not going to enjoy myself. The movie feels like an unnecessary cash grab made to cynically squeeze every bit of money out of it, it is just a movie sized advertisement. The only bit I somewhat enjoyed is the musical number by Penelope two thirds through the movie but that in itself can not even start to redeem the rest of this garbage. Overall the more I think about it the more I hate this movie for tarnishing the mostly pretty good Disney revival",Ralph Breaks the Internet
498,jackcatman,A Sign of the Times,6,28 January 2019,"Think 'Inside Out' with a light touch of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' set in the absolute now.
In this sequel the arcade is abandoned for the world of the internet. So, instead of the classic arcade games of yesteryear, we now have the unlimited, ultra-modern world of the internet.
Sad thing however, is that is it clustered with shallow advertising for numerous websites (half the plot being basically to get enough money to buy something on ebay), the depressing moronic antics of shameless bloggers (showcasing how low the general intelligence and concentration is of the human race), and the self-referencing of Disney within a Disney film, which also has (gulp!) Cinderella break her glass slipper to use as a weapon against a child! (Yes, that actually happened!)
The plot and chatacter development are so so. It's not a bad film exactly, but totally lacks the charm of the original. In the end it just seems to showcase everything that is wrong with modern life, and Disney in particular. And makes me want to flick on Jungle Book or Snow White, just to remind me of what real animation used to be.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

500,grrr-25,Disney/Pixar is stepping onto some swampy downhill path,2,7 February 2019,"Preface - I am in love with the film Wreck it Ralph. One of the best animations ever.So, the story in short:Spoilt little female freak kid: I am bored. And girls just wanna have fun!Big lonely hulk male: I can HELP you! I want you to be HAPPY!The selfish little female glitch mess up her game and falls into apathy. The loser male character come up with the idea: let's go to the internet, we will buy a wheel!Both of them are crazy enough for betting on each other on an auction... they need lots of money... aaaandThe big imbecile loser male guy making himself a complete idiot just because he loves his little freak friend. He does everything to SAVE HER! At the same time the little glitch chatting with princesses about singing... and developing identity(?)Meanwhile the selfish small female confesses to her new friend (does not know anything about Shank but she is super cool - hey, that is enough!), so the little glitch tells her that the big hulk guy is boring, and SugarRush is boring too. So, she would stay instead butchering some game players... why not?Big imbecile dull male guy is lonely, wants to get back his BELOVED friend AND PROTECT HER. He is using small trick but does not want to hurt anyone!Things go wrong, hulk guy saves spoilt little female kiddo's life but she gets offended and send her best friend away...Virus copies the humbled BAD GUY, and the hell breaks loose. The BAD GUY saves the little freak princess from the BIG BAD BAD GUY.Then, the selfish little female freak forgives to the big imbecile and let him adore herself. But just from far distance, only weekly 1 hologram meeting allowed!Conclusion
1. The imbecile lonely big miserable male hulk allowed to make money to save his irresponsible female friend. At the end of the story he remains a BAD GUY, but allowed to worship his princess (sometimes). Does not matter the positive purpose or how big is your effort, the huge dull imbecile male loser will be just BAD.
2. Crazy selfish female glitch princesses has to fulfil their dreams, even if those are irrational. To be cool is more than enough, moreover desirable and the final challenge. They allowed to dispose about bad guys schedule, when to worship themselfs.
THEY ALLOWED TO GOING TURBO!My rating (2) is for the Bob Ross joke and few others. -8 is for the story and the massive tons of advertising.
I liked very much Ralph and I was in love with Vanellope. Disney has been achieved that I hate Vanellope and commiserating Ralph. Thanks.This film is not only one of the worst of all, but especially harmful. Save your time and the money for the tickets!Someone who has doubts about Disney/Pixar's downturn, just check the new Pixar short Purl!
edit: Almost forget to mention the end credits scene! The BAD GUY feeding a super cute white rabbit with pancakes ended up the bunny blew up and... probably burst. As the little girls face shows. This scene is over any limit. The tied-in child trying to escape as she is watching the horror but cannot, just kicking the air with her legs. The fright on her face represents her inner feelings. The shock is so huge, she cannot look elsewhere...
They came up with the idea, drawn, modelled, rigged, animated, rendered and cutted in at the very end.

501,TimJFrancis,A Spent Firework,5,16 July 2020,"This is like finding the dead rocket in a field after a great fireworks show. At first ya all excited wow, cool, then, the moment passes, it's just a spent firework, there's no more fireworks.First off, visuals, animation are great, lots of great ideas and the voices are fab, the best money can buy. But as a movie it is boring and lacked an ability to sustain empathy for the characters. At the half way point I wanted to bang my head against the wall, but I dragged my screaming brain along till the end.The advertising side of things didnt bother me like other reviewers, its been done before and it all made sense in the world they went into and it had fun possibilities, but the littering of bad or boring stuff ruined it.for example.
The princesses are all stereotyped, and then swap their dresses for another stereotype of relaxing gear that Penelope wore as if to say be different as long as its just like me, this was lazy and unimaginative, and failed on being funny.They also missed out on an opportunity to have Ralph paired off with a princess, which would have lifted the empathy factor, been funny, and kept a little of the real Disney in the movie. He just seemed to be there to use or blame.It's message to show that friends should not be clingy, or that we all need to find our own path and let go of the passed was cringeworthy at times. Because of the way they did it, it was almost sociopathic.There's so many points to cringe about in this film package, but, that's all I'm saying. Watch Goonies instead if ya want to see a friendship relationship movie and have fun.I would watch the first movie again because it had the magic, but this didn't take off.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

511,alecbehan,One of my new favorite movies of 2018 besides Incredibles 2!,10,24 November 2018,"I saw this movie while I was in New York City for Thanksgiving Break and I really loved it! I thought it was awesome! It's my second favorite movie of 2018 so far with Incredibles 2 being my first favorite movie of 2018 so far. Ralph Breaks the Internet was an awesome sequel to Wreck-It Ralph and it's like a better version of The Emoji Movie. This movie is like The Emoji Movie done right. Rich Moore and Phil Johnston did a great job directing this movie. Same with Clark Spencer as the producer. Henry Jackman did really good composing the music. My favorite scene was the Oh My Disney scene with the Disney Princesses and the Pancake Bunny & Milkshake Kitty in a mid credits scene. The Oh My Disney scene is where the magic happens, because you got pretty much almost every single Disney owned product and every Disney character ever. Nick Wilde from Zootopia makes a cameo in this movie and that was great! Same with Judy Hopps when she was talking to Rocket Raccoon in a distance (if you have good eyes for spotting Easter Eggs in animated movies) during the Stan Lee cameo while the Storm Troopers chase after Vanellope before Nick Wilde appears. The Disney Princesses were great in this movie! Ariel was the best one for me. The ending to the climax was pretty funny! I'm talking about that last part before the movie ends. It's Ralph in Snow White's princess dress and then a moment later, his belly was exposed! LOL Zero by Imagine Dragons was a great song in this movie and Gal Gadot was good as Shank. Taraji P. Henson did good as Yesss. It's great to have John C. Reilly back as Ralph in this movie. Same with Sarah Silverman as Vanellope. I loved everything about Ralph Breaks the Internet and I had lots of fun with the movie.

518,nathanvarner,Possibly one of the worst and disappointing movies I've ever seen.,2,20 June 2019,"In 2017, Sony animation secreted out one of the most pandering a awful movies known to man. With the magical minds of Sony behind it, it was already set up for failure before it came out. With an already laughable plot, one of the most disliked trailers on YouTube, and a plot that stole almost every element form more successful movies: The Emoji Movie was put out into theaters.Unfountanlty, this is no review of The Emoji Movie. Wreck it Ralph 2: Ralph Saves the internet (Now called just ""Ralph Breaks the Internet), is not only worse than The Emoji movie in my opinion, but is more unexcusable coming after one of the most heartfilled and genuine movies Disney put out of the last 10 years. As the first Wreck it Ralph movie succeed at creating a heartwarming movie with a clear & distinct character and amazing plot from a simple concept: the mere act of continuing the story was already set up for failure.First off, I fail to understand the reasoning behind the name change. It's a small gripe, but something that tends to bother me quite a bit. Though the animation and scale of the movie seems to be very promising, it is given a very shallow under toan with a lack of a ""lived in"" feel to the world, which makes the overall resolution feel unimpactful. With The Emoji Movie in mind, no matter what you'd say about it, there is not much else you'd expect from Sony. What makes Ralph 2 so disheartening is the fact that this was entirely produced by Disney. Coming off of the success of Zootopia and Moana, this feels incredibly rushed and corporate than any of the other features they've recently put out.As a story, I feel this seems more like an outline that a writer connected all of the scenes together in a weekend. The only part of the movie that I in fact felt fitted the story was the Dark Web type interactions with Bill Hader's character. Everything else felt half-assed and sloppy. Nothing flowed right and things just happened. I was left overwhelmed and exhausted by the end of it. I physically had to push myself away from the movie because of how sloppily the final conflict was put in. If there's anything this movie can be used for, I feel it can be used to show to film students on what not to do when writing a screenplay.I may blame the directing and writing, but this movie gives off a large feeling of studio meddling and type of rushedness that never really went away. With the amount of time they were given to create this, I don't really see any reasoning for this, especially with Disney's ""Hands off "" approach with Star Wars The Last Jedi. I wasn't really expecting that from a company with as good as a track record as this movie had. I challenge anyone to watch this movie and tell me they don't feel like it's has a semblance of studio meddling in it whatsoever.The best part of this movie is hands down the animation. Though not much to condemn these days, it did have a noticeable quality to it, and even a noticeable improvement over the orginal. I do feel however it felt as it was more polished and smooth than it should've been. The problems I have with the world inside the Wi-Fi place and everything else had to come down to the direction and writing. Now that this is the direction Disney is headed, I'm not looking forward to the new sequels to these other 3D animated movies or any more of these type of movies. With the bad writing, cheesy heart string pulling music, horrible direction and bad passing on top of it; Ralph 2 Was a disappointing movie which I am not interested in relieving anytime soon. I think comparing it to The Emoji Movie is bad enough for it to began with, but saying I think that movie was better that Ralph Breaks the Internet, should give you more of an idea on how bad it is. Thank You.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The story is mostly a build up of the emotions between Ralph and Vanelope's friendship in the original film. The product placement that rides throughout the movie plays a very important role as in the means of saterical elements like the Disney princess's.

521,divelostmind,He's gonna wreck it.,1,3 February 2020,"Let me begin by saying Wreck it Ralph is one of my favourite animated films of all time. The comedy still holds up today, you can tell passion and soul went into the script, voice acting and visuals. And it is this reason that the ""sequel"" is such a let down.It's a complete meme filled cashgrab with dumb repetitive unfunny jokes, bad comedic timing, unlikable characters which talk down to it's audience with exposition that is spelled out to you with no subtlety every step of the way.Wreck it Ralph was technically in development for over 40 years if you read the history on the films production. With time like that it's no surprise that a sequel made in 6 years isn't going to live up to the finesse of the original. They tried to capitalize on the momentum of the last film and Disney's roll of animated films. Oh boy don't get me started on Disney. This movie felt like an advertisement for all the intellectual property Disney now owns. It was a not-so-humble brag. There are scenes dedicated to simply showing off how much copyrighted franchises they own.Okay. I admit I have written everything up to this point as the credits were playing. I have just now reached the Rick Roll scene. Even that was a slap in the face. It just shows their excessive use of outdated memes and how out of touch the filmmakers really are.The side characters were forgettable and unfunny. You can see they tried to make the driver girl character 3 dimensional but that fell flat on it's face as without Venelope, she had no driving purpose in the plot.They made Ralph a codependent baby and you could tell from the first scene and ever since it became even more insufferable.You know what? I had it on 3 stars while writing the review but I'm going to change that to a solid 1.The whole film felt like it was bending over backwards to some Social justice, internet feminism agenda which diluted every potential joke and unique story direction.This movie is the symptom of needing a sequel so they made an inconsequential forced plot about nothing and tried to drive it by turning it into a movie about insecurity and female empowerment, despite the themes of the original having nothing to do with gender.The visuals were alright but even the colour palette and saturation of certain areas felt too strong or overexposed or just plain unnatural. I even noticed some background animation errors.This feels like a movie made by boomers to cater to generation Z children despite having no kids of their own.They finally wrecked it after all.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Imagine a movie about internet but has no website that you recognize, but it is good that the main story doesn't involve any real website.

This is the absolutely most boring animated movie I have ever watched and probably one of the most boring movies in general. There is nothing interesting in the story or in the characters. The plot is a stupid mess where no kind of logic is to be found. The morality parts about friendship and parenthood just feel awkward.

I like the ending cause it's different from what you expect from this kind of movie, Emotional for adults and a good teaching point for kids.
It had a few good jokes designed for the adults watching that made me smile.
There're lots of details in many of the internet scenes that if you're like me and like to check everything then you'll pause in many scenes and it's either funny or nostalgic most of the time.

Honestly, the movie would've been nothing without their involvement. I really hoped they had shown more of it... It left a great potential for a sequel or a spin-off where Disney could make a great use of it with all their fan-favorite franchises!!!The only flaw I felt was like Disney again making the same mistake they've been doing for the sequels of most of their animated movies, Incredibles 2, Finding Dory, Monsters University, like all these movies were just to bring back the fan favorite characters on screen again but the story is just small... Even though they're entertaining to watch... all these movies kinda drag their story till the end and just finishes off like that!!! Hopefully, we might be getting a good potential sequel where they could do it better with the story!!!But most of us are just gonna ignore those factors...

544,samahyalmudena,A mixed bag,5,17 December 2018,"As many others, I waited with expectation for this movie, and as many others, I was left with a bittersweet taste after watching it.This is probably one of the fastest, most entertaining animated movies of this decade. Unlike other (great) movies, like Moana and Frozen, that made me feel a bit bored at some points, this movie never felt too long or slow. That said, I remind you that ""entertaining"" isn't a synonym of good, though its fast pace certainly makes the experience of watching this movie pleasurable.Most of the movie's charm lays on its cameos and references, which are, almost always, really enjoyable to spot and watch. However, one can't avoid feeling that all those references are heavily dated (in ten years, children will most likely not understand them). In the same way, at times the advertisement of Disney's website, while is one of the most stimulating scenes in the film, can be a bit annoying.Another ""mixed"" issue I have with this films are the supporting characters. On the bright side, there are hardly any other films that empower women as subtly and successfully as this one (with maybe the exception of its predecessor). It's not only the fourteen Disney Princesses breaking stereotypes, the original female characters (Vanellope, Shank, Yesss, Calhoun) are all really strong and hold positions of power without being questioned because of their gender, while still being caring and understanding. The male characters, being numerically less, seem to be the kindest and softest characters in the film. However, there are way too many characters, and many of them, despite being interesting and unique, have too little screen time for the viewers being able to connect with them and their story. In the same way, the relationships between the new and old characters seem a bit rushed and not as solid and endearing as the ones stablished within the original characters in the first film. As a side note, I was extremely disappointed to see that two of the main characters of the first films, hardly got any screen time in this one.My main issue would be how the plot is driven. The first film was amazingly written, with a clear plot line, a defined conflict and a plausible resolution. Both the outer story and the character development seemed realistic and well worked. However, Ralph Breaks the Internet feels weaker and less convincing in its story and character arch than the first one. Most of the story's conflict is based on Ralph's and Vanellope's ignorance of the Internet world, and its resolution isn't realistic, it even can seem almost ridiculous. Moreover, the climax of the movie isn't in order to fix the main conflict, but a consequence of Ralph's and Vanellope's character evolution through the movie.In addition to that, I can't help but feel that, at times, the two main characters were, ironically, out of character, Vanellope being shallow and ungrateful (she literally falls in a behaviour that is deeply condomned in the first film), and Ralph being toxic and possessive. In that way, their relationship and the conflict they faced felt a bit bland, like if it was introduced for the sake of drama. It was obvious since the beginning what their problem would be, its evolution throughout the movie was weak and a bit inconsequential with the characters, and its resolution was plain cheesy. In fact, their story remind a lot of Mulan II, just less cringy.After acknowledging all these issues, it may seem to you that this movie was a major waste of time. But that's not true. Vanellope and Ralph are still those dorky, endearing friends. The movie still has a great message about friendship. The scores and animations are just gorgeous. And it illustrates perfectly how our modern, digital world works, with its good things and its bad things.Ralph Breaks the Internet is a entertaining family film that is totally enjoyable, and I have no doubt that, for many, will turn into a favourite. I personally liked it a lot, even if it doesn't quite match the standards of the first one. I highly recommend it to all people that enjoyed the first movie, and want to spend a good time (gamers and geeks will specially like it). Just remember, this is a movie whose plot and charm count a lot in pop references and cameos, so, if you want a timeless Disney classic, this may not be the movie for you.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

And yes, what is annoying about the internet is also annoying in the movie (the pop-ups, all the advertisement, ...). But is it bad that a movie who wants to portray the internet also shows the annoying part as annoying.And as it is Disney, can we be surprised that there is a story in it about friendship? Nope. So not a surprising movie, a safe bet from Disney. But if you want to relax as an adult, it is rather a safe bet too.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
546,stang-20579,Hollywood has lost their credibility.,1,2 March 2019,"Am I seriously to believe that Hollywood executives thought for one second that people would actually enjoy this""sequel"" to Wreck it Ralph?? It's an ridiculous to think that the writters even watched the first movie! It is so far off of what made Wreck It Ralph amazing. The story started out with good intentions and could have been great had anyone other than the animators, no even they got lazy in the end,even cared. Why even bother saving the Sugar Rush Game if it's STAR PLAYER leaves the game??? I mean COME ON!??? ""There are 16 other racers,who is gonna know I am gone?"" What??? Seriously??? ""Friendship is everything to us.."" ""We are like family"" well what happened to that whole line of thought? Just trashed it after one trip through slaughter race? What about the family that counts on the Princess who rules over an entire Game??? Veneolpe completely disregards the family she fought so hard to get in the first movie just because like everyone else in the world, her responsibility to said family is no longer fun for her. That is a great message to children of the world.
And what was that lazy, creepy, and disgusting giant Ralph virus at the end? Did anyone say ""Hey, let's really talk about if this is something a room full of people, especially children will like looking at"". They couldn't think of a good ""bad guy"" like Turbo/King Candy, they had to turn Ralph into the BAD GUY?????? Are you freaking for real?
What a waste of time and money. Nothing and I mean nothing about this movie is good. It is annoying, sad, tired, obnoxious and actually expects the audience to drop IT OFF points by the end to get through it. So glad Felix and company kept a low profile for most of this shambles. I truly believe they thought the Disney Princesses could save this, because it most definitely did not enhance it in anyway. I can not stress how much I disliked this annoying garbage.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
547,sharktoothxxx,Great sequel for all ages!,10,30 March 2019,"It is rare that I like anything let alone as much as I like this movie and it's predecessor!
Yes, like any piece of media it has its faults. One fault is plot inconsistencies (ie. the fact that a glitch can't leave their game yet she does even though she's still a glitch... Other miniscule ones as well). Also moments that can be conceived as modern feminist propaganda by extra sensitive people though the things that happen do make sense in the given contexts they occur so i would disagree. Finally it would have been great for other main characters to learn lessons like greatfullness in the end as well. In the end though it's strengths far outweigh these flaws! It's fun and upbeat with many jokes that land. It's also a fine example of how to make a powerful female character even if she is secondary instead of a political one. Finally, it's message of friendship is one that is dealt with in a solid way that even adults could learn from though typically from a more special kind of friend. Either way great movie, great message, great fun, great songs, and great greatness.
Now stop reading my boring review and go watch it",Ralph Breaks the Internet
548,DaveOfCrows,An average movie and an average sequel,6,23 November 2018,"Initially I was skeptical about Ralph Breaks the Internet. The trailers made it seem like it would be a movie with a lot of Disney references and not much else going on. I couldn't discern a plot or anything that particularly stood out. However, when reviews started coming out some people were saying it was pretty good. I saw some 9/10 scores. Was I wrong in my initial belief that this movie would be just average? I was not.If you want a quick recommendation as to whether or not you should go see this movie I think it depends on you. It's a good enough family film and will keep kids entertained for a little while. It also has some nice animation and some cool visuals. Overall though I would say it's just average movie and is one to skip until it's out of theaters and available to buy.As for the more detailed points I want to start with the positives. Spoilers from here on out. I like the general theme of the movie. The main conflict is that Ralph and Vanellope are beginning to go in different directions in their lives. Ralph's past experiences with being hated as a villain leads him to feel insecure at the idea that Vanellope may no longer be his friend if she pursues a different path in life. This is a really great conflict and something that most people go through at some point. It's also a natural progression from Ralph's issues in the previous movie of feeling hated and like he has no place in the arcade.This also ties into the next thing I like, the movie's villain. Ralph distributes an insecurity virus to a game, Slaughter Race, in hopes it will convince Vanellope to leave it. It ends up copying him and creates a bunch of mindless zombie Ralphs who attack the internet in search of Vanellope. The villain is pretty creepy to look at once all the smaller Ralphs merge into a giant monster and is a neat external representation of an internal conflict.Now for the stuff I didn't like. The visual references to the internet and jokes about it bothered me a lot. They felt predictable and like the safest thing Disney could've done. Some of the references feel as though they will become dated quite quickly. I would've preferred if instead the movie had created more unique websites that didn't exist and kept references to real sites more minimal. The part where the characters go to the Disney website also felt very forced and like an excuse to shove in references.Secondly, while I do think Ralph's characterization and insecurity is a natural progression from the previous movie there are other aspects to it I disliked. Ralph acts very childish in this movie to the point of it being played for a joke. While there are some things he's done in the previous movie that could be called childish it was just a bit too much for me. Additionally, while he was quite selfish in the previous movie, he left his game in danger just to validate himself, the disaster of Sugar Rush nearly being destroyed was a mistake. In this movie he knowingly infects a game with a virus and does other things that have real and serious consequences for characters. After the last movie I wouldn't expect him to do things like this. In the climax of Wreck it Ralph he sacrificed himself to save Sugar Rush and learnt that being a villain is important even if it isn't glamorous. ""Don't be selfish"" is a lesson I expected him to have learned already. I think there are other ways to escalate the conflict or involve a virus without him being quite so selfish and reckless.Finally, this is a bit personal but I just didn't like the humor. I already mentioned this a bit in my previous point about disliking the jokes about the internet but other jokes I didn't like much either. This isn't a point I typically make and I recognize this is very subjective but considering the jokes take up a good bit of the run time it did impact my enjoyment of the movie quite a bit.Overall Ralph Breaks the Internet is an average movie. I wouldn't have any issue being forced to watch it again but it definitely isn't as good as the first movie. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it and I felt like its potential just wasn't realized.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

550,aidenjgray,Meh,5,9 December 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet review: A little late, but over Thanksgiving break I saw Ralph Breaks the Internet. To tell you the truth, I don't have much to say. I just thought it was fine. There were some enjoyable parts, but it wasn't great. Which caused me to be disappointed because the first film was quite good. The main thing I noticed is that I didn't laugh once while watching it, nor did I find 90% of the jokes amusing at all. Behind all the flash of the internet, the main plotline is pretty formulaic. If I am going to point out the pros, first I'd start by saying the cast do a great job with the script they're given, which is to be expected with such a talented cast. One character who really stood out to me was @tarajiphenson as ""Yes"". I really enjoyed her when she was on screen. And Gal Gadot is fun as Shank. Another fun aspect was when Vanellope went to OhMyDisney.com. There are a ton of Disney cameos and easter eggs all around from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, etc. What I really noticed, was that I enjoyed everything BEFORE they went to the internet. The interest was fine and fun, but going back to the arcade brought a good feeling. Overall, I thought it was fine.

The storyline was beyond weak and the characters weren't even likeable in the slightest. The messages that are portrayed are horrible and have no underlying meaning..No real comedy. I didn't laugh, not once. I will admit that the princess scene was fun and iconic, but that's all. Overall, this movie was... alright, I guess. It had potential after the first amazing movie.

557,edwardnathan-79827,It is ok but could have been much better,5,16 March 2019,"I just watched Wreck it Ralph 1 and 2 back to back and the sequel does not live up to the 1st one. There is still a lot of good in this movie: the animation is very good, voice acting is very good, the jokes hit enough to keep it light for much of the movie. The plot and pace is where this movie is lost. It isn't until the end that I realized I wish they did this movie differently.So just a couple of thoughts after watching.The Disney part is forced and really offers little to the movie in humor or plot. It is just filling up time.Felix should have a larger role in this movie but after Ralph and Vanellope leave for the internet you do not see Felix again until the end. This movie could have benefited from one or two characters being a little more prominent.Vanellope wants excitement and change after 5 years of playing the same game. She ends up becoming part of a different racing game and there is no comment about her going 'Turbo'. The fact she leaves her game and Ralph behind so quickly was sad and it happens near the end of the movie so it doesn't get back up from that.Ralph's defensive emotions come out when he realizes he will lose Vanellope and he basically becomes the antagonist...or more precisely his emotions are labeled 'insecurities' and they actually become the antagonist. It is a cliche we have seen from Disney Villains over and over again. I am not sure there needed to be a villian in this movie and the fact Ralph and his emotions became one seemed forced.Things got weird and slightly boring after they buy the replacement steering wheel for way too much money. Having Ralph make videos for money seemed very forced. It would have been better for the plot if they never got the wheel and the Candy Rush characters had to find a new home for themselves.To conclude a lot of the aspects of the movie are good but the plot and pace of the movie is not that enjoyable as much of this movie seems forced so that the characters can get to the next scene.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
558,minimalcheeseburger,Too much Agenda,3,28 April 2019,"I don't mind the movie until they made Van-P crazy for the wild life Instead of being loyal to her own game...cause she was the star.And all the Disney princess stuff was a slap in the face to men and I just find that lame.I loved the YouTube part though, I thought it was kinda funny!",Ralph Breaks the Internet
559,annamaerae,They made it a recipe,5,1 March 2020,"The recipe for success is video game nostalgia, warm friendly morals, and heartbreaking scenes.
No?
I guess not.
They pretty much copied their own formula from the first movie but expanded and withheld the underlying subtext in exchange for an 'in your face disgrace'. The theme is insecurity and friends sometimes having to let go of friends. Makes sense in the era of high school college and work. We all part ways eventually, but there could've been a lot more to this.
Obvious face slaps aside, it's not that the movie was bad. Just boring. It fell flat and like the emoji movie relied on bright colors and obnoxious slapstick humor to get kids to watch. Any adult wanting to see this came for the Disney princess collab. Wasn't worth it.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
560,mlpvera,Feels like a commercial and it's such a shame,2,7 August 2021,"This movie is the worst thing I have witnessed in a long time. It's just a long ad with reference humor that will age very poorly. Unlike the first one where the references was cleverly inserted into the story. It's easier since classic gaming doesn't really change drastically and you don't really need to know that much to get the funny moments and concept. It gives the world a setting, it's charming, fun differences with the animation and has very strict rules which are easy to follow (and are logical). Memes and brands however come and go very fast (with likability and relevancy mostly) and it doesn't feel real or authentic. The goat meme won't age well for example.The biggest issue however is the drastic character change from the first movie. Ralph who was a strong, independent yet kind guy turned into a insecure, stupid manbaby with no irrational thinking. Vanellope is rather the same which is nice. But I can't stress how much I dislike movie plots that are forced/pulled by funny gags or the characters being ""dorky and quirky"". I really think kids understand more than Disney think. It's a shame that some movies (targeted at kids but enjoyed by most) are being illogical, breaking their own set of rules just to create drama and conflicts. This is one of those. Save your time and watch the first one instead. Or watch another one that challenges you/your kids intellect. This is a movie that looks down on you and your ability to get basic information. Show don't tell.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
561,josephmartinelli,Underwhelming,2,29 June 2021,"Wreck-It Ralph(2012) is one of my favorite animated movies. Being a fan of video games, the film instantly appealed to me, with many recognizable video game characters and and references that only gaming nerds like me would get.(plus an amazing Owl City song). It was a film I watched frequently during my middle school years. I was pleasantly surprised yet a bit skeptical when it was announced it would be getting a sequel on Ralph on Vanellope traversing the internet. Me and my family eventually got around watched the film, and while it was nice to see the characters from the first movie again, I couldn't help but feel disappointed and unimpressed. It was too easy for me to feel that this wasn't even a sequel to Wreck-It Ralph, but instead this underwhelming, unrecognizable mess that just happens to feature the two protagonists from the movie Wreck-It Ralph, who make unfunny jokes about the internet for an hour and fifty-two minutes.The film attempts to deal with the real-world issue of toxic relationships. With Ralph attempting to prevent Vanellope from leaving the arcade, due to her enjoying the internet more than her old game Sugar Rush. However in doing so, Ralph had went from being a sympathetic character who just wanted to be respected, to a completely unlikable ""protagonist"" who nearly murders his best friend with a computer virus at one point in the film.Ralph and Vanellope go into the internet in attempt to purchase a steering wheel for Sugar Rush, which is on the verge of being scrapped due it the game age. Sugar Rush's demise would render Vanellope and her friends from the game homeless. The two attempt to raise funds for the wheel using various methods, eventually cultivating into an idea of turning Ralph into a meme, which is as every bit as unfunny and corny as it sounds, I never thought I would have to see Ralph's face photoshopped onto a goat.Ralph and Vanellope then enter a Disney website, which provides the audience with cameos from various Disney characters, such as Buzz Lightyear and Groot. While this is a cool moment for die-hard Disney fans and causal movie-goers alike, I can't help but feel these scenes were just used by Disney fill space while at the same time using these cameos to stroke their ego, reminding us about the properties and franchises they own, and of course taking the opportunity to dangle the fact that they now own all the Marvel and Star Wars movies over our heads.Moving on to more positive aspects of the film, as with most Disney movies, the visuals are impressive, the atmospheric designs of the buildings makes me think that if the internet was a city, it would be this. The film also provides some good satire on Internet culture through the use of side characters like KnowsMore(voiced by Alan Tudyk, who played King Candy in the first film) and J. P Spamely(voiced by Bill Hader, one of my favorite actors.) who satirize search engines and clickbait ads respectively. The RickRoll at the end also made me laugh, one of the few points in the movie to successfully do so. The song Vanellope sings towards the middle of the film is also a nice, albeit forgettable tune, at least compared to other Disney movie songs. I also enjoy the song Imagine Dragons contributed to the soundtrack.The film reaches it's conclusion with Ralph and Vanellope and getting the steering wheel fighting and defeating the aforementioned computer virus, that has now transformed into a giant Ralph, which is supposed to be a representation of his insecurities. Vanellope stays on the internet and parts ways with Ralph, who has been ""redeemed"" and heads back to the arcade.I almost forgot about Felix, probably because he takes up about three or four minutes of screen time. They set up a sub-plot with him and Sergeant Calhoun(who have become a couple since the first movie) where they take in Vanellope's friends from Sugar Rush. But we don't cut back to hem until the end of their movie where the film quickly provide an explanation and is seemingly solved. Reading about the production process of the movie, there were going to be more scenes featuring the two but were cut from the final film. This is disappointing to me, as I feel the sub-plot could have had potential. I guess there just wasn't enough ""funny"" scenes where Ralph's face is superimposed over videos of animals.The future for the Wreck-It Ralph franchise at the time seems unclear, John C. Reily, who provides the voice of Ralph, was asked by Toronto Sun if he has any ideas for another movie. Reily replied that he would like to see ""Ralph and Vanellope beaming themselves right out into space"".... whatever that means.On a final note, Ralph Breaks the Internet, feels too generic to be the tile, they even make a joke about how the title would be better as ""Ralph Wrecks the Internet"". Reading more into the production reveals that the film had the words ""Wreck-It Ralph 2"" in the title, but was removed from unknown reasons. I feel this is almost the symbolic nail in the coffin of how the film feels disconnected from the original. The film is fine when you forget about how it was a sequel to a much better movie, but when you remember, it just serves as a weak follow-up that doesn't need to be seen after your first watch.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

563,tired-sparrow,Step backwards from first movie...,3,13 January 2019,"This film was weird and uncomfortable. It was a huge step backwards from the first film.In the first Wreck-It-Ralph, there is a scene in which Ralph destroys the race car he and Vanellope built together, in what he saw as a way to try to protect her. It was emotional and powerful and tear-jerking. After Ralph realizes what he's done, the rest of the movie is spent wrapping up their character development and solidifying their friendship. In Ralph Breaks the Internet, there is nothing of the sort. Everything felt forced and rushed. There is no heart. Ralph and Vanellope feel like completely different characters who didn't spend an entire previous movie establishing character development.I would have preferred to watch a film focused to their ""six years"" of being best friends and goofing off around the arcade, which they only briefly touch on at the beginning. Instead the movie skips that timeframe and we are jerked forward to the point AFTER all that has occurred. Vanellope is horrendously bored with her life and essentially her friendship with Ralph too. I will never not be baffled that this was the plot they decided to explore for the sequel. It was depressing to watch, to be honest.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

One bad choice leads to another. This movie ruined the friendly goofy Ralph image for me. Instead, I see a big idiot running around places he doesn't know and do things he doesn't understand. It's hard for me to watch his choices throughout the movie, even when he doesn't mean no harm. He could have killed Vanellope and her games TWICE!As for Vanellope, consider what happened to her game and how bad ""going Turbo"" is, she's still chose to went to another game just because it's ""cool"". It's a message of following your dreams but it also encourages hurriedly decisions based on just first-glance impressions in a world that she's just getting to know.For overall, I feel like this movie was too focused on how much brands and easter eggs in one movie. The plot was dull, the choices are bad. The only good thing about the movie was the visual design for the internet world and the characters.

565,gibby_xl,A shell of the first movie,5,25 November 2018,"Wreck-It-Ralph was like a love letter to classic video games, full of nostalgia and humor. Ralph Breaks the Internet is a love letter to the internet, full of blatant consumerism. Any cameos in the first movie were gems from the vein of our childhoods, and the cameos in this sequel are from previous Disney films or from a business.

I didn't see any messaging, personally, that disparaged boys or men in general. It DID have some girl power elements, but not in the tone of ""male=bad"". I think that distinction is important.Not every movie needs to have a male hero to legitimize a powerful female main character.Hopefully, with time, more people (and fathers especially) will become more comfortable with that concept.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Then I started to seeing a lot of advertisement( EBay, Amazon, Snapchat, Disney itself, Marvel.) While I agree that it's a good idea to have pop culture references scattered everywhere in this movie, and there are lots of them, it served as more of product exposure than meta references. I also started to see the same tired formula of the hero, being stupid as well as the secondary character, being stupid which leads to bad decisions, which means they split up after all their hard work.

He sucked in this one! He was just an insecure, needy character who was kind of a pain in the butt. Liked him sooo much before, in the first movie. It was an teachable way there: even if you have the role as an villan, you don't actually have or want to be a bad guy! Teachable!What did this movie teach us? That girls love being bad*** and it's the feminist year? Disney princess just see water and sings? Penelope is officially a princess who doesn't have a good singing voice?

A lot of the humor and exciting parts from the first film involved Fix it Felix, Calhoun... and many other of the characters they just completely diminished. They brought life to the film. They made Ralph extremely clingy and Venellope just mean. I can't believe she was suppose to be the leader of Sugar Rush and just abandoned them. It just didn't make sense, it could've been great. Opportunity missed.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

It also got away from its own rules in the Wreck-it Ralph universe.In the first movie, a video game character can't leave his arcade to go into other arcades because it'll cause the system to crash aka going turbo. Yet in Ralph Breaks the Internet (which turns out to be an exaggerated title), Vanillape 'goes turbo' to into a mature content internet game - nothing happens to Sugar Rush (yes, the girl who is seen on the game console vanishes from her own game deliberately!)Ralph is a loyal friend who tried to help Vanillape save her game at first (gets a whole bunch of money for her sake), but he goes too far by buying a virus to stop Vanillape from joining Slaughter Race (a twisted metal, grand theft auto parody, I guess?) The virus feeds off of 'insecurity' and creates a whole bunch of insecure Ralph clones ( because being a caring friend makes you insecure).Vanillape and the new third wave feminists Disney Princesses help rescue Ralph from the Ralph clones, and...Vanillape goes turbo. She says she'll write back to him from time to time.Ralph Breaks the Internet was not all that good. More like meh.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
584,Sunnydws,Ralph: An Emotional Wreck,6,22 January 2020,"Gaming has evolved. A social past time that was, and still is, conducive to community building. What began with arcade consoles, wonderfully simplistic and rich with nostalgia, has given way to the new age of gaming: the open world. Itself full of possibilities and pitfalls.This becomes the existential crisis for our two main characters, Ralph and Vanellope. Ralph is perfectly content with his closed world and the familiarity that shields him. Vanellope, on the other hand, is feeling increasingly confined by the limitations of her game.The internet offers Vanellope the escape she's been wishing for. She is enthralled by the endless opportunities an ""open world"" game provides her. However, she is afraid to tell Ralph about her self-revelation, in fear that it may seriously alter their very close friendship. We get our first look at Ralph's insecurities when he inspects some of the online comments to his viral videos. He is visibly hurt by the toxicity of the internet, but takes solace in the fact that Vanellope is a true friend that always sees the best in him. When he overhears Vanellope speaking privately about how Ralph won't be able to handle the changes to come, Ralph is heartbroken. He haphazardly sets loose a virus to coax Vanellope back, but when she discovers that he wrecklessly tried to manipulate her into returning, she is furious. Ralph's plan truly backfires when the virus duplicates his clingy and overbearing insecurities and sets off to destroy the entire internet.Ralph going through an existential crisis is a recycled theme from the original movie. It cheapens the strides his character made by having him look so needy and deprived of emotional support. Yes, their relationship is charming. But that only makes it harder to suspend the disbelief that Vanellope wouldn't be honest with her closest friend about the way she was feeling. And to not have her own up to her mistakes is glaring. She complete discards all her subjects from Sugar Rush by saying ""I'm one of 16 racers. They won't miss me."" She's the highlight of the game. Again, something clearly established in the first movie that is cast aside to force a wedge between two great friends in this sequel. Ralph is justifiably angry by Vanellope's selfish choices, but there's no resolution to that end because not long after their confrontation, Ralph's insecurities morph into a giant scary, chaotic mess. It would seem distrust is a far more toxic quality in a relationship, but Vanellope is never made to answer for why she wouldn't just be up front to begin with.The movie is not devoid of fun sequences, however. Although it totes a very fine line between fan indulgence and outright product placement, it's a sight to behold. I can't imagine the number of Easter eggs and little gems hidden among its finely crafted pixels.It's worth a glimpse. And the visuals and cameos will keep your eyes very busy. But the charms from the original movie are found lacking here.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I think most of the people rated this movie as 1 because they could not handle the issues covered in this movie. Disney goes beyond the cliches and gives a ""woke"", humorous twist to the main problematics of the modern age. The refugee issue (sugar game characters became homeless and no one wanted them), the boring patriarchy all over the movie sector (strong man saves the female) , incorrectly weak female representations ( vs. strong and warrior princesses), toxic friendships/relationships (forever together ralph virus) etc.The contrast between the cute/sugar racer glitch wanting to be in Slaughter race was also adding a nice spice over the movie. I must agree that some fragile m's got offended by a Cute little girl being an excellent racer, but they must not forget that this is a great representation of our little girls and boys.Lastly, I do not think this is a mere advertisement. People got irritated by the representation of the digital companies in the movie, but the movie takes place in the internet for ralph's sake :) I was really amused to see all of my favorite social media , and I really enjoyed the clever creativity that lies beyond imagining them as realistic buildings, workers, people. Pop up guy was truly hilarious and irritating, for example.Thank you.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Some may find this type of ""endorsement"" annoying, but it's a film about the internet, let it be about the internet!There were quite a few big laughs in here that I found were funnier than the first film. The cameo of Disney princesses is going to become an iconic scene for the Disney canon.That said, the plot itself was slightly lacking and felt a bit lazy, and the writing of Ralph's character was slightly disappointing- insecure, jealous and clingy - which was unfortunately a bit forced.Overall, if are familiar with internet trends and love Disney references, you will find something to love about this movie!",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Cameos and references are a big part of the movie, but at no point this is ""just an advertisement with no plot"". In fact, more than ""advertisement"" they're just a quick joke reflecting on our internet use, including spam, irresponsible shopping, online gaming, etc.But the thing that amazes me the most is that people said this movie has no story. This movie starts all play and fun, but ends with an important lesson in growing up and letting friends go their own way. It's just as poignant as the first one on the emotional level.

And it was around that point the movie started to head toward a garbage-filled dumpster fire.And regarding the so-called 'Princesses'? They should've left that out, as well as the shameless brand plugging/advertising that was in this movie.

Most of the characters who meet Ralph and Venellope are very helpful and charming. Some people may find them very unbelievably nice comparing how real life works.Unlike the first movie, this movie's story have much more drama than action, the quest is quite linear but a relationship problem have a lot of depth, which some people might find it interesting or boring.The villain (or a threat) to me is also unexpected and surprising too, like the first movie.it is worth to have a second watch to realize how well it put together and catching some more internet references.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

623,gigakurnia,Enjoyed every second of it,10,8 December 2018,"I went here on IMDB to see the review and expected to read mostly positive reviews. I was surprised by the amount of negative reviews because I totally can't relate.I had very high expectations since I have just watched the first Wreck It Ralph and love it so much. Went to cinema with a bit of sceptical since how can they make an even better version of it? But I was blown. Ralph Breaks The Internet did not dissapoint at all.Me and my friends enjoyed this movie so much and I myself am planning to watch it again. The idea is unique and delivered well. The visual is astonishing. The jokes are funny and relatable to internet communities these days.Overall, worth every second.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The whole Princess insertion was silly.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
625,picardtseng,"A very good sequel but upsets me, would rather things be done differently",6,5 December 2018,"Generally speaking it's a very good sequel. Without being offensive, Ralph Breaks the Internet is better than some most recent Pixar sequels such as MU, Finding Dory, CAR 3 and Incredibles 2. However, personally I considered it partially ruined some most treasurable parts of the first one. I never thought a film features Disney-princesses cameo could ever upset me.What I mean is the conflict between Ralph and Vanellope. It is not said that the story development was bad, but I would rather the script writers did something else.
It was too forced, to make Ralph the actual villain in the film. There was no sign that Ralph would be that clingy and selfish to the relationship with Vanellope according to the ending of the first film; Remember Vanellope invited Ralph to stay but Ralph chose to go back to his game?True, Disney tempt to touch something deeper just like what Pixar usually temp to do, such as the friendship dilemma between Vanellope and Ralph. But if it was done too deliberately, it would be more like preaching to kids instead of telling a clever story. Personally, I don't like good settings be thrown away in the sequel for ""further development"". Just like Ralph, even though he conducted his self-redeem in the end, there were still some damages hard to be undone -- It was hard to believe Ralph, who did all efforts regardless of his own life to rescue Vanellope and her game from a virus, pour a virus toward Vanellope and almost threaten her life.And the story was finally end up with a huge unfairness. Vanellope let her heart decide, abandoned her own game. In the first one Ralph chose to return to his humble job due to the responsibility. While Vanellope was tracing what she really want, Ralph desperately doing web celebrity things, tolerating negative comments. Is this what Ralph want to do or what he desires?Tracing dream is not wrong, but this alone won't make Vanellope special. On the countrary, it is not uncommon for nowadays Disney films that a girl being born with outstanding talent and strong personality, dares to break rules to explores her true identities and makes her dream come true; Disney does it all the time. If you want to be something more, Olaf's quote is a good example: ""Love is when you put someone else's need before yours"". True, Vanellope is facing a difficult dilemma, but to some degree, she is a little bit ungrateful and irresponsible. And this is the curious thing: ""Going turbo"" was a serious exception in the first film, how could it became a positive thing to do this time?Ultimately, thing is sort of frustrating. Although Ralph's attitude toward the friendship is not healthy, it is Ralph that has to make most sacrifice and to suffered more hardship. Vanellope had right to choose a much descent life, and she could easily makes a bunch cool new friends. Poor Ralph, a prude, never had the same chance. Yes Ralph did tried hard to broaden his social circle, which is a good thing, but it is so evident that there is no replacement for Vanellope in his daily life, including his old buddy Felix.True it is closer to true life scenario that one's effort might not pay off;
Shank's quotes for changing of friendship are good. But what we expect from a Disney animation is something a bit more positive and encouraging than the real life,
just like the original Wreck it Ralph. One thing made the original Wreck it Ralph so
encouraging is the interpretation of heroship. In fact Ralph is some sort of
reflection of most normal people -- you are not an attractive star,
you might not be in a pivotal position, most of your hard works might mostly
be ignored. However, even though Ralph's role is being a villain, he essentially showed all traits of a good guy, including sympathy to the weak, having feeling of justice, willing to help someone in need. Those think made him a true hero, instead of winning a golden medal.But in the sequel, Ralph behaved so pathological and selfish, having no idea where it came from (It was NOT Ralph going to looks like in the end of the first one), his image was ruined. Most frustratingly, he did lot of efforts to save Vanellope's game just like the first film, those were not worthy because Vanellope is thinking of leaving in the mean time.Turn to the positive parts. The interpretation of the internet world and social network phenomenon is spectacular, Slaughter Race is cool (although personally still prefer Sugar Rush); The princesses cameos are super awesome that I could watch it millions times.In the beginning I can't help worry that the IPs and cameos parts would be huge distractions, but it didn't happen; those cameos parts were not only exciting, but also contributed to the main story development. One of my most favourite part is Vanellope's song, a super genius ""style mismatch"" right after the princess cameo. You might thought Vanellope is the last one to do a princess-style musical, but Disney deliver one immediately. Shank is also an interesting character, but never close to Felix and Calhoun in the first one. It's a huge pity that Felix and Calhoun were left out.In conclusion, Ralph Breaks the Internet is a high quality sequel, even though
it didn't entirely fulfill my expectation and partially make me feel down.
Certainly, I considered it inferior to the first one.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
626,lycallahan-07595,Don't over think it. (May contain spoilers tho I tried to be vague),8,9 December 2018,"I saw this today with my 11-yr-old son. The animation was spectacular - actually candy for the eyes. The basic premise was straight-forward and believable - Ralph tries to do a nice thing for his friend but because he's Ralph, he screws up. Next he tries to fix it but because he's Ralph, he screws up even worse. While the fixing is happening, Vanillope is shown a whole new world, which Ralph sees as a threat to their friendship. He tries to stop the threat but because he's Ralph... well, you know the rest.You can't make a movie about the internet and use made-up, pretend or fake websites and apps; it wouldn't fly. My son kept up an excited running commentary, identifying all the icons he recognized and how he thought they were going to function in the movie. As it's rare these days for him to look up from his phone or initiate conversation, I loved the product placement.As far as the ""Disney celebrates Disney"" goes, that's what Disney does. And they do it very well. Everything they put out is turned into merchandise. What is so offensive about seeing all of the most popular characters in one place? My son gleefully named all he could, then matched them to their movies or TV shows. The princesses tripped him up a bit - missed three of them - but he is a boy who wasn't really a princess fan.I loved the princess scenes (their screened sleepwear was so clever) and their climactic scene was brilliant and one could say an empowering message to all who claim the princesses always seem to need a man to save them.The search engine made me smile - he was very clever, too. The big guy made up of the smaller guys was creepy yet cool! Especially the fist made of many fists - SO COOL! And while the musical number felt awkward as it isn't THAT kind of Disney movie, the way they read it in worked okay, and the lyrics were absolutely fantastic.Just about everything made for children these days is a commercial for dolls and clothing and bedsheets and diapers... why be offended when the movie makers admit it and use it as a plot point?If you just go to watch the movie, without trying to examine the motivation and financial plans of the producers and the studios, I strongly feel that you will enjoy this film. Just don't over think it!",Ralph Breaks the Internet
627,bibp,This is so meaningful movie,8,20 November 2018,This movie is sooooo special and meaningful for our generation. All kinds of social medias are connected and collaborated so well in this movie. The Disney+Pixar universe is such an unique entertainment which is so naturally coming out that we cant find any bothersome and contrived plot in this movie. But This is also kinda sad cuz this way to speak isnt universal formula. I really enjoyed it but my mom and dad might not be able to enjoy as much as I did since they dont understand the metaphor is seasoned in this entire story. This is just like Ralph didnt understand why Vanellope wants to stay in a different world where her dreams alive. It got me think about my mom who doesnt know how social networks work and me always trying to something new.

If I rated it for the targeted audience 12/10. With that in mind, here is my review.Ralph breaks the internet was annoying to me. The whole time, he keeps making terrible choices. It may be a kids movie, but still no one, and I mean no one, would say, ""Let's keep it the same EVERY single day!"". It's just so, well.... bland. The plot was basically the same as the first one. The game shuts down and they have to go on an adventure to fix it( Also, one sin for being in a arcade. Those were dieing during the time the first one was made, let alone the second).But, it didn't do everything wrong. Half of the joke hit it right on the marbles. Clever references left and right. An example would be the game ""Slaughter Race"" was a good reference to GTA. A few others, but that one was the best.That is my review, so enjoy or argue.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
634,sjbent-33077,So disappointed 😔,3,22 February 2019,"I'm sorry but I didn't really like it. I wanted to like it. I wanted to love it. I'm actually sad about how disappointing this movie was compared to the first one. I love Wreck it Ralph! It's my go to comfort movie. I watch it when I'm sad and depressed and anxious. The plot in the sequel was nonsensical and all over the place. Like where is this going? And why? The conflict, what there was, was forced and the last bit of the movie was just plain weird. Ralph Breaks the Internet explicitly goes against major plot points of the first movie. Pretty much ignores them in order to make their ridiculous plot move forward. Felix and Calhoun are reduced to background characters when they could have done so much more with them. I just did not enjoy the movie. It wasn't fun. I almost wish I'd listened to my gut and not watched it in the first place because it kind of tarnishes the first one.The best scene was with the princesses but even that was kind of a let down because whoever wrote this completely midunderstands the characters. Like it was almost funny how wrong they got it. Having Rapunzel - out of all of them, I mean really - say the line about 'big strong men'?? She literally took a pan to Eugene's head and escaped the tower on her own. It's like they were trying to shoehorn in someone's - the writers'?? - pessimistic view of Disney princesses. I mean I guess I liked the design of their outfits and it was fun seeing them all hang out together...and do you see how that is mostly what I'm focusing on? Because really the rest of the movie was just a big mess. I hate what they did with Ralph and Vanellope. The first movie made me happy. This one just made me sad.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The point of the movie is not exactly the same with the previous movie, sure it is about friendship, but it's the whole other level. And i guess it's the lesson that fits all age. The first movie has the bad guy (the king?), but this one is more complicated than that and more realistic, make sense.

And also two, this is NOTHING like the first movie. This is a completely different film with completely different morals.Let's talk about the good things; the creativity and message. I think the idea of users being represented as avatars is very charming, and the message in this movie isn't something that you see everyday, but a very important one nonetheless. If you want to teach your kids something, definitely bring them to this movie. Its an unconventional message and it might not seem like a ""happy ending"", but its something that will be great for them in the future.And then the bad part. The dialogues. The comedic timing.

All of the characters that appear in the film are weirdly kind, so it was odd to see the story flowing quite quickly without any checkpoints we should know. Also, the 'deep' relationship and friendship between Vanellope and Ralph felt very shallow and odd than the last film. And since it's from the creators of Zootopia, there are lot, I mean LOTS of Disney ""PPL""s (yes, Zootopia also has ""PPL""s). So that certainly wasn't impressive. Especially the part where Disney literally 'dissing' other film industries? It made me frown a lot.But why would I give 5 stars at least? Well, the good thing about this film is that the 'house' is excellently built. And that certainly awed me. The first thought which came up into my mind was ""How in the world did they came up with this?""

But as a passionate lover of the first movie, I can't bring myself to even like this sequel.
The first movie was pure, and there was some sort of wonder weaved together by the soundtrack, animation and story altogether. I got hooked to the characters dangit!
In this one, the characters feel one-dimensional, forced to serve a role in delivering messages about insecure friendships etc. New characters that are introduced are just as flat. Ralph and Vanellope are broken BY the Internet, not the other way around.
The BIG issue is the fact that Disney knew the potential this movie had, but they chose to use it to their advantage. Cut right through those emotional ties and molded it into a generic movie. Rather than expanding on the story, they knocked down everything to make way for the Internet. Painfully obvious in the first few minutes.
What happened to all that retro-style, world-building in the first movie? Completely ditched. Not to mention a lack of love for many of the original characters.

656,uhk-92195,Note one tiny important thing that most people seem to have missed,7,29 January 2019,"After just coming back from the theater I was interessted in how people received the plot,
While I totally agree with most reviews that this movie is not as good as the first and me also being reminded of the soso Emoji movie, I still think this one was much better then Emoji.Most of the bitter reviews concentrate on how this are not the Ralph and Vanellope from the first movie, I dont find this to be all that bad.
People change and their characters are handling things differently.
So while Ralph is all fine with things as they are, being a guy doing exactly the same stuff every day for years and not having any problem with it, I can also understand why Vanellope, as a racer, does not stop longing for new things.Anyway, there is this little shot just at the end of the movie, after Ralph finished the call with Vanellope, that totally blow my mind and gave me goose bumps.
The camera zooms out of the plug socket into the arcade and then further out so we can see where the arcade actually is.
And it is INSIDE the Slaughter Race game !!
This means everything, also the first movie, took place inside Slaughter Race.
Actually the whole Arcade is just an easteregg sitting there inside Slaughter Race for the players to be found and have a good time with the old arcade stuff.For me this was an absolute clever move.
It is not only an explanation for why Vanellope was not missed by the players while being blocked out by Turbo in the first movie and before, but it also explains, why they could get into the other games in the first place, actually being in the same game all along.And it also means that Vanellope is basically continuing the journey she began in the first movie, where she managed to break the blockage from Turbo to get back into her game, to now getting out of the small easteregg part into the actual game and making a name for herself there.And for me this is the real message of the movie, the subtle context some people said they missed:
Don't get to comfortable with what you have and you already achieved.

I didn't like the song of the ''new princess'' (but in general i don't like disney songs so I might be biased). The bunny face at the end of the animations was just perfect. 10/10 I was about to give 9/10 because of the disney song, but hey ... Also there were tiny cliche momets like the broken necklace heart and ''don't follow me'' but they happen irl as well.

666,jreel-92661,"Funny, but becomes a ""children"" movie that normalizes controlling and manipulative behavior",3,13 June 2019,"This movie at parts is both hilarious and smart, dishing out many jokes and little quirks of the internet. The world they go into is smart and funny, and of course Disney knows how to do this. But what bothers me more is the fact that this movie completely normalizes and just brushes under the rug completely aberrant, controlling, concerning, and manipulative behavior that Ralph inhibits in the film. It's great to say ""oh he needs to just learn from his actions and in the end he learns to let go,"" but underlying that is an incredibly dark mindset for a kids movie. He completely becomes obsessed with the young girl in the movie and constantly tries to manipulate her into staying with him and living a boring life she doesn't want to live all in the sake for his comfort. The actions he shows are in fact extremely creepy if you think about it. He gets upset at the slightest hint of Vanelopee leaving, he tells her he can't live without her and it would be ""going against him"" if he left (seriously Disney?), and the list goes on. The behaviors he shows are weird and dark, and it just gets brushed under the rug with a ""lesson"" he learns. However in order to learn this ""lesson,"" he puts her life in fatal danger MANY times throughout the film, even putting a virus into the game she's in that fits to destroy the game and potentially kill her in order to dominate control and force her to go back with him. It's a really creepy movie with really dark and kinda scary undertones for a child, including a part where he straight up stalks and listens to her conversation. I know Disney is dark at times, but teaching children that creepy and aberrant behavior is just a normal thing and teaching them through underlying themes of control and manipulation is incredibly bothersome. It's a funny movie, it's just way too dark for me and I can't believe that Disney just normalize behavior like this. Parents, there's so many better Disney movies out there, please don't show them this one.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

669,dtshw,Ruins previously established universe.,4,20 January 2020,"The original Wreck It Ralph film created a wonderfully imperfect universe told through an arcade and arcade games. Ralph was an outcast looking for an opportunity to fit in, which eventually he did fit in by the end of the film after saving other arcade games and learning you don't need a medal or tangible items to be classed as a hero.Ralph Breaks The Internet, however, is told in a way that is very similar to a fanfiction. Within the first ten to fifteen minutes, the already existing arcade setting is scrapped for the internet, where they spend most of the remainder of the film. Felix and Calhoun adopt the fifteen Sugar Rush girls, we get an awful scene where Felix results to drinking to escape the girls, and then we don't see them for the rest of the movie: which ruins the dynamic from the original film. The rest of the film is mindless advertising, outdated jokes and pop culture references which completely contrasts with the heart and emotion from Wreck It Ralph.While there's still moments that are emotional, they seemed forced and unnatural. Some of the cineamatography is gorgeous. One I enjoyed was when Ralph and Vanellope were following Spamley to the underground section. I found that creative. The plot of the movie is extremely generic and doesn't add anything to the universe. I'm very upset because I absolutely love Wreck It Ralph, but this one just doesn't hold up.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
670,missmarshmallowqueen,Completely disappointing and an ultimate cash grab,2,21 April 2020,"When the release of this movie was announced I was extremely excited as Wrecked Ralph is one of my favorite animated movies. This was a complete disappointment. After revisiting this movie a couple years late, it already looks extremely dated in comparison the the first film that was released in 2012. This movie revisits Vanellope and Ralph years later having a perfect friendship. Apparently nothing changed except Ralph becoming a total creep (or insecure friend) (He literally went to the black market to go buy a virus to destroy a game to keep Vanellope beside his side forever. ) Vanellope also basically goes Turbo during this movie and no one even mentions it once. Considering in the last movie it was established that the whole movie was about how terrible it is to go Turbo, this is an interesting move. All these criticisms aside, I thought the internet scenes (aside from everything that happens in ""Buzztube"") was portrayed well. It was in no way as horrible as the Emoji movie despite this also being a clear promotional movie of how many things Disney owns. (The princess scene was fantastic)",Ralph Breaks the Internet
671,lesage-14954,"Not a horrible movie, but pretty bad",4,4 August 2020,"This is just my opinion, and I understand if you liked this movie. However, I found this movie to be severely overrated, and a pretty bad movie because: it had bad writing, bad characters, uninventive ideas and a lot of Disney ads. Bad Writing: the writers had to say everything in your face. Instead of showing that Ralph was being a bad friend, Ralph has to say ""I can see how I come off as clingy and needy."" Instead of showing the urgency of saving Vanellope from the virus, Ralph says ""I need to save her in under a minute."" These are specific examples, but this is common in the movie. Also, in the movie, Ralph and Vanellope go Turbo MANY TIMES, but they never even mention that what they are doing is against the rules. Bad Characters: In this movie, Ralph turns into a one sided, needy character, who does not understand the consequences of his actions. DESPITE THAT THAT WAS HIS WHOLE ARC IN THE FIRST MOVIE. Also, I quite disliked the whole conflict between Ralph and Vanellope, because I don't like the image of a 40 year old man drooling over a 12 year old girl. It makes me uncomfortable. Uninventive Ideas: in my opinion, a lot of the appeal of the first movie was seeing the different video games and their characters, and how they work in the movie. In this movie, all the wonder of exploring the world of video game worlds is replaced by a clean, white internet without any of the wonder of exploring a new world. Ad for Disney: a good part of the movie is Ralph looking at different Disney properties, like Oh My Disney and Disney Princesses. This isn't necessarily bad, but it annoys me. The princess thing was fun; but a lot of the other product placement was unnecessary and detracted from the movie. Other stuff: they made it look like getting big in Social Media was super easy, which personally annoyed me, because it is quite difficult, and it instilled false hopes, and unreal expectations. Also, the conflict with the hate comments seemed to be pretty contrived and unnecessary, and many better conflicts could have been made. Also, the Ralph monster is destroyed, but the virus is still there (which isn't too bad a plot hole but it still annoyed me). Good things: I liked the princess section, Spammley, and Vanellope's song. Her song is probably the best part of the movie because it actually has original, fun ideas, and beautiful animation. While this movie isn't horrible, it is unoriginal, and has bad writing, characters, and a lot of product placement. It's like a better version of the Emoji Movie, and it exemplifies all the worst aspects of money-grabbing movies from giant studios. I don't understand why it isn't getting more negative feedback, but i personally think it might be because people are blinded by nostalgia for other better Disney movies (from what I can tell from other people's opinions that I've seen). It's fine if you liked this movie, but I personally think thought it was quite bad, and was possibly the worst Disney animated movie of the decade (including Pixar)",Ralph Breaks the Internet

The first movie was great but Ralph breaks the internet was a complete let down. Besides the writers not knowing where to go with this film.. I feel this adult/child relationship (that they remind you of every 15 min that Ralph is an adult and Vanellope is just a ""kid"") should not exist. It made me uncomfortable when Ralph mentioned they go to Tapper's aka the bar every night. Specifically, the scene where Vanellope stood up Ralph up at the ""Root Bear Bar."" & then Felix shows up there overwhelmed from ""adopting"" the 15 kids including the other kid drivers from Vanellope's broken game. And then Ralph offers Felix the Root beer he was saving for Vanellope, and Felix chugs it insinuating that is their version of alcohol (like funny) but he was so sad that a KID set him up. He literally said at the end of the movie ""I don't own her"" like a self realization about his insecurity. He was in love with her for possession not bc he cared for her as a child like Felix adopted the kids with his wife. Another example; why was Ralph so insecure about a kid not wanting to be his friend. He became so obsessed with Vanellope he tried to stop her from leaving and her happiness and she even said ""Stop Ralph you're scaring me"" he scared her so bad she stated ""Fine Ralph, you win.."" and gave in to him and he picks her up and starts creepy smiling again..Idkkk this all could've been avoided if all characters would've been adults.

This movie advances the plot of the first and it does it in a creative and incredibly thoughtful way. Yes, there is a heavy eBay and Disney element and these are big corporations, but for a film based entirely around the internet I was genuinely shocked at how little they implemented cheap and tasteless adverts for what was mentioned. Every beat of the film had a purpose and the attention to detail was far beyond what I expected going in to watch this.One criticism I do have for this movie however is the slice of time it is targeted to attract. When you discuss cultural trends and rely heavily on social quips and nuances to advance plot, it can prevent a film from becoming timeless and relevant a decade from now. Ralph Breaks the Internet does a good job of making sure none of the trendy and relevant subjects have any plot relevence, meaning someone 20 years from now can still watch it and not feel uncomfortable in their seat.Overall I appreciate this film and would be happy to show this to my future children so they can know what stupid things were popular in my day, without making them think I'm completely tasteless.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

While some haters, dont see this as a break-out new movie, try referencing the extremely subpar Sony 'Emoji' movie that wasn't even close to the quality and fun twists that this roller-coaster allowed us.What really sets this movie apart is it was able to once again talk about a deep, highly emotional human construct, and show us a fun-loving way to resolve the matter while giving us the warm safe feeling venue in which to encapsulate.The quality of intertwining so many stories while staying focused on the main plot and seeing the conflict come to a point was a heartbreaking and fun joyride that I'm glad my daughter and I was able to continue on with.Oh, how I wish there will be one final story or follow-up with John and Sarah that we can see before my daughter is too grown to fully appreciate these wonderful parables.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

There are multiple instances of characters who almost fall to their death in the ""internet"" city, despite the fact that it is a visual representation of a digital construct and death by falling makes no sense. The climax is Ralph fighting a giant-sized physical manifestation of his quote unquote insecurities (just punch your insecurities in the literal face, man), which he defeats by speaking out loud the moral lesson of the film. I am completely serious.As far as themes and emotional impact it feels like a rehash/basic progression of the first film's ideas, EXCEPT FOR that amazing, amazing, song.

That includes showing IMDB, Google, Ebay, etc....Instead of having the original characters in the plot (Felix, Calhoun), they only appear as cameos. The story itself isn't horrible, but it could have been a lot better. It seems like it was rushed, and not a lot of ideas went into making a great story (like the 1st film). This is more of a watch it once film, and not a nostalgic watch it repeatedly movie like the first one. I'm disappointed in Disney for releasing this 2 hour ad to show off their properties.

But this ruined it! Ralph and Vanellope became shells of their former selves, the fun arcade setting of the previous film was quickly discarded, and any potential a sequel may have had was out the window just to shill memes, other Disney properties, social justice values, and Gal Gadot. And I saw that ending coming a mile away, it was NEVER a question that Vanellope would stay in (ugh!) Slaughter Race and there'd be some ""heartfelt"" message about how Ralph should let her go. Don't even get me started on the princess scene, and how Disney made the annoying, shallow views the likes of Peggy Orstein have towards their characters official!The advertising and memes have been mentioned enough in other reviews, so I am going to focus on Slaughter Race and Shank. First of all, very uncreative names there. All Slaughter Race felt like was Disney's way of saying, ""look, we CAN put a realistic violent edgy game in here"". And Shank, no reason to love her at all; had this been fanfiction on the real Internet instead of a movie on a screen she'd have been criticized for being a Mary Sue. Both Vanellope's and Ralph's, especially the latter's characters suffered greatly just to make her look better. I resent how popular she has already become, and hope I don't run into her at any future visits to Disneyland or in any shows or parades there. Oh yeah, Slaughter Race is going to eventually go the way of Farmville, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Dream Daddy. What then, selfish little girl who I'm supposed to believe is Vanellope?Really, if they truly wanted to do more with the Wreck-It Ralph characters, there's still things they could've done while sticking to the gaming and arcade setting, without ruining Ralph and Vanellope, AND without virtue signaling. But we got this, and now I'm not even so sure I can enjoy the original film, the tie-in book ""One Sweet Race"", or even the princesses' original films/anything else with them anymore!

See below:Wreck-it-Ralph part 1 remains my favorite animation ever. Brings back so many memories from childhood when we were really asking ourselves what are characters doing after we go to sleep? what if they are actually alive? oh the excitement! So funny and well thought.Part 2 is ruined by following the same recipe as every action movie nowadays, especially the ones featuring the Marvel Universe -> start with a simple local plot in the first movie and end up fighting super-ultra-mega-hyper villain to save the Universe (actually defeating him stupidly easy).The idea with the characters going online is actually great but I would have wanted for them to find help from well known characters not some made-up stupid game called Slaughter Race. I do understand that the first movie is more relatable to those who actually went to arcade games and this one is for the current generation of kids who grew up with Elsa (an well thought character) and stupid addiction-provoking-with-no-sense-of-completion games like Slaughter Race seems to be.First half of part 2 is actually good and offers something new and interesting. The Internet if creatively displayed and Ralph using names like ""eBoy"" or seeing pop-ups messing around is actually quite fun. Everything goes down the drain as soon as they bring the virus and the guy who gives them the virus. The joke ""don't look at his little brother"" -> we've seen that in other movies before + the virus looks like it doesn't belong in the movie at all. But the most stupid idea was to make the virus multiply Ralph a million times and creating a creature with skin which looks like disgusting worms and it's actually horrible (also it's voice -> bleah!). Why not choose something which could have raged havoc on the Internet but also be funny? It looks like they ran out of ideas for the second half of the movie. The creature goes to the top of the building? Really? Isn't it obvious at this moment in the movie they're referring to King Kong? (I do get that Fix it Felix is actually an homage to the Donkey Kong game but still...)Here are the absolutely stunningly great ideas from the first movie: The cart baking factory, names like King Candy, diet Cola mountain, the Mentos geyser, the hot dogs police, the King's Fungeon and Sourball, the therapy session with the other game characters, the Nicelanders, Ralph and Vanellope actually coming up with a great idea to save the game.VersusWhat you get in Wreck-it-Ralph 2: a virus replicating Ralph a gazillion times, a grose creature with hollow eyes and mouth, them saving the world using kind words and explaining stuff, Buzzztube, viral videos (the world had enough of those in real life already), a characters names Shank and Yesss, a game called Slaughter Race, insecurities.That's probably what you get when you replace ideas with money driven execs who pull the strings.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

This took me out of the story, and disappointed me.The story itself was also less creative and attention-grabbing than the first. I support Disney and love the company, but I worry they are becoming too full of themselves.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

712,limeding,When Disney trying to be realistic...,5,26 November 2018,"Second half was horrible, both Ralph and Venellope went completely out of their characters. The quarrel was out of blue and unnecessary. Venellope didn't even have a good reason to abandon her own game and stand up on Ralph. I mean, wasn't ""saving Candy Crush the important home for Venellope"" the only reason they come to the Internet? And then another racing game is too exciting so you just...forget that core reason? Seriously, doesn't add up at all.
I almost feel bad about Ralph because his friendship with Venellope was apparently inequivalent.
And let's not forget the virus with one eye is still out there in the Internet somewhere!!!!!!
Finally, if I want to see a dark-tuned realistic movie about growing up and friendship, why would I choose Disney?? Not what I've always expecting from this company' work, not cool Disney. 5/10",Ralph Breaks the Internet
713,luke87789,"Surprised me, a great movie! (A review from an 18 year old)",10,21 November 2018,"No spoilers, don't worry. I'll make another review if I want to talk about those. I'll start this off by saying I'm a pretty big Disney fan- this, however, doesn't get in the way of how I take in their movies. They've had their fair share of blunders in the past. I walked into this movie with moderate expectations- it is a modern Disney movie, but that also means it's typically predictable. Not only this, but it's about the internet, and we all know how movies portray the internet. Memes are funny!!!!! Right kids? But this... this was something else. I'd also like to mention that I'm 18, and use Reddit and Twitter quite often.The internet world they made was incredible. Any questions I had about it were answered, it all made sense. The jokes kept coming and landed every time, it was nonstop for me. Some adults may not get them, of course, since some were referencing actual internet culture- which surprised me. They obviously consulted some actual teenagers and people who knew about this kind of stuff, not just the typical ""hey kids like X, Y, and Z right!?"" Even the excuses given for sharing videos made sense- instead of ""hey look at this funny meme!!! It's funny because it's a cat or goat!"", the excuse given was nostalgia for a retro game.The music was phenomenal, especially the song in the second half of the movie (you'll know the one), it utilizes older sounds with a modern spin (kind of hard to explain). There's plenty for both kids AND adults to enjoy, and for someone like me (an avid consumer of internet content), it hit all the right marks. I did like the first movie, but this one was so energetic and fun that it surpasses it. Will it be outdated in a few years? I don't think so, I do think it perfectly encapsulates the internet. Will it be outdated in 10+ years? Since the world is constantly changing, probably. Eventually sites we use today will be long gone and replaced. But for now, this movie gives a perfect representation of the internet and makes for an amazing movie. I give it a solid 10/10.For anyone wanting an adults perspective, I went with my parents, cousins, and even my grandmother. My parents got most of the jokes (if not all) as they should have. My grandma thought it was fun and energetic, but did miss a few references (though she did get more then I assumed she would, as news stations like to report on ""hip new internet trends""). Overall enjoyable for the whole family! Go see it!",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, but it wasn't close to being as good as the first one.
The first half was great, the world they created was pretty cool and it was interesting to see how the writers interpreted the internet from the inside, but 3/4 into the movie it felt as if the writers decided the movie was going to be too long or they ran out of ideas ,so they gave us a half completed movie with a meh ending.

Yes, lot of humour in the movies is from web based services and products. I don't want to even think whether those companies paid Disney to do so or not. Because I enjoyed the movie a lot.

The whole ""I want more"" song, which was something I hoped they wouldn't do.For me, personally, Wreck-It Ralph 2 is an okay film.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
726,banear-54461,"Simple, about friendship and, for a change, well done!",9,15 January 2019,"I want to say that this movie was good. Yes, a simple sentence for the beginning and I think that in reviewing this movie we don't have to do anything except exactly the thing we don't do generally too much because we want to make our points of view more highlighted, dominant - be simple.First of all, I just want to say that I'm on IMDb for a long time and I always lean on the reviews I read here for the movies I'm about to watch. It annoys me so much that there are so many people who consider themselves ""educated"" enough to criticize (in such harsh ways) things like the messages that are sent through this movie that I almost recognize or their disappointed turned into anger aiming at Disney, which comes from somewhere else, or just a way to gain some sort of popularity by being in the group of people who dislike things in their complex, well (falsely?) proven ways.I liked this movie. The thing I especially liked is that the movie was strongly based on friendship, very simple true friendship which has its ups and downs. The way these two characters, about which the plot is obviously intentionally based, try to fix it is very well highlighted. The monster in the end (and Ralph throughout the firat, big, part of the movie) was a representative of the bad sides of the feelings every friend feels for the friend he or she simply likes, it tells that friendships aren't perfect all the time, that we very often are indeed very possessive and that with time, not only people change, but friendships too - they gain a new form which doesn't necessarily has to be the destructive form, but a form that is a different way for things to work.
It's a cartoon so the aiming group are of course children and a message like this one should be sent exactly to them, indeed! I'm sure that for them the fact that the roles of the main characters are exchanged for new ones won't be a big problem because the main attention will anyways be on the main two characters - Venellope and Ralph who's relationship this movie is about, right?
For the ones who followed the plot precisely the growing of Ralph's character couldn't be missed! He realized what his dream is, what Venellope's dream is and with the sentence that Shank (Gal Gadot with her voice, marvelous performance, btw) said he realized how things really are, how things work and he got his definition of friendship to a couple of levels closer to the pure one.
Friendships are something that really fills up people, they make them feel appreciated, accepted, happy, they make people be themselves which is the most important and when the time comes to change the friendship's form you do it because if not it looses on it's power.
There is absolutely no rule that says that friends have to have the same dreams, but there also is no rule that people with different dreams can't be best friends!I myself am not a big fan of Disney of the last years, I grew up with it and today's Disney generally is not the Disney it used to be - there are many wrong things indeed. However, I don't sort this movie in this pile. On the contrary, watching it I felt the innocent, simple child inside of me enjoy it very much!I would also like to praise the animation which was really great, the voice actors who did really well and portrayed the emotions of the characters almost perfectly and of course the references and ways to portray the internet as well as the virtual world as a whole - it's like the Emoji movie, just done well, haha!My personal favourite little detail was when Ralph and Venellope ended up in the Shank's game and spied on the players, the movie creators and animators made the players move just in few directions while the ""bot"" (computer controlled) characters moved in all directions very smoothly; for all the fellow gamers around, I know you'll find it at least interesting. :)
All in all a very pleasant, touching and interesting movie which doesn't ask for a deeper message dig, the simple pure story makes both children and older enjoy!
It has left me a good feeling in my stomach!
From me: 9/10All the best!",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I love that the ""getting the steering wheel"" plot ended quite early and it went deeper and darker. However, I admit that it shows Disney's animation style is not as modernized as Dreamworks, especially compared with How To Train Your Dragon 3. Ralph and Venelope just move too much and they use a lot of body languages to make the point. But still, it's a great movie, a very funny animated movie.

Why? Because to create the world of the expanse of the internet and still follow an interesting plot that kept me going for the whole of the film is pretty hard to do. I loved it when he went to the bottom of the city and discovered companies that are no longer in existence - let's face it, that scene was designed for the older generation - no young person will know Geocities or Netscape Navigator! I also like the way they happily made fun of YouTube (I can only guess that YouTube refused to sponsor the film).So is it cliche? Maybe. But is that a bad thing? Certainly not. It keeps you active in the film. It is good for all ages. It even shows the dangers of bidding on Ebay, warning young buyers that they need to have the money before they start bidding.There was a questionable scene that implied you can buy an internet virus on the Dark Web. Is that true?? Hmmm....To wrap it up... Wreck it Ralph was good but I think Wreck It Ralph was a step up. What next? Wreck It Ralph becomes a Hologram Projection??

Second movie is about Ralph and vanellope graduating to the idea that happiness is not from any external crutches. Vanellope is still a child so she uses racing as her crutch.

This movie is so garbage that it feels like it belongs in the same category of Foodfight! And The Emoji Movie. Both Ralph and Vanellope were flanderized to the point where they felt like two different characters. Ralph became a dimwit who was slighty clingy while Vanellope was a selfish brat that only cared about ""her dream"". She basically only cared about herself, she didn't care if the people in her game would cease to exist if it didn't get fixed due to it being the last copy of Sugar Rush in existence. So basically the work Ralph did in the first and second movie was a waste. And don't get even started on the Oh My Disney, product placements, and that woke Disney Princess scene. People say Space Jam: A New Legacy is terrible because it seemed like it was flexing it's properties, but I think product placements everywhere in Ralph 2 is worse than SB2 flexing their IPs. The only good thing about this garbage movie is that Imagine Dragons song and it's animation. The movie is way less to be desired. The voice of Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is racist and had done blackface. Almost gave it three stars, but it's animation is what make me give it a four star rating. 4/10.

He believed he could be better, made friends, and realized that being himself was more important than being ""better"". He realized his faults and fixed them with his new friends.I guess 6 years ruins a character, huh? He's nothing short of an oblivious idiot in this movie. His reasoning, temperament, and lovable attitude from the first movie are nowhere to be seen. He's just a big dummy. His entire character was reduced to just being a pedestal for Vanellope to go through the same development Ralph went through in the first film. There is definitely a better way to have a character arc without ruining other characters for no reason. But that wouldn't be as interesting I guess.There were some enjoyable moments and some laughs, mainly when Ralph wasn't on-screen.

But for another fun family, with a mix of Ralph get lost in the internet, in the time when Disney has own so many major brands, including Marvel.. This flick will have you enjoyed the view and story offered by Vannelope and Ralph.. Moreover, its all about friendship and keep moving forward..",Ralph Breaks the Internet
762,helloachiig,Nahhhhh,1,24 November 2018,Save your money and don't watch this. You'll just be disappointed and wished they didn't create a follow up from the original movie. Half way into the movie I've realized Sarah Silverman has a really annoying voice which I didn't noticed on the first movie as the story was good. Couldn't overlook it for this one.

763,darshanmaru-07688,Full rating for the details Disney has tried to show in the movie.,10,24 November 2018,"You must not miss this movie. For those who haven't watched the first part, its ok read the characters role in the movie to get a gist of what this movie is about.
.
For those who have watched the first part. You can't miss this movie. There are so many things that is added to this sequel. The movie isn't very much related to first part. It is completely different story.
.
Kudos to Disney for making such a great movie. Who would have thought about making movie based on internet. Everything was point on. Liked many scenes in the movie. This movie has travelled way ahead than the first part. In terms of detailing and maturity. Disney movies aren't fairy tales anymore. Glad to see such a change in movies. Disney is making movies that both kids and adults can watch.
.
Ok so about the movie, many new characters are added. This movie is appropriate for today's generation. As it has based on internet and games. You can relate to everything that is going on in the movie. Ads, clickbaits, virus, antivirus etc. Everything in the movie is presented as characters which is quite commendable.👌 The attention to details is awesome.
.
Even the car race has great realistic graphics. Spoilers ahead. You have Ralph trying to save vanellope's game is. Then Ralph making trendy videos and reading comments and getting disappointed by the harsh comments some people post. And the buzztube's head saying the first rule of internet, don't read the comments. Ralph is insecure about losing vanellope in the new internet game slaughter race. So tried to win her back by adding virus to the game. Then the virus turns haywire and crashes the internet and every website.
.
The best part was when vanellope goes into disney.com and all princesses meet vanellope. And vanellope is asked many weird questions about what she has done to be a princess. Had she been kidnapped and she just says what is wrong with you should I call police. :p
.
The scene where Ralph convinces himself to let vanellope go to the new game is emotional.
.
The best dialouge I would say is Shank's, I learnt it the hard way that it is not necessary that your best friend's dream and your dream has to be same. And Ralph trying to convince his insecurities to let go vanellope.
.
I must say watch this movie and you won't be disappointed. :D",Ralph Breaks the Internet

766,de-78287,"A rare, well done and emotional Disney sequel",8,25 November 2018,"I'm going to start right off the bat by saying I don't think I can make a decision as to whether or not this sequel is better or worse than the original, both have such good qualities about them that I find it very difficult to make that call. What I will say (which is very evident by the score above) that that I REALLY enjoyed this movie.I wont go on and on about the plot details as Im sure anyone reading this would be all too familiar with the basics of the plot. But I will say that as excited as I was for the movie, I was also a bit worried. I was worried that product placement would over shine the movie, I was worried that the Oh My Disney shtick would just be fifteen minutes of back patting, but no, to my surprise none of that happened. To my surprise I got a Disney sequel that not only justified its existence and inclusion of all these things, but made a case for more sequels in the future.This movie does what a sequel is supposed to do. Many sequels get caught in the trap of just bringing back their characters for another adventure without really thinking about where to take their characters emotionally. The characters evolution matters less because, hey, at least we get to see them again. But not this movie, not Ralph Breaks the Internet, from the get go it is continuously more and more clear where the emotion of this movie will lie and that it is the heart and soul of the movie. Sure, there are a lot of jokes (Many of which land) and sure the Internet is vast and impressively animated, but the real reason this movie works is the incredible and unexpected emotional places the characters go.As Ive gone through reviews of fellow audience members like me, a few if not many people have criticized the exact thing Im praising. Criticizing where this movie takes its characters, calling it cringy, calling it sad, and I agree, but thats what the film makers wanted, thats what they were trying to articulate and man do they, because if you are watching this movie and I mean really watching it, there is a bold and incredibly important lesson to be learned.Overall this movie succeeds, the voice cast is brilliant and I think even improves this time around. The setting is gorgeous and cleverly laid out. The first time I saw it, the pacing felt a bit off, but, and I cant explain this (possibly my sub conscious expectations had been lifted) but the second time around the movie just seemed to flow better. But maybe that is just me. There is product placement, but it makes sense, the movie is attempting to satire and educate about current internet culture, and to me at least, that would come off as veeeeery odd if dominate brands of the current internet landscape weren't featured.Go for the internet jokes. Stay for the incredibly game cast and a heartwarming and important moral center.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

768,oemmy,"It was alright, but has no staying power.",5,27 November 2018,"When I walk out of a movie, the first thing I do is turn to the people I went with and ask, ""Thoughts?"" It's just something I do. I like to hear what other people have to say about what we just spent a couple hours watching.
Last night as I walked out of the theater with my mother, sister, and family friend, I turned to them and I said, ""So. Thoughts?"" The general consensus -- it was pretty good. It was funny. They liked it.
So I express to them, obviously not verbatim, ""I liked it too. It was pretty funny and charming, but it's gonna date itself pretty quick due to it revolving around modern technology. I felt like the inclusion of the princesses, the various Disney properties like Star Wars & Marvel, as well as social media really felt cheap to me. It was okay on its own, but not at all a worthy follow-up to the masterpiece that was the first Wreck-It Ralph. People aren't going to watch this 5, 10, 20 years from now."" (I realize now that my sentiments echo many of those shared here on IMDB.)
So my mother turns to me and basically says, ""It doesn't have to be timeless or have staying power. They just want to sell it now and get their money and no one is ever gonna watch it again.""
And I realized that she's right.
I don't think Disney cares much about making original, quality films anymore. All they seem to do nowadays is live-action remakes of their previous animated films, and I can only come up with two reasons for that:
1. They're out of ideas.
2. Pandering to nostalgic teens/adults and children who enjoy the animated movies.
Anyway, I think Ralph Breaks the Internet is truly just a cheap cash-in beneath its flimsy veil of jokes and a ""plot"". It's not meant to be a classic. It's just meant to make a quick buck and fall to the wayside.
Stick to Pixar. I know they're a subsidiary of Disney, but they've been churning out hot after hit as of late.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Too safe, no risk taking, and conceptually the same stuff we've been seeing for awhile now, but with less care to get the job done and cash in.Disney's philosophy of the internet is as shallow as their Princess cameos. Ralph is insecure, Vanellope is insecure, therefore the internet is not secured, but everything is fixed now because they all patched up. That's it. Nothing deep or residual, just lack-luster and cookie cutter.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

But their were more scenes that were way too questionable to be in a kids movie that is targeted towards younger kids. It literally made my son cry before it was over, the previews and the movie are very different, and very disappointing for a movie that had so much potential. Also the other reviews are right ab and it it being a huge advertisement for internet companies and other Disney movies",Ralph Breaks the Internet
772,skyekmwu,"Boring, not funny, and annoying",3,28 November 2018,"Honestly, throughout the whole film Ralph is portrayed as this stupid, insecure, and weak character. He constantly makes mistakes throughout the ""movie"" (worst disney film in my opionion) and only learns until the very end when the stupid little candy girl is in danger. Throughout the whole movie the adventure is basically travelling across the internet and exploring what it exactly is; however, it doesn't accurately portray the internet and fails to connect the real world to world that Ralph lives in. For instance, in one part of the movie news spreads to the real world that a bunch of Ralphs have taken over the internet via a denial of service attack. The problem with this is that this explains sort of what a DOS attack is but fails at making sense whatsoever. My point is that Disney put some terms into the movie that kids and most people won't know. So as a result, they use the terms so loosely that it leaves people like me clueless as to how these things even happened in the first place. I have question such as: ""How did they get to the dark web in the first place?"" ""Why didn't they have to pay for the virus?"" or ""What even happened to the virus in the end?Maybe there are answers to the few questions I have listed or perhaps I should just conclude that its a kids movie. If you liked the movie, good for you but I can't recommend watching this unless you like movies that 1. don't make sense 2. have a dull sense of humor 3. and just are downright boring",Ralph Breaks the Internet

I feel that due to the amount of over the top cameo rolls it will struggle to make it there.The plot overall is quite good and has lots of clever quirks just like the first one. My biggest issue was that where the original kept the camels and jokes well placed, this film decided that after a few well placed internet cameos and jokes it turned in to cameo central and was needlessly took over by Disney princesses.

777,thouston2,Great for Adults and Children Alike,9,4 December 2018,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is a great movie. Its beautiful world of the internet that is brought to us, along with its funny internet and video game references make this movie one of my favorites. The internet being re-imagined as a large metropolis filled with different websites as different sized building and other structures make the world really pop. And its fun to see how the two main characters traverse it. The references that the movie offer seem more like a tribute to the history of the internet rather than just mindless product placement or poorly written jokes. Some might say it doesn't live up to the expectations given by the original, but we are expected to know that we are looking in years after the original story. Time has taken a toll on the Wreck it Ralph universe, making the overall conflict between the characters seem more reasonable. Overall it's a great movie for adults and children to enjoy and is one of favorite Disney movies to date.Also be sure to stick around after ALL of\ the credits for a special surprise.",Ralph Breaks the Internet
778,stilljm-87049,Decent film but very sub-par for Disney,2,5 December 2018,"I love Disney so much, I actually made this account just so I can leave a comment - in hopes that they will steer away from the direction that they are heading with films like these.I grew up with Disney films, I felt that they were warm, genuine, and intrinsically value laden. They taught kids about faith, belief, magic, and dreams even through tough times. This film, on the contrary teaches one to be reckless, unforgiving, and emotionally driven.Ralph was essentially reduced to a idiot in this movie. But the one positive trait he got to keep - his love and care for Vanellope, was so under appreciated that it was essentially mocked to be nothing more than an insecurity. This may be applicable for a relationship between two high schoolers saying goodbye as they head to universities, but the portrayal of Ralph's devotion is so one-sided that I geuinely felt bad for the guy.Vanellope was written as a child who essentially does whatever she wants because she finds meaning in the ""unknown"", and is ready to sacrifice anything to achieve it. Again this would have been OK with an adult character, but we are talking about a child venturing into a world of gangsters and explosions. The whole scenario only works because there's a noble and all powerful woman in this wasteland that seemingly would protect her for no good reason at all.I understand what Disney is trying to do symbolically here... but they got the characters, target audience, and overall feel of the film confused. They are trying to make an adult film in the guise of silly animation. It doesn't work well.Then I came on IMDB to read some reviews and it only revealed further failures like - where did the virus go? Where is the empowerment for little boys? You can read them for yourself the list goes on.Like I mentioned before - I grew up with Disney, and now I am planning to have children of my own. I don't feel that I would be comfortable with my child or toddler watching something like this. They may get the wrong message - its OK to do dangerous things just because it feels right, or its OK to be emotional and throw tantrums, and when someone wants to keep you away from your interest its not because they care for you - its because they are ""insecure"".Anyways I don't usually write these reviews. But I really wish they would bring some traditional values back to Disney movies. One's that aren't questionable. Ones that show realistic values and consequences of actions.",Ralph Breaks the Internet

Story was great, jokes were fun and the characters definitely feel real. While I noticed how some slight character adjustment was made, it was just that: a slight change. To me, they made the characters more relatable. In the end, I am still a huge fan of both films. My advice: try not to read the reviews before you see it yourself. I'm sure glad I did.

It's cool to see those. However, I ended up enjoying the easter eggs more than the characters and plot. This movie was a let down, glad I saw it on Netflix and not in theaters. Honestly, Ralph and Vanellope's relationship in this movie made me cringe. They made Ralph waaay too clingy and self-centered in my opinion. I get that Ralph was alone his entire life but why would he be THAT clingy? Plus, 6 years have passed from the first movie when Ralph and Vanellope became friends, as it even mentioned in the movie. How did Ralph still stay so attached to her for 6 whole years?? Anyways, the plot was just bland and cliche. It kinda ruined the first movie, now it's a bit hard to see Ralph as anything else but a clingy and selfish character because of this movie, and in the first movie he broke those habits, but now they are back in action. This movie wasn't the worst though, I can name a worse Disney/Pixar movie.

798,sms-84210,Ralph Wrecks Modern Insecurity,9,20 February 2019,"Walt Disney Animation Studio is famous for creating family friendly films with timeless messages that have been teaching children for generations the morals that sometimes even parents have trouble expressing. In Pinocchio, a fairy taught us to be honest to others but above all to ourselves. In Hercules, Zeus taught us that ""a true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart."" In Tangled, Rapunzel tells us to follow our dreams no matter how crazy they may seem and in Wreck it Ralph the titular hero, or should I say villain, shows us that it is okay to be the ""bad"" guy. With Ralph Breaks the Internet, Disney's villain turned hero, Ralph, jumps out of Mr. Litwack's arcade and straight into the future of technology: the Internet. Accompanied by his best friend Vanellope von Schweetz, Ralph embarks on a mission in an online world to save her game, Sugar Rush, from being removed. Ralph Breaks the Internet stands apart from other Disney animated films for its combination of traditional Disney elements with an updated, modern message that speaks to a new generation challenged with a problem unique to today: how to deal with your insecurities with the Internet.
Ralph Breaks the Internet stays true to the elements that have made Disney animated films so loved over the years. It maintains its quality standard of colorful yet detailed animations and loveable characters. The personification and modeling of both the Internet and its users are full of clever references to real world sites and applications. From pop-ups and advertisements, to Twitter, Google searches, and Amazon, Ralph Breaks the Internet offers comical representations of what these Internet functions might look like in a physical form. This sequel adds new layers to the character development of both Ralph and Vanellope after their friendship was established. While their continued use of sarcastic jokes and puns keep spirits light, both Ralph and Vanellope must learn how to handle their friendship as their dreams begin to deviate down different paths. Gal Gadot's animated character, Shank, from the game Slaughter Race offers classic Disney wisdom on the nature of friendships to resolve Vanellope's conflict by saying, ""all friendships change its the good ones that get stronger because of it"": a perfect commentary for younger children who are growing up.
On the surface, Ralph Breaks the Internet is just like any other animated Disney movie pandering towards a wide range of children with the goal of creating a happy experience at the theaters. However, this film offers a time-relevant message to viewers young and old that as great as the Internet may be, it can also bring out the worst in people by highlighting their insecurities. The danger of the Internet is first foreshadowed by a short statement made by Surge Protector, the virtual security guard, when Mr. Litwack plugs in the Internet router. In reference to this new technology, Surge Protector ironically states, ""it's new it's different therefore we should fear it"" indicating his own insecurity as a security guard. As the movie progresses and Ralph then finds himself on the video-sharing, social media platform Buzz Tube, he is introduced to the bipolar world of the comments section. While Internet users are capable of complementing one another, the more notable comments, which Ralph took immediate notice of, are those of hate and destructive criticism. The moral culmination of the film begins when Ralph enters the dark web. If this is not shady enough, Ralph returns with a virus named Arthur whose purpose is to find insecurities and replicate their flaws in a program. After causing a server reboot in the game Slaughter Race, Arthur escapes into the Internet itself and finds Ralph to be a 100% insecurity. Arthur creates a horde of clones that embody Ralph's primary flaw of being a needy, possessive, and selfish friend. Although Ralph resolves his inner demons, his journey tells us that the Internet can bring out our insecurities and amplify them to the point where we risk damaging our real-world lives and relationships.
Overall Ralph Breaks the Internet is a must see for Disney fans especially those who grew up watching past animated films and are still wanting more. The humor and traditional Disney formula appeal to the usual, wide-ranging youth audience, but the deeper underlying message about the dangers of Internet use keep the movie relevant for younger adults and even older audiences alike as it calls for self-reflection.Bibliography
