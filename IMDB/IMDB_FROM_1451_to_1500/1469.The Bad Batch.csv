0,nogodnomasters,Find Comfort,4,27 February 2018,Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) is placed into a land of misfits behind a fence any Mexican could get through. The desert area is divided up and Arlen ends up in a city of cannibals which costs her an arm and a leg before she manages to escape on a dolly and picked up by a guy pushing a shopping cart through the sand with ease. She ends up in a town run by Keanu Reeves where everyone smokes pot and does acid.The film was not the Mad Max action film I was expecting. It was far more drama and I am still not sure of the whole point of the film or the ending. She found her dream? That's weak. Keanu Reeves had a small but important role. Suki Waterhouse was the star of the film. Jason Momoa grunted most of his lines. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,The Bad Batch
1,zardoz-13,The Bad Batch is Not A Good Catch,5,21 June 2021,"Writer & director Ana Lily Amirpour came up with an interesting premise, but ""The Bad Batch"" scratches out long before its 118-minute runtime ends. To call this movie slow would be an understatement. The cast and lenser Lyle Vincent's widescreen cinematography are to die for. Each shot is artfully composed. I'm not sure what Amirpour wanted to do with this unappetitizing epic where the heroine has both her right arm and leg hacked off by cannibals. Mercifully, Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) escapes but the moment when she steals a skateboard to roll her across the desert made me want to burst out in laughter. I mean, here's a drop-dead gorgeous chick laying supine on a skateboard with only one arm to propel her forward. It isn't like she knows where she is going either as she stares into the brassy white hot sky. Eventually, Arlen escapes from the flesh-eaters, recovers, and acquires a fake leg. She gets pretty good with a gun and kills Miami Man's (Jason Momoa) black wife Maria (Yolonda Ross), kidnaps his daughter Honey (Jayda Fink of ""Under the Bed"") and takes her back with her into a safe zone where the cannibals aren't allowed to venture. Jim Carrey must have been bored out of his skull to want to play the Hermit who cannot talk. He is in the film maybe 10 minutes and he is virtually unrecognizable. Keanu Reeves wears his sunglasses well as the chief villain, The Dream, who keeps people high on drugs and searching for 'The Dream.' Arlen loses Honey to The Dream, but it takes her a while to track her down. Meantime, Miami Man enters the desert to find his wife and daughter, but finds only the wife. The shot of a vulture feasting on her eye socket looked cool. Arlen shot.Ana Lily Amirpour's screenplay didn't make a lot of sense either. Arlen saves Honey from the desert, loses her and then trudges back into the desert and runs into Miami Man. He gets the drop on her and takes her prisoner, informally speaking, and then on the way back, she watches an African-American dude shoot him in the left side of his chest. Predictably, Miami Man survives the shooting and The Hermit picks the right time to find him before he dies so he can nurse him back to health.The cast is excellent and so is the cinematography, while the movie struck me as sluggish and half-baked.",The Bad Batch
2,bombersflyup,Waste of time.,2,13 August 2021,"The Bad Batch is a wasteland, metaphorically and physically.I'd seen this premise before, minus cannibalism, in a bad 1986 Aussie film, ""Dead End Drive-In."" The whole thing's empty, stupid and ugly, but everyone being in unison is the most ridiculous part to me. The lead character differs, Waterhouse fine in the role. The ending mildly amusing, but still stupid.",The Bad Batch
3,namashi_1,Trippy & Original!,6,27 September 2017,"Writer-Director Ana Lily Amirpour's 'The Bad Batch' is quite a ride! Trippy & Original, this romantic black comedy horror-thriller flick, is intentionally slow-paced & has very less dialogue to speak of, and while its never compelling enough to be called a must see, it still has its own strange mood that is appealing for the most part.'The Bad Batch' Synopsis: A love story set in a community of cannibals in a Future Dystopia. In a desert wasteland in Texas, a muscled cannibal breaks one important rule: don't play with your food.'The Bad Batch' is a story on survival at the end of nowhere. The world here is shown as broken, deserted & horrifically violent. Its a world where cannibalism rules, its a world where people are near danger at all times & survival is their first priority. Its all dry, dusted & dirty!Ana Lily Amirpour's Screenplay is comfortably slow-paced & delivers a story that will only cater to a niche audience. The mood & the atmosphere of this story, is certainly not meant for all. I, however, found myself interested in this story for a good part of it. And while the film is overlong at nearly 2 hours, the narrative never gets unbearable. Its thoroughly watchable & extremely well-shot. Ana Lily Amirpour's Direction deserves brownie points. She has Directed the film with a vision of her own & remains true to the subject matter all through. Lyle Vincent's Cinematography is excellent & captures the cannibalistic world, most effectively. Alex O'Flinn's Editing needed to be sharper. Though crisp in parts, the film needed to be trimmed by at least 15-minutes. Art & Costume Design are brilliantly done. And 'The Bad Batch' features a killer soundtrack, featuring some smashing tracks from the yesteryear's.Performance-Wise: Suki Waterhouse is superb in a star-making performance. As the protagonist with a lost hand, Waterhouse is sexy & arresting in her portrayal. Jason Momoa uses his buffed up body to do most of the talking. Keanu Reeves as the Dream, a manipulative cult-leader, is at his relaxed best. Jim Carrey as the mute & lanky Hermit is outstanding. Giovanni Ribisi as the mentally damaged Bobby, leaves a strong impression.On the whole, 'The Bad Batch' isn't bad nor is it great. Its somewhere between good to above-average.",The Bad Batch
4,FeastMode,my notes,1,26 July 2019,"Pointless waste of time. one of the slowest and most boring movies i've ever seen. i watched most of it at a whopping 2.5x speed. normally at 2x speed it is difficult to understand some of the dialogue. this movie had almost none, and on top of that the scenes were extensively long with nothing happening, so i had no problems watching it at 2.5x speed. that's how much nothingness this movie is filled with (1 viewing)",The Bad Batch
5,westsideschl,Munchies Anyone?,2,9 October 2017,"VICE TV had a hand in this which fit nicely with their alternative tele clientele. Nothing was believable in this film beginning with a girl walking across a Texas desert with about a half gallon water, really cut off shorts and a tank top (she did have a hat). Next we have a not explained well, if at all, two different nearby walled in communities in the desert at odds with each other. One likes to capture people and cut off limbs to munch on (while still keeping what remains of them alive) the other likes to drug their members. So our female stroller gets captured and loses a couple of limbs to the one group, but escapes to the other then returns to the first group of munchers. Stupid and pointless and a waste of viewing time. Was there a theme about humanity - only if you're a cannibal.",The Bad Batch
6,Reno-Rangan,In the land of savages!,5,4 February 2018,"The overall concept was good, but I did not like the initiation. I don't like any film of cannibalism. I don't know why such films are made. What's the point! Definitely not entertainment or art. It could only encourage such savage culture. So I thought I made a mistake picking it to watch. Except the opening, the rest of the film was different. Then ended as a just below average product.In a near future, where all the criminals, illegal immigrants are dumped in a waste desert land. So they have made their own system, divided by two. One the savages and the other is kind of civilised, but not without flaws. A new arrival who experience from both the end, had to decide where she belongs when a series of bad events had taken place.Here comes another film from a woman director. Her previous film was one of the worst in the history of filmdom. And again this is not her best work either. Though I liked the cast. They all performed well, particularly Jim Carrey. Yes, I did not recognise him at first. Then there's Keanu Reeves. But Waterhouse was good. I wish her a good future. Generally not recommended, but then it's your choice!5/10",The Bad Batch
7,Tweetienator,Stuck Somewhere in Okayland,4,8 October 2021,"The Bad Batch is no bad but also no really good movie - but everybody calling this flick ""worst movie ever"" is a very lucky guy - my eyes and souls had to witness movies compared to them The Bad Batch is almost Oscar material... Anyway, back to this one - some parts and ideas are entertaining, even funny (if you got the right taste for humor), some shots and settings are well done and the acting is rock solid for a movie of the doomsday genre. Sometimes the movie misses some momentum and maybe a bigger budget for some more action on a greater scale. The Bad Batch - not essential but worth a try for the aficionado of the genre.",The Bad Batch
8,Vartiainen,I was rendered speechless,2,19 October 2020,"This film was Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves in it... It's from the director of A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, a real surprise hit of a vampire movie. It's set in the dystopian Mad Max future where a crippled woman has to face a desert full of monsters and rapists with her guts and prosthetic limb alone.This should have been amazing.But the execution is the key in everything that is ever done. And that fails on all the levels here. This film has no idea what it should be doing. It has no direction. No rhyme, no rhythm. It's not tasteless enough to be a gore film, nor is it coherent enough to be proper dystopian science fiction. Its actors seem to have had next to no direction whatsoever as they're mainly just reading out their lines with no inflection whatsoever.And it's just so amazingly disjointed. The story wanders from one scene to another and nothing about it makes any sense. It's like someone smashed two completely different stories together and then tried to parse together a narrative from the ashy remains of their cliff notes.The worst crime this film is guilty of, however, is the fact that it criminally misuses its Momoa and Reeves. The two should have been the highlight of the film, but instead they're just about the most baffling and boring part of it. Which boggles the mind. How is that even possible!?Hard skip on this one.",The Bad Batch
9,subxerogravity,"Weird posts apocalyptic movie, but a large part is not entertaining enough.",6,5 July 2017,"It's a surrealistic movie about a girl seeking redemption over the fact that some cannibals living in the dessert ate her arm and leg.This is the second time I herd Jason Momoa play a Latino. He's trying to get good at the accents. I don't know if he is Latino, I assumed that he was Samoan or partly like Dwayne Johnson. Guess Momoa is trying not to be typecast (Although there are not enough Samoans in Hollywood).Jim Carrey is in the movie. He's actually amazing in it. It's more of a drama, and Carrey gives us the best laugh of the movie, it was so good.The Bad Bacth has not much going on in it. Most likely better if I was on weed. It's very slow and it's not all the best slow.",The Bad Batch
10,jtindahouse,Dreadful stuff,4,3 October 2017,"I went against my instincts when it came to watching 'The Bad Batch'. Every nerve in my body was telling me it would be dreadful, but the words cannibals, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi kept repeating over and over in my head until I finally gave in and made the fateful mistake of watching it. My god, how is it possible to make a story this boring out of cannibals? Every single thing it tries to make itself interesting with completely falls flat. When you manage to get a completely dull and forgettable performance out of Jim Carrey you know you're doing something terribly wrong.The film tries to be thought-provoking (at least it seemed like that was what it was going for) but none of the concepts it presents are in any way actually worthy of a second thought. It also goes for a lot of style, however it again falls short. In a futuristic desert wasteland setting there a thousand different concepts you could use to create an interesting story. For some reason 'The Bad Batch' chooses a story that could have been told in any setting and in any time period. That's about as lazy as story-telling gets. If you do make the mistake of selecting this one up on Netflix brace yourself for a long and painful couple of hours.",The Bad Batch
11,jadavix,An amazing experience,8,8 February 2018,"""The Bad Batch"" is an extraordinary film. It is almost unlike anything I've ever seen. The only movie I can think of, off the top of my head that comes close, is ""Gummo"".I'd say ""The Bad Batch"" is better, though. It has so many amazing moments, its visual style is so powerful, and it takes you so completely inside its community of outcasts.I had never seen anything by this director, but she is clearly one to watch.",The Bad Batch
12,dfranzen70,"Tainted, although sparkly in light",5,18 October 2017,"The Bad Batch refers not to some brown acid but rather to a particular set of ex-convicts, those recently released from a prison in the southwestern US. Each inmate is tattooed with a serial number, which naturally precludes them from gainful, meaningful employment. Good thing that the vast desert right outside the prison's gates is uncharted territory, meaning it's not under the jurisdiction of either the US or Mexico. It just is.Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) is such an ex con. With nowhere else to go, she begins a-wandering across the desert with a jug of water. She finds a rusted-out car and – for some reason – begins to apply her eyeliner using the rear-view mirror. Then a couple of people roar up in a golf cart and abduct her. When she wakes up, she's chained to an airplane door. She gets injected with something – I'm gonna guess a sedative or painkiller – and her abductors lop off her right arm and left leg. And eat them.None of that is a spoiler. It all happens in the first twenty minutes or so. Our heroine does quickly escape and finds a place called Comfort, which is basically a continuous rave. Comfort is run by The Dream (Keanu Reeves, delivering a particularly wooden performance), and everyone there is part of the Bad Batch themselves, the rejects of society.Arlen is out for revenge, so back to the cannibals she goes. There's a lot of her ping-ponging back and forth between the two camps, for various uninteresting reasons. But this isn't a standard revenge movie – it's much more confounding and pointless. I can get behind a good old fashioned revenge flick, but this is just dopey nonsense. You know things are out of wack when you kind of root for the main cannibal (Jason Momoa). And when the best performance in the movie, by a long shot, is by Jim Carrey as a grizzled hermit – who never speaks a word.The Bad Batch looks pretty and might even have a genesis for a cool movie within it somewhere, but it's a major dud. It's also very violent, so you have plenty of gore to look forward to. And lastly, Arlen's lopped-off limbs are on full display (not hiding behind bulky clothes), and apparently this was accomplished without resorting to digital erasure of her real arm and leg. So that's a positive. Not much else is.",The Bad Batch

14,peterp-450-298716,Hypnotic and fascinating for a while.,6,19 July 2017,"""Strange, isn't it? Here we are in the darkest corner of this earth, and we're afraid of our own kind.""You can say ""The bad batch"" is an exceptional and eccentric movie. It impressed me the first 20 minutes. An apocalyptic and insane society, somewhere in a desert on the American continent, where unwanted individuals are being dropped. Are you a criminal, an illegal or an asocial person, you'll get a distinctive tattoo and a hamburger, and you'll be left behind in the scorching heat in this no-man's land. That's what happened to Arlen (Suki Waterhouse). First of all, she wanders around carefree and careless, until she's snatched by ""Mad Max"" -like desert dwellers. Not much later, she loses an arm and a leg. She seems to have fallen in the hands of a gang of unscrupulous cannibals, who needed some fresh meat for their barbecue. In addition to their love for human flesh, they are also avid bodybuilders. Does this already sound absurd enough? Wait, there's more.As an escape tool, Arlen has this brilliant idea of lubricating herself with excrement's (probably making her own flesh distasteful), then she knocks down her guard and escapes into the desert with the help of a skateboard. There she's found by a crazy looking hobo who aimlessly pushes a shopping cart (maybe you'll recognize Jim Carey). And in that way, Arlen ends up in a commune called ""Comfort"". A community filled with normal eating inhabitants, who aren't so normal after all and who follow some sort of leader who repeatedly talks to them about ""The Dream"". He feeds them psychedelic tablets and he's surrounded by a harem of pregnant women who are armed with automatic guns. What you'll see next is a revenge film that slowly evolves into a lunatic, romantic story.Frankly, those first 20 minutes were hypnotic and fascinating. A practically dialogue-free spectacle, full of energy and artfulness with images, silence and a soundtrack which are perfectly complementary. The amputations are horribly realistic. The whole situation is disturbing on the one hand. But on the other hand, it's kind of absurd and comical. A futuristic created environment. A fantasy created in a film, but nevertheless it's not unthinkable that such isolation could exist sometime. An appropriate method of removing those who don't fit into a future society adequately Unfortunately, this creative level couldn't be detained and it became a bit too psychedelic and laughable. Even though Keanu Revees surprised me with his role as a heavily mustached cult leader. He looked like Nicolas Cage while playing in ""Arsenal"" where he had a similar appearance.The moment Arlen starts strolling through the desert hallucinating and completely drugged, while watching a beautiful galactic panorama and afterwards pleased she didn't arrive in Mexico (looked like she walked quite some distance), the innovative and unique character makes room for something less fascinating. I realize Arlen fights an inner struggle while weighing both worlds. And then there's also the influence and appearance of Miami Man (Jason ""Conan the barbarian"" Momoa). An impressive personality causing Arlen to feel something you can call romantic. I also wondered where the ""Follow the dream"" leader could find the right material to build such a luxurious home. Even a water supply is provided for the indoor pool. I doubt they found all this on the dump.Yet, this was more than successful film to me. And not because of the brutal aggressiveness or the repulsive habits. Perhaps I'm more enthusiastic about the ""exploitation"" part it all began with. And maybe I thought the psychedelic, romantic part wasn't that great. But how inventive can you be to provide a soundtrack including Ace of Base, Culture Club and Die Antwoord? Highly recommended, if you are open minded at least. And I bet you'll feel sorry for the little Honey (Jayda Fink).More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",The Bad Batch
15,a_chinn,Post-apocalyptic story that's so heavy on metaphor it loses it's narrative,5,28 January 2018,"Visually striking and an interesting story premiss are undone by arthouse pretentiousness, a slow pace, and a lack of narrative. The film opens with our heroine, Suki Waterhouse as Arlen, being expelled from the United State as an undesirable, part of the ""bad batch"" and left to fend for herself in a post apocalyptic vision of Trump's America, where the powerful literally feed off of the still living corpses of the downtrodden. Once across the border, Arlen is promptly captured and has an-arm-and-a-leg (Get it? An-are-and-a-leg?) chopped off to feed a group of bodybuilding cannibals led by Jason Momoa. Although this sounds very ""The Hills Have Eyes"" it's more like an arthouse version of ""Cherry 2000."" Make that a slow moving and highly pretentious version of ""Cherry 2000."" In terms of tone, I'd compare the film to something like ""Six-String Samurai"" or maybe ""Bagdad Cafe"" and a bit of ""El Too,"" but nowhere as good as any of those. Besides Momoa's cannibal leader Miami Man, who Arlen inexplicably crushes on, Keanu Reeves plays a cult leaders called The Dream, and an unrecognizable Jim Carrey plays a shopping cart pushing wastelander. ""The Bad Batch"" is an obvious and heavy-handed metaphor for Donald Trump's America, which is certainly a ripe topic for filmmakers to exploit, but when the metaphors about the haves and the have-nots and the powerful and the powerless are so in your face, the film just becomes annoying. I'm fine with arthouse message films, but they need to at least be either entertaining or present ideas that challenges my thinking, and this film did neither. However, Waterhouse is very good in the lead and writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour brings strong visuals to the film, which were both enough to hold my attention. Overall, this film needed to either have more interesting of ideas behind it's metaphors or barring that have more Escape from New York/Mad Max post-apocalyptic action.",The Bad Batch
16,mhorg2018,Might have worked... at fifteen minutes,1,11 February 2020,"Interminably dull and glacially slow, this attempt at a dystopian future film fails in every aspect. The set up isn't given enough background and the story... well, this is lust lame and slow. It also has a lot of unanswered questions that don't help the film.

This film starts off very brutally but calms down considerably after the first few scenes.The characters, acting, production and filming are really good. The story is adequate for needs. The scenery and leading lady are absolutely gorgeous.So why the low score? The pace of this film is cripplingly slow. There are tedious scenes that should be time lapsed but are run in real time, there is lots of staring and grimacing in silence. You really can go and make yourself a sandwich during this and be safe in the knowledge that you are unlikely to miss anything.A lot of potential, I really wanted to like this, but it is just so slow I was fighting to stay awake.",The Bad Batch
21,MrGKB,"""You're either gonna love it...",4,3 April 2018,"...or you're gonna not understand it."" So sayeth co-star Jason ""Game of Thrones"" Momoa in the making-of feature appended to this dire sophomore effort from auteur Ana Lily ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" Amirpour. Count me in the latter camp. Replete with vapid, slumming appearances by the likes of Keanu ""John Wick"" Reeves, Giovanni ""Saving Private Ryan"" Ribisi, and Jim ""The Mask"" Carrey, this ""A Boy and His Dog"" wannabe fails to engage on almost any level. Ms. Amirpour obviously had a very personal apocalyptic fairy tale to disgorge from her inner self, but it simply doesn't connect to the wider zietgeist of human behavior. Doesn't help that her lead, Suki ""Insurgent"" Waterhouse, who for some odd reason appears to be a high-demand talent judging from the slew of films she's done recently that are all due out this year, nonetheless appears to have the acting chops (pardon the pun) of a mannequin. Meanwhile, Amirpour's meandering, sketchy script doesn't help. Insomniac viewing only, and I'd be willing to bet that very few people can get through ""The Bad Batch"" without hitting fast-forward more than once. It gets its points from me strictly for some nice DP work from Lyle ""The Woman in Black"" Vincent.",The Bad Batch
22,rockman182,The Bad Batch (2016),6,24 June 2017,"Continuing the trend of desolate Texas locale, I decided to watch The Bad Batch. I did not see Ana Lily Amirpour's A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, despite hearing really good things about it. I did see the trailer for The Bad Batch a few months back and thought it looked good. It seemed like the type of film that I would enjoy an artsy, stylish, female protagonist driven film that remains memorable. While that description is fairly apt, I could not help but feel disappointed by what I have seen. Its not terrible, I'm just struggling to praise the film as I would have wanted to.The film looks to be a dystopian film that takes place in a wasteland in Texas. Arlen (our protagonist portrayed by Suki Waterhouse) is attacked early on in the film and has her arm and leg cut off and eaten. The area is ravaged by cannibalistic tendencies as people must hunt each other to survive. She eventually adapts to her missing limbs and comes across a little girl and her father, who are at first at odds but then begin to bond against the negative forces around them. The entirety of the film basically takes place in a desert like barren landscape, think Mad Max but way less on action and plot.The film is too long for what is offered. There is minimal dialogue (which is okay if the screen time is being filled with something worth getting invested in). That is not the case with this picture. You find it hard to care for the characters who just kill each other and have no real redeeming qualities. Some of the shots in the film are quite nice but there is little to no reward sticking through the film. Its nice to see Jason Momoa in other films; I think he has the look of an action star which is why I think he'll do well as Aquaman.The narrative in this film is like the wasteland which this film takes place: its barren and nothing grows. I still want to see Amirpour's previous film because perhaps this was just a risky misfire. There aren't really any memorable moments or scenes that can detract from the general uninteresting plot development. Maybe others will find some joy out of this but this just wasn't for me.5.5/10",The Bad Batch

Arlen attempts to lay low in this town with an apparently abandoned little girl and her pet rabbit. With the cult leader showing interest in the pair and a burly cannibal searching for his little girl, Arlen is faced with some difficult choices. There are truths she needs to find for herself.There are glimmers of Amirpour's amazing previous film, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, including funky music, fantastic light displays, beautiful people, charming spontaneity, skateboards, gorgeous hot pants and grisly encounters. Keanu Reeves makes a delightful appearance as the harem loving cult leader and Jim Carrey as an impulsive and sunburnt hermit. I wish there was more depth to the dialogue.

First, the movie looks like a mixture of Mad Max, The Hills have Eyes and The Burning Man music festival, and adding Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves, sounds good right?
Second, even the script has some plot holes like the origin of the cannibals or the people living the dream, the main idea is interesting and pretty well executed. Similar to Ying Yang theory.
Third, the use of FX's here are pretty effective. They look like pretty realistic.
To sum up, the movie it is quite interesting and has an original concept and even the weak script, it is pretty well executed. So, overall underrated.",The Bad Batch
29,PyroSikTh,"Slow, Minimal Dialogue, Meandering",5,7 November 2017,"Two of those things were good to see.Arlen is cast away into the desert, branded a member of the bad batch, implying a dystopian society on the outside that locks away it's undesirable members. Unfortunately we don't get to see any of that at all, and the most we get is odd little references dotted about. She's caught by a group of cannibals who cut off and eat her arm and her leg, before she manages to escape. After finding a place named - without subtlety - Comfort, she goes out into the wilderness again to seek revenge on those who took her limbs from her. She finds a kid, has a badly- narrated drug-trip and bumps into ""Miami Man"", a great hulking figure, head of the cannibal settlement, looking for the girl she took to Comfort. The second half of the movie becomes Arlen and Miami Man trying to get the girl back.The story isn't particularly great, I'll be honest. The revenge plot is completely forgotten about in favour of trying to get the girl back. In fact the whole cannibal thing doesn't play too much of a part after the drug trip either. It also never seeks to answer any questions, which is fine, but when the world this all takes place in is far more fascinating than the actual story, the lack of answers becomes frustrating. Where does Comfort get all of its comforts from? Who is The Screamer? Why does no-one kill The Hermit while he's just wandering around the wasteland? If Comfort has access to food and water, why are the Cannibals cannibals? If all of The Dream's women are pregnant, but there are no children, what happens to them? Or has The Dream only been in power for less than nine months? If Comfort has guns and ammo aplenty, why are the Cannibals still alive at all?There are other questions too, that pose more as plot holes than straight-up world building cock-blocks. Like why is Arlen so accepting of Miami Man despite him being responsible for her lost limbs? Why does she willingly help him when she could just go back to Comfort and stay there where he can't get her? And why is there a subtle romance hinted at between them? I mean big props to Momoa and Suki Waterhouse for managing to get across a sense of desire and affection between them without a single word - and I really liked it for that - but narratively it made no sense (or maybe that was the point, hurr hurr).Acting is a mixed bag in all. Suki Waterhouse is at times great and at times awful. The movie's lack of dialogue definitely works in her favour, as she gets to look pretty in the desert in skimpy shorts the whole time. The emotions and feelings she manages to convey without words is good, but as soon as she opens her mouth I couldn't help but cringe. Bad accent, badly delivered, and badly written. Momoa manages to encompass the more brooding side of his musculature quite well, and the chemistry he shares with Waterhouse is commendable for sure. Giovanni Ribisi is criminally underused. He appears about twice, muttering about some ""thing"" that he can't find. That's it. Keanu Reeves gets a potentially tantalising role as The Dream, but it's never capitalised on by the story. Nonetheless what we see of The Dream is a man of wisdom who abuses his power just enough not to be an antagonist. Jim Carrey is unrecognisable. Didn't even realise it was him until well after the movie finished, but his character was definitely one of the biggest highlights of the entire movie, despite not uttering a single word.Stylistically The Bad Batch is a winner through-and-through though. It's a slowly paced movie that prefers to sit in the moment. There's a lot of desert-scape shots, as we watch people walk around the desert (or drive golf carts), but even from the confines of Comfort and the Cannibals there's some interesting cinematography. With dialogue to a minimum, it's down to the cinematography to tell the story, and it does a brilliant job of conveying who's who, what they stand for, and what's going on in the story, and ultimately that's the most important thing for cinematography to get right. It's use of practical effects throughout deserves mention as well. While most the time it can make it feel like a cheap student film, they somehow managed to make the amputation clean and believable without the use of CGI, and for that I only have endless praise.Sonically the movie is really good as well, barring that terribly narrated drug trip. The use of ambient sound really brings the otherwise vacant world to life, from the sound of things to the subtle white noise of the wind. The music is also surprisingly good too. The selection of popular and dance music is an odd mix that somehow works. From the synthwave-influenced Black Light Smoke and Chilled by Nature, to more pop-y Federale and Culture Club, it creates a sonic identity to the movie that makes it stand out and be individually enjoyable as well.The Bad Batch is not a movie for everyone. It's extremely slow-paced, with a story that meanders around aimlessly in order to pretentiously tell us something about the world that we already knew. I saw it described somewhere as like if someone went to Burning Man and thought 'I want to make a movie of that'. It has some great cinematography and some great music, and some surprisingly good acting from the big name stars, but it's not particularly a movie I'd ever opt to see again. I give it a middling 5/10.",The Bad Batch

I Thought this was slow burning time waster i almost fell asleep me watching this in Netflix. I Wanted to give a look of movie i thought it could be Interesting Movie to watch it's nothing like Eli Roth Trash Green Inferno or Cannibal Holocaust movie does Involved Cannibal people but it's not that kind of flick not in a extreme Violence movie it's slow ,boring, quiet, actors are just looking at each another doing nothing, one of them don't talk, it's boring film nothing Interesting about watching this flick. Story doesn't tell nothing about how Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) got transported to this desert dystopia, Prison guards tattooed her side of her head like prisoner lock her up in Desert In an unspecified near future. it's processed and dropped inside a fenced-in area outside of Texas where people being deemed undesirable by society (the ""bad batch"") are forced to live and fend for themselves as outcasts. A sign declares that the area is considered outside of the U.S. and that American laws and citizenship no longer apply. why could of this movie could have been a Apocalypse movie a real Apocalypse like Mad Max style not a world where with no Apocalypse made movie like a Apocalypse but not really of it movie, it doesn't explain why people are living their are they most dangerous Criminals ? is that why they getting locked up ? what's up with this movie it doesn't any sense why because of dream ? come on it doesn't make any sense of no matter what oh people just wanna live their, it has to be reason but do they explain it ? no they don't. so anyway Arlen is alright character but their are moments where she made stupid decisions at middle of movie, she got kidnapped her arm and leg been cut off by Cannibals then she kills it and then runs off then she has been living their for 5 months movie is really nothing, just nothing, nothing and like i said it's nothing The Screamer (Giovanni Ribisi) has done nothing in this movie just acts like crazy person he is nothing he does nothing he is only in it for second then that's it. The Hermit is (Jim Carrey) i am like what ? really he has no script nothing in this movie you don't really know he was in this movie ? he is not really in it i am what the f could hired different person not random actor we all know then actor has done nothing in this movie he is really nothing in movie why ? paycheck easy to act. that's all i could say that's Jim Carrey everyone he plays like quiet bum guy who doesn't speak. The Dream (Keanu Reeves) i love and love Keanu movies Point Break, Speed, Johnny Mnemonic, The Matrix Franchise, Constantine, Street Kings, 47 Ronin, John Wick 1 and 2 love it to death, then after his different movies sucked as hell like this one and worser one is Exposed aka Daughter of God even more worse and worser movie then to this his character is some kind of god or something he is called dream and he hasn't done nothing in this movie at all nothing at all just looked like a 70's porn star Mustache he should been doing porno movies Keanu Reeves because he looks like 70's Porn star with hair at that the way his dressed he looks like a 70's Porn Star jeez his character is not really much him and Suki had a good acting scene in movie. (Jason Momoa) Miami Man he has nothing to do in movie he is just quiet, he is a tattoo artist a printer who draws a lot of good pictures he is not much in movie he is a mysterious character, part i liked when he threw butcher knife at guy and saves Arlen he is not much of character his performance in movie is ok but he is Cuban Character you don't understand what he is saying in movie of his Cuban accent which makes me saying what ? he is looking for little girl name honey (Jayda Fink)she doesn't speak in movie at all not until in very end of movie their's not much to say about this movie just Quiet movie, everyone is looking each another just doing nothing, very empty movie no point of been made just lame flick that has nothing to watch it's Slow Burning Time Waster that's all i could say. 3.10 not worst movie i have ever saw their's a lot of movies i have seen are worse then this.",The Bad Batch

I realize I was stupid to think that, but hey.So, it actually starts off pretty good. There is some real tension in the beginning. I was like, yeah, this is gonna be awesome! But man is it down hill from there. After the first minutes, it goes into drama mode and stays there. It does have some qualities, a couple of cool little details that I really liked. But I'm sorry to say, it was a tad boring. Movies are not supposed to be boring, so that's no good.I don't think it had to be so long, almost 2 hours. You could easily shave off about 15-20 minutes. I think this movie tries to be a little artsy. Which it does with long, long scenes, often without dialogue, that drags out, and when they're done you're like.. OK, what was the point of that? Some people like that kind of stuff, but I'm not one of those people.You would think this was a premise you could do some really cool stuff with, but most of it is wasted. It's just drama. Drama drama drama. And some sand. And of course Aquamans pecs, they are great.There is some trickery with a character that loses an arm, and goes the rest of the movie with one arm. It looks OK for the most part, but since they don't use CGI primarily, the character doesn't move it's arm, and you see something is off. Had they used CGI in stead, it would probably look a lot better. Goes to show that practical effects aren't always best. At all. (Probably has something to do with the budget too though, but if you can't afford to have the effects needed, just rewrite the script dammit) Just every scene, basically, the arm is just plastered to the side of the torso, not moving, and I'm pretty sure people missing an arm, don't walk around like that.But yeah, all in all it was just too dull. Some of the characters aren't likable at all, actually that goes for most of the characters I'd say. We get some scenes of violence, but those are too few, and not that exciting either. The ending is also kind of annoying, and really dull.",The Bad Batch

As I'm a journalist I like to pick things apart Stan Ruth you down the way I do the music that bands send me. However, it's late at night and this movie could take hours upon hours to pick apart. First off, this is a star-studded cast, and if you aren't careful and really scrutinize people you might miss who's right in front of your face! I know I didn't know that Jim Carrey was even in this movie and so when he was on camera several times I had no idea it was him I didn't know until right now! Same thing with Giovanni Ribisi! I kept thinking that there was something familiar about his character but I had no idea he was in this movie! So maybe do a little research and check out the IMDb obviously you're here LOL! When I first started watching this movie, I figured okay somebody with a lot of money decided to get a hold of Jason Momoa and Keanu Reeves and make a new Hills Have Eyes. And in the first 15-20 minutes that is it exactly how it looked. I was very disappointed. And then all the sudden, things open up and got really interesting. I kind of started seeing a Stephen King Dark Tower and I'm not talking about the stupid movie that came out that completely destroyed what Stephen King's original story was like I'm talking about the book the Canon! So I got very interested! And things slow down in a couple places and just as I started getting a little concerned and despondent about parts of the story, then all the sudden things sped up! So I kind of had an idea of the way that things were probably going to go and so did my husband and son apparently based on their emotional outbursts at the end of the movie when we discuss things afterwards we all kind of said we thought things were going to go a certain way which was not at all the way they went so I think the writers made a really bad decision and how they were going to handle the ending because the movie started out rough, like a typical Cannibal movie and then became more of a fantasy almost kind of movie, and I'm not going to spoil the end I just refuse to but suffice it to say we were disappointed. Who knows maybe they'll be a follow-up to make things better and that's why they left them the way they did. I still think it's a mostly worth seeing.",The Bad Batch

It was deep whilst being shallow at the same time and I adored some of the acting in this.However, I just can't sit and give it the five out of five I feel that the film deserves due to casting Suki Waterhouse as Arlen. This would have been an amazing film, opportunity and time to have casted a disabled actress (and there are many with the same amputations that Arlen has) for this role. It would have been absolutely perfect with that but I just can't sit and pretend like it didn't bug me through the whole movie.The horror genre needs to open up and this would have been the perfect film to kick start some of that.",The Bad Batch
37,asifahsankhan,"Ana Lily Amirpour's ""Bad Batch"" feels like a ""Mad Max"" film directed by Robert Rodriguez. . .",6,29 June 2017,"Keanu Reeves sports a 70's porn moustache, simply called ""The Dream"" and the homeless mute, ""Hermit,"" is the unrecognisable Jim Carrey! The 2 Best (or otherwise unique) Things to watch out for is in the summary. . . The Bad Batch opens with a lingering shot of a sign that says, ""Beyond this fence is no longer the territory of Texas. That hereafter no person within the territory beyond this fence is a resident of the United States of America or shall be acknowledged, recognised, or governed by the laws and governing bodies therein. Good Luck.""That sign is the foundation of Iranian director Ana Lily Amirpour's extensive world building in her sophomore film. Amirpour struck gold with her directorial debut, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. The vampire spaghetti western used very little dialogue and mainly relied on the universe that it inhabited. The Bad Batch is a similar concept and feels like a Mad Max film directed by Robert Rodriguez. It's gritty and dirty but doesn't rely on shock value to move the film forward.The film follows Arlen (Suki Waterhouse), an ex-convict who is now a part of the ""Bad Batch,"" a group of people rejected from society. She's kicked in a barren wasteland left to fend for herself against cannibals that rule the land. When they eventually capture her, Arlen's limbs are sawed off for dinner, and she barely escapes with her life. After being saved by a homeless mute (played by an unrecognisable Jim Carrey), she's brought to ""Comfort,"" a town that thrives on drugs and hedonism. Their leader is a man simply called The Dream (Keanu Reeves), who sports a 70's porn moustache and pregnant concubines with machine guns. Reeves can talk about human faeces like it's holistic mambo jumbo and we will buy every single word of it.The first 19 minutes of the film purely silent and lets the camera do the talking. Cinematographer Lyle Vincent utilises wide camera shots to illustrate the vast nothingness of this world. Despite having so much space, it's claustrophobic and gives us a sense of hopelessness. It's when the dialogue starts to become more frequent that the film starts to falter.",The Bad Batch
38,namob-43673,"Kudos for trying, but effort mostly for not",5,6 October 2021,"By accident I stumble across a trailer of this movie, and I thought why not. Happy I did. Not that this is a good movie, because it is not, but because it is different, and it tries. So seldom you see mainstream movies try something different and take a risk I think we should give the director, screen writers and the actors a lot of cred for doing this movie.As I started watching this I immediately thought I stumbled across a new classic. An almost unheard of masterpiece of weirdness, chaos and great acting in a brutal dystopian world I can see in our near future. When all the mask people with their dozens of jabs finally realise the truth, this is it. Sadly that weirdness and brutality switch over to a slow moving train-wreck only (partly) saved by an excellent cast. Over 1 hour of this movie is completely pointless with people gazing, doing nothing, getting a tan, walking and basically doing anything but driving a plot, and they never have anything resembling character development. This should have been a short film shown at schools to highlight where the world is heading, not a feature film with no point.Scenery is great, acting is great, the protagonist beautiful and mesmerising, and this is slightly different. Sure we have seen a lot of this before, but this is still fresh enough and strange enough to stand out as ""original"" in Hollywood. The little story there is has merit and potential, but sadly told and executed upon poorly.I want to give this a higher score, but sadly 5/10 is the best I can do.This is not as bad as some reviewers claim it to be, but this is also far away from any higher score. I think this could be, with some modification, the starting point of a good TV show. I cannot really recommend this because the movie is too empty and offers little, but why not?

39,clintstevens,Mad Max Meets Hannibal Lecter,3,31 December 2017,"The main criticism I have with user reviews are ones where the reviewer admits to watching only a fraction of a film before sharing his 'expert' opinion. I watched this movie from beginning to end, and was not impressed. A group of undesirables are gathered together by the powers that be, abandoned in the desert to fend for themselves. Not really a horror film, not really science fiction, not really much of anything. The film DOES seem to offer characters for everyone; body builders, skater boys, ravers, Hispanic gang members, amputees (soup's on!) and pregnant women, inseminated by the leader, played by a pasty and out of shape Keanu Reeves. I won't delve into the plot, but suffice it to say it plays like Burning Man on acid. Mercifully, there is a minimum of dialog. An example spoken by the lead, ""What if all these things that happen to us so the next things that happen to us can happen to us?"" Say WHAT?

40,js-66130,Burning woman.,7,17 July 2017,"Hoo boy. This movie requires some effort. What starts off as a brutal exploitation flick, surely to weed out the meek, evolves into an absorbing treatise on primal human conditions in a barren, deserted wasteland.While Ana Lily Amipour's sophomore effort contains pulpy roots, littered with outrageous characters and circumstances, it also tackles some grand topics. Our white trashy heroine Arlen is unceremoniously turfed out of society to fend for herself behind a Texan fence, where lawlessness and depravity are the rule of the day. She is soon captured by a tribe of cannibals, and mayhem ensues.Dystopian futures as these don't seem all that far fetched any more. ""The Bad Batch"" may serve as a warning, but chiefly it serves as dusty entertainment. Much like the ""Mad Max"" franchise, it is a world full of crazies scrambling to survive in glorious sunbaked vistas. Sporting a primo porn stash, Keannu Reeves pops up as a bizarro, robe clad cult leader. Giovanni Ribisi slips in several rambling, asylum escapee diatribes, but it is an unrecognizable Jim Carrey who absolutely steals the movie as a wizened bag man.""The Bad Batch"" has the art junk, lost inhibition, drug and music orgy feel of Burning Man, and because it's stealthily asking tough questions, has much more going for it than the cheap veneer may indicate.",The Bad Batch

43,ReganRebecca,A mixed bag,7,25 June 2017,"I loved writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's debut A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. A genre-mixing Persian language black and white vampire flick, the film established Amirpour as a fresh voice, a visionary, an all too rare woman of colour working in a genre that has typically been dominated by casually racist and sexist white men who don't think through the implications of their material. With this in mind The Bad Batch represents both a step up and a step down for Amirpour. Set in an undefined near-future The Bad Batch takes place in an unnamed zone outside of Texas in which lawlessness rules and ""Bad Batch"" aka people who are considered deviant in some way, are set adrift. We never learn why Arlen (Suki Waterhouse, serviceable) has been cast out, but we follow her from the second she is dumped in this vicious territory. Quickly captured by cannibals (with gruesome results) she manages to free herself and is rescued by a peaceable hermit. Months later, healed but embittered, she sets out into the wasteland and makes a series of decisions which set the course for the rest of the movie. First off Amirpour proves herself once again to be a complete master of tone. Her wasteland is an '80s baby's pop-punk dream, filled with mad detritus from the '80s and '90s. The post-production here is really top-notch and filled with clever visuals (there is a ton of signage among the wreckage which gives Amirpour the ability to make tongue-in-cheek jabs at the audience, like a scene in which Arlen contemplates a difficult decision while in the background a sign cheerfully proclaims ""THIS ISN'T REAL""). I've heard some reviewers balk at the so-called half-baked romance that takes up the final half of the movie, but to me it feels meditative and real. Much like the romance in Amirpour's debut, this one is as full of quiet suggestion and glances as a Victorian novel adaptation.What then was not to my taste? Well to go back to the earlier discussion of filmmakers in the genre being sloppy, thoughtless or even downright racist with their messaging... Shortly before the film was officially released a woman at an advanced screening raised some criticism about the casting in the movie and she was dead right. The first question she had was about Jason Momoa being cast as a Latino character named ""Miami Man"". In the movie Miami Man isn't just any random Latino, he's an undocumented Cuban immigrant with a thick accent. To have Jason Momoa, an accentless American born man of Native-Hawaiian and white descent feels incredibly tone deaf, the kind of ridiculous casting that was something that wasn't given a second thought in the 50s but is incredibly tired now. The second issue raised was the question of a black female character being given a particularly gruesome death... Again, the entire arc of that character and the fact that Arlen's fall, and later redemption, occur because of this woman's death is treated so carelessly within the narrative it would almost feel like a joke or like Amirpour is making a statement on how irredeemable Arlen is if not for the fact that again and again the movie works to make the audience sympathize with her. It's truly baffling and takes what could have been a good movie and makes it incredibly tone deaf and insensitive to the very racism it seems intended to point out.I hate scoring movies with highs so high and lows so low because it often comes out to a very mediocre score when the movie couldn't be anything further from mediocrity. It's really too bad that Amirpour was so blind to something so essential to her film.",The Bad Batch

But thankfully doesn't turn into a all out gore fast. More like a daydream fantasy romance. Eerie and other worldly. The victim falls for the dangerous man.

But I guess this is what makes the feel it's own story and unique.. the cinematography is beautifully I love the trippy scenes where she's high and alone wandering the desert staring into the milkyway ( the music and scenery fit in perfect harmony) and then falls into her captors arms. Good soundtrack and the chemistry between the 2leading roles is amazing. You really feel it even though they barely speak. I found the main character Arlen just mesmerising you can not take your eyes off this white trash girl, she played her part well. The film has the mad max feel.. clearly this film isn't for everyone but I felt this movie.liked it's style. I'm saddened it's not got a higher score it's a good original piece.

But hey, you can't really expect an art-house film to be dynamic.This is a beautiful, beautiful looking movie. Seriously, this thing is gorgeously shot and sucks you into this world. But the story fails at sucking you in. It's obviously open to interpretation at times, but when you take it literally, it's really not much of a plot. It has these moments, surprising moments of an actual conversation that seems to set up some themes, but then it's like nothing ever happened. Only if you dig deep enough, but it's not that interesting. I came up with a few theories about metaphors in this movie, so it did interest me a bit, but I really didn't feel like going into details. Aside from the script, everything worked for me. The style, the acting, the pace (even though it's a bit sleazy, I sort of expected that).

The scenery is bare and there are all these long sequences and panoramic shots of walking, someone in the distance wandering, yada yada. I am baffled why Jim Carrey, Giovanni Ribisi and Keanu Reeves would be part of this train wreck. The description states this is a romance - nope! There is zero romance going on here. There's nothing thrilling either. The actions of the main character - who is unimpressive - is questionable at best. And the ending makes no sense whatsoever. Again, a huge waste of time.

This is not bad, and has some good ideas, but definitely flawed in a few ways. First of all, Mamoa is good, as usual. The other actors, not so much. I have to take a moment here to point out Keanu Reeves has got to be the absolute worst actor to ever make it big. I mean, this guy simply can not act. His performance in most movies can only be described as terrible. He sucks as an actor.Spoilers! Arlen (Suki) is captured by a barbaric tribe of cannibals. She is immediately used for food, having her arm and leg brutally amputated. Considering that she is very pretty and about 20 years old, I find this to be extremely ridiculous, especially comparing her to the other women that are in the camp, who appear to be either ugly or old. There is NO way that the tribe leaders, such as Mamoa's character, would allow a girl like Arlen to be used up as food. They would have used her as a sex slave, no question about it. Then Arlen escapes and finds her way to a town called ""Comfort."" This part reminded me of Fallout 3. I love that game and I like the concepts, and I think they were handled well in this movie. But shortly after she makes her way to this protected city, she is immediately set up with money, a prosthetic leg, a gun, and even a little house. It is never explained how she earns any of the commodities she gets. Why? How? If you are a fan of Fallout, you know that nothing in the wasteland is free. So how did she come to establish herself so well? Inside the city, she seems to have a pretty safe, easy existence. They have electricity and even entertainment. So why would she want to leave? No explanation for that.I can understand that she falls in love with Jason Mamoa's character, even though it was HIS people who hacked her arm and leg off. But after she makes it back to ""Comfort,"" why on earth would she choose to go back to him? She must know that choosing to be his bride means that she will have to embrace a life of brutal cannibalistic practices. She is OK with that? And if so, then that makes it very difficult for us as an audience to sympathize with her. So she goes to the DJ (horribly played by Reeves) who has kindly adopted Mamoa's lost daughter. We see that the DJ is treating the little girl very nicely, giving her a very comfortable place to live, not harming her at all, letting her keep her cuddly pet rabbit, and feeding her spaghetti...ya know, instead of HUMAN FLESH. It seemed to me that, in order to retrieve the little girl, Arlen could have easily just approached the DJ character and explained the situation. He didn't seem to be brutal or cruel. He was just an affluent person living within the little society of ""Comfort."" But instead of explaining the situation and at least asking to take the girl back to her father, Arlen hatches a violent plot to take a hostage at gunpoint and kidnap the little girl. In the course of the kidnapping, it seemed like there were plenty of opportunities for the DJ and his female body guards to take action against Arlen, but they choose not to. Which only furthers our assumption that the DJ is not a violent or cruel character, and he probably would have been open to Arlen simply explaining the situation and asking for the girl in a friendly way. As Arlen leaves the gates of ""Comfort,"" we hear a guard say to her, ""Don't come back you crazy bitch."" I was thinking that was exactly what I would have said to her. So, again, as an audience member, I have NO sympathy for the protagonist in this movie. Big flaw. Finally Arlen reunites the little girl with her father, Mamoa. The little girl doesn't really seem that thrilled. She is happy to see her dad, and that is a touching moment. But then, her father, needing food to feed his daughter, takes his daughter's poor little bunny rabbit, rips it's head off and feeds it to her. Seems to me she would have been a lot better off with the DJ. In fact, as she is asking Mamoa for food, she says, "" I want spaghetti. The other man gave me spaghetti."" A quick side note about the end scene where Mamoa, the little girl, and Arlen are feasting on the little girl's rabbit: where did they get all those rocks to build the fire pit? They are sitting in the middle of a dry lake bed with no other rocks like that around. Did they run out to the edge of the dry lake bed and gather rocks and then run back to the middle of the dry lake bed? If so, no wonder they were so hungry. They need to be more careful how they expend their energy. I am glad that I rented this movie instead of buying it on Blue Ray. It was worth watching and it was interesting to see Jim Carey in such a different role (with absolutely no lines whatsoever). Also, when Jim Carey's character trades Mamoa a snow globe for a knife, that seemed like a terrible trade. I seriously doubt that a survivalist like Mamoa would have agreed to such a trade and he would have taken the knife back, probably killing Carey's character in the process. Let me just say these problems with the movie do not surprise me when I take in to consideration who wrote and directed it. I give it some severed thumbs up, but mostly the severed thumbs are down.",The Bad Batch

It had a good premise and set up. It had potential. But someone forgot to write a script before movie production time. It was a complete bore and a complete waste of time. It went nowhere and did nothing. I gave it an extra star because I have to commend 'somebody' for getting Giovani Ribisi and Keanau Reeves to show up. They obviously didn't read the script first either. I never thought Jason Momoa could act. Then Justice League proved me wrong and he actually made Aquaman cool -- Which was no easy trick. I thought I'd give him another shot here. With The Bad Batch, he proves me right. He got lucky with JL and should only do Aquaman from now on. How he keeps getting other roles is a head-scratcher. Having a beach body, agreeing to do an entire film with your shirt off and only saying about 4 words must have been the only acting requirement for this casting agent.

The viewer is never given any explanations at all, which is great, and has to figure out what exactly is going on. That said, the first half hour is very intriguing, if not borderline silly and weird for no real reason.After you get sucked in, having spent that half hour trying to figure things out; the film turns into a very forced art film. The kind that you would normally see at a friend's house in Ann Arbor, and your friend just dropped out of U of M's film school after 3 semesters. Only difference here is this has a good sized budget, and Keanu in a hilariously fake mustache and wig.Deliberately slow, this film forces a ""meditation"" on possibly suburban normalcy or just insider/outsider culture. The last half of the film drags you into a very hip and boring rave with aspirations to be elite. Our hero leaves that to exist in the desert as an outsider eating (possibly) human flesh to survive. That's it.Like I said, the first part gets you hooked, but the last 3/4 of the film I kept reaching for the off button. The train wreck effect kept me watching, even though I rolled my eyes constantly and even said aloud several times, ""oh, come ON already!""

It felt like it knew what it wanted to be and had some real atmosphere to it. In contrast, this movie feels very under-written and has an underwhelming lead. Suki Waterhouse is going for some kind of accent but certainly doesn't work. Jason Momoa doesn't fare much better as his character is inexplicably Cuban and struggling through a ""Cuban"" accent. Jim Carrey is in this movie. He does not speak nor do I know why he wanted to be in this movie. I guess it was probably 1 or 2 days of work judging from his screen time. Keanu Reeves fares the best in this and seems to be having fun as the sleazy leader of the town. I have plenty of issues with the plot of this movie. The lead woman Arlen (Suki) has her arm and leg taken but that's not to set-up a revenge story. It's more just something that happened and then she wanders around the desert for a bit and eventually returns to town. The overall look of the movie is one of the highlights. The cinematography is simple but very colourful. But it also ends up bringing out the biggest issue I had with the movie.

As someone who grew up going to midnight movies, ""The Bad Batch"" seems like its taken elements from these films (""El Topo,"" ""Mad Max,"" ""Kill Bill"") and stitched them all together in the hopes it'll hit the mark somewhere. The performances in the film are adequate, but nothing in the script really demands much of the characters. Ms. Amirpour obviously had the support of actors like Diego Luna, Jim Carrey and Keanu Reeves, all of whom are seen briefly, but I'm willing to bet they never saw much of a script.

60,aquascape,Bizarre post-apocalyptic film without a true purpose,7,4 April 2018,"""The Bad Batch"" heavily borrows elements from ""Mad Max"" but without concluding to anything really, having a slow narrative with minimum dialogue.The film takes place in an post-apocalyptic desert wasteland and follows a young woman captured by cannibals who chop off her right arm and leg and plan to eat her piece by piece. She eventually escapes the cruelty of those creatures, led by Jason Momoa, and wander off into the desert. There really isn't any plot or main story, the protagonist treks the empty barren land until she meets various strangers, like a helpful but crazy hermit, played questionably by Jim Carrey, who's current real-life state of affair could probably be transposed into the character with ease. Keanu Reeves also plays a strange person called the Dream, the cult leader of a settlement.
With more depth to the characters and back-story, I think this film could have turned out nicely, while adding maybe another side-story to it.The film's soundtrack was definitely odd, from Ace of Base to Die Antwoord to strange rave music. I was confused on what feelings to assess by connecting the scenes with the music.""The Bad Batch"" is definitely one of those bizarre and offbeat independent movies that fall under the radar.

The story is, however, neither well done nore attractive. And did I say the movie was long? It was too long for the inaction involved.
Our star is a sweet young thing in cutoffs who crosses a dangerous border and finds herself cutoff in more ways than one. She escapes one human 'tribe' and wanders into another.

63,mistabobdobolina,It's pretty unfortunate.,4,21 January 2018,"You can actually see some interesting ideas under the chassis, and elements that work in isolated parts of the film. There's an opportunity here to have a kind of Yojimbo-style storyline with a protagonist caught between two equally dangerous forms of evil, Miamiman's desert cannibals and the pimp/drug kingpin/cult leader calling himself The Dream. There were the bones of a really interesting story here and short stretches -- the brutal opening sequence, the surreal journey into The Dream's household -- where you can see what it could have been. The cannibals *feel* viscerally evil, even banally so as when we see them murdering and eating people as part of just normal family lie. The Dream and his empty-eyed, uzi-wielding concubines *feel* viscerally creepy and wrong even with Keanu Reeves' typically, um, limited acting talent interposed as a filter. The dilemma of what to do with a child who's been born into the ""Miamiman"" lifestyle is potentially quite interesting and could have brought out different sides of the protagonist.Unfortunately, it's mostly a misfire. Agonizingly slow, the film attempts very long stretches of wordless storytelling with actors who mostly don't have the chops to pull it off. The pretty visuals -- and they are pretty -- can't make up for the stultifying stretches of watching people walk around or stare at each other. The two real A-lister acting talents on display (Ribisi and Carrey) are almost criminally wasted. Gorgeous as Waterhouse and Momoa both are, they just aren't lead material as actors and can't bring alive the incredibly flawed material they're working with.Worse yet is that the minimal story and characters spiral into the nonsensical whenever they're actually allowed to move forward. The final sequence is cringingly lame and makes no sense for any of the characters involved, as if the filmmakers just painted themselves into a corner and then gave up.I'm not sorry I watched it, but I don't recommend it.",The Bad Batch
64,steve.schonberger,"It wants to be an art-house send-up of exploitation films, but it's just exploitation.",2,27 June 2017,"I generally try to avoid spoilers, and this is no exception, but there are small details from throughout the course of the story, so I checked the spoiler warning.My wife walked out on this film about five minutes into it, offended by the exploitative abuse-of-woman scene that opened the movie. I stuck it out, and the film improved to the point that it started to look promising, like an art-house post-apocalyptic movie. Unfortunately it then turned boring, with endless scenes of the main character wandering barren desert, then being adopted into ""Comfort"", a seemingly benevolent community with no visible means of survival in a virtually lifeless desert, and wandering aimlessly in that community. The main character followed up with an act of revenge against someone she recognized from the exploitative opening scene, adoption of a member of the exploitative community, some more aimless wandering in Comfort, adoption of a cute animal, and more wandering in the barren desert. Finally, it then finished with an ending in the barren desert that suggested that the writer didn't quite figure out how to satisfactorily conclude the story.I read some reviews by professional critics, many of which which were quite a bit more favorable than my reaction. Although I recognized what they praised the film for, I still didn't like it. The similarity between Comfort and a Burning Man camp are amusing. The pop-culture references in the music track, the debris in the desert and in Comfort, and so forth are amusing. The use of well-known actors in small roles is interesting. But the interesting pieces don't add up to an interesting film.I can see that the writer (who also directed) put a lot of thought into the ideas behind the film, and aspired to something that was both an exploitation film and an art-house send-up of exploitation films -- but she only managed to succeed at making an exploitation film. Maybe if there were more hints about how Comfort was supposed to function, why the ""bad batch"" people had partitioned into two camps, and so forth? Maybe if there were actually an ending that made sense? Often when I see a bad movie, I ask, ""How could this be made into a good movie?"" Sometimes when I see a good movie, I think of ways it could be made even better. But in this case, I can't see any way to make a good movie out of this except a large-scale rewrite.One might ask how so many notable actors ended up in a film this bad. My guess is that they were drawn in by the writer-director's previous work _A Girl Walks Home at Night_, which was well-received by IMDb voters and very well reviewed by professional critics, and didn't expect that her second feature film would be a mess.",The Bad Batch
65,emvan,Extraordinary Film That Hugely Defies Initial Viewer Expectations,9,16 June 2017,"Most films tell you what they're about by their style and their trappings, and what happens in the opening scenes. THE BAD BATCH opens in a recognizably post-apocalyptic sort of setting (although it actually isn't -- more on that in a moment) and immediately features brutal, grisly violence. But the story that unfolds is completely unlike what you'd expect given that beginning.To begin with, it's not shot like an action / adventure movie. The pace is measured, even contemplative, and the camera lingers on the actors' faces. In other words, it's shot like a family drama ... and in a way it is. I was moved nearly to tears by the movie's climax; to say that was the last thing I expected after the opening scenes would be a massive understatement.It is, above all, tremendously thought-provoking. (And you now can see that in two or three important ways it's the polar opposite of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, a very clear influence and of course brilliant in its own completely different way.) First and foremost, it's an examination of the nature of morality and moral choices. There's a scene where you will ask yourself whether the act you have just seen was justified, indefensible, or some indescribable mixture of the two, even as you watch Suki Waterhouse (in a tremendous breakout performance) ask herself the same question -- what have I just done, and was it good or bad? The moral situation at the movie's end unconsciously evokes Ursula K. Le Guin's classic short story ""The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas"" (after a special screening in Boston, writer / director Ana Lily Amirpour confirmed she was unfamiliar with it).It's also a potent and cutting commentary on the problem of income inequality. The movie is actually set in the near future, where ""bad batch"" characters are exiled to a lawless fenced enclave in the former Texas desert, and left to fend for themselves. Unlike an actual post-apocalyptic setting, there's no inherited privileged class, and there's a lot less wealth for the powerful to hoard. It's never spoken of, but the characters seem always aware that whatever luxury they can achieve pales beside that which they left behind. It changes their psychology completely. So although the trappings are completely familiar, the situation is in fact utterly original. That originality underlies the moral situation and the depth of characterization.The movie defies another convention: it never bothers to explain what seem (on surface) to be unlikely elements of the portrayed world. However, Amirpour says she did extensive world-building and even devised complete back stories for every character. Her strategy is to keep viewers as uninformed as the characters themselves. That may bother some, but I think it adds immensely to the movie's weight and power.The film features a fine turn by Keanu Reeves as the leader of a settlement called (perhaps without irony) Comfort, and a wordless and barely recognizable Jim Carrey in a few key scenes, at least one of which is darkly hilarious. Giavanni Ribisi and Diego Luna show up in small roles, so you know that people wanted to do this movie. Jason Momoa (Aquaman) is excellent in a lead role, but it's Waterhouse that ultimately makes it all work.It's shot almost entirely outdoors, and it's so impressive to look at that I plan to see it a second time on an even bigger screen. It borrows many familiar trappings but is almost startling in its refusal to use them in stereotypical ways, and it has haunted my brain since the moment the lights went up. In short, it's an exemplary addition to the small but growing group of art-house science fiction films. It more than fulfills the promise of Amirpour's art-house horror debut, A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT, and marks her as a major figure to watch in genre cinema.",The Bad Batch

I won't bore you with the lengthily details of the entire film as one reviewer did. (Would not be surprised at all if He/She had some direct connection with the making of the film, etc) I am always up for cerebral, off color, non conformist, anti-Hollywood type films and praise those who make them. I am not, however, a fan of films that aim high to be recognized as deeply artistic and thought provoking when the film fails miserably in achieving that goal.There are at least four big name actors in this mess and there is hardly any dialog through almost 2 hours of run time. This is not to say Dialog makes a film great. Often silence and facial expression and body language speaks volumes. Sadly, this is not the case in ""the Bad Batch"". BORING is the first word that comes to mind to describe this film. The story line and plot are all over the place. Th film is set in a supposed Apocalaptic setting with a two caste system. One being cannibals, the other the privileged, if you can call it that. To categorize this film as ""Romance/ Sci-Fi"" is utterly misleading. There is absolutely No romance in this film nor is there any Science Fiction in it anywhere. I would categorize this film as a Dark Drama. The only redeeming quality of the film is the score in my opinion. None of the story telling is explained or resolved and you meander through the film (as do the characters) with no purpose. Here is my take on the film.....Girl is captured, has her leg And arm amputated barbarically, which is used for food BTW, by a group of cannibals. Girl escapes, finds woman in desert, kills her and takes daughter, head cannibal sets out to find daughter, finds girl sans two limbs, sets her out on a mission to find little girl. Girl finds little girl at another ""camp"" of the higher caste and recovers little girl, meets Said Gorilla cannibal in desert, film ends!Two hours of time I'll never recover.

Then she goes back later with a new leg and kills another one and takes the kid with her presumably to give her a better life or at least not leave her in the desert, even though that would be and was the first place her father looked. She gets messed up at a party and looses the kid and gets captured again by a cannibal. Then somehow is rescued by some rando good guy and goes back to the safety of the city. So what does she do now? She searches everywhere for the girl and when she finally finds her, she hatches some stupid plan to risk her life and get the girl back from a life of luxury and ease, just so she can return her to her cannibal father who she apparently has feelings for despite only knowing him for a day when he kidnapped her. They then eat her pet rabbit and it fades to black. What? These cannibals just ate half of her and now she risks her life and joins them because.....why?? Did she seriously develop Stockholm syndrome in one hungover day in the desert?Ugh. The acting, writing, and direction is sub par at best.

If, on the other hand, you see your glass as half-full, you will see a deeply complex political parable about the world we live in today even tho' this is set in a dystopian future. So think a few minutes before you dive in and certainly before you post your comments.I have thought about this film for some time and decided that I had to share this point of view for you. I like dystopian feature films so that was the first reason I jumped in.I do NOT like cannibal films and when Suki Waterhouse lost her arm and leg, I was ready to bail. Later, when Jason Moma was dressing a person he had killed in preparation for grilling, I was soooo soooo close to simply shutting dow this show.Then it hits me that Jim Carry is the Hermit; then Suki Waterhouse has a look which encouraged me to keep watching as she takes on the daughter of Moma; then there is Moma's character which compells me try a ferret out--is he good or is he bad.As with my last review, ""Hold the Dark,"" I began to see textture and characters and themes which encouraged me to stay and watch and enjoy.Then, of course, there are huge plot holes that drive me crazy: How does Keanu Reeves have this great place in the Waste Land where the ""bad batch"" are exiled? How do the dreamers have noodles to eat? What is the exchange rate? Where does Waterhouse get the gun she uses? How do the dreamers have access to electricity for the rave scene? I didn't see any explanation for these, as well as others!So I scored this an 8--its theme is well worth suffering through various atrocities and plot holes. The acting of Moma is worth watching.

It worked no better in this than it did then. This movie makes The Six-String Samurai look like a classic. Why cast Momoa as an insultingly stereotyped Mexican? Why not have, I don't know, a plot? The lead is set adrift with nothing to do, say, or be - except sort of...erotically disabled? Was that what the director was aiming for? This is a confusing and upsetting film, and I don't know how it was allowed to carry on for as long as it did without someone trying to fix it.",The Bad Batch
78,lacatusalexandru,The Bad Batch is almost like a spin-off to Mad Max,10,1 January 2020,"I'm glad that I didn't wanted to read or watch any of the movie critics as well as some of the audience reviews for ""The Bad Batch"" because I wanted to make my own impression about the movie and not to get influenced by someone else opinion about the movie or to start watching the movie by having low expectations because of the mixed reviews for the film.
I honestly liked the movie and I think that ""Bad Batch"" almost maked me feel like I'm watching to a spin-off for ""Mad Max"" or that the movie takes place in the same apocalyptic future as the one from ""Mad Max"" but in a slow way and without too much crazy things like the ones from ""Mad Max"".
The cast and the soundtrack are the things that make this movie powerfull and great.As for the story,I guess you can say that it's not really the greatest story you have ever seen in a movie about a dark future for the mankind but it sure is a great plot.
I knew I would enjoy this movie right from the beginning of that scene where Arlen is caught by two cannibals who than left her without an leg and an arm and at same time one guy is listening to the song ""All That She Wants"" while watching at Arlen how she is cut by a cannibal woman.
Another great scene is with Jason Momoa who is listening to ""Karma Chameleon"" and at the same time kills a woman and then he cook her and eats her alongside his girlfriend/wife and with them it's a little girl who might be his daughter.
Overall,Bad Batch is a great movie full with an amazing cast,great soundtrack and it fits perfect as a spin-off for Mad Max.",The Bad Batch
79,ShimmySnail,"very enjoyable, but expect a weird film",10,11 November 2017,"A minor criminal is exiled to a fenced off wasteland that used to be part of Texas with all the other undesirables (a la Escape From New York) and is immediately captured by cannibals. After her escape, the only safe place to go is a camp where a sex/drug cult leader is building his paradise and trying to impregnate as many followers as possible. The main character doesn't exactly love this setup either, so she at first goes looking for revenge on the cannibals, but ends up kidnapping the daughter of one of them, and the father comes looking for her.I'm kind of surprised so many people didn't like this. It wasn't billed as a big action sci-fi kind of movie, and it's not. The director, Ana Amirpour, has been compared to Tarantino, but I feel she's the exact opposite of Tarantino. He's all about lots of dialog, skipping around in the story line, very little in the way of visuals, lots of jokes, etc. This is slow paced, very little dialog (almost none really), but it's telling a story in the style usually called ""realism"" where the textures of the world come through. It's a very good soundtrack, great visuals, the director makes full use of sight and sound to tell the story, which I have to say is what cinema, as opposed to books and radio, is all about.It doesn't really have a straightforward plot with a simple conflict or obvious good and bad guys, but the director is not known for those Hollywood style movies at all. She's known for being very unconventional (her other big film was an Iranian vampire western) so just expect that it's going to be a weird film.",The Bad Batch
80,sithstalker-75789,Wtaf???,4,30 January 2021,"I just had to share my thoughts on this one.
This review contains spoilers from the get go.If ever the phrase style over substance applied to a film then this was it. I dug the dystopian landscape and the weirdly unique world in which the film is set, the cinematography and sceneries were beautiful and elegant, I loved the use of colours and I don't even mind the film being a slow burn with little to no dialogue.I can even get over the fact of the not so stellar performances by some amazingly talented actors but there is no way on earth you are gonna get me to believe that after someone gets brutally turned into an amputee, then has her limbs eaten by the man and his crew who ordered it.This newly made amputee then goes on to kill the leader of the fine young buff cannibals baby mama, kidnaps the daughter, after said daughter witnesses the shooting at point blank range.She then loses the daughter after taking some acid in a nearby fallout style shanty town (as ya do) then gets threatened to find the daughter that she lost (after just stumbling from the relative safety of newly found shanty town out into the open dessert on her acid trip) by big buff baby daddy or he gonna kill her crippled ass.Only to then swoon and fall in love with big, bad, buff, beard toting canibal leader baby daddy at the end of the film and want's to play happy families?????Get the duck out of here!!
Am I missing something? Did I not watch the same film as everyone else?Yes this film has its positives as mentioned above, it has numerous gaping plot holes that many others have mentioned in their reviews. Magical electricity that comes from nowhere to illuminate the acid fuelled desert rave, Pablo Escaobar I mean Keanu Reeves's magic palace with built in indoor swimming pool and fresh water with fruit and ice cubes in it. Lush lavish furnishings and fine garments in said palace whilst everyone else outside is looking like a scrub who needs a good wash. This film had more magic and sorcery in it than the entire run of Harry Potter films.But after fully reading the first fifty reviews and not a single one even hinted at the fact that its a wee bit odd that this poor women who endures all this barbarity all of a sudden develops stockholm syndrome at the end of the film shocked me more than the film itself. Hence this lengthy ass rant I mean review.If you have a mediocre flight you've got to stick the landing people.Why not shoot Jason Momoas character and then walk off into the desert scape with kiddy and rabbit in tow?Why not shoot the daughter, knee cap Jason Momoas character steal the bunny and walk off into the sunset? (The brutal ending) gasp.Why not shoot the rabbit whilst staring at momaos character as if to say. I could rinse you if I wanted but I'm better than you?Fair enough I ain't no script writer but any of these endings would have made more sense to me than u ate my arm and my leg and disfigured me for life but its okay boo I forgive you let's get coffee some time. She even asks him what he's doing now. Sigh.There are so many kool revenge films Peppermint, the film named Revenge, John Wick no 1. All these films had a satisfying payoff the bad batch did not. Bad Batch more like Bad Scratch.TLDR - Perdy looking film, kool setting, plot holes the size of meteor crates, poor acting chops, complete lack of decent script and plot and frustratingly silly ending .4 thumbs up.

81,shipwreckjack,Not all dystopian future movies have to be good,2,18 April 2021,"Netflix' movie The Bad Batch is an unusually awful movie. It misses opportunity by miles at every chance. There's dystopian cannibals. That stopped being a thing after 20 minutes. Jim Carrey is unrecognizable and they do nothing with that. Nothing. It's a Mad Max world that comes across as like the last day of Burning Man, where everyone is hung over and everything is a wreck. Jason Momoa is in it and he's alright. Keanu Reeves is decent but he's got little to do.There's a freaking working office printer in a world where people are eating each other and trading amputee women for gasoline. What?The biggest crime the director/producer made was forgetting to edit. It's a 2 hour movie that feels like 3 and, if edited, could be shoehorned into a 15 minutes short and still you could go to the bathroom at any point and not miss anything. There's no spoiler in saying that there's no real point in having the girl protagonist lose half her limbs to cannibals (it happens like 15 minutes in) and it's like not even an event that had any impact in any way on the rest of the movie. If you're hoping for cheap, exploitational nudity, that's not something that happens either. No one seems to have any libido or drive for anything, except maybe a gaggle of musclebound meatheads in cannibal camp who are really into their weights.Giovanni Ribisci is in it, playing a typical Giovanni Ribisci mentally-addled character who equally has nothing to do.Whoever the producer is, I suspect he has incriminating photos on these stars or he's one charmer on the casting couch.",The Bad Batch

83,alihandemiral,Slowly but surely: one of the most original films of the decade.,8,6 February 2018,"If I was asked to describe The Bad Batch in a classic Hollywood motto, I'd have to go with ""Mad Max meets Jim Jarmusch"". I only began watching because I am a fan of Jason Momoa, but after the ten minute mark, I knew this film was going to be good. First off all, this is not for people who want constant action and a fast plot. The film progresses slowly but surely; there are scenes that do not contribute to the main plot, and characters whose developments are left incomplete. Moreover, Both the directing style of Amirpour and the plot suggests spontaneity. Therefore the whole film may be described as ""a post-apocalyptic ramble"".The remarkable cast is led by the amazing future star Suki Waterhouse, Jason Momoa, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves and an uncredited Jim Carrey as ""The Hermit"". The leading cast's portayal of their rambling characters blends perfectly with the spontaneous plot of the film.

86,incubus-0914,One of the most tedious big budget movie ever!,1,24 September 2017,"I watched this film today on Netflix. I was surprised when I found this title on Netflix this soon, I guess Netflix got the right to release this at the same time as its DVD release. That is usually not a good sign... however, I took a chance because I had been excited to see this movie since last year because it's got great casts, and a promising plot directed by one of the most anticipated foreign female directors, sounds like a good catch...but,It's a big fat MESS!!! Boring, tedious, lengthy are the perfect words to describe this movie. I am so glad that I watched on Netflix because I could fast-forward some scenes. I couldn't help it, it was painfully uninteresting!! Like other reviewers are saying, nothing really happens in this overlong approx. 2hrs movie. Too many unnecessary landscape shots, too many meaningless walking scenes, minimal dialog (probably I can easily memorize the entire script), unrealistic supplies of resource, lack of character developments, no explanation of characters' intentions etc...etc...I don't even know when and why the main girl (A watered down version of Miley Cirus, IMO) fell in love with Jason Momoa's character! Stockholm syndrome of some sort??? Pretty much all of her actions are questionable. In the beginning of the movie, her priority should've been finding her own safety in this lawless territory and seeking a water supply, instead she chose to put on a lipstick in the very dry desert where no one is around. I immediately disliked her for that reason.Although there is so many tedious scenes, the part where she grew feelings for Miami Man (Momoa) is shorter than the blink of an eye. Even Miami Man seems confused by her action at close to the end scene (where 90% of dialog takes place), and her answer is just nonsense. Moreover, her southern accent was utterly unbearable more than Momoa's Cuban accent. Why not avoid using British actress if she is that terrible. The other 10% of dialog happens in the scene where Keanu explains how important to grow tomato right. The acting of Ski Waterhouse especially her facial expressions in this scene is purely awful. It's actually astonishing, can't help wondering how she got this roll.I can go on and on, but I don't wanna make my review lengthy like this movie.The only things worth watching were Jim Carry's portrayal of sympathetic scavenger (he gave me a good laugh, too) and Keanu Reeves's 70s' porn star like looks exclusively in this movie!!",The Bad Batch
87,re-animatresse,not horror but not bad,8,4 November 2017,"i love writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's debut film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. slow-paced, visually-oriented and highly stylised, it reminds me of the films of Jim Jarmusch. this one, on the other hand, feels more like an homage to Jodorowsky's El Topo. set in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland, it features all of the driving characteristics of A Girl Walks Home, but with added emphasis on a diverse assortment of characters and relatively sparse but memorable dialogue. i wouldn't necessarily describe it as philosophically profound, but it certainly inspires contemplation the film is categorised as horror on both IMDb and Wikipedia. aside from a brief scene involving cannibalism near the beginning, there's nothing really horrific about this, and viewers expecting there to be will likely be disappointed in that regard. it takes a while to get into; each scene is drawn out to the max, with the camera repeatedly lingering on characters' facial expressions for 5 - 10 second intervals. i'm not good at reading faces, though, and if there was some meaning being conveyed thereby, i had difficulty interpreting it and found it tedious to watchon the whole, it's an enjoyable and thought-provoking film that i look forward to watching again, even if it's a little slower than seems necessary at times and doesn't quite measure up to Amirpour's first effort, in my view",The Bad Batch

Low self esteem is what I figure,the oiled down hunk meat-head is a good father to his mute 9 year old biracial daughter (points) draws pretty birds (points) & has awesome prison pecs,tats & sensitivity (points points points)But beefcake is a cannibal after all so it's not perfect (minus points for gnawing on bone marrow ) But for stumpy it's a marriage made in heaven.The Cameo of the homeless bum Jim Carrey tooling around with his shopping cart is stolen straight out of 'The Road' with Viggo Mortensen ...the plagiarism ruins deep ...actually allot is stolen from The Road,Mad Max & others of the Doomsday genre. The long drawn out scenes of fading B character actors tripping on a cocktail of Ecstasy & Ego (that's you Carrey & Keanu ) while wandering the Mohave sound-stage is bizarre .I missed seeing the deeper meanings while fast forwarding to the end.

91,ppilf,A wonderful holiday movie for all families,1,13 January 2020,"My family watched this movie over the Christmas holidays. It's a heart-warming story of a little girl named Honey who is cared for by a young handicapped woman, Arlen, after the death of Honey's mother. Honey is later taken away from Arlen and unlawfully adopted into a wealthy foster family, because the family assumes they can provide Honey a better life in Comfort than Arlen can. After much turmoil and struggle, Arlen manages to get custody of Honey back again, rescuing her from the domineering foster family. But shortly thereafter Honey's father suddenly shows up again, and we assume this means Honey will once again be taken from Arlen. But the best part of this touching movie is its happy ending. The handicapped Arlen and Honey's father form an unexpected strong loving relationship. And after all the hardship and emotional stress, Honey finally has a happy family and lives in Comfort with her father and Arlen.Suki Waterhouse puts in a superb performance as Arlen. But what is truly amazing is how real her amputee handicap and prosthetic are made to look, through special effects. Jason Mamoa does a good job playing Honey's father. He is depicted in this film as a man with a slight speech defect and eating disorder. Keanu Reeves plays the head of Honey's temporary foster home. He plays a dreamy, wealthy, but strange ladies man who is obsessed with the plumbing in his large luxurious estate.I think this movie will become my family's new favorite Christmas movie, replacing 'It's a Wonderful Life'. I recommend it as a traditional holiday movie for all families. -NOT.Kidding aside, the following is my real review:On a talent scale of 0 to 10, I'd put Ana Lily Amirpour at about minus 5. Daring to call herself a writer or a director and call this a movie is an insult as much as a joke. Anyone involved in writing, directing, or producing this pathetic puke, and daring to call it a movie should be prosecuted for fraud. Ed Woods could rise from his grave and sue these people for slandering his profession.This is not a movie. Ana Lily Amirpour is not a movie director or a screenwriter. The actors in this rot have wiped out any and all credits that they may have previously accumulated. They've reset their resumes back to a blank sheet and their slates back to zero.It's not that I have something against dystopian films. I always say that a great movie can be made of any subject if made by talented artists and professional filmakers. But you need talent and professionals.Literally and truly, I would hire any of the dozen 5 and 6-year-olds on my block to write a screenplay or direct a movie before I'd pay Ana Lily Amirpour a dime.

I grade things with brutal honesty and it takes A LOT to get me to grade something a 7, let along 8 or 9 but this, I strongly feel, deserves a 10. Yes a ten. Camera work is spectacular. Scene composition is absolutely amazing. Most of the scenes do not even require dialogue. Every gesture, every facial expression, every little detail was not missed. Watching silent clips was like watching entire conversation because it was about the scene.... not some lazy rehashed instant gratification copy paste algorithm that is applied to movies. This movie literally had a story line and that story line was of a post apocalyptic no hope at all, no light at the end of the tunnel... just surviving sort of thing. From the first few minutes to brutality of what came after to wandering about the universe that was created by the writer/director... it was hitting all the right buttons. Watching this on my home projector on a 10 foot wide screen just blew entire movie out of the water. I felt that it was a breath of fresh air. I felt that this movie was exactly what I was looking for. Granted to the most impatient one, this movie is certainly a no go. This is not about gore, this is not about action... this is not some mad max 2 with Charlize theron driving about the desert. This was about anything but that.

There are a lot of things that work here;the direction and pacing of the film are spot on with some nice cinematography and some interesting choices along the way. Likewise, most of the actor's contribute some nice work here including the much lauded cameos by Jim Carey and Giovanni Ribissi and the high profile appearances of Jason Momoa and Keannu Reeves. (None of whom did this film because they ""needed a paycheck"" by the way but was a chance to work with the Sundance Institute and/or an up and coming director they wanted to support.) Carey was really surprising, it took me a few minutes before I even realized it was him and Momoa shows he's got real acting chops but it was Keannu Reeves who really stole the show for me. He goes against type and really brings the creepy to his role of a ""Jim Jones"" type cult leader. It would be interesting to see him play an out and out villain in a future role. As for Suki Waterhouse, I honestly have no idea whether she can act or not because the script is so bad, littered with wooden dialogue and bad choices throughout, that it's impossible to tell. The characters consistently make decisions or take actions that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. We are not talking your typical Hollywood tropes either (Going down to the basement alone, saying ""I'll be right back,"" etc...you know the drill)NO, we are talking actions and decisions that are so wrong they are insulting to the viewer. Example, after narrowly escaping from a group of cannibals and finding safety in a small town, our hero, sans two limbs mind you, immediately wanders BACK OUT into the desert right back towards the cannibal community.She then, over the course of the rest of the movie, proceeds to fall for the head cannibal. A man who participated in a barbecue involving her arm and leg!! I kid you not. I actually found this offensive. And I'm not offended easily. I am baffled as to how the director even considered this line of action for the character or even what the point was. I'm totally mystified as to how anyone could have thought this was a good idea. I found myself very irritated with Ms. Waterhouse's character, to the point that I yelled at the screen several times during the film, so annoyed was I at the character's stupid decisions and at the creators themselves for letting this character be such an idiot. It was like a roll back to before Buffy, when women in horror or sci-fi were nothing but mindless eye candy. You'd think Ellen Ripley had never happened. And this during the week ""Wonder Woman"" came out. So, there you go.

After two months, I watched it again and decided that this was well worth a second view.The story is pretty typical for the genre of undesirables exiled to a wasteland. Yes, some felt compelled to resort to cannibalism as the easier strategy. And yet, there's a haven of sorts, if one is willing to find it. The lead character, played by Suki Waterhouse, does an admirable job - but Jim Carrey is the real surprise - dramatically entertaining in a completely unexpected role. Even Keanu Reeves' portrayal of a dubious but benevolent ""desert sultan"", replete with breeding harem. is spot on. An agreeable fellow who is just too smooth to be truly likable. Jason Momoa's character remains an unpredictable cut-throat who may or may not turn out to be one of the most depraved amongst these outcasts.I would be tempted to rate the film higher if the story had been a little more imaginative.

Essentially, death and survival was more probable than behind the walls of ""Comfort"". The wide open of nothing.

 I do not understand all the terrible ratings. I really thought this movie was entertaining! While yes, it was slow ... the whole point was living in a world with nothing left, and trying to find your way (even after SEVERE brutality). 
I thought Waterhouse and Mamoa were excellent, while Ribisi was wasted, and Keanu was VERY out of pocket as somewhat of a perv. And, tho I have never been a Jim Carrey fan, this was perhaps his best role. 
There are, basically, two camps here ... the ""Bad Batch"" (cannibalistic bad guys), and the city (for lack of a better word) of Comfort (supposed ""good guys"", tho, well ... you decide). In almost every ""apocalyptic"" movie you see, this inevitably leads to the big showdown, for all the marbles. But these two seem to have a binding truce, and no one tests that set-up. But, it appears, after the brutality inflicted on Waterhouse, she must decide where she belongs.

(Okay, it's not very satisfying to me, but I'm trying to be open minded). - It's got Keanu Reeves. - The dream cult.Casual CannibalismThis goes in the pros list if you're pro casual cannibalism, otherwise in the cons.Review Overview:The movie is just okay which is not really okay. The desert post-apocalyptic genre is almost as played out as the zombie genre. So if you're going to make another movie about this, at least have something more to add or something to say. You could *not see this film* and you wouldn't have missed anything. The only interesting part for me was the dream cult. The movie could be titled ""A year in the life of the fine young cannibals"".Gripes: The overall 'world' doesn't make much sense to me. Why is there cannibalism when there is, apparently, a reasonable amount of food. I guess this makes it more of a ""life choice""? - Why would a group tolerate being preyed upon by the cannibals? - Would there really be a group of pumped up weight lifters when food is so scarce? - Maybe if you spent less time skate boarding you could farm more food?",The Bad Batch

111,misha_kerogazov,Defenitly a bad batch,2,7 May 2021,"First things first, the movie is slow, boring and pretty much about nothing. I guess some people can see it as an art-house movie, but it's still too slow and too boring. I mean, there is a bunch of movie stars and they are not doing too much to show what they are capable of.Now in a bit more detail. For the slowness - there is a lot of slow waking, slow talking, intense staring, intense standing and it's dragging on and on through the whole movie. About it's been boring. There is a plot of course, but it's very thin and even though there is some extreme brutality at the beginning to hook us up that you may think to lead to some excitement later, in fact it really doesn't. There is no message in the movie, nothing is explained, nothing exciting happens at the end. All dialogs are very boring and very slow, so you sort of waiting oh, now they are going to reveal some interesting plot twist or cool idea, but nope, just nothing, just space fillers.If I had to compare the style of this movie to something, I'd say it reminds me some old Russian art-house movies, Tarkovsky and etc. Where nothing is happening for 2 hours and ends with nothing and everybody stands and claps and say that there is some hidden genius message to show that they are really the ones who got it. Well, if there was a hidden message, I failed to reveal it.Verdict: Not Recommended.",The Bad Batch

The movie doesn't shy away from showing you the slower parts of what life would be like in the world they created. I found the slower parts personaly helped bring me into that world though. It was interesting to think about what I would do in each situation presented, and you really felt the hopelessness of the main characters situation at times, as well as her strength as she continued on. The best way I can describe the plot is that they simply took an uncut portion of a person's life and turned it into a movie. This means that the plot doesn't exactly have a clear direction or a traditional layout with a buildup, climax and ending per say. If you like thought provoking dystopian movies and enjoy just seeing what a broken world would be like, I'd recommend this movie to you. If you like the more traditional approach of movie story telling, than I'd probably pass on this one.",The Bad Batch
115,darth-tobe,Film without a point? Couldn't finish.,2,24 September 2017,"What can I say about a film I only watched the first quarter of? It's not my habit to stop a film once I've started watching. With this one, I hit the 30-minute mark and the film was just plodding along. I didn't have the impression that anything important had happened. Don't get me wrong: events had occurred but it didn't feel like there was any weight to any of them. To illustrate my point I've transcribed the beginning of the film. For the above reason you don't need to worry about spoilers.We're in the middle of the desert, middle of nowhere. A fence runs through it. A voice narrates something about a ""bad batch"" as two police officers lead a young girl through a gate in the fence and lock up after her. A sign tells us that this is Texas and beyond the fence she's no longer a citizen of the USA and doesn't enjoy any rights. She stares gormlessly after the police car as it leaves. Next scene: she eats her rations. Next scene: she starts walking, even does a little dance and basically seems completely unfazed by her situation. Next scene: she finds a car and sits in it. Not because she feels hot and wants to get out of the sun, not because she wants to try and start it up and have a means of transportation, not because she intends to loot the car, she just sits in it - and applies some make-up. A golf cart comes into view behind her, draws nearer, she notices it but doesn't display any reaction. Next scene: she's running for her life away from the golf cart until one of the occupants pounces on her.I hope I'm getting across the point that even in these first few minutes our main character does stuff but not because she displays any motivation but just because the script seems to call for them. And this goes on and is also true of the other characters. I found it infuriating to watch a movie in which the characters just do meaningless stuff or stare gormlessly into the middle distance. By the 30-minute mark the movie had failed to properly establish the setting, the characters and the plot. It also took until roughly that time for any spoken dialogue to come up - that wasn't grunting or screaming.I think I know what they were going for: bleak, grim and brooding. And that didn't work because a) they would have needed to establish some contrast, otherwise it's just bleak against bleak. b) it's hard to come off as bleak when the characters have food, water, shelter, firearms with ammunition, electricity, some form of medical care, body lotion (some guys seem oiled up like it's Mr. Universe) and even entertainment. Since the film makers were obviously going for something like Mad Max or Escape from New York they should have checked out how messed up characters in those movie were - with all their gear cobbled together from spare parts. You could see plainly that they were living in harsh conditions. c) if they were going for brooding and grim they should show the violence and have characters react to it appropriately. Our leading lady doesn't seem traumatised enough considering she should be far from used to the kinds of things that happen to her.I stopped watching after about the first quarter because I couldn't see the film going anywhere. It was scene after scene of tracking shots of people walking or close-ups of people staring silently. In better films such techniques might have been used for pacing or building atmosphere but here they only come across as pretentious. Maybe I stopped watching before the film gets good but somehow I doubt it and I also don't really care. If the film can't seem to make an effort to engage my interest why should I continue watching it?",The Bad Batch
116,KyleBel,Entertaining but misses the mark,5,11 September 2021,"From a cinematography, acting, and visual stand point this movie delivers. Even the directing is really good when there's compelling scenes and dialogue. The problem is there's not a compelling script/story to hold this movie together.Do I think it's worth the watch? Yes, but not if you're behind on great movies. If you're a fan of Jason, Keanu, or Jim Carrey then you could watch it for that alone .I could have probably been happy and given this a 7/8 star review if not for that ending. I won't spoil it, but the ending was not worth the wait and I feel like it was written in such a way that they were certain that there would be a sequel, like this was just setup for something great, the problem is that when you do this you still need a compelling story with some kind of resolution and an actual cliff hanger leaving you wanting more. This movie had neither a fulfilling conclusion nor a compelling cliffhanger.I just wish that had spent a little more time polishing the script/story before filming this, it could have been great.",The Bad Batch
117,deborahzzzzz,What i think,10,26 September 2017,Awesome film & acting by all cast - Suki was fantastic & such a natural beauty throughout. Her acting is intense & deep & Suki is well suited to this role. Keanu was himself as always & played the part well as always. So a great film & interesting story line & it is like the beauty breaks the Beast when she finally gets close to Miami Man Jason Momoa. The filming looked so 'complete' when Arlen was filmed with no leg & no arm - very clever filming!. Such a Retro film that it made it a classic.,The Bad Batch
118,LongLiveTheNewFlesh27,"Some interesting moments, but overall incredibly lacking",2,26 September 2017,"The Bad Batch is a bizarre, sometimes fascinating, but mostly dreadfully glacial, try hard artsy film. The main problem with it is that it confuses silence and a plodding pace for depth, and despite some unique moments, it's really not worth your time. The story is actually a fairly interesting one, something that you could see in a Mad-Max type of film, but unfortunately the premise is mostly squandered on shots of empty expanse and our main character, the lifeless Suki Waterhouse, staring dead eyed, either sober or on hallucigenic drugs from Keanu Reeves. If she had given a better performance I might have cut this film some more slack, but in this movie she has about as much personality as a piece of plain white bread (which is also a good metaphor for the movie as a whole). It's there, it serves it's purpose, but its ultimately forgettable and bland. With actors like Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey, I'm surprised that the director chose this actress for the lead. Even Jason Momoa gives a middling performance. Keanu is hard not to love in everything, but his role could be played by pretty much anybody else. Jim Carrey doesn't say a word.To resist the urge to rip this movie to shreds, I'll say that the scenes between Momoa and Waterhouse are the highest point in the movie. My favorite scene in the entire movie is where they hide from a sandstorm. It only lasts a couple of seconds but it's one of the only moments in the movie where you actually feel a connection between two human beings. Ultimately, under a better or more talented director and with a more likable lead this movie could have been something, but as it stands it's a mostly lifeless shell of something that could have been decent, with a couple of interesting moments thrown in. I wouldn't recommend seeing it, for art house fans or not. It's just not a good movie.",The Bad Batch

124,shrame,Tries too hard to be something that its not,6,25 December 2017,"This film desperately attempts to portray itself as being supremely sophisticated and abstract artsy. It tries to fall into the category of a being an instant ""cult classic"" However, despite the first half or two thirds of the movie being somewhat interesting and having some potential, the rest of it just falls flat on its post apocalyptic face. The accents are cheesy, the music often times feels forced and over imposed and the acting is... alright I guess... One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it's a little too slow paced at times with the camera focusing too much on scenes that should have been time lapsed or edited out. The ending, like much of the film, is irrational, just like the protagonists motivations which start off being based off of primal instincts but end up leaving the viewer confused over her arbitrary decision making process. I mean, in the end, rather than lead a descent life in a town with civilized human beings, who seem to be providing for her, giving her food and her own place to stay even though she doesn't seem to be contributing in any way, she chooses to throw it all away, leave it all behind to go and live with the same cannibals who abducted her and tore her limb from limb to eat her flesh while they held her captive ? but WHY ? Also wasn't the little girl better off in the town of Comfort? Wouldn't she have had a much better and brighter future there ? I mean I can understand how the film tries to portray the town of Comfort as being corrupt and shallow at its core. After all, it is run by an EVIL AND SINISTER Keanu Reeves (sarcasm), who does a shitty impersonation of a post apocalyptic, drug addicted? hippyesque Hew Hefner (with a flabby body) who's also some sort of weird philosophical drug lord messiah / leader type who rambles endlessly, mostly about shit, toilets and his own delusions of grandeur... but REALLY what's the worst part about it all ? Okay sure they've giving out drugs and everyone is high every night and Keanu mentions that the economy seems to be dependent on drugs (which he controls I guess), but on the bright side they're not forcing people to do drugs, they actually seem to be giving out the drugs for free and the best part of it all is that in a barren wasteland apocalyptic nightmare they seem to be civilized, accommodating and accepting... Yes I can understand that she (the protagonist) has some sort of weird chemistry with Momoa... but WHY ? Is it because they were close to each other in a few scenes ? Or is it because he saved her from that big black dude with the BBC (jk) ? But he only saved her from the black guy because he needed her as a means to an end, to get his daughter back.. Sure there is some chemistry between the two and maybe she has a thing for tough bad guys but COME ON this is the same guy who's in charge of the group of cannibals who were eating her, one limb at a time.. LET ME REPEAT THAT... they were EATING HER ONE LIMB AT A TIME and they already ate one of her arms and one of her freakin legs... In fact Momoa's character probably ate some of it himself...In the end, I don't know what to make of this film... I really don't... All I can say is that it's weird, excruciatingly slow and after the halfway point, very predictable. Also after the halfway point the main characters motivation seems arbitrary and almost silly considering the situation... All in all, 6/10 for the effort and potential. Should you watch it ? I would say, just watch MAD MAX, you'll be better off because at least that movie doesn't try to be something that it's not and the story is much more rational than this one.",The Bad Batch

I had to use a literary lens to look at this moving picture through, and I think if others did the same, it would've been more fulfilling for them. It offered a unique vision into the modern world, into our relationships, into what we spend our time working hard for and what we probably really desire.

This review could end here, because it's something you have to see for yourself.There's a caveat, though: as for every real movie, ""The Bad Batch"" requires you to have the SKILL of watching a film. You have to work *with* the movie in order to enjoy it, which means your brain must be ON. If you are the kind of viewer who thinks movies should be mindless entertainment to switch your mind off for a couple hours, who needs to be guided through a story, hand-holded by expositional dialogue and stereotyped characters, then I strongly suggest you turn to something different: the Fast & Furious franchise, or Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie #17 may be a more apt choice, for you.Here you'll find strong acting performances, a beautifully crafted narrative that relies on visuals way more than on dialogues, a great soundtrack, a chiseled editing and lots and lots of great small moments, ranging from horrifying to dramatic, from comedic to romantic, from bitterly satiric to endearingly sweet.It's a great cinematic experience all around which, as cherry on top, also has something to say about the world we live in.

Cubano's Mute Daughter is a MacGuffin.The movie starts off ""OK"", with a good pace, and despite poor acting skill (Suki is mostly eye-candy, with a squeaky voice to match), it maintains an interesting premise. But then dramatically FIZZLES after Suki revenge kills Cubano's girlfriend. Then the ""distopian love story"" plot takes over and the movie is just embarrassing. There is zero chemistry between the actors, the writing is hideously awkward, and the location seems impossible. Grade F.

However, that didn't happen. Some big actors in the movie, but generally their performances weren't great, but its not like they had much to work with. The main character was terrible. She was extremely uninteresting--in fact, usually the opposite of interesting. Her acting was often questionable. In the movie, she had some pretty cringy scenes. However, it could be argued that that was reflective of the terrible character she was playing. The movie seemed to devolve into getting cheap ""entertainment"" off of gore scenes, to make up for not much really happening in the movie. If you are into weird movies that have some interesting concepts, and have some patience, I'd say the first half is worth watching, but go in with low expectations.",The Bad Batch

147,StudioElluf,It's slow and it doesn't make any sense,3,14 August 2020,"This movie started quite interesting and in your face. But not before you first had to sit through minutes of nothing. And this is the problem throughout the whole movie: it's so slow! It's like the director never heard of pacing before. I think that if this was made into a shortfilm it would be much better (if they would also rewrite the story, changed the setting and characters and just went with a simple revenge story with cannibals). But now it seems like everything is so stretched out, but it's so unnecessary.On top of that, almost nothing the main character does makes sense. Especially in the end. In short: she ""adopted"" the kid of a woman she killed (who was a cannibal). The dad of the kid wants kid back. Unbeknowst by him he ""hires"" the girl who killed his wife to find the girl. The kid meanwhile lives a live of luxury after being found by the ""big chief"" of the town called Comfort. Then the main character finds out where the kid is, goes there, and even gets the chance to live in luxury as well. But no, she kidnaps the kid and brings her back to her cannibal dad in the desert. She didn't save the kid, she ruined the kid's life by dragging her out of a life of luxury to live in the desert with her dad (who even almost immediateley kills the pet rabbit of the kid BTW).So it's very slow, very stupid and very pointless. I can't really recommend this to anyone. I'm also wondering what genre this movie's supposed to have. There's not enough action to be a action movie, it's not sad enough to be a drama, it's definetely not a comedy, not a horror movie, it's not really science fiction either. What is it?

151,andrew-marks59,"Walking around, more walking, oh and did I mention walking?",2,25 January 2017,"I was excited to see this movie after reading the synopsis a couple of days before the screening. As the title of this summary suggests, there is a lot of walking in this movie. The story starts out semi promising with you wondering what happened to the earth but ends up being the walkiest and least talkiest movie I've ever seen. I know those aren't words but goddammit they get my point across. The main actress is forgettable, Jason Momoa, Jim Carrey, and Keanu Reeves were miscast or maybe it was just the bad script? Possibly both? Back to the walking part, with minimal dialogue and no action whatsoever, this movie becomes a student film really quick. What I mean is that they don't cut out all the walking around and other useless scenes that should have obviously been taken out. There isn't really a story, it's sort of tried to take elements from Mad Max and other post apocalyptic films that are much better than it and hope the audience notices and doesn't care or doesn't notice at all.My suggestion: don't see it unless you want to be bored to death.Seen at TIFF 2016.",The Bad Batch

It seems like it desperately wants to be Mad Max with a touch of Beauty and the Beast, and most definitely it wants to be seen as a ""cult classic"" but it never will be. The whole movie could have been done in 20 - 30 minutes. Take the first part of the movie, up to where she does that thing that causes Jason Momoa to come looking for her, delete the rest...The End..that would have been a great movie. The acting skills seem off, the lead actress has the personality of a tissue, no one really seems to sound convincing when they deliver their lines, if they even have lines because there really isn't that much dialogue, which would be fine but they don't convey anything via body language or facial expressions either...I didn't care about any of the characters..well maybe the little girl but even then not really....the only good thing about this movie was Jason Momoas gorgeous physique.

153,Giantjott,"For your own sake, I hope you can see this film for the masterpiece that it is.",9,26 November 2020,"Charles Bukowski once wrote, ""Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must live."" This is how I feel about the people who didn't appreciate this film. Not the monosyllabic morons decrying the film for wasting their precious time - like ants to a picnic, those types will always heap vitriol onto any art house film worth its salt. Rather, I mean the supposed cinephiles...those who think that when this movie loses them, it's because it took a wrong turn. Sorry to say, but for all their self-importance, there are those out there, like myself, who have discovered another way of approaching cinema - maybe we're crazy, but it includes recognizing the genius of this film.It's easy to see why critics didn't like it. Unlike the director's last output, she doesn't couch her visual style in the time-honored techniques of serious cinema. I loved A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, and in fact, the two films share a lot in common (fictional world of outsiders, injury to main character in the first act, furry critter ties everything together), but Amirpour was obviously working with a much smaller budget then and remained in the established realm of student art film. It worked masterfully, winning her awards and praise and the chance to direct a much bigger production. But rather than borrow once more from the pre-approved visual styles of Jim Jarmusch and David Lynch, Amirpour instead leans into her love of desert landscapes as she takes on the post-apocalyptic genre (Mad Max, A Boy and His Dog, Tank Girl).And yet, the tone of the film is much the same - long cuts, gorgeous stylized shots, in-camera effects. In a word, the storytelling is extremely visual, in both films. But for some reason, this style is easier to swallow when it looks like you're making the most of a small budget. It especially works well when there are no recognizable faces, as people tend to expect a certain amount of dialogue or a certain style of acting or a certain length of screen time from celebrity actors. Much like McConaughey in The Beach Bum, casting Keanu Reeves, Jason Momoa, and Jim Carrey seem to have elicited the wrong expectations from its viewers. It definitely attracted too many viewers from the mainstream (accounting for the endless dribble about the slow pacing in a large number of the reviews), and for that reason the low score is to be expected. But those viewers ought to be aware - Fury Road isn't the only way to make a film about the desert. Hell, it's not even the only way to make a Mad Max film. The Road Warrior, for instance, had a much slower pace, and it is perhaps for this reason that so many cinephiles consider it to be the best of the series. Slow pacing and desert landscapes go together like peanut butter and milk. Lawrence of Arabia, anyone? Walkabout? Of course, I'm also a huge fan of Gus Van Sant's Gerry, which I imagine had a lot of cinephilic fanboys looking for the exit.The problem boils down to this - the more cinema knowledge you have, the more difficult it can be to leave your preconceptions at the door. But as someone just as interested in finding new talent as in venerating the established veterans, I find this is a necessary precondition to enjoying the bold, original work of tomorrow's cinematic innovators. The Bad Batch is a genre movie, a western, and Amirpour knows this, employing various genre tropes, albeit in slightly new ways. She doesn't give us an obvious big bad, or a final showdown - she doesn't employ Mexican standoffs, or bounty hunters, or even gun fights. She does, however, give us a story of survivalism (both man vs. wild and man vs. man), cannibalism, kidnapping, drug addiction, forced labor, indentured service, exploitation, redemption, personal responsibility and trust, which, I don't know about you, but that sounds like a lot of juicy story content (I saw one reviewer actually list the events of the film in a similarly bulleted fashion, attempting to illustrate how empty the script was, but inadvertently listing several major themes with emotional weight and human interest). And honestly, the pacing isn't even that slow, especially when compared to films like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Solaris (outer space is, after all, a kind of desert). It's more likely that this film's detractors are reacting to the meandering plot. And it's true - the story is told in a way that makes it difficult to recall the details of the plot afterward, especially the chronology of events. It is, at times, surrealistic, even hallucinogenic. At other times the events of the film rely heavily on happenstance. Without each scene leading directly and obviously into the events of the next, it can sometimes feel like you, the viewer, are drifting through various unconnected episodes, unguided by an overarching plot. And perhaps that's true. But who said that's a bad thing? Actually, it seems like a very appropriate storytelling device, given the setting. But alas, it seems the success of Fury Road has monopolized audience expectations when it comes to films made in the desert. Don't look for that movie here. Rather, if you have any expectations at all, they should be based upon the director's debut, her revisionist approach to genre, and maybe the broader history of quirky desert films, such as A Boy and His Dog. And, for the love of God, leave behind any preconceived notions based upon the cast. They're actors, after all. They deserve a chance to show you something different.",The Bad Batch

A few tweaks to story-line would improve it.",6,27 September 2017,"This appears to be a movie about a future where members of the prison population are cast out into a apocalyptic desert wasteland. There are two settlements in the movie, a set of cannibals who I guess are the bad guys (sort of) and a settlement of non-cannibals who appear to have a more moral stance in terms of not eating people, offering a bit of help to those in need and not casting people out for being extremely odd. There are a few nods to what actually transpired/is transpiring but nothing concrete. **spoiler alert** At the end of the film the main character appears to opt to choose to live with a cannibal who ate some of her limbs rather than staying in the relatively safe haven apparently controlled by cultish leader ""The Dream"". Not really sure how much logical sense this makes as in the non cannibal settlement they have have Uzis's and other weapons along with an heir of civility and certainly no one brutally sawing limbs off living human beings which are then cooked and eaten. But each to their own I guess.There are certainly areas of this story which could have been explained better, there are sections of the film that drag on a little whereas there are sections that simply skip large time periods in which more light could have been shed on what is actually going on. This may well be deliberate and certainly gives scope for the viewer to use their own imagination to construct large areas of the plot in their own mind, it's debatable whether or not this is a good thing.In summary - This is not a terrible film nor is it a finished masterpiece. If one can get through some horrific scenes and isn't expecting too much it's probably worth a watch, it has it's moments of brilliance and no shortage of sections that will one would expect to draw a large amount of criticism.",The Bad Batch

I mean the movie has all the elements but the story revolves around a little girl that I clearly could care less about. She's not even a likable character but the plot just circles around her and those ""find the child"" type of movies are always the worst.

I give this movie 6 stars because I like the atmosphere, the cast, it was shot well but the plot... was it ever terrible. I mean stick to the basics of desert wasteland. Controlling the water or the fuel or whatever resource people need to survive throw in the bad guy in control of it all and then the heroine trying to stop them and free the people so they can have access to said resource without being slaves.

It's a visual art movie which can be enjoyed by anyone, but is definitely not mainstream. A lot of reviews I see about the movie being to slow are clearly that mainstream voice. It's kind of funny that the people who love ""slow"" artsy movies have to get through the gory cannibalism and murder scenes. You can see how that can split audiences.The style reminds me of Quentin Tarantino in the sense that the art-house and exploitation genre are combined a little. The big difference between Ana Lily Amirpour and Tarantino is that Tarantino can catch that mainstream audience as well. If I knew more about why movies are successful I could tell you why, but I can't help but feel that it has something to do with the fact that this movie has a female director. At least fans of good movies will make this a cult movie, but I really think it deserves more.I cant wait for the next movie Ana Lily Amirpour makes.(9/10) Would recommend.",The Bad Batch

I want to vote it down, because I feel it was truly made to waste two hours of a person's life. It has a thinly constructed main plot line that never really goes anywhere and lacks the investment of time in character details that could have made the development of the overall film, much more interesting. The great thing about this movie? I fell asleep three times during it, and stayed asleep each time! Nor did I have much trouble going back to it either. I was literally that invested in the cinematic tapestry, and subtle hints of deeper story just waiting to be scratched. The film is quiet, surreal, and in many cases intricate and interesting, even if it lacks a central story arc worth the overall investment. And the fact that you can sleep to it? Not many films can offer that sort of peaceful bliss.",The Bad Batch
195,pmcjrw,Terribly underrated!,7,25 March 2020,"This is my first, and possibly only, review on IMDB. Felt I needed to come out in defense of this film which I regrettably put off watching for so long. There was initially two things that put me off after I'd seen A Girl Walks Home and wanted more Ana Lily Amirpour: cannibals and Jason Momoa's eyebrows (seriously, those things are straight out of a comic book). Anyway if you can get past a little gore and the f'd up concept of cannibalism this film is a worthy, bigger budget follow up to AGWHAAN. Suki Waterhouse creates an icon with the role, Keanu's character will come at you like a curveball, and everyone else is diggable yet understated.I love Amirpour's pacing and the breath she allows into films. To sum up, you get some dystopian sci-fi, a little horror, and a really good movie about compassion and heart. Watch this film, and keep The Dream alive!",The Bad Batch
196,ian_tully,"Worth a Watch, but with time to reflect on afterwards",8,17 January 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film up until the trip scene, my attention dipped in and out there. The day after watching it thinking back I felt it had interesting themes. I would recommend this to some one into art-house films similar to the likes of directors Harmony Korine. If you are used to Hollywood blockbusters its not for you, its pacing is slow and its one to think on rather than get immediate satisfaction.The film explores themes of normalization to violence, body image, Neotribalism, social outcasting, survivalist and more. There is no mass culture portrayed in the film but rather a mix of cultures where one is not prevalent over the other. I feel this portrays society today where subcultures such as Goth, Punk and Jock are dying out into very individualistic modes of culture. The character of Miami man displays this best as a bodybuilder listening to culture club who is a caring father, 
and an artist but yet is normalized to violence and is a cannibal. Die Antwoord play in our introduction to this character who I feel sum him up brilliantly with the similarities to ZEF culture.His character defies our social norms he has both good and bad traits which can be difficult for most people to relate to, but I feel that it paints a realistic character who has to get on with life in a dystopian world where realistically meat is not gonna be found in large masses in the desert. It is also worth noting the body image portrayed by Miami Mans tribe vs the other, is this due to their diet.Die Antwoord for me has a strong influence on this film not only in the reference to the band in Yellow shorts but also this ZEF culture. The main role is similar to that of Yolandi in her petite but strong portrayal.Jim Carey's character is great in this film, for an actor who is so outspoken, loud in films his character here is a total contrast, the real Jim Carey shines through in his posing for Miami Mans drawing. His role is small but works. I wasn't familiar with the actress playing Arlene and was fooled to think the actress was a real amputee at first. she carries a confused look throughout the film, which is what I feel makes her character work, she is trying to settle into a society where she doesnt have a place. I feel her reliance on Momoa at the end is one of survival, rather than love (which for me is a comment on real life relationships), but is also an understanding that Momoa has learned to fit in, in order to continue.overall great visuals and audio with some interesting themes and comments on society, great performance from lead role, I felt personally Reeves character didnt work. I would have liked to see a more less known actor for his role.",The Bad Batch

That misses the point entirely.From start to finish The Bad Batch is shot with such vision that I'm left firm in the conclusion, admittedly after some initial doubt, that this oddball of a film, is not so by mistake but by creation.Lacking the semblance of a cardboard cutout blockbuster in all but the cast, The Bad Batch wouldn't be out of place as a rolling feature in an art gallery darkroom.Kudos to Ana Lily Amirpour for having minerals to throw convention out the window and make this movie.

If you're saying it's bad for any other reason then I can respect that. In my opinion the movie is really good, I appreciate the movie's approach for less dialogue and more of a visual performance. Maybe what we should take from this film besides the cannibalism and violence but a picture of our society today. All we do today is talk, talk, talk, everyday people are just running their mouths.

Each scene lasts a lifetime without any dialog or anything being communicated in body language or anything. Nothing happens.In fact, I watched this on Netflix, and after a while just started clicking +10sec time after another (som maybe I am not entitled to review) and realized I didn't miss out on anything.There are so many questions raised like: Where do they get electricity? Where do they get water? How can they make noodles!?! Do the cannibals survive on just human flesh (and stay suffer super buffed at that)?The major question though is: How the hell do they expect us to believe that the main character actually fell in love with ""Miami Man"" (i.e. the man that ate her arm and leg)? I thought she acted as such in order to get close and kill him...but then just...end credits! What the...?! Whyyyyyyyy? Because of...muscles? Will there be a sequel where we realize she does this to kill him in his sleep and invite everyone for a Cannibal Thanksgiving feasting on him?The photo is pretty decent and it has its moments, as mentioned especially the first part.

She's in virtually every scene, and she holds her own. Admittedly I sought this movie out primarily because I'm a huge Keanu Reeves fan, and will essentially watch anything he's in, and sure he's in it...but not very much. There are many other famous faces too although you'd be hard pressed to recognize some...Jim Carrey, Diego Luna, Giovanni Ribisi, and not to forget Jason Mamoa (you can't miss him in this movie). Despite the cue of a cast...nothing much happens...a lot of filming of people in the desert, wind in hair, long uncut scenes with very little dialogue. Essentially a slow film, the soundtrack is what propels you through, and simply wanting to see how the story resolves.Not the worst 2 hours of my life...but probably won't watch again, nor would I really recommend it to others, unless you're a die hard Keanu completest like I am.",The Bad Batch

I don't own a television, so seeing movie promos for upcoming films is rare for me. Only by Googling sci-fi films did I stumble upon this one in someone's movie list. I'm so happy that I did! All I saw was that it was a futuristic film with cannibals in it...that was all I needed to see! I absolutely love to be surprised! And this one is a treasure! Each character was played wonderfully. I had no issue suspending disbelief. This must have been a project for the love it. I'm guessing by Keanu's work, these non mainstream shows are a passion for him, much like A Scanner Darkly. I loved that one, as well. I had no idea who would be in it and am always thrilled to see such phenomenal actors take on obscure roles. The Hermit's teeth were truly nasty! Well done on the costumes and effects. If you go through the movie and know that there's something familiar about a particular character but you just can't pinpoint it...that means the actor is doing a brilliant job...because you have no idea that it was someone notable until the credits roll. Jim Carrey was great! Giovanni Ribisi, though recognizable, did a great job being the local crackpot. Not a huge role, but he did it very well. Again, I think this was a project that they must have done for the love of it. I'll be looking at Ana Lily Amirpour's work more now. The story was fantastic. Granted, I would liked to have known a bit more back story, but that's what my imagination is for. The best films keep you thinking. I like Jason Momoa, as well. Seeing his softer expressions, like when he admitted he was lost, was tender and amazing. I don't go for the burly man dripping in muscle, but it suits him. It actually makes the vulnerability that he shows even more beautiful. Suki Waterhouse did a fine job in her role. Though I would liked to have seen a bit more variety in her emotions, however, her character would have to be tough to survive. You don't survive if you are weak. But still, a little more from her would have been nice, especially during the removal of limbs. The music choices were hysterical. The enormous muscle man on the scooter in search of his daughter, priceless! The matter of fact attitude they had to eating people as a means to survive, was interesting. It makes one think of what it, indeed, is like in that situation. It has happened in reality, it may happen again, who knows. Overall, a magnificent piece of work from everyone involved.

The symbols and references keep flowing through the entire movie, but they're always so shallow or obvious that they don't hit their goal.

Whilst relying less on an elaborate plot line and more on style and subtle moments, it does its job and it does it well. The thing about this film is that it's sort of difficult to describe, and that's meant in a good way. Again, organization is not it's strong suit. Emotional appeal, however, is something this one can provoke. Only having a few dialogues in the first 30 minutes of the movie, we gain more knowledge of what's going on in this desert wasteland from the visuals than anything else. This melancholy theme continues throughout, and what this does is make the dialogues just that much more juicy. I'll never forget when town lunatic Giovanni Ribisi goes around exclaiming of the one thing that you must never forget, and when asked by the main character what this one thing is, he tells her to ""figure it out yourself."" To me, this exemplifies the film altogether. Yes, the all-star cast will turn some into believers; but this is more than a movie.

It hasn't left my mind.This was a wildly addictive roller coaster ride! A truly breathtaking experience that had me unexpectedly laughing out loud at the very last scene. The slow parts went unnoticed to me because I spent most of that time lapping up the dry, desert landscape. The desert has always been a nightmare to me, symbolizing destitution and extreme survival-ism. When our heroine was released into the empty abyss in the very start, I felt overwhelmed with the feeling of not just desperation, but extreme isolation as well.I enjoyed how unpredictable this was. The storyline was basic, but enough to drive the movie forward and the characters too. Keanu Reeves really shined in this. Though he wasn't a huge character, whatever scenes he did have were brilliantly done. Momoa's presence was strong too, overshadowing Suki Waterhouse every time they were present together. I would have loved if there was more time between them to justify labeling it a love story. At the same time, with the direction the story ultimately took in the end, I think it wasn't her affection for the big guy that pushed her to do what she did, but the human basic instinct of wandering that did.We are all wanderers, and yet we live our lives trapped in one fixed point to survive one day after the next. I felt this movie highlighted that when Waterhouse took refuge in Comfort, yet couldn't stop herself from wandering out every so often. I truly enjoyed every character on screen. Jim Carrey was on point! I loved that he too was a wanderer, moving from one point to the next.Without giving it away, I am happy with how it ended. Though there were plot holes, I didn't let them deter my experience in the slightest. I know this film is not your typical mainstream film, and it will be lost on most of the viewership, but give it a try and decide for yourself! Sometimes odd is good!",The Bad Batch

245,Amelilie,Unpopular opinion: it's good ^^,7,25 May 2020,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.
It's not as fast paced as most movies are these days, but I never felt bored while watching.
Also I guess that some people thought that the storyline just wasn't really there but I think the Regisseur knew what she wanted:
It feels like the Main Charakter is drifting, not really knowing where to go and that's exactly how we as the viewers should feel. We can not see how everything will turn out and the Charakter we are following can't as well.
So I think the unusual pace and unnormal storytelling adds to the movies feel in a good way and puts us in the shoes of the maincharakter.
The movie doesn't do any explaining and we don't understand everything that's going on. Because of this it feels like we are guests to a small part of the Charakters life's, leaving when the film ends. And since their lifes aren't finished yet the story might not feel finished for the viewers as well.In conclusion: I really liked the feel of the movie and the Charakters.
But it really isn't a usual movie, with typical Charakters or a storypace we are used to, so if you are looking for that you won't like it.",The Bad Batch

Or do they have new money cause I saw a guy not beeing able to pay 1 dollar and the hermit guy ( Jim Carrey!! Did not see that one!) used a bunch of 10 dollar bills to light up a fire..and there are tons of them left, I just want to know!!I woke up this morning with all these questions...but mostly I wonder how it will end for the the brutal man-eating man and the girl that was the dinner once.

265,psull48,Does the (female) director hate women?,1,28 December 2017,"First, I am NOT a feminist, in fact, I cannot stand modern-day feminism. Just making that clear right now. And having said that, this movie literally offended me because of how many (negative) female tropes the main character was guilty of.(spoilers)The main (female) character:1.) Immediately gets captured and exploited -- a trope, because women are weak, I guess. She loses two limbs. As a trope, this didn't bother me so much because it could've happened to anyone in her situation if they had no way to hide or defend themselves, but I'm still including it because of everything else that happened afterward.2.) Is spoiled and never happy. Even after being rescued and brought to a safe place by Jim Carrey, she decides to wander back out towards the place where she got her limbs cut off. Spoiled brat trope. Cool.3.) She uses the bait of sex to steal something from a wealthy and powerful man, who, honestly, didn't do much wrong. Keanu took the lost girl, which could be viewed as wrong yes, but the girl WAS lost and without a guardian at the time. Yes, the main character's goal WAS to retrieve the girl back from Keanu, but could she not have maybe simply ASKED him before resorting to using the ol' seduce-and-betray trope? Oh, and the only reason Keanu was able to take ownership of the lost girl in the first place was... number 4...4.) Our ""heroine"" took this little girl (she's basically her guardian at that point in the movie), to a RAVE. That's bad enough on its own. Then, she willingly ingested hallucinogens and started tripping out instead of watching her kid. (She could have spit out the drugs if she was only worried about being accepted by the townspeople of Comfort. Or maybe, you know, just don't go to the rave at all if you've made the decision to be a parent.) So, she's a bad mother too. Another trope. Nice!5.) Our heroine is also a brainless ditz. She has no purpose or goals and her morals change on a whim. She's a complete idiot. Another female trope -- the braindead bimbo.6.) Here's the kicker: (After stealing something from the stable, wealthy man, Keanu,) she ends up falling for the bad boy. The bad boy, being, one of the cannibals that participated in the feast of eating her arm and leg in the beginning of the movie. I couldn't make that up. So she's a brainless bimbo who falls for an abusive meathead who has no moral issues with killing and eating other human beings. Because women are irresistibly attracted to abusive men. Whoooo!Keep in mind the writer/director is female.If this was a comedy or some kind of ""ironic"" movie that's meant to show the absurdity of certain tropes, then things would be different, but the movie presents itself as 100% serious, intelligent and thought-provoking.I haven't even discussed the plot yet. And I would gladly discuss the plot, if there was one.If you're looking for a decent (well, ""decent"" in terms of Netflix movies) post-apoc movie with a female lead, try ""The Last Survivors"".

Much like your fat body is what makes u look fat and not the dress ('you', in a general sense), it's just plain a bad movie. Age has zero to do with it, taste however is a factor.

I could tell that some members wanted sex scenes and other strong imagery but I think it was not necessary. The movie delivers its messages even with a minimal script.

279,keith-benoit,"Good opening, then limps to nowhere",1,14 October 2017,"Jim Carrey is uncredited. I wondered why. Then I watched the movie.Thing is, I watched the first 20 minutes, then put it aside, thinking that my wife's sister's family, who are fans of edgy cinema and were soon to visit us, would be down for an aprés apocalypse mindfock like this.They, like me, enjoyed the first 20 minutes. Hardly any dialogue (in a good way), some nice directorial flourishes, a more than adequate set up. Lots of promise. A good skeleton on which to put some meat.A young woman is banished to a lawless territory in the desert, is kidnapped by what turns out to be a community of iron-pumping cannibals, has an arm and a leg amputated (and her wounds cauterized, presumably so that the rest of her can also be eaten or, you know, otherwise put to use), then manages to free herself and find her way to a place called Comfort where the people eat noodles and chicken instead.I assumed what would follow would be a story of revenge and rescue, the goodies of Comfort taking down the baddies at the Venice Beach barbecue, maybe with some explanation as to how the people of Comfort get access to gasoline, photocopiers, rice noodles and all the recreational pharma you could hope for. (My guess was that there would be some connection to a group outside the lawless land, perhaps some sort of probably not-so-kosher arrangement between Keanu Reeves's Jim Jones knockoff and his inworld suppliers.)No answers came. None.Despite a severe underbite, Jim Carrey managed to chew what little scenery there was and he was still the best thing in the film by a long walk. The moment he hands Momoa a snowglobe was when I knew I wasn't coming back. The movie had left me in my own offworld without a clue where I was going or what would happen to me when I got there.Loooong story short, the girl falls in love with Momoa's Atkins aficionado after eating some Guatemalan insanity peppers and tripping out like she ate a bad oatmeal cookie at a Grateful Dead concert.There's some other stuff. A kid who likes spaghetti elbows more than actual elbows and who cries when her Daddy and her new stepmom eat her pet rabbit; a homeless philosopher dude played by Ribisi, channeling an amalgam of all those fidgety weirdos that Brad Pitt used to play; and almost no dialogue not spoken by Reeves, whose explanation of where his dookie go goes on for about nine minutes.But it is bad enough to be a fun watch with friends who like movies made without scripts by people who can't make a movie without a script. Which is most people.Seriously, I want to know the backstory to this debacle. My guess: Super-talented young director makes great movie, gets noticed, then gets one of those bags with the two dollar signs on it and access to Harvey Weinstein's rolodex while he's in the bath. But the movie has to be made in 10 days because Jim has a showing of his larger canvases at a gallery where people will hand him bags with two dollar signs on them because he's Jim Carrey, not because he's actually a talented sculptor and painter.Or Jim shook the snowglobe and handed it to the director, saying (with only his eyes), ""Before the snow has settled within, the script must be written.""",The Bad Batch

294,nikolalicko,Very interesting movie,8,16 July 2017,"A very interesting movie that at first glance seems boring, but it needs to look a little deeper into things. For example, today's trend is everywhere in the world that people exercise bodybuilding, and as the main source of protein is meat, so we begin to look like cannibals. Everyone is strong, enjoying music, and only ""meat"" is important. On the other hand, there are those who are weaker and injured by bodybuilders, which in real life manifests as if they are not handsome, but they are nevertheless complex and have some kind of entertainment. And there is also a love story that connects incompatible, which tells us that physical appearance is not important in life, but what someone does for us - for us. The saying ""never say never"" is present here and this is seen by a girl who wanted to hurt Miami Man first, but later fell in love with him. Although the world is a desert and a deserted world, there is hope for them, and they will never be handed over at the price of everything, while in the real world it is increasingly important for us, for example, of material things (whether the guy has a car, apartment, and of course money) After that follows something (feeling).This is my view of the film, which is a bit boring, but when we look a little better about the things in the movie and we alter the reality and sadness we will see a lot of similarities and a lot of educational things.",The Bad Batch

You keep watching because of tantalizing bits and pieces... and that cast. But almost every single scene designed to capture your attention does ONLY just that. Some gruesome, some desperate, some eccentric, some cool music. So, you find yourself unable to stop watching, thinking it HAS to start fulfilling it's apparent promise, yet it never does. Momoa is his usual awesome sight, but produces this odd ""Cuban"" accent. Keanu's impact is in name-on-marquee only. The movie has an interesting dynamic going on, with insiders that were outcasts, and outsiders that were outcasts, but their juxtaposition is never clearly defined.",The Bad Batch

I guess we are supposed to read the screenwriters mind. I have more questions than answers after the credits role. Matter of fact who wrote this. If I did someone like what he did to her what he did to ...smh and then .. really. I thought this movie was going to good since I saw Aquaman in the trailer. Aquaman in this movie suck.

I really loved the cinematic combined with excellent music! This movie really kept me interested all along even though the plot was a little bit slow (but in my opinion everything blended perfectly).. The way the script was written and directed, brilliant acting... not much words needed to be said whereas movie scenes talk on their own! Lots of emotions were generated throughout the movie. Personally I think it was a brilliant movie and something different from what I have seen till now. That's my first review I ever wrote on internet for a movie. Personally I was a little disturbed from the low rating that this movie has earned and driven to write a whole review on my own. In the end it's important not to judge a book by its cover but have your own experience with it! So if you watch it I hope you enjoy as much as I did!",The Bad Batch

304,zenoian,Details... A bit more definition to story would have elevated it greatly.,3,30 September 2017,"This review contains a small spoiler. The script was weak and without clear center. Coupled with the direction, It lacked a clarity of what if any the desert society's moral or ethical base base might be. Given that the environment is a part of the story, I felt it was under emphasized. The direction and shooting of the main characters emotional content was good, The directer did establish 'connection' with the characters. I felt the interplay of the characters themselves could have been better. I attribute that the the script. Suki Waterhouse did a great job for the material she had, i.e. words put in her mouth, or lack thereof. She was very good given the limitation of a less than developed script. She displayed the subtext of emotion well. But a few words more would have elevated the part. Jason Mamoa,I thought did a first rate job. He is very adept as the dangerous giant, who even as he carries an aura of death, silently so beautifully conveys complex and deep emotion, even compassion. Keanu Reeves played the philosophic opportunist who rationalizes his existence and flexible morality with an air of caring, yet a deceptively dangerous indifference.One flaw sticks out. Alert, this may be a spoiler. There is a scene where three characters sit around a fire cooking and eating the evening meal. The fire ring, is common to all of us. Some stones stacked in a circle ring, and the fire burns within. What is wrong with that? Well, they were sitting in the mid of what appeared to be a salt flat, or dry lake. Flat for hundreds of yards. No foliage close, no wood. Jason Mamoa, a girl with one arm, and a kid? Who will carry wood for a fire, and gather heavy stones? Sitting in mid dry flat, not a sprig within reach? Nope.",The Bad Batch
305,animaniac-78152,Unreal... seriously... Why?,1,20 October 2017,"OK, first let me say I am a fan off off beat cult type artistic movies. No matter who rates what I will still see it for myself and come up with my own opinion. (I wish I could suggest you do the same here)That all said, this movie is one long drawn out, slow, Lost show style plot (if that), striving to be artistic and moving and... just... doesn't get there... ever... not even close.A friend said I should watch this movie. I want to slap him and never trust anything he says ever again. Usually I would say, a movie has some redeeming qualities some place... this one is totally void of any.So, you probably already read the layout of what happens, so I wont rehash that here. Let me say that I can 100% agree with their reviews. Entirely agree. Someone said there was drama, and murder and all that... yeah... murder yes. Painfully so... but the drama...? And the person who filmed this movie seemed to love focusing the camera needlessly on the rear end of Suki Waterhouse. Not that it's a bad rear end. However, just about every scene is focused there and I almost half waited for the missing dialogue in the film to come out of it... Cast Away was better at limited dialogue than this film by a long shot, say Galaxy wide long shot.Just save yourself the time. If you really want to see it for the train wreck it is, be my guest, but consider yourself warned. It's really really... REALLY boring, slow, pointless and VERY Bad. Seriously bad.",The Bad Batch

Visually it's a masterpiece but severely lacking in the plot department.The first 20 minutes are by far the strongest, the rest of the film has strong moments but sadly the plot is sparse and the message mixed.It's trying to make allegories & metaphors but sadly they don't land very well.Would recommend for visuals & music alone, with interesting performances.
