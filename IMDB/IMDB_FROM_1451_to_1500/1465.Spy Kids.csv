0,TheLittleSongbird,"Funny, intelligent and creative-very underrated",8,18 November 2009,"I really liked Spy Kids. I thought it was a very entertaining film, without taking itself too seriously. It was funny, intelligent and creative. What I mean by that, is that there is something for adults and older children as well as young kids. There was a fun script, that was intelligent and funny without being too artificial, and the direction from Robert Rodriguez was surprisingly effective. The plot is original, the thumb people were great fun, the action was fast-paced, the scenery was lovely and the special effects and stunts are splendid. And the soundtrack was awesome. The acting was very good, with Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara spirited in the two leads and their constant bickering was a delight. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino have fun as the parents, while Alan Cumming and Tony Shalhoub come close to stealing the film as Floop and Minion. The film also has a nice message; my only complaints are the rather over-emphasised ending, and I did feel that Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo didn't have enough screen time to shine properly but I did enjoy their brief appearances. All in all, a very underrated and fun movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Spy Kids
1,Leofwine_draca,Disappointingly childish,4,11 January 2018,"SPY KIDS is a film franchise that I never had any experience of before now. I've just watched the first film for the first time some seventeen years after it was released, and I'm afraid I didn't enjoy the experience. This is a silly, dumbed-down children's film featuring over the top performances from the adult actors and a whole variety of shoddy CGI effects work which looks extremely fake when witnessed in the modern day. The child actors are just about passable, but Alan Cumming, Antonio Banderas, and Carla Gugino all seem to struggle with the material and come off looking very silly as a result. The sci-fi storyline is about an army of robot kids but never really goes anywhere, instead churning out the usual cliches over and over again. Genuine actors like Danny Trejo and Robert Patrick are wasted in their parts. I can only hope it gets better from here on in.",Spy Kids
2,SnoopyStyle,fun wacky kids' movie,7,16 February 2015,"Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid Cortez (Carla Gugino) are the greatest spies who retire to be simple consultants once they started a family. Their children Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) think their parents are boring. Gregorio is annoyed by the children's TV show ""Floop's Fooglies"" and investigates its host Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). He turns out to be a villain evil inventor. His latest evil invention with Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub) are kid robots. However the robots have no brains and Floop is after the Third Brain. He's been kidnapping OSS agents and captures the Cortezes. Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin) reveals himself not to be the kids' uncle. He tells them the truth and sends them to the safe house. OSS agent Ms. Gradenko (Teri Hatcher) arrives but she turns out to be a double agent. The robots take the Third Brain and the kids seek out Machete (Danny Trejo) for help who turns out to be their father's older brother.Director Robert Rodriguez has infused this kids' movie with wacky visuals and crazy gadgets. It's all outlandish fun. The adult actors are all top shelf with many Rodriguez alumni. The trick of this movie are the kids. They're likable enough. Their characters are combative siblings but Rodriguez makes sure that they show their love for each other every once in awhile.",Spy Kids
3,jboothmillard,Spy Kids,5,6 January 2008,"I had seen quite a few trailers of this film from director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City), and I suppose it was necessary to try it. Basically Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) are two great secret agents: masters of disguise, inventors of high-tech gadgetry, and able to stop a war. They are on opposite sides though, and when they finally come face to face, they fall in love, and embark on their most dangerous mission: raising a family. Nine years later, after retirement, they have children, son Juni (Daryl Sabara) and daughter Carmen (Alexa Vega), but they are called back in to action, and one by one, their spy colleagues are disappearing. The unthinkable happens though, they disappear, and the only person who can rescue them are the kids! The villain seems to be Juni's TV favourite, Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming), but it is really his egg-headed Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub) who has created the race of thumb monster things, and brainless identical robots (including his own Juni and Carmen). Also starring Teri Hatcher as Ms. Gradenko, Richard 'Cheech' Marin as Felix Gumm, Danny Trejo as Isidoro 'Machete' Cortez, Robert Patrick as Mr. Lisp, Beavis and Butt-Head creator Mike Judge as Donnagon/Donnamight, Richard Linklater (director of School of Rock) as Cool Spy and a cameo by George Clooney as Devlin. The special effects were quite good, and the kids will obviously like this film, but I just found it corny most of the time, but a good film. It was number 90 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Worth watching!",Spy Kids
4,ccthemovieman-1,A Boost For The 'Family Unit',8,14 August 2006,"This was a silly kids' adventure story but still fun the younger ones and for adults, thanks to colorful scenes, great special effects, decent humor and a nice family tone to it. The kids are alright, except the girl is a little bossy, and the villains aren't too nasty. This also looks very good on DVD.Included in the color and characters are ""the thumb people"" who were especially fun to watch.The only problem I found with it is the last 30 minutes in which it got too silly and emphasized (typical Hollywood) how the kids can do the job better than the adults, which a ludicrous film cliché. However, overall ""family unity"" gets a big boost in this here, even in the end, and that good message is probably a big reason this movie was such a success.",Spy Kids
5,BA_Harrison,You can keep your Nimbus 2000: I'd rather have a jet pack any day of the week.,8,25 April 2010,"Forget about discovering that your parents were a pair of weirdo wizards (yawn!): in Spy Kids, Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) and her younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara) find out that their mum and dad are ex-secret agents, which is a whole lot cooler in my book (I guess being raised on James Bond films might have affected my opinion somewhat). This means that when Mr and Mrs Cortez (suave Antonio Banderas and yummy Carla Gugino) are captured by criminals intent on taking over the world with an army of robot children, it's up to the kids to save the day, equipped with all sorts of ultra-cool, high-tech gadgetry supplied by their uncle Machete (Danny Trejo).Pure, unadulterated slam-bang craziness from the warped mind of Robert Rodriguez, Spy Kids is cool, action packed fun for the whole family —perfect entertainment for a rainy Sunday afternoon on the sofa with the children. There's constant kiddy-centric action loaded with inventive visuals, weird creatures and snazzy special effects galore, guaranteed to keep the sprogs glued to the screen from start to finish, whilst easy-on-the-eye couple Banderas and Gugino are there to give the adults something to get excited about too.",Spy Kids
6,Quinoa1984,At a crossroads,7,2 April 2001,"Robert Rodriguez writes, edits, co-produces, co-composes and directs this action fable about a couple of kids who unbeknownst to them have parents who are spies.  However, the parents are kidnapped and it is only up to the kids to save them.  The film has colorful visuals, fun action (not too violent) and is overall a good family film.  BUT, the film is at a cross with me because Rodriguez has made some of the classic action films of the 90's (El Mariachi, Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn), and it seems strange to me that he feels he has to take this step (kids probably).  Not that I'm putting down his creative visual state for this movie, but when a name like Rodriguez comes up, and is as infamous with 90's indie like Tarantino and Smith, there's a bit of sadness.  So while I do reccomend this film to kids and maybe even parents, the director's hard-core audience (which includes me partially) will be a tad dissapointed.  Stars from previous Rodriguez films come in to play including Marin (who only has one role this time), Trejo (who actually talks, though this role tarnishes his knife man role in Depserado, Banderas who stars as the father, and George Clooney at the end (but no Salma Hayek!).

7,sunwarrior13,Kids As Spies,10,31 March 2015,"Spy Kids is a family film that tells the story of 12-year-old Carmen Cortez and her younger 9-year-old brother Juni Cortez.They are two greatest child secret agents in the world that are known for abilities such as masters of disguise,ability to invent various things and the ability to prevent wars.Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara stars together with Antonio Banderas,Carla Gugino,Alan Cumming,Teri Hatcher,Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo.It was written and directed by Robert Rodriguez.It is the first installment in the Spy Kids series.This definitely provides a lot of joy and entertainment for the film's intended audience as we get to see young lead stars fulfill many of the children's dream of working as spies in lieu with the terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States during its year of release.While the visual effects maybe considered far from standard as of today,it would still be proper to say that it definitely helped the young audience to enjoy it back then.Finally,this will definitely provides lots of fun as a family film and expecting something not silly will surely disappoint many who aren't expecting any.",Spy Kids
8,studioAT,The first and best Spy Kids film,4,26 April 2015,"I loved this film as a kid and wanted to go back and watch it again to spot all the moments I enjoyed first time around.I think all these years later the film still holds up as a bitter than average family film. I don't think the director needed to stretch it out to be a trilogy (or add the very poor fourth entry many years later)but that's another matter.The two lead kids play the parts well and have a good dynamic between them and Antonio Banderas/Carla Gugino are good support as the parents.Watching it back now though I think it does have some slow parts and the technology looks a bit dated compared to what we're used to today, but Spy Kids 1 still remains a quality film for all the family.",Spy Kids
9,Theo Robertson,Entertaining Enough Despite The Flaws,5,6 October 2003,"Director Robert Rodriguez once said in an interview "" You never know what to expect in a Robert Rodriguez movie "" . I beg to differ . DESPERADO and the rather over rated FROM DUSK TILL DAWN were almost live action comic strips as was THE FACULTY so guess what SPY KIDS resembles ? That`s right , it`s a live action comic strip . Mind you both DESPARADO and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN were both rightly awarded 18 certificates while THE FACULTY was a 15 cert and SPY KIDS is a U certificate so despite having a similar style his movies are targetted to widely different audiencesAs I said SPY KIDS is very much a live action comic strip with two kids , Carmen and Juni , trying to rescue their parents from a evil TV host played by Alan Cummings . The movie does have a problem and that`s that the plot is wafer thin and in many places the plot seems to have gone AWOL all together as the film descends into a series of set pieces almost always involving a chase sequence , but to give it credit SPY KIDS never takes itself seriously so therefore never comes across as patronizing which is a nice antidote to the hidously over hyped Harry Potter movie which came out a couple of months later",Spy Kids
10,preppy-3,Great family film,8,25 June 2003,"Retired secret agents (Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino) are reluctantly called back into service when an evil mastermind (Alan Cumming) threatens to take over the world. When they're captured it's up to their young kids (Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara) to save them.Turn off your brain and enjoy! Director Robert Rodriguez (who has previously done just violent R-rated movies) turns out a picture that will appeal to adults and children equally. The story moves at a lightning pace, the special effects are just unbelievable and the story and action never gets bloody or too violent. I assume the PG is for one minor swear word.The acting varies. No one is really bad. Vega and Sabara are just OK but they act like real kids and, most importantly, like a real brother and sister. You believe these two are related. Banderas, Cumming and Gugino are exceptional. They play the movie in a perfect light-hearted way--never taking anything too seriously and enjoying themselves all the way. There are also amusing performances by Teri Hatcher (looking fantastic), Robert Patrick (looking good too) and George Clooney (!!!). Basically a fun, fast, enjoyable family film which also teaches kids about believing in themselves without getting too preachy. Well worth seeing. Can't wait to see the sequels!",Spy Kids
11,zardoz-13,"A superbly made, larger-than-life ""Wizard of Oz"" with gadgets galore that celebrates family values",9,11 July 2007,"The pint-sized protagonists in ""Sky Kids"" do the darnedest things to save their imperiled parents from a mad scientist and his indestructible army of android urchins. This far- fetched, fast-paced, family-friendly fare fuses over-the-top 007 action sequences with childhood classics like ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" Surprisingly, writer & director Robert Rodriguez's whimsically eccentric but warmly entertaining comedy thriller doesn't pander with the usual lowest common denominator humor and histrionics. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara behave neither like obnoxious ragamuffins nor precocious brats. Rodriguez forgoes the farce of the ""Home Alone"" movies and the flatulence of ""See Spot Run."" Instead, he treats us to a yarn as wholly innocent as it is implausibly outlandish. Not only does ""Spy Kids"" qualify as a must-see for twelve-year-olds, but also Rodriguez has revamped the kids' action movie genre with style to spare! ""Spy Kids"" unfolds in the near future. Espionage agents have replaced armies, and Gregorio (Antonio Banderas of ""Desperado"") and Ingrid (Carla Gugino of ""Snake Eyes"") are the best. As spies on opposite sides, they receive orders to kill each other. Ironically, they fall in love, resign, marry, and raise two elementary school age children: Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara). Now, our ex-spies serve strictly as ""consultants,"" until several secret agents vanish without a trace. Gregorio launches a search, and Ingrid accompanies him. No sooner have they entrusted their kids to Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin ""Up In Smoke"") than chief villain Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) traps our adult duo. Fegan Floop masquerades as a loopy ""Willy Wonka"" type villain with his own popular children's TV show called ""Floop's Fooglies."" Imagine Pee-Wee Herman on the prowl. Floop operates from an offshore castle shaped like an old battered boot with a candelabrum of Disney-like towers sprouting from it. Floop kidnapped those secret agents and mutated them into bizarre circus freak characters. Behind the scenes, Floop and Dr. Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub of ""Monk"") scheme to replace the children of celebrities and world leaders with robotic clones. Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick of ""Terminator 2"") wants to buy them, so he can dominate the world. Dastardly Floop sends agents after Carmen and Juni, but the siblings elude his Thumb henchmen. Literally, these guys are all thumbs: thumbs for heads, hands, and legs. Carmen and Juni fill their parents' shoes and thwart evil.Director Robert Rodriguez, whose credits include ""Desperado,"" ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" ""Four Rooms,"" ""Road Racers,"" and ""The Faculty,"" has come a long way since 1992's ""El Mariachi."" Typically, he saturates his sagas with buckets of blood & gore, so watching the sanitary PG-rated ""Spy Kids"" comes as quite a revelation. Aside from an occasional outburst of violence, ""Spy Kids"" poses as little a threat as a ""Barney"" episode. Nevertheless, Rodriguez stages these melodramatics with such skillful cinematic virtuosity that you find yourself sucked in by the momentum of the action. Indeed, ""Spy Kids"" qualifies as a superbly made, larger-than-life ""Wizard of Oz"" with gadgets galore that celebrates family values.",Spy Kids
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Good film, especially for what it is",7,11 March 2006,"This is a somewhat unusual film; it's a children's film, but it doesn't talk down to its audience. And as an added bonus, it can be watched even if you are over ten. As the far too little-known short Bedhead, Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children, featuring children... which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess. Adults often forget what children are like, and think of them as 'less' than the grownups. Rodriguez gives them(and us) a film that allows them a similar status to adults. The film has stuff that will appeal to kids(spy equipment hidden in children's things) but it isn't offensive to us who aren't. While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion, it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion. The plot is pretty good, though I guess it's not all that original... and as usual with children's films, the kids are the heroes, which puts too much pressure on them, as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it. The acting is a usual high(as most of the actors are quite talented), no performances really let you down, even the (intentionally)overplayed ones. The characters, many of them fairly clichéd and thin, are all credible. As with many(most) Rodriguez films, pretty much all of those that he's written, himself... there are subplots and such, many of which are either overly easily resolved or not properly addressed. The humor is pretty good, I laughed out loud several points, rather unusual for children's films, and I was never insulted by the humor. None of it tries too hard to garner laughs, either. The special effects are quite impressive, and though it's still evident that it's Rodriguez' mini studio, it will fool you for the very most part. The action is quite intense and exciting, and like the humor, it's got Rodriguez' unique touch. Any fan of Rodriguez(such as myself, which is by far the main reason I watched this very film in the first place) will enjoy this, if maybe not to the same extent as one of his typical films. I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez or any of the actors, and definitely most kids. Very much worth watching, even if you've outgrown childhood. Indulge your inner kid. 7/10",Spy Kids
13,anaconda-40658,Rodriguez Goes Youth.,9,25 May 2015,"Spy Kids (2001): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alan Cumming, Tony Shalhoub, Richard Cheech Marin: Wonderfully inventive and exhilarating experience for families. It is about little people doing big things. The special effects are totally creative with a story that is straight forward but a lot of fun. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are captured spies by an entertainer who mutates spies as props for his show. Gugino tells of the two spies who were suppose to eliminate each other but ultimately fell in love instead. Their children catch on quickly when villains that resemble thumbs search for a device called the Third Brain. Alan Cumming plays a villain who desires to take over the world using robotic children and the third brain is needed. Director Robert Rodriguez outdoes himself here with inventive visuals and creative gimmicks. This is a far stretch from the gory horror films he is known for such as From Dusk Till Dawn and The Faculty. Banderas and Gugino are a wonderful pairing with Alan Cumming on target as the entertainer. Tony Shalhoub plays the scheming villain. Richard Cheech Marin is an amusing edition as an uncle who is in on the big parental secret. The third act is mainly numerous action sequences that present cartoon style violence and predictable results. Otherwise this is a challenging family friendly visual delight. Score: 9 / 10",Spy Kids
14,StevePulaski,Limitless ideas handled brilliantly,8,11 August 2011,"Spy Kids is a special kind of family film that will please adults and children alike. What a rarity. I critique family films by judging if both the parent and the child will enjoy seeing the film. The parents buy the movie or the ticket for the kids, so they should both be provided with entertainment.Director Robert Rodriguez is all about special effects. So it comes as no surprise that Spy Kids relies heavily on technology. If Rodriguez had made this in the late eighties or early nineties, it would get more of a reputation as a cheesy, low budget picture, and wouldn't be remembered today in the hearts of many adolescents. If the first film would be made in 2011, we'd get the creepy hybrid of motion capture-like animation for most of this, most likely. So it's nice to see Spy Kids was made just in the nic of time when technology could produce such a fun, original picture.The story is about two youngsters, Carmen (Vega) and Juni (Sabara), whose parents (Banderas and Gugino) are undercover spies. They don't know their parents are spies, but after staying with their ""Uncle"" Felix (Marin), he tells them about their parents during an emergency, and sends both of them off to rescue their parents from an evil TV show host named Fegan Floop (Cumming).Spy Kids is only limited by the imagination from Robert Rodriguez head. My favorite scene is when Carmen and Juni are speeding on what resembles a water jet-ski pod (I'm just guessing, I really don't think Rodriguez knew what he was coming up with either), and evading the ninjas by just half a second. Something about that made me think back to when I was a kid, on my bed (or my spaceship) rolling around fighting imaginary bad guys.The CGI works, but it's flawed when it comes to the thumb creatures. The thumbs look blocky, and not very life-like. Not like anything is, but this picture was flowing perfectly up until the ""thumb thumbs"" came in. They are just assembled awkwardly, and lack animation. I was actually hoping two would go to war with each other if you know what I mean.The two leads are fairly decent actors, not perfect, but they have some time to practice, and I think these films are good places to start. The storyline was the least of my concerns, I just wanted good-humored, little to non-violent fun, and Spy Kids works. Its charm springs from the fact that it is just a kid's film, and it doesn't worry that it is being too unrealistic. It's meant to be that way.Starring: Alex Vega, Daryl Sabara, Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Cheech Marin, and Danny Trejo. Directed by: Robert Rodriguez.",Spy Kids
15,g-bodyl,Pretty Good!,8,6 December 2010,"I thought Spy Kids was a pretty cool movie to watch. I did not expect much of it at first but I'm glad I saw it because I really enjoyed it. This was not the bad movie that I had anticipated. I even liked the sequel to this movie.This is about very young spies who are on a mission to save the United States, of course.The cast is pretty much an all-star cast. The spies played by Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara are pretty good. The parents played by Antonio Banderas and Carlos Gugino are wonderful.Overall, this is a good piece of work. I also like to mention that some of these gadgets are cool. I rate this film 8/10.",Spy Kids

18,johnnyboyz,"Little more than a good crack, perhaps a tad more if you're the right audience; Rodriguez's film is a colourful but ultimately underwhelming romp.",5,9 May 2011,"Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids is a perfectly rounded, perfectly harmless adventure film; a piece that will no doubt play to an audience consisting of parents of whatever age whom happen to have kids around about similar ages to that of what the kids characters therein are. Feeding off of two separate strands, children will no doubt be consumed in the undying pleasures one equilibrium offers when two infants, one male and one female but brother and sister all the same, bicker and argue with each other as they journey on the adventure of a lifetime; essentially undertaking a quest which will see them strive to save the day and do the grown-ups a favour for a change in bailing them out of the trouble they get themselves in. The scenes and sequences are harmless enough for youngsters to enjoy and brief and charming enough for the adults seeing it with their kids to enjoy; the second strand consisting of the grown ups ambling along with parental life and cracking tired ""Oh, aren't we both getting old!"" gags which will no doubt induce grins onto that of the faces of thirty-something mums-and-dads watching on with an arm around each other and one of their two tots on either side of them.The problem being, and if like me, you land somewhere in the middle of all of this demographic pandering as a non-child whom isn't a parent and doesn't have any kids, chances are Spy Kids will be a bit of a chore; a film whose success rate in this case relies on it being an interesting and engaging enough adventure piece, something it isn't necessarily and thus doesn't quite pull through; a piece bordering on that of a monumental drag as it shuffles along doing its best to encompass people from better films that you've probably seen – by the end, I was having more fun mentally ticking off those whom had before worked with the aforementioned Rodriguez and were present here than I did from the film itself. For the Folks: if your kids answer you correctly after having turned to them post-credits in order to offer them a pop-quiz on what the only other film George Clooney and Robert Rodriguez had previously worked together on, chances are you're a pretty irresponsible parent.Joking aside, the film does offer up a meek if somewhat interesting study on how to utilise teamwork and one's skills for that of good, honest and upstanding means yadda,yadda, yadda; the film effectively a tale about two nippers seemingly at war with each other coming together to foil a common enemy through hard work, dedication and working together explored in a manner which is a bit better than dull but not really as good as 'slightly interesting' - although it is done so in a rapid, punchy manner tots will enjoy. Where the kids have what is for them, everybody else will observe the ridiculously photogenic parents of the two titular Spy Kids in Antonio Banderas' Gregorio and Carla Gugino's Ingrid Cortez, respectively; two people living a seemingly normal life (whatever 'normal' constitutes in this film) in an isolated cliff-top villa hiding out as retired spies now trying to function as office workers and keeping their previous incarnations private from their offspring.Those kids are Carmen (Vega) and the younger Juni (Sabara), two more often than not at each others' throats in that innocent enough way brothers and sisters this age usually are; Juni's existence somewhat lowlier than Carmen's in that he appears weak and is easily victimised, sports warts on his hands and is disenchanted with school life. His escape from this life is that of the transporting of himself into that of the world of television; specifically, a show headed up by Alan Cumming's suitably nasty and suitably sadistic, but wholly within the boundaries of the film, Fegan Floop; a man with a colourful and joyous TV show featuring all manner of wacky characters; sets and ideas.These circles of characters will come to integrate with one another much more later on; Floop's surface existence masking something more underneath running parallel, when he's later revealed as essentially that of an arms-dealer, with that of Carmen and Juni's parents whom additionally subscribe to a cloaked living that is similar only in nature. The catalyst which kick-starts the titular kids' adventure out into the unknown; a journey encompassing the learning to co-exist with one another; the realisation of what it means to take on certain responsibilities and Juni's own realisation of the true meaning of Floop's show, which he holds so dear to him, occurs when parents Gergorio and Ingrid are swiped by an unknown quantity. From here, surprises and revelations whisk the pair off on an espionage and action imbued adventure featuring bad guys; double crosses; sordid plots and a lot of humour revolving around fully grown adults falling down. Where it's easy to sneer, and boy is it easy to sneer at Spy Kids, it is on the other hand difficult to get as excited about as one would have liked; Rodriguez demonstrating a knack for completely shifting gears and coming up with a piece acceptable to all ages which isn't exceptional but is a long way from woeful.Who knows? Like somebody whose introduction to Brian de Palma was in the shape of 1996's Mission: Impossible as however young I was; maybe, in years to come, youngsters whom saw this with their folks and have such happy memories of it will discover what else Rodriguez has to offer, before quietly exclaiming that they find it hard to believe such a film here was even made by the man – let alone was their introduction to his back-catalogue of which they've come to really admire. The world works in strange ways.",Spy Kids
19,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Silly, surreal fun",7,11 January 2016,"Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids has a very special significance for me: it's the first movie I ever saw in theatres, and therefore left quite an impression on me. It has loads of Rodriguez's trademark imagination and vision, as well as a stacked cast and a whimsical sense of adventure that makes it a super charged Saturday morning cartoon style bucket of fun. Rodriguez makes two types of films: shamelessly violent, over the top, bloody genre fun, and family orientated sci fi/fantasy for kids. He fares better in the former, as this is really the only good one in the secondary category. The sequels are trash, and I don't know what he was thinking with Sharkboy and Lava Girl, but with this one his filmmaking skill and passion for the craft work its charm and provide a wonderful experience. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play youngsters Carmen and Juni Cortez, who are surprised to learn that their unassuming parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) are in fact lethal undercover spies, and need their help after being kidnapped by eccentric megalomaniac Floop (Alan Cumming hamming it up terrifically). Aided by their uncles Felix (Cheech Marin) and Machete (Danny Trejo) they embark on a dazzling adventure to find Floop's surreal, isolated palace, take down baddies Ms. Gredanko (Teri Hatcher) and Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick) and save their parents. The four have amazing chemistry as a familial unit, especially when it comes time to kick major butt. The practical based effects have a wondrous vitality, from the Thumb Thumb henchman to the eye boggling, Terry Gilliam-esque realm that Floop resides in. There's also work from Tony Shaloub, Mike Judge, Richard Linklater and a sly cameo from George Clooney. No shortage of imagination, creativity and fun.",Spy Kids
20,Agent10,Fun in a way only Robert Rodriguez could provide,7,8 August 2002,"At first, I wondered what in the world Robert Rodriguez got himself in to. But after watching this film, I realized he is setting himself up for the next big step. I'll explain later, but on with the review. Sure, it's a kids film, but the wild and fast paced nature of the film was interesting. The odd sets, the fantasized story and characters so unusual, one has to question what is going in Rodriguez's mind. Nevertheless, the decent cast and the surprise cameo at the end proved to make this an engaging film about a family, who just happen to be a bunch of spies. Overall, I give it a 7/10, but a  seven in a very good way (considering this film wasn't exactly made for a 24-year-old). As for Rodriguez, I believe he is positioning himself to be a sort of Spielbergian type of director. While his ideas are a little more unusual, he is slowly stepping down from the graphic, violent films to movies you can take your kids to. Hopefully, with this film, he has beaten M. Night Shyamalan to the punch (but then again, they could both be cast in the future mold, which probably wouldn't be a bad thing).",Spy Kids
21,ShootingShark,"Goofy, Lovable, Thrill-A-Minute Comedy Action Junior-League Spy Thriller",7,21 August 2005,"Carmen and Juni Cortez' parents keep an amazing secret from them - before their kids were born they used to be top international spies. When they are kidnapped by the villainous Floop and Minion, who are building a robot army of copies of world leaders' children, the two kids must learn lots of spy stuff fast so they can rescue them. Along the way they enlist the help of their estranged Uncle Machete, escape from the double-agent Miss Gradenko and confront evil robot versions of themselves.This is a wonderful action-packed comedy spy movie which rattles along non-stop and is packed full of funny characters and Rodriguez' tremendous visual style. It somehow manages to romanticise spy movies and cheerfully send them up at the same time, and there are many terrific action/effects scenes (the kids' escape in a mini-submarine, the jetpack chase scene, a helicopter ride). The terrific cast give it their all - I particularly like Gugino, Trejo and Patrick, but everyone is great and Vega and Sabara hit just the right notes as the kids. They are kinda cute, but they argue good-naturedly; Vega has a great long-suffering quality and Sabara is just plain irresistible as the put-upon Juni, who not only has to save the world but get rid of his warts too. The movie is zippily shot by Guillermo Navarro (who has a walk-on as a minister), has some great music by Danny Elfman and features some cool special effects makeup by the Kurtzman/Nicotero/Berger group. Rodriguez made this movie as a labour of love for his children and it shows in every frame - it's just so much fun, and has a great underlying theme of families looking out for each other in the face of crises. He wrote, directed, edited and co-produced the picture, and also co-wrote the music and co-supervised the effects. This is a great director and a man who makes movies to entertain.",Spy Kids

24,eric262003,A Kid's Film That's Never Offensive,9,14 May 2019,"""Spy Kids"" succeeds as a kid's movie that even the adults can take a liking to. It takes the liberty in creating an exuberant atmosphere, with insanely original set pieces. scintillating visuals and plays our as a kids film without ever getting the feeling that your intelligence is being insulted. Under the direction of Robert Rodriguez, he must've seen his project after its initial release and had a mile long smile.Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez spies who hated each other and first, but then fell in love with each other and got married and raised two children, Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara). They never told their kids they were spies, but sooner or later their cover will be blown. Happily retired from the wacky world of espionage, Mr. and Mrs. Cortez get abducted by an evil doer named Minion (Tony Shaloub) and now it's up to Carmen and Juni to save them while fighting off robotic kids and Thumb Monsters.Minion is under the superiority of a diabolical mastermind named Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) whose kid's show he hosts is a concealer to kids manipulative evil schemes of world domination (sounds familiar?). His headquarters is located at a sea-castle where strange thumb-shaped creatures while Floop has an apparatus that morphs clone-like robotic replicas of children from powerful parents. They resemble the kids except for the stoic eyes and the creepy glow. But their brain capacity is not up to par. Floop devises a Third Brain that Gregorio took after retiring from the biz.Sure it sounds quite juvenile on paper, but surprisingly this movie has set pieces that will make James Bond's head spin. These gadgets seem more superior than the things Q has invented over the years. If the adults are entertained as much as the kids are than this movie truly stands out. ""Spy Kids"" succeeds in giving us its money worth and why we even watch movies to begin with. Aside from the style which does it exceed over substance with no apologies, there is a moments of witty dialogue and clever banter which adds more to the pleasure of the story.The kids are not alone in their quest. They are joined by their Uncle Felix (Cheech Marin) and an old friend of Ingrid's in their spying days Mrs. Gradenko (Teri Hatcher). The kids find the secret to the ""safe house"" and become naturally savvy in these spy techniques some more complicated than others. The cool thing is that the kids don't take their matters lightly, they are dedicated in their mission and even Juni eventually gains confidence in standing up to bullies in school.Rodriguez has a thing for special and visual effects (like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"") by depending on computer-generated set pieces with the colourful backgrounds that look like a party is taking place inside a paint box. Such awesome gadgets include chewing gum that can be used for a tracking devise or a cool car that can transform into a submarine. Their even a scene where the siblings take charge of a watercraft submarine shaped like a giant fish that will put Captain Nemo to shame.Though I try to stir clear from race or politics even when it comes to kids movies, but from an observation standpoint, Rodriguez made the film mainstream for the Latino demographic. Even Gregorio jokes about the Latinos that make up most of the cast on Floop's show. It's great that the violence displayed here isn't graphic, and that for a kids movie it's more juvenile and cartoon-like that's fun to watch. Even the kids high-tech stuff looks fun to look at as it is when it's used unlike the gadgets adults use which most of the time is scaled down.""Spy Kids"" stands out as a kids movie that is rare to find being that it is original, inventive and not watered down to insult anyone's intelligence. It does have lessons learned but in a positive and not preachy ways. You never feel embarrassed to watch it. Even if you don't have kids you can enjoy the film and be amazed at the work Rodriguez accomplished.",Spy Kids
25,Gislef,Generally enjoyable for the 5-10s,6,16 April 2001,"Spy Kids is a kind of offbeat movie. It tries to parody the spy genre, and be a kids movie, and make a commentary and on the weird Barney/Teletubbies subgenre of kids TV shows. All filmed against a rather odd Mexican/Spanish locale, and using Rodriguez's stable of ""favorite"" actors like Banderas and Marin.There's enough here to keep the adults (barely) interested. And the loud bangs and recognizable kid-social situations will keep your children involved. Generally I'd recommend it, but it's not really what I'd call an overwhelming classic.",Spy Kids

29,mattymatt4ever,"Mildly amusing and often watchable, but aimed more towards the young ones",6,20 September 2001,"Robert Rodriguez has proved to be one of our many talented, young, up-and-coming directors.  Though I wasn't too impressed by his debut film, El Mariachi,"" I enjoyed his later efforts (i.e.:  ""Desperado,"" ""The Faculty"" and one of my personal favorites--""From Dusk Till Dawn"").  He has a great knack for producing flashy, slam-bang action sequences.  Naturally, you won't see too much of that in this film--being that it's aimed towards an 8 and younger demographic.  The little violence we see is very mild.
One thing I did appreciate was the use of Hispanic actors.  Very rarely do we see a mainstream motion picture with a predominantly Hispanic cast. Even the two young leads (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) have a Spanish background. We also have an array of Rodriguez regulars, including Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo (who has a nice little role that supercedes his typecasting as a shallow tough guy), Antonio ""Mr. Handsome"" Banderas, Robert Patrick and...I'll keep the last actor as a surprise.  He appears in a brief cameo at the end, and yes he has appeared in one of Rodriguez's past films. Anyway, Hispanics are one minority we really don't see too often in cinema and it's nice that a movie like this comes by and lets them show off their talents.The plot is, well, corny.  But it's a kiddie flick, so I tried to let that slide.  Unfortunately, we go through some of the same ""Home Alone-esque"" situations involving the two kids crowded by a group of high-tech villains, and they somehow get away scott-free with the help of slapstick violence. OK, I get it.  Kids rule.  Adults suck.  Isn't that the message of all these flicks?  Though I would say this is moderately easy-to-take considering the majority of kid-oriented flicks like this, we do have to sit through some annoying bickering between the two kids.  We could've done without the gratuitous name-calling.  However, I have to give credit to the kids for their natural performances.  I appreciate any kid actor who can deliver witty dialogue without appearing as if he or she is reading off cue cards.
As for the actors I didn't mention...Alan Cumming is amusingly evil as the villainous host of a top-rated children's show.  Tony Shalhoub is amusing as his partner in crime.  Teri Hatcher is beautiful as always.  Even when she had half her scalp burned off, I think she looked hot.  :)
Rodriguez added a nice Latin mix to his funky soundtrack.  There's humor here and there that winks at the grown-up viewers.  Some of it's pretty damn funny.  I liked when Banderas hugged his crying, long-unseen brother (Trejo) and says, ""He's real emotional...Latinos.""  But more often than not, we journey into Saturday morning kid's show territory and of course, we have to end with a PC message about family values and all that stuff.  *Snore*If any of you grown-ups got kids, this is not a bad movie to rent.  It's a fun movie to watch with your young ones.  Those without kids...you might want to explore other options.My score:  6 (out of 10)",Spy Kids
30,Beta_Gallinger,"Maybe not strictly for kids, but it still didn't do much for me",5,14 March 2011,"I was in my early teens when this movie came out, and I can't remember exactly how I first heard about it, but I don't think that happened until a few years later. It has now been several years since I first heard of ""Spy Kids"", but I was far from eager to watch it. I knew it was a kiddie spy flick, like ""Agent Cody Banks"", and even though it's been several years since I last saw that 2003 release, I can still remember being put off by its cheesiness. I would probably still be ignoring this 2001 kiddie spy flick if it weren't for renowned cartoonist and filmmaker Mike Judge in the cast, as small as his role here is. This movie generally isn't considered atrocious, but I knew it would be at least somewhat cheesy, so I was not surprised by its overall mediocrity.Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez were once enemy spies from different countries, sent to kill each other, but when they met, they soon ended up falling in love, getting married, and semi-retiring from the spy business. Nine years later, they are now the parents of two children, Carmen and Juni, who are both unaware of their parents' past. The two Cortez parents return to their spy jobs after several other spies go missing, and it looks like a children's TV show called ""Floop's Fooglies"" could be responsible! They leave Uncle Felix Gumm with the kids and set out to investigate. The two secret agents are soon captured on their mission, and when this happens, an alarm goes off in the Cortez home and the place is invaded! Uncle Felix tells Carmen and Juni the truth, which is that their parents are spies and he is not really their uncle. The two young siblings manage to escape, and set out to work as spies themselves and save their parents! As well as being an action adventure film, this is also supposed to be a comedy, but absolutely nothing made me laugh, and I guess a couple parts made me smile, but hardly even did that! The ""Now flushing your poop"" part is an example of juvenile kiddie humour in the movie, and it's also certainly not amusing watching the conflict between the Cortez siblings, with the name calling and such. The story didn't really grab me for the most part, either. I found the first 25 minutes of the film or so to be consistently dull (including the part showing how two enemy spies just suddenly changed their minds when they met), and later, I did find SOME adrenaline in it, thanks to the action, but not enough to distract me from the flaws. I didn't really care much for any of the characters, and Alan Cumming's performance in the role of Fegan Floop is rather weak. I could tell that this character was supposed to be one of the more comical ones, but he just provides more failed attempts at humour for the already unfunny film. The special effects in ""Spy Kids"" are great, but special effects aren't everything.This 2001 kiddie spy flick apparently turned out to be a success, and was followed by ""Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams"" in 2002 and ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"" in 2003. After a long break, it appears the franchise is about to return with another sequel called ""Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World"" coming up, one by Robert Rodriguez, just like the first three. However, I doubt I'll be watching any of these, as watching the original ""Spy Kids"" didn't capture my interest well enough. Now, maybe a 6/10 for this movie wouldn't be too much from me, due to the reasonably suspenseful parts (it may be a bit better than ""Agent Cody Banks""), but in the end, it still left me with an underwhelming feeling. There's a good chance I would have liked this movie as a kid, but many adult viewers have also clearly enjoyed it. I won't say it's strictly for kids, but you should know what you're in for, and it's unsurprisingly a little cheesy.",Spy Kids

Hard to believe it's been that long. I can easily say it's a lot easier to appreciate this cutesy film if you have children of your own. Not many adults would be caught watching this feature alone....I hope!Carla Gugino was just 29 years old then. Crazy! Alexa Vega was only 12. Time seems to have flown by since this films release all those years ago. The best part of this movie was getting to see Antonio Banderas and Danny Tejo kick butt together. How about the actors who became famous after this film; Tony Shaloub (MONK), and Teri Hatcher (DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES). And those who were already pretty famous; Robert Patrick (TERMINATOR 2), George Clooney (O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU), and Cheech Marin (CHEECH & CHONG, NASH BRIDGES).And speaking of George Clooney, I never knew his scene towards the end was filmed in his own home, while he still wore pajamas!

If you've been around a while, there isn't a single new element to the plot--it plays like some Christian group edited a mish-mash of spy movies (especially James Bond, as I mentioned), but it's short and feels even shorter.

34,rzajac,Kiddie appeal drags it seriously down (and it didn't have to),4,28 January 2003,"I tend to think of the challenge of ""genre"" movie-making as the challenge of getting over certain hurdles that are endemic to that genre. For example, if you read my comments on ""crime"" or gangster movies, I'll usually start off by telling the reader whether the filmmakers succeeded in making it past that particular hurdle: Convincing me to to see criminals as human beings whose fate I should care about.Spy Kids is billed as a film for ""the whole family"", which is code language for saying that your 2-year old should be able to stay put through the whole thing (assuming a diaper change just before the opening credits). The challenge of this kind of movie is that it should also succeed in having something to say to the oldsters. I'm not saying that it has to work on the level of genius for each and every member of your family, from Baby to Gramps. But it has to do *something*, and Spy Kids does nothing for ""Gramps"" (that is, for me).I expected Spy Kids to have a moral dimension. You have to understand that this didn't have to be sacrificed to an abiding interest in keeping the triangular-pants set at bay. No sacrifice was necessary; I think it's just sloppiness and laziness and a lack of high expectations on the part of the producers, writers, and filmmakers. I can think of one film that shows these expectations are entirely reasonable: ""Babe"". Babe was eminently watchable by children AND deeply moved me at the end, so lovely and touching and fully integrated was the profound moral. (*Don't* ask me about ""Babe II""...).I suppose some may say, ""Didn't you see the moral of Spy Kids? That families are these happy, warm environments where kids can feel secure!"" And I suppose there was something of a clever play of ambiguity on the concept of ""security"". But in the end, it wasn't enough for me. It may be in part because I'm sort of a stickler for the idea of sharing and full disclosure, against which the very idea of spying is a kind of moral rape. So I have trouble sidling it up against the security of hearth and home and characterizing that contrast as cute and ""family entertainment."" Also, the appeal to hearth-and-home is a kind of obvious one-note-johnny; we all know that families are these secure places. Tell me something I *don't* know. Perhaps my definition of ""security"" needs upgrading. Maybe, as the movie happily and innocently hints, I need to relax in the knowledge that ""security"" sometimes means the state privileges that international lying and duplicity brings. I mean, what's *really* the point here? I'm too old to see spying as anything but profound ugliness on the spiritual level. So I guess this is ""family entertainment"" for the family without eyes to see that it's not really funny.Sorry about the rant. I'll back off a bit and just say; really, cool effects and action-for-action's sake without a properly integrated moral dimension doesn't cut it for me. It'll keep my 2-year-old from squirming, but it doesn't stop me from expecting more.

37,Movie-12,"Fun for kids and their parents, good for a family movie. *** (out of four)",8,10 April 2001,"SPY KIDS / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	If James Bond married another secret agent, had kids, privately continued his life as a spy, became captured, and left his rescuing to his offspring, we would have the formula for Robert Rodriguez's new action adventure, ""Spy Kids."" Rodriguez normally directs harsher, more brutal movies, like ""Desperado"" and ""The Faculty,"" but accustoms a slick style of adventure and humor in this film that exceeds past the level of any of his recent work. ""Spy Kids"" really does belong in some kind of James Bond picture.
	As the film's writer, director, and co producer, Rodriguez does a lot more with the material here than we expect. The film has a stunning array of special effects, ranging from walking thumbs to a particularly imaginative experience in the villain's headquarters. Even the introduction has zest and intrigue: we meet a seemingly normal family of four, consisting of Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez (Alexa Vega and Antonio Banderas), and their children, probably middle school aged, Juni and Carmen (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega). As the movie opens, Ingrid tells her children a nice bedtime story about two daring spies assigned to kill the other, but fall in love, get married, and retire. She prepares her offspring for bed and turns the lights off, walks to her husband, and explains she thinks it would be a good idea to tell Carmen and Juni their real identities as top-secret spies; the story Ingrid enlightened her kids with was true.	 Rodriguez quickly sketched his characters, but his method is surprisingly effective; the movie starts out with fast-paced action and captures our attention abruptly and does not really lose energy throughout its running time. We learn the two married spies have retired from the business nine years prior, but their fellow OSS agents are disappearing all over the world, and thinks it to be the work of a kids TV show host named Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming in a very whimsical, fitting performance) and his assistant, Minion (Tony Shalhoub). The agents have been converted into clay-like animated characters held captive at his mega tech laboratory.  Imaginative and interesting, if a bit cheesy. 	Ingrid and Gregorio call their ""Uncle"" Felix over to watch the kids while they go out on their latest mission. Unfortunately, this mission could be their last; they walk right into a trap and are snared from beneath their toes. Felix receives a distress call, sends the kids to a ""safe house,"" but is captured himself, leaving the responsibilities to the younger members of the family. 	The story isn't cheap or silly, although some of the material tests our tolerance for far-fetched science fiction. The underlying motives here are also legitimate. The movie puts confidence in strong family values, honesty, and trust, but does not preach, lecture, or on the other side of the barrel, become lost in an utter mess of silly dog poop and passing gas jokes like ""See Spot Run."" The movie takes itself seriously, and is well written. We understand the character's motives.   	""Spy Kids"" gets one thing painfully right, and that is therelationship of the brother and sister. Their relationship is all too familiar in American households, where name calling and mean-spirited behavior inhabit offspring of both sexes. The petty little conflicts they feel strained and forced, giving this movie, otherwise somewhat mature, an immature sensation. This familiar stereotype is profoundly irritating.
	""Spy Kids"" is often exciting, funny, and almost always entertaining. It is not the kind of movie that parents should just drop their kids off to, however, but should stay for themselves to witness some of the most effective family movie moments in quite a while. In a time when family movies are completely disposable, ""Spy Kids"" proves itself to stand out from all the others and provide us with a genuine spy movie experience.",Spy Kids
38,the red duchess,Fast.,4,24 April 2001,"'Spy Kids' uses hi-tech means and a busy action adventure to offer an old-fashioned, conservative, pro-family message.  it goes beyond the usual 'family is a sacred and inviolable unit' platitude, and suggests that families have to be worked at, that it's a daily, often violent, even traumatic struggle where nothing can be taken for granted, where enemies and chaos intrude at every corner.Rodriguez seems to parody this message with a sub-plot about a docile army of 'Village of the Damned' robot kids who do the bidding of their master, appropriately a children's TV host, whether for good or evil.  But the essential message doesn't seem to be parodied - the narrative concerns all those favourites in the pro-family genre: the father who has to prove himself worthy of his kids; the kids who have to come out of their shells; the realisation that lies and assumed roles are probably not very healthy in a family context; children should follow in the footsteps of their parents, asserting tradition; children's TV is not a good substitute for family contact and communication.From the beginning, the spy antics are conceived as an allegory for family values - the parents' marriage is conceived and disrupted by their careers in espionage; the main narrative concerns the kids' attempts to rescue their parents and restore the home; the denouement is the scene for a family reunion.  There is even a juvenile Oedipal story, where the son manages to surpass a father he was always embarrassed by.There's nothing inherently wrong with this.  Rodriguez wrote, directed and produced the film, so we may assume it's a theme close to his heart.  For all its CGI modernity, the film's movement actually resembles those old live action Disney films about kids-in-peril (e.g. 'In search of castaways'), crossed with the old-fashioned, fetishised gadgetry and outre sets of Supermarionation; spliced, of course, with the more late-20th century likes of 'Star Wars', 'The Matrix', 'Mission Impossible 2' etc., and, hearteningly, the queasy colour schemes and various plot points from 'The City of Lost Children', which might be this film's dark double.As in 'The Matrix', there are some pop-metaphysical pretensions, such as the scene where our heroes fight their evil doppelgangers, but this is part of the conservative message: the rupture of the family unit entails a breakdown in identity (see also the transformation of dad into a grotesque puppet thing).In any event, we are free to ignore the message, and enjoy the film's surface (certainly, Rodriguez could argue that his message is explicitely framed as a fantasy, a bedtime story, unrealisable in the real world; that would make the tone sarcastic and in bad faith).  This is underwhelming.Too often the bold flourishes betray their CGI joins, and become the digital equivalent of those back projections in Hitchcock movies. Rodriguez admirably wants to create a world of pure 60s bubblegum artifice, but the fact of 'real' actors force logistical compromises that aren't always pretty.This leaves the story.  The script and characters are too thin, and the action too abrupt, for us to engage in their trauma.  Like the usual Rodriguez film, the narrative is pretty much non-stop action, but because this is a kid's movie, the sanitised, cartoon action prohibits the usual Rodriguez tension between the ugliness of the violence and the beauty of its choreography.  The sets are strange, colourful, but somehow lack inventive vividness.  A Tim Burton would have accessed the story's dark centre; Rodriguez, however, provides an interesting subtext about the lingering racism suffered by the Hispanic children at their WASP school as the basis for their unhappiness.",Spy Kids
39,LebowskiT1000,Not nearly as great as everyone says.,6,28 August 2002,"I have to admit, I am not a fan of Robert Rodriguez, I was less than impressed with ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""The Faculty"" was better than expected, but still nothing great.  I had very low expectations for ""Spy Kids"" and I have to say that the film was even less enjoyable than I thought it would be.  I guess for a kids film it's kind of funny, but FAR from hilarious.  The story is ok (for a kids movie), but is a little too childish for me.  And when I saw ""childish"", I don't mean like 8, 9 or 10 year-old childish, I mean 4 or 5 year-old childish.The acting was ok in the film, but I wouldn't say it was anything great. The only character that I really liked was Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming).  Alan is such a cool actor.  Although, I did also like seeing Tony Shalhoub and Robert Patrick in the film, very cool actors.  There are also two other reasons to sit through this film: 1) Carla Gugino 2) Teri Hatcher!  Those are some beautiful women!  Also, there's a George Clooney cameo, for those Clooney fans out there.Oh, and an interesting little bit of movie trivia just occurred to me.  This movie a kind of spoof of the James Bond films, and both Alan Cumming and Teri Hatcher were in a different James Bond film.  Kind of interesting, yeah?I have to mention the special effects in this film.  There were some times in the film where they were just incredible and very well done, and there were other times where they just looked TERRIBLE!  I think this movie used WAY too much computer effects than it should have.I guess if you've got young kids, go ahead and watch this film, the kids may enjoy it.  Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this film.  Also, if you're a fan of Robert Rodriguez, then you may also want to check this film out, but be aware that this is a kids' movie, quite different than his other films.

They should've died and also what is with the thumbs? I had no idea what was going on in it. I got one more question and then I'm done. How can this get a 6.3 rating. It should be in the bottom 100. The only good thing I'd say about this movie is that they have alright inventions but that's it.2/10",Spy Kids
41,ruby_fff,"It's a kids version of James Bond adventure - fantastically enjoyable for adults, too! BRAVO to writer-director Robert Rodriguez!",8,1 April 2001,"Unlike his ""From Dusk till Dawn"" 1996, there's no swear words, blood & guts, or ballet of bullets in Rodriguez's SPY KIDS. It is of solid entertainment value and with high creative energy - equal to a Bond film. The premise is a fantasy adventure truly for kids, while the adults can enjoy along with the ride. Everything - storyline, plot progressions, characters, scenes, sets, costumes, makeup, and special effects with techno-gadgets galore - is fun and in lively colors and imageries, with little inventive surprises here and there. The pace is unarguably right on - full 90 minutes of a thoroughly delightful mix of spy-venture and sci-fi family movie.
Antonio Banderas is Dad, Gregorio Cortez, and Carla Gugino is Mom, Ingrid Cortez, both were once super secret agents unbeknown to their two kids - the heroes of the story: Alexa Vega is daughter Carmen, Daryl Sabara is son Juni. The two young heroes may seem ordinary and vulnerable, and no smarter than any other kids, but that's the down to earth aspiring quality we want to believe in - that anyone of us can jump into such an adventure and cope as they do! The movie is loaded with graphic delights, comic book style as they may be. For instance, just within the adult Cortez's room at a glance, one gets a chuckle over the interesting keyboard that Mom has vs. Dad's workstation. Playful inventiveness is reminiscent of Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" 1990; the gadgetry-loaded interiors of the Safe House and at Uncle Machete's went beyond Disney's ""Inspector Gadget"" 1999.
Alan Cumming is exquisite as Fegan Floop, the children's TV program genius - the hero in Juni's eyes. Tony Shalhoub, once again, after ""Galaxy Quest"" 1999, took on a light-hearted role and is willing to poke fun at himself, including adorning an interesting headdress! The Floop's theme song is by Danny Elfman - the tune reminds one of the Elfman touch distinctive to his film scores like Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" 1993, and ""Edward Scissorhands"". Somehow with all this fast-pace ventures, Juni became the one (increasingly confident and unsuspectingly smart by simply being himself the kid) who helped Floop to get out of his psychological predicament and concentrated on solving the problem at hand to save the world. SPY KIDS is produced by Troublemaker Studio (truly fun as its namesake!) with Dimension Films, a division of Weinstein brothers' Miramax Films; I hope it gets the marketing promotion it deserves - such a rare diamond of a decent family fun movie these days. I dream of it reaching top ten status, and perhaps another family mission for the Cortez bunch yet to come.If the sci-fi quality and the makeup being a little too much for some kids, try the British production of ""The Borrowers"" 1997, another worthwhile family children movie, also quite an adventure in itself. John Goodman is the nasty landlord in the tale of a young boy helping to save the plight of literally the 'little people.'",Spy Kids
42,departed07,A kids movie that proves adults (or parents) could watch this film also.,9,4 October 2003,"My parents used to tell me that once I reached a certain age, no longer was I suppose to watch cartoon flicks or kid movies but films that a ten year old boy were suppose to watch: action films filled with blood, carnage, neat monsters and so forth.When I first heard that Spy Kids was out back in 2001, I was already used to the technology of DVD's replacing VHS movies while at the same time hearing how this movie directed by Robert Rodriguez captivated both children and adults alike. Yes, I said it. Even my high school teacher Mr. MacAulay told me that he liked the film more than his daughter Fiona in which he was delighted with the special effects and cool story line.To my review of the film, Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) think they have it pretty bad with their lame parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) who aren't hip like their peers parents. What they don't realize is that both mom and dad are international spies who forbidden themselves from making any more espionage attempts until getting a briefing that a couple of their field agents have been kidnapped where it's up to them to save them.However, once the parents are kidnapped, it's up to Carmen and Juni to take their parents positions and save them.""Spy Kids"" is a whole lot of fun with a big set of innovated techniques from Robert Rodriguez where I didn't feel bored from the first minute of the film.",Spy Kids

The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. Well if I were 12, I'd feel insulted. The best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino that just stole every scene she was in. Sadly, there weren't many. 4/10",Spy Kids
45,DavidSim240183,Rodriguez's revved up kids film,9,6 April 2007,"Spy Kids is a film that falls into what I call the hidden treasure variety. Its a film that falls alongside others like Fargo, Meet the Fockers and James and the Giant Peach. These are films that all failed to strike a chord with me when I first saw them. But after I rediscovered them, they went up considerably in my estimation.My first viewing of Spy Kids was not a pleasant one. I thought it was juvenile, stupid and sloppily plotted. In short, an overrated film that didn't deserve success or a trilogy. Still, there must have been something to the film otherwise I never would have come back to it.My second viewing of Spy Kids was a complete about face. I really had a great time. It no longer seemed juvenile but witty, fresh and inventive. Amazing how a film can seem completely different after you give it a second chance.The spy genre has had a sudden boost in the last few years. Kickstarted by GoldenEye, it brought Bond into the 90s, and was then followed by Austin Powers, a parody. Then came Spy Kids. Which also proved to be influential. Not only are there the sequels, but blatant rip offs like Agent Cody Banks, and even the excellent Pixar film The Incredibles has a shade of Spy Kids.One thing that shocks you right away about Spy Kids is that it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. This is the man responsible for no-holds barred material like the exceptional Sin City, as well as sharp and biting satire like The Faculty. But to Rodriguez's credit, he hasn't dumbed down. He's brought his natural, exciting style of film-making to Spy Kids, and crafted a rip-roaring adventure kids and adults will love.I could go into detail about the plot. But I'm not going to. Its inconsequential anyway. The real fun to be had is the dazzling display of stunt-work, special effects, visual sight gags and witty puns Rodriguez keeps throwing up at us. He's not always successful with special effects. Sometimes he indulges them to such an extent they swamp everything else. The exception being Sin City, where he melded it all into a breathtaking hyper-real world. And with Spy Kids, although I did notice obvious matte lines at times, he does a commendable job, and incorporates them without sacrificing narrative structure.Rodriguez has also assembled an imaginative and quite superb cast. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are good value as the retired spies forced back into action. I love the story of how they first met. If you've seen Mr & Mrs Smith you'll have a good idea of what they're like. And their heart-shaped parachutes are great.Alan Cumming is not bad as the one part children's presenter and other part criminal mastermind. Sort of like a cross between Pee-wee Herman and a Bond villain if such a thing is possible. And Tony Shalhoub is great as the power behind the throne. So is Fegan Floop's stronghold. A set so full of eye popping effects and surreal wackiness you're constantly blown away by what the filmmakers have gotten away with. Love the jigsaw puzzle floors too!But where Spy Kids really shines is Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as the dynamic duo. They make a completely believable brother and sister. Affectionately sniping at each other while propelled by jet pack, piloting submarines and using quick dry cement that looks like Silly String. The whole film rests on their capable shoulders. Vega is especially impressive. She has that rare ability among children where she can seem capable but gracious, and Rodriguez draws out a great deal of strength from her character.The gadgets and gimmicks the writers come up with are very innovative. They beat the pants off anything Q could come up with. I'm especially partial to the electrically charged gum balls. And the dozens of robot kids put films with much higher budgets like I Robot and Bicentennial Man to shame. I love the use they're put to in the end.There are so many delights to this film. The sight of Teri Hatcher getting her hair burned off by jet pack is worth the price of admission alone. And watch out for George Clooney's cameo at the end.I'm glad I rediscovered Spy Kids. If I hadn't, I would have been missing out on a superior piece of family entertainment. Spy Kids soars just as high as any of this film's jet packs.",Spy Kids
46,eagandersongil,Pure charisma,7,27 December 2018,"""Pequenos espiões"" Um jovem clássico com a cara do Robert Rodrigues, mas para o publico juvenil, o despretensioso longa que ganhou o mundo com sua simplicidade e carisma, com um toque trash e infantil ""Pequenos espiões"" é uma grande sátira, com ótimos personagens, grandes atores e muitas referencias. Com um roteiro simples, e uma boa introdução aos personagens, Robert nos coloca no mundo da OSS e tudo que o cerca e logo depois nos faz embarcar em uma aventura, infantil é verdade, mas ao mesmo tempo macabra, com experimentos humanos, tortura, cárcere privado, escravidão, mensagens subliminares....Algumas crianças podem se assustar, mas tudo isso tem uma pegada bem leve e de segundo plano, depois vem uma boa aventura juvenil com toques de ação, comedia e suspense. Antônio Bandeiras está ótimo no filme, Alexa e Daryl fazem uma ótima dupla, passam um ar de irmandade verdadeira. O filme conta com um estilo de direção bem Robert Rodrigues, exagerado mas divertido, pesado e leve, muitos o odeiam, mas eu adoro seus filmes e o ar de amadorismo perverso e sarcástico que eles passam, além de diversas referencias ao cinema e ao próprio mundo cinematográfico de Robert Rodrigues.

47,La Gremlin,Demented fun,6,28 September 2001,"It occurred to me that I should be settling down to write a big, long essay about how insane and bizarre this movie is.  Imagine a *much* less subversive ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and you have an idea of the tone.  The thing that's throwing me off, is that for the first time ever, I mean all of this in a good way.I guess when I learned that Robert Rodriguez directed this movie, I anticipated another insanely wrong-headed ""children's"" movie like the depressing ""Jack"" and the frightening ""Small Soldiers"".  I am well aware that Rodriguez has the dubious distinction of being responsible for some of the most violent movies ever made.  The only one of his movie's I've managed to see before this one was his ""the Body Snatchers Have a Really Bad Acid Trip"" opus, ""the Faculty"" (if you remember anything from that movie, it's the ill-behaved severed head [of Salma Hayack I believe]).Well, there are a few scary scenes in ""Spy Kids"".  Heck, the Fooglies and the Thumb-Thumbs freaked me out on an Oompa-Loompa level.  This isn't for little kids.  Older kids will have an absolute blast.  And while us 80's kids will have a bad case of ""Wonka-vue"", at least we've got a kid's movie that has the guts to use it's effects budget to do something different visually.One caveat: how come the video doesn't have the added ""special edition"" footage from the recent re-release?  (Speaking of which, ""Atlantis"" surely couldn't have been doing *that* badly.)",Spy Kids
48,jamiedarlow-37510,Pretty awesome family fun that was on repeat a lot when I was younger!,6,29 March 2020,"Ingrid and Grigorio Cortez (Carla Gugino and Antonio Banderas) are two super spies who meet on a mission to contract kill each other but fall in love and get married! They have two children, Carmen and Juni (Alexa PenaVega and Daryl Sabara) who, through realising their parents have been taken hostage by a mad genius, have to get to grasps with their espionage family history and learn the ropes in order to save them. The two kids are great in the central roles, Alan Cumming is fantastic as Fegan Floop, the children's show presenter with creative block who also provides one of the film's most memorable sequences with an Elfman-esque musical number that is catchy and exciting. There's also fun cameos from the likes of Danny Trejo as Uncle Machete; a character who we are likely to see pop up in future Rodriguez films. I think the parents are genuinely cool as well; Gugino and Banderas are a great on screen couple and I suddenly remembered when watching it again my school boy crush on Ingrid Cortez ;) Rodriguez directs with the fantastic swagger of his previous films added with a generous dash of childlike innocence to make an interesting family experience. It's a film so delightfully unpretentious and playful that it was hard to give it a lower rating than brilliant but the reason I did is because on watching it again, I admittedly didn't find it as engaging as a whole as I did when I was a kid. It's definately a great kids film and it's one that the whole family can at least find amusing but it does lose some of its sparkle with age; quite a depressing fact about getting older! Nevertheless, it's still a good nostalgic trip and the first instalment of a pretty cool series",Spy Kids
49,cosmic_quest,Entertaining kiddie-flick,7,2 April 2006,"For a film aimed primarily at children under twelve, 'Spy Kids' is surprisingly amusing enough with plenty of action and comedy to keep both kids and adults happy. The film is the first in a long line to use the idea of child spies as the plot device with the story itself centring on twelve-year-old Carmen and her eight-year-old brother Juni as they strive to rescue their spy parents from the grasps of Floop, a campy TV presenter with dreams of world domination.There are, of course, an abundance of special effects in the film that are of a decent quality and a number of intriguing James Bond-like gadgets make their appearance. However, what makes this film engaging is the interesting story that walks a neat line between being moralistic without preaching (we have the typical sibling fights but they band together in tough times as well as topics such a trust and familial loyalty being touched on) and not taking itself seriously (the adult characters are there mainly as comic relief back-up to the child leads and they revel in this role). Also, the child actors, Alexa Vega as Carmen and Daryl Sabara, show they are talented enough to carry off the bulk of the film themselves with limited support from Antonio Benderas and Carla Gugino, who play their screen parents.Unlike the lukewarm sequels, 'Spy Kids' is the kind of children's flick that older family members won't mind watching since the funny and action-packed plot and appealing performances by all the actors involved provide fun for a wide age range. In fact, the only problem I have with this film is that we can predict many mediocre copy-cat films, using the child spy concept, to be produced for the next five or six years until another fresh idea comes along, ripe for the rip-off.",Spy Kids

This is a likable adventure from start to finish and never tries to make itself larger than it appears to be. It's not pretending to be a cultural statement or a book of moral values.

55,AnishMisra,Spy Kids Review,5,2 January 2018,"Spy Kids is a film written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. I remember sitting in the hall some 12 years ago watching the 3rd part of this franchise. That happened to be my first 3D film. So since I had no clue as to what I was watching that time, I didn't like the film that much. So I fortunately came across the first part which was being aired on TV a few days ago. And I can safely say that I didn't like it.Plot: Carmen and Juni decide to take matters on their own hands when their parents who happen to be ex spies get kidnapped.Story and direction: This film had quite a good story in its place. I can atleast give it credit for that. And its starts quite well. I was kind of engrossed in it. I felt like the flashback scene was to be the only over the top thing in this entire film. But then it happens to go on. I can understand when a film is being made for kids and we have to add some illogical sequences. BUt this film has a lot of them. And the VFX. Oh My God. How much green screen and so fake. Films before Spy kids had much better VFX. I know that the budget was very less. I always think when you can't do great VFX, just put that thing away. And the fight scenes are so wire-y. Almost every fight scene looked fake. This film kind of irritated me. Also we have a more over the top villain who stays in some CGI-ed castle. I would say that Danny Elfman was mostly the saving grace for this film because the score was quite enagaging.Performances: Antonio Banderas was good. But he has done better than this. Carla Gugino was OK. The kids were great in their roles as most of the concentration was them and they did justice to what was given to them. Alan Cumming and Tony Shalhoub were so over the top that they became irritating over a point of time. Same goes to Teri Hatcher. Danny Trejo was a good addition to the film.I can't actually mention any scene that would be my favorite.Verdict: This film is for Kids only. If you are mature enough, you can quite avoid this venture. I am going with a 5.5/10",Spy Kids
56,shaun98,Good entertainment,7,13 April 2002,"""Spy Kids"" seems like a strange choice for director Robert Rodriguez. After all he is best known for bloody movies like ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" However, upon closer examination, one realizes that despite his new ""family friendly"" approach, his basic style hasn't changed. Faithful viewers will remember that ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was never meant to be taken seriously for a moment. No matter how gruesome it was, it was clearly made ""just for fun,"" in the tradition of ""Evil Dead.""This is his most blatantly cartoonish film yet, one which gleefully throws all credibility to the winds. With Rodriguez, questions of credibility are a nonissue. The only real concern is, ""is this funny and entertaining?"" In this case it certainly is. It's much better than most of the so-called ""family movies"" out there today. It breezes through its short running time with few lags. Newcomer Alexa Vega is engaging as Carmen; even at this age she has a great deal of spunk and charisma. We should look forward to seeing her future work, I hope she succeeds as an actress. Likewise, Alan Cumming makes a fun antihero, suspiciously reminiscent of Willy Wonka.*** (out of ****)Released by Dimension Films",Spy Kids

It has an all-star cast who give great performances, especially Alan Cumming as Floop, the bad guy who turns good because he loves children. I was at first surprised that Antonio Banderas would appear in a film like this, but I was even more surprised to learn that Robert Rodriguez, the man responsible for DESPERADO, directed this picture. There are great cameos by T2's Robert Patrick and LOIS AND CLARK's Teri Hatcher as villains and the Thumb-Thumbs and Fooglies are brilliantly realised creatures. The action is brilliant as well, with our miniature heroes being chased in a submarine, on rocket packs etc. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are very good as the spy parents and DESPERADO refugees Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo are also brilliant in their roles.

59,nzswanny,"Overrated garbage that should of been straight to DVD, it's a bit hard to watch with all the sexist remarks to boys...and the bad special effects don't help either",1,24 April 2016,"This is barely funny. I'm having trouble laughing at all the crude humour and sexist jokes in this film. I thought girls always got made fun of, not boys? Well, this film (and lots of other TV shows) proves me right that both boys and girls are made fun of, so that's why I rated this a 6/10, not a 5/10. But this film is definitely extremely sexist, and I'm surprised nobody has pointed that out. It's hard to beileve Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic gave this film a good rating, because the special effects were terrible, the story was crap, the pacing was too fast, the crude humour wasn't too good either and the film was very sexist. I'm going to describe a little more about these flaws and about how this film is, and explain why you probably won't like it (unless you hate boys).SPECIAL EFFECTS:You feel like bashing up your television screen when you see these terrible special effects in a so-called ""good movie."" The greenscreen is terrible, also. The thumb-thumb was a terrible special effect, the animating on it was absolutely terrible. It was hard to sit through the movie, knowing that this got great reviews, when there's something callled thumb-thumb on it. This can't even be called a movie, the special effects aren't even good-bad like films like Sharknado, Spider Man, Star Wars Episode 1 and Jaws...the special effects is just plain cringe worthy, it's hard to watch without puking all over the floor. And the crazy thing is, this cost 35 million dollars to make! I'd expect 3 million for this crap! And 3 million is way lower than 35 million! Okay, maybe you can cope with bad special effects, but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???STORY:A simple story! Nice and simple, not too complicated! Although this flaw that I am going to talk about isn't actually too bad, it's still something to consider for you story lovers out their. Two kids, a 12 year old and a 9 year old, find out that their parents are secret agents, so they become secret agents. That's not too bad a plot...for one of those Disney channel TV movies, that is! But the plot get's worse, believe me...Techno-wizard Fegan Floop and his evil, egg- headed sidekick, Minion, capture the two kid's parents. So, a 12 year old and a 9 year old embark on a mission and become spy kids so they can save the parents in this terrible movie that will guarantee that you kill yourself! Okay, maybe you can cope with bad story, but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???PACING:That's right! PACING! The one thing that bugs me in the movie Spy Kids is the pacing! It's way too fast, even for a family movie with bad special effects! As soon as you start to take a breath, another exciting part happens! The movie honestly feels like loads of exclamation marks heaping up onto your television screen, and you won't be able to see the actual movie because of all the exclamation marks! It's very hard to pay attention to the story when the pacing is god awful, especially when you can't find one part in the film where you can take a breath. I hate fast paced movies with a passion, and unless the movie has a great story behind it, I usually need something else to make me like the film. However, Spy Kids hasn't delivered me anything apart from...well, you know. But honestly, the pacing in this film is terrible, and it's hard to sit through this movie like a proper good movie. Okay, maybe you can cope with pacing (luckily), but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???CRUDE HUMOUR:FAAAAART! Hahaha, that's hilarious! THUMB-THUMB! A GUY MADE OUT OF THUMBS! Hahaha, that's hilarious! THE SISTER JUST MADE FUN OF HER BROTHER! Hahaha, that's hilarious! I hate crude humour with a passion, as it is very tasteless, and I think lots agree with me that crude humour is tasteless. Spy Kids, however, had loads of crude humour, too much to even call it a family comedy. It's basically more of a horror because of how scary that a film could be this bad. Honestly, I would list this as one of the worst movies ever, and if it weren't a box office success, and had good reviews, I would be cheering right now! I don't think there is much to talk about with crude humour though, so let's just go onto the next one. Maybe you can cope with crude humour, but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???SEXISM:I am against this, a LOT! I hate sexism against both boys and girls, however, it really annoys me when movies like this always seem to throw insults at the boys. You could tell, because the brother always got treated like crap. He always seemed to fail in the film, and so did most other male characters in the film, I couldn't find one male character that didn't fail at least once (apart from the father of the two kids). I am surprised nobody complained about this in the bad reviews, because it is the main reason why I hate this movie with a passion. Now, come on, there's no way you can cope with sexism! Is their? Because if their is, then I guess this is the right movie for you! Unless you can cope with all the things I just told you about the film, I recommend you don't watch this film, and that's a final!

If you liked Inspector Gadget or Jumanji or even Cats and Dogs you will probably like Spy Kids.  I would not attempt to over analyze this movie.  It was just good old fashioned spy adventure with kids as the main characters.  I really did not notice any references to ethnicity as a reviewer mentioned.  A few audience members who were thinking this was a spoof or satire were way off base in their yuppie sheltered worlds but most people liked this film for what it was.  It was meant that we laugh with the characters not at the characters. This was just fun with good special effects.  I hope it does well.
Also Antonio Banderas shows his versatility here far away from ranging from Thirteenth Warrior to now a father spy in Spy Kids.  I have not yet seen his other new film Original Sin or some but I am sure it is a far cry from Spy Kids.  Also it was refreshing to see the mother played as an exciting person rather than the usual henpecking boring yuppie character.  She is fresh.",Spy Kids

I can see some effort with some fun action, but the story doesn't execute well. It can be weak like other spy films for kids. Both the CGI and the costumes Ed can be outdated. And the characters are weak. Even the fact it would be hard to root for Carmen and Judy mainly because they would argue throughout the film. I guess the best thing the movie can offer is with some of the visuals, especially with Troublemaker's debut of filmmaking. So at least I can call this film harmless and it's for kids to enjoy. But maybe it's worth for spy fans. Maybe this would be the best of the Spy Kids films, but not really saying a lot.",Spy Kids

Antonio Banderas,Carla Gugino,Alexa Vega and Darayl Sabara were great as playing the Cortez family and I also thought Alan Cumming was good (much better than he was in Son of the mask).2 secret agents (Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino) have retired but have to go back in business when an evil man (Alan Cumming) threatens to take over the world.

As an adult watching this film, I am impressed by the directing in this film: great performances and expressive, well thought out camera-work. This, combined with excessively creative production design (which clearly had passionate people behind it) creates a world that, frankly, feels like it was genuinely thought up by a children, albeit a team of extremely creative and funny ones with an impressive understanding of filmmaking.
I generally judge children's films for how well i can enjoy them, as an adult, since any film that has to pander to a child mind to succeed is lacking an essential intellectual, critically examinable element. This film half succeeds at that, while also clearly and specifically pandering to children. It's like a live-action kid's cartoon, and the director/cinematographer did a great job at achieving that specific aesthetic.I often struggle when evaluating children's movies, because I am not a child.

73,Doogie D,"Save your time, save your money",5,22 April 2001,"I saw the ads and thought SPY KIDS looked awful.  Saw the stills, thought they looked awful (just posing the kids defensively in front of the parents, all in a fighting stance, implies incredible irresponsibility).  I kept reading these wonderful reviews about what a delightful confection this is, and eventually I got suckered in, thinking I didn't want to miss another BABE or something, and the film was probably being poorly marketed to get the kiddies.Well, kiddies might have a good time (though in the theater I attended, restless kids had to be told repeatedly to hush, and one child articulated in the aftermath, ""I was hoping for more action"").  But this is one where the adults will definitely need to shut their brains off.  If you're on the fence about whether or not to check this out, I'd strongly suggest not going.  It's not awful like CURLY SUE or something -- I laughed aloud once and got a couple of chuckles elsewhere -- but it is... well, it's poor.  The adventure isn't manic enough, the inventions by and large not that incredible (a packet, when microwaved, becomes a McDonald's meal.  Yipee!). SPOILERS AHEAD: Yeah, the thumb thumbs are kinda cool, but the villain is far too toothless.  Kids' movies CAN survive real villainry and, in a way, need it: Wicked Witch of the West, anyone?  And then when the villain goes soft and is revealed as NOT the villain, Villain #2 is even less frightening.SPOILERS OVER.  I guess one of the main problems is that the sense of threat is never tangible. The film has obviously been designed not to frighten children, giving no sense of real evil or malice onscreen (almost all critical physical contact happens either off camera or with simple karate flips).  In cushioning every blow in this manner, SPY KIDS leaves no sense of tension, danger, or conflict.  That's probably why the kids got so shifty during the screening and parents got testy; the kids saw that this emperor had no clothes -- or, more to the point, a candy colored but rather dull one-piece.  5/10",Spy Kids

And although all the violence for which he is well known is rather missing, it is one hell of a ride. It is fast, energetic and absolutely fun. From the beginning until the aftermath the film is full of ingenious takes and gags.Now, is it really for everyone?...I think not. While I was watching it, I was having one of the best times in this year, I was delighted by it. But then I saw my girlfriend yawning, and that's when it all came down. This film is mainly for kids, they will have the best time ever watching the film, having their parents buying them all the merchandise that is out on the stores and buying the Happy Meals to see what's in them. Suddenly I felt like a child accompanied by an adult, and later on while commenting on the movie with some friends, nobody liked it, and some even though it was an insult to intelligence.But after giving it some though, I realize there is nothing wrong with me, if I am a child inside and this is the kind of film that suits me, it is OK. So, if you are a child at heart this film is for you, if not, stay away from it before it's too late.Also, what I like about Robert Rodriguez is how he breaks the stereotypes and manage them.

This movie is an example of the former.The kid actors are good, as well as the adults. Danny Trejo is a standout for me. Antonio banderas was great as well.The villain, Floop, may be silly but you understand his character, which is something MANY spy movies fail at.Jokes do fall flat, but some do land and are pretty good. The plot is simple and silly and does makes no sense at times, but it's a kid movie: I don't know why some reviewers were expecting an in-depth socio-political commentary on the government and spies. And in my opinion, the plot is entertaining and that's what matters.I suppose that what movies should be aiming for: entertainment.

Although the intro feels like 1996 The Rock with Elfman's score being a little similar but then as soon as you hear Los Lobos guitar solo you know you're in for some classic Rodriguez action. The movie does have flaws such as the corny wedding story at the beginning, the forced ending with the family theme pushed into the audiences' throat but other than those two aspects the movie is pretty fun. The plot is as simple as they get, Minion the generic villain has to sell killer robot children to Mr. Lisp who wants to take over the world but he needs brains for the army and that's where Mr. Cortez comes in because he helped create the Third Brain, which is an artificial brain which Minion can replicate, therefore the Cortez's kids have to rescue their parents. Kudos for Rodriguez by including such awesome cameos such as George Clooney as Devlin, Danny Trejo as another knife name bad-ass this time Machete who got his own fake trailer in the Grindhouse and later turned into a movie, and the T-1000 as Mr. Lisp! Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara really take the movie with their hilarious brother and sister bickering with lines such as ""Stop calling me names"" -""Or what?' –""Or I'll call you names"" classic! Or when Juni calls Carmen the diaper lady because she still wears diapers at night and you see Carmen's reaction, hilarious. Another character that is awesome was Alan Cumming as Mr. Floop who was portrayed as a mad genius who cared more about his kids' show than his diabolical plan to take over the world. Overall this movie is worth renting but only worth buying to complete your Rodriguez collection along with El Mariachi trilogy and Planet Terror since this is essentially Rodriguez. On a side note the Fooglies and the Thumb Thumbs were very creative especially the way that the film explains that the Fooglies were victims by reversing their singing to ""Floop is a madman, Help us!"" and when Cortez begins suspecting when he sees the show and the camera zooms in at the new Fooglie with his terrified eyes.",Spy Kids

Also, a comedy where the characters take themselves seriously - don't look for the Burt Reynolds ""wink and a nod"" school of comedy here.  The performances are so restrained in what is, after all, a satire of spy films, that you can forgive the occassional bit of overacting.The film has at is core a very adult theme, secrets and how they can keep us from getting close to each other.  This family is in trouble because they are all keeping secrets from each other - the big secret being that mom and dad are spies, a fact they hide from their kids who are incredulous when they learn the truth.

99,davidsrose,"Nice idea, not so great implementation",5,22 September 2001,"Spy Kids takes a neat idea and unfortunately turns it into a pretty mediocre film. The concept, of kids finding out their parents are spies, and then rescuing them with high tech gadgetry, is great. In this case, however, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem isn't with the cast, which is pretty good all around, but with the direction and plotting. In the Bond films, or the Mission Impossible series, or even True Lies (of which this is something like a children's version), there is at least a surface attempt to keep things within some bounds of what-might-pass-for-reality. But here, you have what one previous reviewer appropriately described as Bond-meets-Willy Wonka-meets-Tim Burton. And that just doesn't work.The child actors (especially Alexa Vega) are quite good, Banderas turns in a solid performance, and Carla Gugino is great. But what could have been every kid's dream (finding out your parents are spies and playing with their cool toys) turns into an unfulfilling mishmash of computer-generated fantasy (which usually looks cheesy), ridiculous plotting, and some really disturbing stuff for kids.The moral is good, the Latino casting is good, the concept is good, and there are probably eight or ten GREAT little one-liners or sight gags scattered throughout, but all in all I really can't give this more than a five.Whether or not I'll come back for the sequel depends a lot on what I hear by word of mouth. If Roberto can do a kid-friendly version of True Lies, I'll definitely see it. But if he goes back to morphing Teletubbies and Burtonesque weirdness, I'll have to pass.",Spy Kids

This is by far his best film to date.   My only two gripes are: 1.  The unmined riches of the characters.  Character development is something on which Rodriguez seems to spend little time; a pity considering how adept he is with the action sequences.  I am sure with a little more effort he could have combined all the daring-do with a more intimate look at what was stirring inside those diminutive super agents and their parents. 2.   The often times horrendous effects including a high speed chase on water featuring speedboats that looked like they were being jerked back every half second and some all too obvious CGI vehicles.

103,Chihiro_Sen15,I promise you'll have a great time,9,3 August 2003,"SPY KIDS / Starring by Antonio Banderas, Daryl Sabara, Alexa Vega, Alan Cumming and Carla Gugini / Directed by Robert Rodriguez / Written by Robert Rodriguez / Rated PG / *** 1/2
Kick me if I found the low-budget, small surprise known as Spy Kids much more entertaining than the big-budget, over-hyped Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It is clearly a better picture for young and old. This thoughtful adventure was created by Robert Rodriquez. Surprising, after seeing Desperado and Once Upon A Time In Mexico in his filmography. Being a veteran for intense action films, Rodriquez still breathes life in this movie, aimed at kids and yes, even adults. In fact, this movie could even be compared to Pixar's films: Solid entertainment for kids and witty and sophisticated for adults. And live action? Finally!The plot finds Antonio Banderas (Desperado) and Carla Gugino (The One) star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, retired secret agents, though unknown to their two kids, Juni (Daryl Sabara) and Carmen (Alexa Vega). However, when loony television show host Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) searches for a mysterious power to give life to his army of child robots, he kidnap the two spy parents. But after learning their true identity, Carmen and Juni stock up on spy gadgets and gizmos and set off on a quest to rescue their parents and stop Floop from (surprise!) ruling the world. But could there possibly be someone else stirring in the plot?Sure, the story isn't overly complicated and everything has a goofy look to it, but I didn't watch a movie called Spy Kids to come and expect Citizen Kane. This is simply better-than-average and wholesome entertainment for kids and adults. The movie never ditches any sides of the story and cuts back to both the spy kids and spy parents. There's also some time with the relationship between the two villains Floop and his minion, properly named Minion (Tony Shalhoub). This film is not so much about gadgets and special effects than it is about characters. Rodriquez breathes life into these characters and the chemistry between them is where your investment will begin.The relationship between Carmen and Juni is second to none. They're both very fine actors. Their dialogue is never forced and their chemistry never fizzles even in the movie's stale moments. Like the film's visuals, they and their characters are colorful, fun and inventive. Alexa Vega, particularly, probably has the most potiental to be the better actor of the two, with Daryl Sabara having a few one-liners thrown down the drain. The adult actors, Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, are likable and charming as the spy parents but it is Alan Cumming, as the delightfully wicked Fegan Floop that steals the show. The movie never focuses on the children 100% which allows Cumming to ham it up everytime he appears.The film was made with about a $30 million budget, but the special effects look curiously more focused than the ones found in Harry Potter (which still makes me wonder where that $125 million budget went to). Don't walk in to expect the best of the best in special effects. When a person (or even a thumb) is flying around in a jet pack, it's easy to tell it's done by computer. Though the flying sequences are not the most exhilerating part of the film, it is the color and bouncy images found in the sets and locales. Floop's castle is lively and energetic but never tries to take itself too seriously.Well, what else can I say? This is fun and intelligent family entertainment. There is never a too serious moment and the kids are both charming and likable.",Spy Kids
104,rosco29,Right up there with Willy Wonka!,9,30 March 2001,"Finally, a live-action family movie that entertained me and my wife immensely, while my six-year old daughter had a blast too!The most obvious (and fitting) comparison film is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Amazing fantasy world, some true menace, and a great message about being true to yourself and your family.Spy Kids as a family movie for the post-Matrix age. It's witty, but never falls into that oh-so-hip faux-ironic self awareness that plagues so many movies today. It hands you a fantasy world, and encourages you to believe in it.It has a great deal of action and slapstick, but (thankfully) was completely missing the mean-spirited undertones of the slapstick in Home Alone.Like all great children's literature or entertainment, Spy Kids doesn't talk down to kids. It assumes they're intelligent and can pay attention. Having said that, there are sections of the film that are hyperkinetic, but they flow naturally.It has something of a similar vibe to the Pixar films (Toy Story 1&2, Bugs Life), without as many in-jokes. There are some wonderful adult-only laughs, mostly stemming from the trials and tribulations of being a parent.It's PG for a reason. It's not for the youngest moviegoer. A mature 5 or a six-year-old is about as young as I'd recommend. There are some scary moments, ala Willy Wonka, or The Wizard of Oz. But that's ""good scary"" in my book, as opposed to needlessly scaring folks to death.The message of family is delightful. The Cortez family is a *real* family. They have disagreements, but they love each other. Thankfully, Rodriguez avoids the sit-com smartmouth syndrome, and gives us kids we can believe.And I love the fact that Rodriguez never downplays the Latino heritage of the family. Hey, I'm so Anglo I'm practically translucent, but it was such a refreshing change to not have typical whitebread heroes out to save the world.Not since Bob (Porky's) Clark pulled A Christmas Story out of his hat has a director come up with such a pleasant surprise in a genre you'd never imagine. Summary? A cup of Bond, a splash of Willy Wonka, and a dash of The Matrix. Sit back and watch the fun!",Spy Kids
105,0rbita1,Secret Agents have never been so much fun - 3 cheers for Robert Rodriguez!,7,10 July 2001,"Robert Rodriguez is not the first person you'd suggest to make a children's film. As entertaining as 'Desperado', 'The Faculty' and 'From Dusk Till dawn' are, you wouldn't line them up alongside 'Toy Story 2' and 'The Jungle Book' for good, old-fashioned family entertainment. Yet, as this energetic, light-hearted Bondesque spoof proves, Rodriguez has the talent to turn his hand to just about anything, and inject it with the suspense and adrenalin that are his trademark.From the gloriously OTT opening scene (which tells the story of how two agents sent to kill each other fall in love and settle down) to the last second, 'Spy Kids' doesn't miss a trick. The obligatory gizmos, mad villains and dastardly plot to take over the world are all there, along with a star cast all playing their roles with tongues firmly in cheek. The action/humour mix is extremely well-balanced too, with some hilarious visual gags sitting within a sharp script and Banderas, in particular, revels taking a sly swipe at his normal 'strong yet silent Latino' image. Yet, refreshingly for a children's film, it's never patronising, never obvious, and genuinely original in places (soldiers made of thumbs, secret agents transformed into tellytubby-type TV characters - imagine Goldeneye-meets-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory-meets-Any Tim Burton film and you'll be close). In truth, some of the surreal moments and the more graphic effects may get a little too much for younger kids at times, but these moments are few and far between. Ok, it's a 'U' certificate and you may well have to sit through the trailer for 'See Spot Run', but don't let that put you off. This is one of the better films you'll see this year, and the best out over Easter by quite a way. Go and have some fun.8/10",Spy Kids
106,biancazlotea,Review by a 9 year old,8,30 September 2018,"I personally didn't enjoy the serie at all, but my sister may think differently: ""I love it, I love it, I love it. I like it because it's about spy and I love spy. And plus it's an action movie so I like it. Because you are always exited of what's going to happen next and even if I watched it 4 times, I never get bored of it. I really like it. My favourite character is Carmen. She's very pretty and always happy and cool. I hated the part when the guy stepped on gum. It was eww. But also, why does that lady have so many hairstyles. I really like it. But it's a little cheesy. I'm going to give it a 8/10 because of the cheesiness. Also the mommy's wedding dress was ugly.""",Spy Kids

109,youremythrill,"""Mommy, there's no 'excellent' on this survey.""",5,1 April 2001,"was my seven year old son's response upon receiving his post-viewing survey card. He loved it. Which is good news for the movie since it's aimed at kids. My opinions aren't quite as gushing.I was roped in by the trailers, its PG rating and the fact that it was NOT animated. The trailers let me down ... surprise. I didn't dislike it, I just didn't like it as much as I hoped I would.I loved the sets! Very cool. And it was a good story that a 2nd grader had no trouble following. Downside: Antonio Banderas was in it ... that always blows a movie for me. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but as usual, that failed. He just always looks like he's posing to me ... aaaaaak. I asked my son what he thought about the guy who played the dad and his review was, ""He was good but his fake mustache looked dumb"". I think I muttered something about Zorro under my breath.The kids playing Carmen and Juni were great. My son was rooting 'em on through their travails. They were likeable and you got the feeling that if any kids could've pulled off this wild scheme, they could.Overall, it was harmless, my son loved it and I didn't fall asleep. That's about all you can hope for when sharing a movie with a seven year old son, I think. At least until another Babe, Princess Bride or Wizard of Oz comes out.",Spy Kids

111,vmcdavidson,Rodriquez: Kid-Flick Genius?,9,15 April 2001,"Robert Rodriquez, keep it up. Parents are so tired of wincing at the double entendres, scatology, lame and retreaded plots, and sassy child actors with smug Eddie Murphy-style comebacks in the current kiddie film wasteland. Not only are parents tired of it, but many had given up on attending films in the theater all together. Better to rent an old, safe Disney flick or tape something from PBS.A realization, though, is now hot on the lips of Hollywood execs - a realization spearheaded by Rodriquez - that if a quality family film is created for children that is not a vulgar embarrassment or a chance for a quick nap for bored parents with their offspring in tow, paying audiences will attend. Gee whiz. Imagine that...Rodriquez is a man of vision, a man of family values, and a man of hands-on follow-through. According to the ""LA Times,"" he not only wrote, directed, and co-produced ""Spy Kids,"" he was also the editor and camera operator, and shared credit as music composer, visual-effects supervisor, and rerecording mixer. He reportedly flew to Chile to personally shoot background film footage. He concocted several of the astonishing spy gizmos used in the film. Did I mention that he is a working maniac?Latinos not only dominate the main cast of this film, but most are the good guys. This is an understated but positive sign that negative stereotypes in film may be crumbling.Imaginative, spirited, fast-paced, family-oriented, and highly amusing (a lot of it is just delightfully weird), ""Spy Kids"" is a must-see for elementary school-aged audiences (OK, many older kids will love it, but they won't let on). The kids in the film act refreshingly like normal kids, the parents like loving parents - it's all tied together with a delectable espionage angle. Most films released to theaters for children are ""quick-to-video"" - this one won't be.Robert Rodriquez - keep it up, and the families will come.",Spy Kids
112,robbinsreynolds528,The best family movie of the in the last 10 years,10,4 April 2001,"This movie was so great.  I was expecting a very typical kiddie movie and what I got was an edge of your seat clean adventure.  Where the bad guys did not have to stay bad but, good and love did defeat all.  I found myself telling every one at work that they needed to see this movie even if they had no children.  I was very pleased with the characters and the plot even had a couple of twists that were a bit unexpected.  I loved it !!!!",Spy Kids
113,motherfather,This movie is such a joy,9,1 April 2001,"This is a movie that gets it.  For the first time in a long time, I've seen a movie targeted at kids that does what a kids movie should do: be as imaginative and as vibrant and alive as they are.  Everyone in this movie looks like they're having a great time, and it definitely rubs off.  It's an kinetic thrill ride from start to finish, overflowing with action and wit and special effects.Instead of totally rehashing the plot, I recommend that everyone (no matter how old you are) see this movie.  No matter how cynical you are, if you go in with an open mind you should be entertained.  This movie has so many surprises that the less you know going in, the more you'll take from it. (But at the same time, if you know the entire plot, you'll still enjoy it).
With a horrible movie like ""See Spot Run"" passing for a family film these days, it's great to see a movie that doesn't have to resort to gross out jokes.  It doesn't insult your intelligence, it sparks your imagination. Spy Kids only looks all the greater in comparison,  because instead of trying to capitalize on the worst type of childlike humor (that move was much more immature than any ten year old I've ever met), it banks on the spirit of imagination.The film critic in me wants to mention that there are a few flaws to this movie, but nothing that can't and shouldn't be overlooked.  The movie has a few pacing problems, and some effects shots could be smoother.  But really, who cares besides nit-pickers who don't want to admit that they were entertained?One of the greatest assets is the dialogue.  It's obvious that the writer/director Robert Rodriguez came from a huge family (ten children) because he really has an ear for how siblings talk to each other, and how children react to certain situations. All the performances in the film, especially that of the two children, are just fun to watch.
This film has a great message of family unity and standing up for yourself and believing that you are good enough...  and it's a message that kids could really use.After seeing this movie the audience will be divided into two groups: those who had a good time, and those who felt embarrassed that they had a good time so they'll use words like ""cheesy"" to describe it.  Of course it's ""cheesy,"" I would expect nothing less from a movie that is supposed to capture the minds and hearts of children.  And since when is ""cheesy"" a bad thing?  Doesn't it literally mean ""innocent"" and ""child like?""
This film made me feel younger and vibrant.  I absolutely loved it.  I just wish I had children of my own take to it.  Maybe I'll call up my sister and take my nephews to the theatre, just so I can have an excuse to see this again.I think the greatest mystery is how this movie only cost $36 million to make...  Incredible.",Spy Kids
114,kevinp8192,Near Perfect Fantasy Film,10,8 May 2003,"First off, this film is under the wrong category.  Although there are action elements, it is indeed a FANTASY.  I mean, it's set in a fantasy world, it includes fantasy characters, and has fantasy ideas.  Some of the other user comments for this movie are just stunning.  Plot twists not realistic?  Logic gaps?  Come on!  The movie is about 10 year old spies with rocket packs, includes characters made of thumbs, voice command toilets, and has freeze dried Big Mac value meals.  Is this the kind of movie where you fault it for lack of realistic elements? 
Sometimes I wonder if we as adults have just been spoon fed so much unoriginal, formulaic drivel that when we see something like Spy Kids with true creativity and imagination, it's just too much for the senses and we reject it--we think we're too ""mature"" for it.Accept the film on its own terms.  It's a great ride--and true cinematic art.  It's going to be appreciated for years to come.",Spy Kids
115,ann-chess,"Not a masterpiece, but definitely some creativity",3,5 July 2011,"I remember seeing this as a kid and really enjoying it. I really wanted to be a spy like these kids. It was pretty funny for a movie directed at kids, too. Was it a favorite of mine? No. Classic Disney movies still had the leash on me. A little while ago I saw this movie again. It didn't give me the thrills it gave me when I was a kid, of course, but I still enjoyed some parts of it. No. It's not a GREAT film. But you can definitely see effort. There was definitely creativity and effort put in this film to get a laugh, to push the story forward, to give characters different quirks and personalities. Even some of the gadgets were pretty cool (like the world's smallest camera and the bubble gum.) Overall, it's a pretty harmless film. You can show it to your kids and they'll most likely enjoy it. The sequels slowly got worse, but if your kids are REALLY into this movie and are just pleading to see the sequels, just show them the second one. The third one was pretty bad, and the upcoming fourth one just seems...well, I'm not going to say anything since I've only seen the trailer, but I don't think I would want to spend money to see it. Sorry. Got off track there. Overall, this movie is worth a rent. It's a good movie to show to your kids on a weekend or something.",Spy Kids

One other thing is that the bad guys were just so..... so .... I dont know I cant find the right word for how dumb they were.  I thought of it as little kids movies and what Ive heard about the 3rd one is that it is even more horrible than the first.  And I still dont see how people voted a 7 for it.

However, for me, I can only stand to watch it, because I was forced to (and, might I add, I was). I thought the plot was bad for me, but OK for kids.

Probably my favorite movie since Can't Hardly Wait and Clueless (and let's include Being John Malkovich, too)  But anyway I would just like to say that Spy Kids is a fruition of many years of hard work for Robert Rodriguez, the director. After directing El Mariachi, Rodriguez never really had any movie that seized the power and original flavor of his El Mariachi (Dusk Till Dawn, Four Rooms, Desperado and The Faculty were bombs.  Dang you, Tarantinoooo! hehehe) But this movie, Spy Kids finally seized it again!  It seems Rodriguez's forte was kiddie movies after all!  (Remember Bedhead?) Rodriguez finally has a hundred million dollar movie and no one will ever be able to take this away from him!  And I bet you Spy Kids 2 will make even more!  Good for you, Roberto!  And I look forward to all your further action movies to come!By the way, if you want to get an inside look into the life and mind of Robert Rodriguez, read Rebel Without A Crew.  It's a book about how he made El Mariachi.  It's da best!!!",Spy Kids

I didn't really like how they showed how Carmen and Juni's parents got married because seriously, lets get on with the movie!!! But I LOVED the cast. Alexa Vega, i thought was the best one in the cast! She is a great teenage actress and should go really far in the Hollywood movie making business. Daryl Sabara was so cute playing Juni and should go far as well. There was Also Antonio Banderas, and it was an okay movie, not the best, but i expected better.",Spy Kids
122,gordon_brennan,"Imaginative, Funny, Entertaining, and at Times, Surreal",8,17 September 2009,"This is an excellent family film, with plenty of action, comedy, and solid pro-family messages for both kids and parents, messages which don't beat you over the head or drip with saccharine. A great mix of fantasy, adventure, James Bondian gadgets, and kid-accessible characters and themes. Director Robert Rodriguez, best known for his ultra-violent films such as ""El Mariachi,"" ""Desperado,"" and ""From Dusk Til Dawn,"" crafts an well-paced, well-told, and highly enjoyable story. I easily sat through this film in the theater, pleased with its impressive production values, acting, story, special effects, and its sheer imagination. I was engaged and interested from the very beginning, as were my kids (4 and 6). I remain impressed by the clearly adult themes (and visuals) of the opening boy spy-meets-girl spy bedtime story, as we slowly realize that the story being told was that of the now boring, predictable, and thoroughly domesticated mom and dad. We've watched this film dozens of times since, and it's still easy to sit through, great fun for both me and the kids. The morals of the story are clear enough to any adult viewer: the importance of family and family support, the importance of believing in yourself, and the importance of being open and honest. My 4-year-old son picked up clearly on all three messages, without any pointers from me. By the end of the film, everyone has matured in one way or another, every character has gained insight, and the family is closer than it ever was before. There are great supporting appearances by Cheech Marin and Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), although we sadly don't see enough of either. Alan Cumming as the fanciful and ultimately influential Floop is very enjoyable. Tony Shalhoub is great fun, as he is in any role, as the diabolical master manipulator, initially in the background who eventually becomes the ultimate bad guy, Alexander Minion. His best line, as he takes over: ""I can assure you, it's MISTER Minion now."" He gets his in the end, naturally, but it is not unpleasant or gory. It's actually quite comical, and he appears even to accept the final result/punishment he has brought upon himself. There are a number of other celebrity cameos here, including Teri Hatcher, ""Beavis and Butthead"" creator Mike Judge as Donnagon, George Clooney right at the end as Devlin, and a very stealthy Dick Clark as one of Floop's financiers. The story of the kids discovering that their parents are spies, having to strike out on their own with neither knowledge nor support, and then using their smarts and talents to take action to regain control of the situation and find their parents is plausible throughout, even when they're flying over the ocean and desert in personal jetpacks and mini-jet planes. We trace the kids from their home into the bad guy's lair, and the journey is easily believable and logical. The gadgets are a treat, from mini-jet planes to personal flying Buddy Pacs to homing devices, electrostatic gum, pinpoint video cameras, submarine minivans, instant McDonald microwave meals, and a totally cool Super Guppy submarine. The best part is that the kids get almost all of the gadgets, and they put them to instant good use defeating the bad guys. There are plenty of good comic bits to liven up the film as well, both jokes and sight gags. The kids act and talk like kids throughout, which adds to their plausibility of the film. The humor is both juvenile and adult, and presented in such a way as to keep the two separate, as they should be. There is no swearing, no blood or gore, no violence (some minor fighting), no gunplay or weapons, no nudity, and no drugs. Spy Kids is original, creative family fare, great for a video/DVD purchase and repeated viewings at home. The messages in the movie are strong and highly positive, yet subtle enough not to overshadow enjoyment of the story, its characters, and their adventures.",Spy Kids

Lots of quick camera switches and fast action mark this as clearly a Rodriguez film.The movie itself focuses on one family and works well by exploiting the differences between the parents and the children.  The kids are the heroes of the movie but succeed thanks to lots of pluck and a good dose of serendipity.  The parents are the ex-spies who are very suave, flawless in their work (almost), yet are the ones who need rescuing and are the supporting cast.  The kids are the exact opposite.  The younger boy, Juni, is plump kid who has no friends at school, a bad case of warts and is a klutz.  His older sister, Carmen, is a truant from school and is a bedwetter who still wears diapers at night.  However, this duo are the ones who save the day and carry the film.Look for lots of great sight gags and double-entendres.

When I saw this movie IT SCARED ME FOR LIFE, I was like 7 or 8 at the time but little did I know the horrors that were ahead. I was used to top notch special effects like in Star Wars, even though they were old but still worked well, or high quality CG affects, but THIS, was something else entirely, it was so cheap I was actually disturbed. The bizarre Lazy Town, Willy Wonka hybrid cartoon looked like an acid trip and the flying scenes were so cheap it makes Ratatoing look professional. The villain seemed really cliché and about the same as anyone out there, the ""kid spy"" thing really wears off because only 4.01% of the movie is actually spying, and the lighting made Man of Steel look like My Little Pony.The best part of the movie is the one reference of the Cold War.

133,freedomsbeat,GO ROBERT!,10,3 April 2001,"Let me just say that, along with Loyd Kaufman, Robert Rodriguez is one of the people the help keep my dream of being a film maker alive.  His awesome book showed me that a real guy with a $7,000 budget can make an entertaining movie that goes on to be a huge success.  I've witnessed all of his movies, and while Desperado (fun but paper thin characters) and the Faculty (far too hip for it's own good) where kinda let downs, I still counted him as one of my fav. directors.. Now, when I heard that Spy Kids was coming out, I have to admit that I was saddened-  I thought my hero was officially selling out.. Come on, a kids flic???   But, alas, I was wrong.. Clearly a loving tribute to his three children and his spanish heritage, Spy Kids is an entertaining, ""wholesome"" and very likeable film.  I've noticed how cynical hollywood has been lately- it seems like most movies are made by these arrogant little guys that seem like they have something against their audience (dumbing down plots, throwing in dumb twist endings, etc.).  Spykids is a refreshing change and clearly the work of someone in love with film.  I especially liked how only the villains talked down to the children - very cool.. Yes, the product placement was a little bothersome, but the frenetic pace and touching (yet not cheesie) msg. all worked extremely well.. I do wish, however, that it had a different title- 'Spy Kids' is simply such a dull name for this wildly creative thrill ride.. *** 1/2 (**** if I was a kid) The best kids flic since babe (and possibly the best movie of this year.. Period..) - Sorry if this review isn't well written- It's 2 am but I felt compelled to write something :)",Spy Kids
134,acadec_nova,An excellent film,9,8 September 2002,"I was not expecting much from this movie, the day I picked it up off the shelf at Blockbuster. I had heard very little about it, and, frankly, it didn't look like it would be all that great. But I was in the midst of a ""relive my younger days"" phase, and wanted a kids movie that wasn't Disney.
Boy was I surprised - very happily surprised - when I started the film. From the very beginning, it was a surprisingly fun, and funny, show. The children are both cute, but cool, heroes. Alexa Vega is hilarious as Carmen, the cool-headed, suave 12-year-old who nonetheless exhibits classic older sibling behavior to her cute little brother, Juni (Daryl Sabara). Daryl himself is very good in this role, and his growing up and overcoming his fear is a central tenet of the plot. When the family overcomes their problems and comes together at the end of the movie, it's cheesy, but I didn't care. It worked.And that's a good summary of the entire film - it's cheesy, but it works. See it - I promise, if you leave your adult prejudices behind, you'll find a movie worth watching, and enjoying.",Spy Kids

This was a very good film, certainly the best of the ones i've taken my young cousins to see and they all enjoyed it despite their variety in age (5, 7, 8, 13). Great film for kids of all ages, but it gets those extra few points for suceeding in keping adults entertained at the same time as their offspring!

Far from being lame and not the type of movie I like, I enjoyed it enough to watch SpyKids a few days later. Boy, what a surprise! I got to sit back and enjoy life again as fantastic stories were woven before my eyes, entwined with a pinch of realistic human emotion and a hope for growing up into something that exists despite the seeming impossibility of it. Be careful, innovative, compassionate, and completely unafraid of pursuing that which you love beyond all else. The height of enjoyment and good feelings I picked up during this movie was only paralleled by the soaring of my imagination as I went to sleep that night.

I was truly hoping for something like the Goonies which is a great film for all ages. This movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ???  Alan Cummings was however a delight.  And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the Willy Wonka song doesnt make this film anything like Willy Wonka.,Spy Kids

The humour is fun for kids and grown-ups, the FX are first rate, and all others in the Comic-Book-to-Movie genre will forever have to live up to this original screen-styling. Yes, Rodriguez wrote this highly entertaining script, but there are enjoyably obvious tributes to the classic superhero comics in the underlying story. This film is an homage that is more than flattering, too: it is addictive! I will certainly be looking forward to the sequel.

Teri Hatcher was a hoot, and I could have swore that was Paul (pee-wee herman) Reubens as the kiddie show host.The gadgets were awesome and only one product plug was overly blatant.

I particularly like the fact that a normal sibling relationship was shown, the rivalry and disdain but still the reality that blood is thicker than water and no matter if you think that your brother or sister is a twerp, you still do anything for them. The family sticks together and although it is a very far-fetched concept, it was a movie both my children and I liked. It was filled with action and adventure but the good guys come out on top in the end against overwhelming odds. I think we could all use a little more optimism now and this movie delivers it. Carmen and Junie were not the impossibly perfect kids seen in most movies now. Nor were they brats who only care about themselves in other movies.  They were too athletic to be real children, but I'd like to think that they are showing the kids seeing the movie that they can do anything that they put their mind to.

AWFUL special effects. Between the hand minion things and the water. Most of the effects make me want to shove forks in my eyes.3. The whole movie doesn't matter. What the f*ck.

It's one of those movies that, if nothing else, makes you 'ooh' and 'ahh' at what kinds of gadgets they came up with. It was a little predictable, but I could definitely see families going to it and everyone enjoying it. It has things for little kids (i.e. the flooglies and the ""flushing your poop"" bits), teenagers (action scenes, takes a jab at kids' tv shows..)and even adults (""play a record backwards and you'll hear the words of Satan""-type joke).

And we watched Spy Kids (2001) as the sun set below the Alabama cornfields. To this day I watch this movie daily.This movie has changed my life for the better. It helped me when my father passed away from gonhorrea, when I failed college as an entomologist major and even when I lost the love of my life; my sister. This movie still reminds me of her smiling face, her pretty sun-kissed skin and ginger hair.Whenever my depression worsens or my anxiety won't stop pestering me, I watch this movie. Whenever my hands bleed from working on the farm all day, I turn on Spy Kids (2001). This movie has been a life saver in more ways than one.So, it's only fair to rate this movie a solid 9.5/10.

If you think your life is hard enough think about this movie all the troubles that the kids in this movies had to go through. They had to save their parents. Imagine you in this movie. And having to go through all the hardships passing your way. All you got to know is that this movie is the best. The best in the world. It is out of this world. now think about the kids.

In fact, adults who are fans of Robert Rodriguez's other work will especially appreciate the subtle reminders of films such as ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" From his stable of familiar actors (Banderas, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, etc.) to shots that seem to pay homage to his earlier works, this film is a real delight. The casting is solid -- young Alexa Vega is a real find -- and the tone is perfect. Highly recommended!

165,Disgruntled Ninja,"Much Better than ""Madeline.""",10,4 April 2001,"There are two things that family films need today: They need to be creepier, and they need to be directed by Robert Rodriguez.  Rodriguez, whose frantic camera work and editing make his previous films like ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" seem like kids' movies for grown-ups, must apparently recognize that something drastic has been missing from the ""family"" genre for many years.  That something, as I've noticed anyway, is a healthy dose of evil.  It's interesting to note that some of the most memorable childrens' fare of all time contained, for the most part, some really twisted stuff.  The mere mention of the phrase ""Willy Wonka"" conjures images of frightening Oompa-Loompas, and deeper recollection of the Gene Wilder (aaahh!) musical serves us visions of the rather gruesome elimination of misbehaving children and the beheading of a chicken.  In the 80's, Jim Henson gave us a baby-napping Goblin King in ""Labyrinth"" as well as a world of grotesque critters and monsters in ""The Dark Crystal.""  The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the 90's and beyond, which have failed to provide much more sinister fare than 1996's wonderfully disturbing ""Matilda"" and the late Gene Siskel's final ""Best Film of the Year,"" 1998's ""Babe: Pig in the City.""  Luckily, in ""Spy Kids,"" we are treated to a cornucopia of wickedry in the form of a dim-witted kid's show host and his horribly deformed sidekicks (the result of crude experiments performed on missing secret agents).  These elements, along with kinetic pacing, funky set design and an obligatory moral message for the tykes make ""Spy Kids"" one of the best family films since ""Full Metal Jacket.""

166,kunoluv98,I'm glad I didnt miss it!,10,9 August 2001,"Oh gosh! I wondered what would have happened if Kelly Preston (who was initially chosen to play the mom) would not have given up her role and opened the door for Carla Gugino. I probably would have missed out on one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen! I am a huge Carla Gugino fan and got remotely interested in this ""kids"" movie because she was in the cast. Then I found out more details, and said to myself ""Gugino? Banderas? LATINOS in a Hollywood movie? All in one? What?!"" I just could not miss it, and I am sooo glad I didn't! I, a 21 year old, had to see this by myself because none of my friends could even fathom the idea of watching an openly childish movie. It was funny. You should have seen the ticket seller's face when I said ""One for Spy Kids please..."" She was basically like ""Loooser... Not only by yourself, but a kids movie?"" I realized it didn't matter though, because it made me rediscover the child in me, and thanks to ""Spy Kids"" I found a new appreciation for children - and their movies.Sure, it is not Oscar material and there are better children's movies around, but we cant deny that Spy Kids is fun and different. It's refreshing! I agree with a previous post, the Latino flavor was definitely a relief compared to the everyday white-bred movies out there. Being Hispanic, I like the fact that this is not necessarily a movie about Latinos. This is a movie about a family - who just happens to be Latino. It doesn't try to exploit the stereotype like other movies do (i.e. 'The Mexican' ugh!), and gives it that touch of flavor most movies don't have. By adding this Latin twist and bright imagination, we get a nice and unexpected treat. We must admit, now a days, such elements in a film are rare and should be appreciated - especially when presented so well. Bravo for Rodriguez!

One character spells it out like this, roughly: ""Being a spy is difficult. Keeping a family together is impossible. From now on, whatever we do, we do together"". Since seeing the film, these lines haunt me nearly everyday of my life. Hearing these words is easy: doing them is honor and joy. And tough.This film not only says these words bluntly, but also imaginatively illustrates how to keep a family together, though the fun may distract you from these themes. A second viewing may help them become more apparent.The production values are very high, although several set and story elements are boldly fantastic.An added benefit for a select few: if you are a father with once young, impressionable children who in the ancient past watched ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"", this film will be especially satisfying.The casting for Spy Kids is top drawer. The children, perhaps not the leading performers of the century, are completely well suited for this film  I wouldn't change them for anyone. (You shouldn't either.) The parents are also wonderful. And watch for several other familiar performers  my family are particular fans of Tony Shaloub (Minion). You may have seen Tony in ""Monk"", or ""Galaxy Quest"" or elsewhere.Warning  some people have said this movie is dumb. So, if you have no imagination, no appreciation for transcendence or appetite for family unity, if you'd rather throw mud and poke people with sticks, I recommend you stay away.

The fun fact is that I hardly remember the plot of the film, but the characters are so catchy that I still remember them.As it's never a dull moment watching a movie, I advise you to watch this story about the family of spies, who try to save the world. There are many hilarious scenes and dialogs between the main characters, which makes you feel gripping and emotionally connected to the story and the characters themselves.One more thing I really liked about this movie was the pace. They went backwards and forwards between the real world and the computer fiction and it worked really well.

175,zakatak3613,There is no hope for humanity... Just no hope.,1,25 June 2013,"Honestly, I don't know where to start. I first saw this movie when I was nine years old, and it insulted my intelligence then. Having just seen a few fragments recently while my younger siblings were watching it, I decided to do a comprehensive criticism of exactly WHY it was so terrible. And let me tell you, there are plenty of reasons. Here are my top three.Number One: StoryOkay, so the concept of ""Parents were spies, kids find out, have to rescue parents before plot to take over the world is successful,"" isn't actually ALL terrible. It has some holes, and is admittedly pretty cheesy, but isn't so bad, if executed right. Unfortunately, this movie wasn't executed right, for several reasons. First off, where the Tartarus did the script writer get the gods-awful idea to make the villain a kids TV show star?!? Yes, a sadistic, Burton-esque, disturbing kids show which uses mutated spies as it's actors, (more on that later) but seriously? What the heck? I seriously want to know what Muse (or lack thereof) whispered in your ear to have produced this bizarre monstrosity. Why did you choose to make the generic, faceless henchmen into THUMB PEOPLE? Why is your army of indestructible automatons disguised to look like children? Why did you have to make his base a fun house that seemed to have been designed by MC Escher in the middle of the ocean? Why are your supercomputers designed to look like little deformed cyborg brains? (perhaps to resemble the minds of the producers of this movie?) WHY?!? *Ahem, sorry.* Second reason: this movie brought the art of the cliché to an all-new level. Seriously, when my friend and I were watching this, we literally predicted EVERY plot twist. Keep in mind that we were nine-year-olds.""Oh look, there's a bad guy who serves the Demon Tellytubbies show guy! I'll bet he's the REAL bad guy, and has some connection with their parent's past!"" or ""Oh, look, they introduced Uncle Machete, but he doesn't want to help. I wonder how long we'll last until he shows up to save the day?"" And so on and so forth. In all, they could have done WAY better with the storyline, which was pretty much just crap.Number Two: Special FX Really guys, did you even try to make these effects look real? I'm all for CG animation, but honestly, you could have gotten better animation results from my 11th grade Graphic's Design class, and we were only using Photoshop! For example, during the scene when Mom and Dad Cortez drove their submarine car off a cliff, there was a glaringly visible change from real car to CG-ed car. All of the other fanciful technology (Escape Sub, Jetpacks, Thumb-Thumbs, Movie Room in Fruit-Loop Guy's castle, etc) was obviously green-screened. The lighting and shading was all off, the coloration was garish, gaudy, and generally crappy, and overall, the animation looked like a bunch of circus clowns came in and covered everything in overly polished balloon latex. It looked that fake. And don't get me started on the crummy rubber suits they did for the mutated spies. Really peoples? To quote the internet term, ""DERP."" Number Three: Psychological Damage I swear, as a nine-year old, this movie didn't die in my mind easily. Even now, many many years later, it still disturbs me. Maybe I'm overly sensitive, but I saw Lord of the Rings around the same time, and the grisly orcs didn't even make me bat an eye. Yet the Burton-esque feel to the main villain was just too much for me, and the floating eyeballs, mutated dudes with their overly happy squeaking and tittering, and tinkly music-box music didn't help. Seriously, overly cheerful and bizarre kids shows are the stuff of nightmare. It seems like they went all out to make this particular aspect as weird and disturbing as possible, and I really can't understand why. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't SCARY or intense or thrilling like a spy movie should be, it was just WEIRD. Sort of the creepy weirdness that's usually associated with clowns or carousel music. It just felt out of place and frankly, I'm surprised no-one else has sued this company for psychologically scarring their kids. I don't know how to describe it, I just was seriously weirded out by this factor.In all, this movie is scraping the barrel when it comes to entertainment, which is why I'm depressed that some relatively prominent actors like Antonio Banderas lowered their dignity and restating by participating in this blot on the name of film. Maybe they signed on before they realized what they were getting into, I don't know. The acting was the only commendable part of this film, which frankly wasn't much to work with. Kudos to you, the actors for a good effort, but not good enough to salvage this shipwreck. My only thought is that the gods must hate humanity to allow this monstrosity to exist. Which gods, you ask? ALL THE GODS! May mercy be had upon the souls of those who spawned forth this crime against art.",Spy Kids
