0,MartinHafer,"While aimed mostly at kids, it's a pretty sweet little film",8,10 June 2007,"This isn't a great film, but it does stand above the crowd of the many computer generated films. The quality of the film from start to finish is excellent and as far as insect films go, it's a lot better than ANTZ because it's much more family friendly and endearing. ANTZ was often rather dark in tone and also featured some very inappropriate voices for a kids' film. Whose bright idea was it to have Woody Allen do the main voice in a film where you would be creeped out if you actually saw him in the audience?! Would you let your kids sit next to him during the show? I would hope not, unless your kids are teens and looking to replace Soon-Yi.My overall impression of A BUG'S LIFE is that it is squarely marketed to kids and the studio threw in a few bits and pieces here and there for the parents. As a result, if your kids want to watch it with you, you won't be bored. However, if you don't have kids, I really doubt if there's enough here to merit your watching it--though it still is a lovely and well-made film.",A Bug's Life
1,TheLittleSongbird,Bug's Life is really funny!,9,18 February 2009,"Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can't remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox",A Bug's Life
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun charming family movie,8,1 December 2014,"Flik (Dave Foley) is an ant and a bumbling inventor. The colony is led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and the Queen. They work to provide tribute to a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey). However Flik loses the year's tribute and the grasshoppers vows to come back for their food. Flik has an idea to recruit warrior bugs from the city to fight the grasshoppers. The other ants are happy to get rid of Flik and sends him off on the suicide mission. In the city, he recruits a group of circus bugs who mistakes Flik for a talent agent.This is a good follow up to Pixar's breakout movie Toy Story. This is fun. The animation looks good and bright. The story has a funny charm to it. The circus bugs are a lovable lot. This is a great children's movie with enough to entertain the adults as well.",A Bug's Life
3,Hitchcoc,I Hope This Doesn't Bug You! Can't Help It!,8,11 March 2017,"The Disney animation is again top notch. Like the movie Antz, we have a rebel in the collective. The ant population has been victimized by the bullying grasshoppers who come by each year to collect their ""share."" They are like mob bosses. They are also huge, compared to the ants. So along comes Flik who because of his best intentions, makes things even worse. He is brought before a tribunal and banished. Of course, like any self respecting outcast, it is his job to reclaim his right to be part of the culture. He is creative and inventive and so he has the tools to manage this. Even though things are predictable, they still come off quite nicely, visually.",A Bug's Life
4,classicsoncall,"""Shoo fly, don't bother me.""",8,19 May 2018,"It all started with one of Aesop's famous fables, and then in 1934, Disney produced a classic Silly Symphony titled ""The Grasshopper and the Ants"". It tells the story of a single lazy grasshopper who fiddles his summer away living for the moment while his neighbor ants work tirelessly, squirreling away massive amounts of food for the winter months. When the cold finally arrives, the starving grasshopper is reminded of his laziness and lack of preparation by the ant queen, who allows him to stay with the colony if he plays his fiddle, in a sense, working for the food and warmth he'll be provided.Disney ups the ante in ""A Bug's Life"" by pitting a grasshopper warlord and his followers against a huge colony of ants by demanding that they provide food for them on a regular basis. Noting that the ants far outnumber the grasshoppers in quantity, little Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) embarks on a series of initiatives to free the ants from domination by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and his mean crew. I've read other viewer comparisons of the movie to Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven, and that might work except in one respect. When push came to shove, it was Flik and his own ingenuity that helped win the day for Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and the colony. With more than a little help from the voiceless, colorful bird that made bird food out of Hopper. I always get a kick out of the ingenuity and cleverness that goes into these animated features and this one provided it in spades. Very colorful and well drawn, the insect characters are unique and fun, especially the 'warrior' bunch from the circus. If you liked this, you owe it to yourself to look up the original Disney Silly Symphony, as the restored version is glorious with outstanding color and first rate animation. You can't go wrong with either one.",A Bug's Life
5,gavin6942,Pixar Does Ants,6,6 April 2015,"A misfit ant (Dave Foley), looking for ""warriors"" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, recruits a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe.At the time this came out, it was probably a big hit. And they certainly got a wide selection of interesting voices. But now (2015) it no longer really has that charm. The message of non-conformity is still good and not letting yourself get pushed around, but the animation is just so standard for Pixar that the wow factor no longer applies.I think I heard a rumor there is a ""Bug's Life 2"" on the horizon. If there is, I will no doubt watch it. And perhaps like ""Toy Story"", the sequel will be even better. But it might take a little work.",A Bug's Life
6,lee_eisenberg,"Sorry, ""Antz"" is the real deal",4,16 February 2018,"It was a surprise when ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"" (both computer-animated movies about formicids) got released a month apart in 1998. Most people called ""A Bug's Life"" the better movie, probably because they found it weird that the former had Woody Allen voicing the main character. Nonetheless, I saw ""Antz"" and not the latter; a trailer that I saw (preceding ""Beloved"" of all movies!) made it look childish, particularly with the line ""Turn off your butt!""Well, I've now seen ""A Bug's Life"". I have to say that ""Antz"" is the better movie: cleverer and not so silly. ""A Bug's Life"" has the occasional funny reference to the real world, but it's no match for ""Antz"".As for the cast. I don't know who Dave Foley is. It's a bit jarring to hear Kevin Spacey's voice, now that he's fallen from grace. The rest of the cast includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, Denis Leary, Madeline Kahn, Roddy McDowall and Edie McClurg. Put another way, it stars Elaine, a comedienne, the ref, Lili von Schtupp, Cornelius and Ferris Bueller's principal's secretary (McClurg also appeared as the clerk who receives a profanity-laden rant from Steve Martin's character in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"").",A Bug's Life
7,jboothmillard,A Bug's Life,9,8 July 2005,"I thought that Antz was really good because of the number of good actors, but this rival film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar did better business. Basically ants pick food for greedy grasshoppers, and disaster happens when Flik (Dave Foley) is responsible for ruining the offering. The grasshopper leader, Hopper (Kevin Spacey) with his gang give them till the end of summer to try and gather food again. Flik decides to leave the island, with Princess Atta's (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss) permission, to find warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers, and to his disbelief, what he brings back is a bunch of circus clowns. These are Slim (David Hyde Pierce) the stick insect, Heimlich (Joe Ranft) the fat German caterpillar, Francis (Small Soldiers' Denis Leary) the ladybird, Manny (Jonathan Harris) the magician bug with assistant Gypsy Moth (Madeline Kahn) and Rosie (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) the black widow spider. Anyway, they end up proving themselves when they build a bird, and after this fails they do succeed in scaring off the other grasshoppers, and Hopper gets what's coming to him. Also starring Tom and Jerry: The Movie's Richard Kind as Molt, Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as P.T. Flea and Fright Night's Roddy McDowall as Mr. Soil, his last film role before his death of lung cancer. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Musical or Comedy Score for Randy Newman, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. It was number 84 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 65 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!",A Bug's Life
8,ccthemovieman-1,An Early Demo Model For DVD,8,28 April 2006,"This was one of the first of the new animated films that came out when DVD was just beginning to catch on, and this really helped sell the new format by giving us a very sharp picture, bold colors and a fantastic 5.1surround sound, all a vast improvement over the VHS. In this instance, the sound was most impressive aspect.The story is pretty good with interesting characters, mainly the circus performers. As in most of these modern-day animations, there are so many astounding sights and sounds it would take many viewings to catch them all.The only negative in the movie is the typical Disney plug for the gay agenda. Here's it's the ladybug being really ""a man in touch with his feminine side."" Other than that, the film is family-friendly and far better than another animated film that came out at the same time: the profane and crude ""Antz.""This isn't a laugh-out-loud film but there are many amusing and clever lines which makes it fun for adults, not just the kids.",A Bug's Life
9,Tweekums,A fun insect adventure from Pixar,8,15 October 2012,"Every summer the ants must harvest grain for the coming winter; not just for themselves but for the bullying grasshoppers who demand half the harvest. One of the ants, an inventor named Flik, tries to find ways to make the harvest easier but the other ants aren't impressed; they prefer the old ways. When the grasshoppers come all the ants flee onto their anthill but as Flik adds his contribution to the pile he knocks it over and it is all lost. Hopper, the leader of the grasshoppers tells the ants that they must provide twice the normal amount of grain before the end of summer or they will take all the ants food and let them starve. Flik offers to go into town to get some warrior insects to fight off the grasshoppers when they return; his offer is accepted... not because he is expected to succeed but because it will get him out of the way. The only ant that has any faith in Flik is Princess Dot, but she is just a child. In town Flik meets a group of unsuccessful circus insects and mistakes them for warriors. He returns home a hero, but when is becomes apparent that they aren't warriors the colony appears to be doomed.This isn't one of Pixar's best films but it is still a lot of fun; the story is simple enough for young children to enjoy without being so simple that older viewers will get bored. Most of the character designs are great; I particularly liked the grasshoppers and the various circus insects. The only character design that I though was poor was the bird which is strange as it was probably the creature that looked closest to its real counterpart; perhaps that was the problem... it had no 'character' it was just a dangerous creature whereas everything else was anthropomorphised. The voice cast, which includes Kevin Spacey and a young Hayden Panettiere, do a fine job; I never though they sounded too 'cartoony'. Being rated 'U' there is little to offend here although some parents might find one or two of the gags involving the male ladybird a bit crude and there are some mildly scary moments that could possibly upset younger children.",A Bug's Life
10,Quinoa1984,One of the Best Animated Films I Have Seen This Decade,10,26 January 2000,"""A Bug's Life"" was much better than I expected.  This film made by Disney and Pixar pictures has elements that are good for the whole family.  I think this film is the best animated film since Pixar's last film, Toy Story. Mainly because both films have a lot in common.  Both films look into groups that we usually don't think (or want to think) about and how they have to overcome the odds against their enemies.  Both films have great animation, comedy and entertainment.  This film is not as good as Toy Story just because Toy Story was the first of the computer age animation.  Yet, this film is still extraordinary and is one of the best films of 1998 (by the way, watch the credits for the first bloopers with bugs).",A Bug's Life
11,Theo Robertson,Ah Grasshopper,6,10 April 2004,"To be honest I didn`t think I was going to like this animated movie much but I was fairly wrong in my presumption . My enjoyment is down entirely to the animation involved . You see I`m not very keen on bugs at the best of times and last night I drowned a couple of spiders I saw scuttling around my bath tub and I also squashed a woodslate beetle I found in my kitchen , but thanks to the superb animation I was convinced the characters in this movie weren`t pesky little bugs - They were as human as you and I
I do have a slight problem with A BUG`S LIFE and that`s down to a lack of plot in the screenplay , in fact watching this movie is like watching a James Bond film where there`s lot of set pieces ( Like hiding from a bird who realises it`s dinner time ) but little incident involving a wider picture . The main plot involves the ants trying to free themselves from the aggression of a colony of grasshoppers , but guess what ? , this doesn`t take place until about two thirds of the way into the picture , a shame since this stops A BUG`S LIFE being a very good family film but it`s still a good family movie Six out of ten",A Bug's Life
12,grantss,"Goodish fun, though a bit one-note",5,30 April 2020,"A colony of ants is under the thumb of the grasshoppers, who extort food from the ants. One ant, Flik, decides to do something about this. He sets out to the city to find some warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Hew returns with an assortment of characters he believes will be enough to battle the ant's oppressors, only to find that they're a troupe of circus performers.Okayish. Starts interestingly and originally enough: the mixing of the traits of the various bugs with human qualities was initially quite funny and clever. However, this wears off pretty quickly as this becomes the writer-directors' go-to form of humour.Similarly, the plot is initially quite interesting but soon degenerates into pretty basic action-comedy stuff.It all feels so predictable and basic after a while.This said, it is reasonably fun and does have some good comedic moments. Kids will love it.",A Bug's Life

14,view_and_review,The Winner Is...,7,5 December 2020,"In this edition of same movie same year we have ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life."" The edge goes to ""A Bug's Life"" by a long shot. This movie was funnier, a better story, less grim, and more kid friendly. Both movies focused on a singular ant who wasn't the best ant, but had bigger hopes for himself and the colony. They both had eyes on the princess ant. One of the biggest differences is the voice. ""Antz"" main character was voiced by Woody Allen (huge mistake) and ""A Bug's Life"" used Dave Foley as the voice of Flik.In ""A Bug's Life"" the ants were pretty much the slaves of the grasshoppers. Every season they had to collect an offering for the grasshoppers to keep them pacified. This season Flik upended the offering plate and the food was all lost. Instead of collecting a new pile of food, the ants decided to fight back. For their fight they recruited a ladybug, a black widow, a dung beetle, a walking stick, two rollie polies, a praying mantis, a butterfly, and a caterpillar. But would that be enough to ward off the fierce grasshoppers?",A Bug's Life
15,anaconda-40658,Watching Insects on Nature Shows is More Interesting.,5,25 January 2016,"A Bug's Life (1998): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: David Foley, Kevin Spacey, Denis Leary, Julia Louise-Dreyfus, David Hyde Pierce: Imaginative yet low key followup to Toy Story. Title suggests hardship with an ant colony under ruling by a gang of ruthless grasshoppers. One of the ants ventures for help and returns with a group of circus performing insects. Predictable events follow. Flick is the ant who foils everything. The new Queen fears failure. A spider creates anything from her web. Frances the ladybug has an identity problem. Directed by John Lasseter who made the previously mentioned Toy Story. Here he is backed with the same innovative images only this time the screenplay is much weaker. Voices by David Foley as Flik who is the low ant on the poll who has big hopes. He attempts to pull together help using deceit as an aid but we know his heroic fate. Kevin Spacey as Hopper the grasshopper leader is cardboard and uninteresting. Denis Leary as Francis the lady bug is perhaps the most interesting with his identity issue with perhaps the best lines. Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the Princess is pretty straight forward and dull. David Hyde Pierce voices a walking stick insect appropriately named Slim. While writing is weak families will no doubt enjoy its humour. It contains a strong theme of talents assisting in its animated world. Score: 5 / 10",A Bug's Life
16,safenoe,We need to talk about Kevin,10,17 October 2021,"I saw Antz in 1998 in the cinema, and a few years later watched A Bug's LIfe on DVD. Both are superb, but the latter more so, especially Kevin Spacey's role which shouldn't be understated. A Bug's Life is more optimisic compared to the dystopian Antz.Anyway, maybe a reboot is in order. If so, I nominate acclaimed British actor Danny Dyer to lead the voice cast.",A Bug's Life
17,Mr-Fusion,Proof that Toy Story wasn't a fluke,7,15 August 2017,"It's under-appreciated, but ""A Bug's Life"" has the ingredients for a worthwhile PIXAR movie; conflict, characters, inventive world-building. If you really want to tear holes, you could argue that the story's been done elsewhere (The Seven Samurai, Three Amigos, Galaxy Quest) but there's creativity here and it still feels like something new.And then there's the cast, all well-suited to their roles (with Spacey nailing the terrifying villain; what can't that guy play?) and the side players lend plenty of color. Does Denis Leary seem like a PIXAR fit? Nope, and it turns out he's a highlight.Seems pretty hard to dislike this movie.7/10",A Bug's Life
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,A whole lotta fun!,9,28 November 2006,"After seeing the movie Antz, I was very curious to see A Bug's Life because most people told me that it was better than Antz. Not to mention that Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor ever! But to be honest, I was a little nervous, because I remember seeing the trailer when I was younger and it looked like a typical kid's Disney/Pixar flick, but I was pleasantly satisfied and had so much fun watching A Bug's Life, it's a true treasure for the whole family.Flic is an ant who keeps screwing things up for his colony, his colony also collects food for the grasshoppers who threaten to beat up their colony if they don't. Flic feels like if he goes out and gets some warriors to help the colony gather food, maybe things will go by faster, but he ends up meeting a flea circus of different bugs. He tells them that they are going to a place where they could perform and being appreciated for it and he lies to the colony that they are true warriors, but everything untangles in Flic's lies and the grasshoppers are getting very impatient.A Bug's Life is a great story and excellent animation, I just loved the humor that was used because it was great for kids and adults. This was a great family film and one of my new favorites from Disney and Pixar. I would highly recommend it any time, Kevin Spacey is the man! 9/10",A Bug's Life
19,MovieAddict2016,"Pixar's Worst, But One of Animation's Finest in Recent Years...",7,18 April 2003,"""Toy Story"" was rooted in the fundamentals of childhood memories. All of us as children just KNEW our toys were alive. That they could talk. In turn, we played with them as if they were real. But soon it hit us that they were just pieces of plastic with limbs, and tossed them out. That's what ""Toy Story"" did--it reinvented not only animation, but imagination; it was not only a children's film, but an adult's film, as well. It brought back fond memories of all of our childhood fantasies.But what ""A Bug's Life"" does is simply toss together a few characters and have them bounce jokes off each other. This film, by itself, is excellent, but when compared to something smart, intelligent and witty, such as, say, Pixar's ""Toy Story,"" it looks like pure commercialism; Pixar's only downfall.A small ant named Flick (voiced by Dave Foley) is a real mess; a klutz, so to speak. He and his colony of ants, presided over by a new Queen Ant, are harvesting food for the naughty Evil Grasshoppers who come every year to gather food from the ant's hard work. But because of Flick the harvest is lost, and when the grasshoppers show up they are mad. Hopper, the lead grasshopper (Kevin Spacey) is pretty ""flicked"" off, and demands more hard work and labor. Everyone is mad at Flick...until he hires circus talents to fight off the grasshoppers, and tells the ants they are fierce warriors. Restoring their confidence to fight, the ants set up a series of attacks for when the grasshoppers arrive, until they find out the truth behind Flick's lie(s).""A Bug's Life,"" like ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" is a fairly simple idea. But, unlike the other Pixar films, it is missing a vital element: identification with the audience. In ""Toy Story"" we identified with the story; we were all kids once and had toys. The story just worked because it played with that.In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" the idea of monsters was played upon. All children at one time or another were scared of monsters under the bed, and by presenting us the monster's side of the story, ""Monsters, Inc.,"" could be enjoyed by both children and adults.And then there's ""A Bug's Life."" No identification here. How many of us have been bugs before? Exactly. Maybe on a more emotional level we can identify with Flick the Ant, but on a visible basis, we simply cannot. There really is no fun in the storyline. The story/film is above-average in terms of regular animated motion pictures, but in terms of Pixar films, it is simply a film best to be forgotten in Pixar's otherwise strong resume. Let's all hope that ""Finding Nemo,"" Pixar's upcoming summer film, is better than the ads lead to believe, because if I have it correct, I predict another ""A Bug's Life"" for Pixar next year.3.5/5 stars -",A Bug's Life
20,Rainey-Dawn,"A ""Buggy"" Film",9,23 October 2014,"This is one of Disney's best Pixar films. It's extremely cute and comical with a great story about ""A Bug's Life"". This is a humorous peek inside the life of bugs that is good for all ages.Hopper is very much a drill-sergeant figure in this film. He's funny yet a bit dislikeable - not the kind of guy you would want for a boss or manager that's for sure.Flik and Dot are as cute and lovable as they can be. Heimlich is a scene stealer - one of the funniest toons in the movie.The rest of the characters are great as well - so you are in for a fun time when you watch this ""Buggy"" film.Good companion films: ""Antz"", ""Ice Age"" and ""Madagascar"" 9/10",A Bug's Life
21,OllieSuave-007,A super bugs story.,8,8 July 2015,"Disney and Pixar studios team up once again and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a misfit ant named Flik, who accidentally drops the food offerings his colony gathers for the fierce gang of grasshoppers, leaving his fellow ants to gather twice as much food for the fierce bugs. To help his colony rid their land of the hopping menace, Flik tries to seeks out warrior bugs that would help out but, instead, he unknowingly returns to the colony with a circus crew.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic as it cleverly shows a bug's world from their point of view. The story is full of adventure, from Flik running into the flea circus to the ants trying to defend themselves from the grasshoppers. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate the bug humor and, of course, it's typical for a Disney animated movie that the filmmakers would make the ladybug character a guy in the story.There are some slow plot points in the first half of the movie, especially during Flik's solo scenes, but the plot picks up steam during the second half, especially when the circus and ants conjure up the plan to defeat the grasshoppers. It is also notable that the film concentrates on redemption, endurance and never-say-die attitude of the ant colony, proving that even the ""little guys"" are ferocious and determined.Just like the Toy Story movies, this animated film will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination.Grade B",A Bug's Life
22,FeastMode,good movie for all ages,6,14 June 2020,"Fun and entertaining movie. pretty funny. felt a little off at times but enjoyable overall (about 3 viewings, 6/13/2020)",A Bug's Life
23,ElMaruecan82,What's bugging bugs...,7,14 August 2016,"You know the fable from Aesopus (or La Fontaine) with ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"", the ant works the whole summer gathering food for winter while the grasshopper idly sings and enjoys the sun and when winter comes, he realizes, a bit too late, that Karma is a bitch, and so is the ant. Loosely (very loosely) translated into Disney language, the grasshopper becomes the villain who forces the ant to offer him food for winter in exchange of ""protection"" from termites or bigger ants. But the story must sustain the movie format, let's make it a colony of ants versus a gang of greedy grasshoppers, and then work on a script à la ""Three Amigos"" and you get ""A Bug's Life"", Pixar's second film.So, if ""Toy Story"" was to 3D what ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was to traditional animation, well I guess that makes ""A Bug's Life"" a little bit like ""Pinocchio"", at least as far as chronology and technological improvement go, this comparison is valid, but while ""A Bug's Life"" didn't hold up as well as ""Toy Story"" 18 years, for the film's defense, it has nothing to do with quality. Indeed, this is a marvel of animation and entertainment and the technological accomplishment it represents says a lot about the progresses made in three years.Drawing toys is one thing and I said about ""Toy Story"" that it had the merit to put the setting in a very cozy and familiar environment instead of the usual forests and castles. In ""A Bug's Life"", we go back to the forests, but on a smaller, smaller scale and the level of detail is so phenomenal, each frame must have required a lot of hours of works and remember there are 24 frames per second, and many frames contains dozens of character, because, hey, they're insects, small creatures.""A Bug's Life"" is the result of thousands and thousands of hard working and the animators deserve all the credit for not having surrendered to the 'easy way', during the mass scenes, I closely looked at the ants in the background, you never have the feeling of a block or repetitive shots, and from what the trivia said, they used a computer program that would animate several group of ants randomly placed in each part of the screen, and it contributes to convey a realistic mass effect. And that's how we imagine ants.Of course, the film is not just about ants but is a tribute to that underworld (literally) that inspires a constant fascination and revulsion. I hate insects but for some reason, I'm fascinated by documentaries about them as if the best way to finally look at the forms, the shapes, the colors, the interactions with other insects or the outside world or fights is to make sure they're not here. Not that ""A Bug's Life"" has a documentary-like value like the great ""Microcosmos"" but even on a documentary, I would have had a hard time enjoying the sight of cockroaches or grasshoppers. In ""A Bug's Life"", insects are cool to watch, and from their standpoints, rain doesn't play a salvation role anymore and cute birds are like scary monsters, time have changed since ""Bambi"".But if ""A Bug's Life"" had everything to please the eyes, and to entertain, so why don't we celebrate it like ""Toy Story""'? I guess it was released too soon without having the privilege of a sequel younger audiences could appreciate, it's hard to carry a reputation when you're made just between ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"". And it's all justice that ""Antz"" suffers from the same fate, the two films, from rival studios were released the same year, and it's obvious there was some leak, but let's accept as a happy ending that they didn't go to court (although it did terminate some friendships) and that both did well at the box-office but I think I would paraphrase the Emperor Joseph's quote by saying ""there were too many characters"" and I'm not saying that was the problem within the story, but about its appeal.Take the ants, they are a colony where each one has a role to play, some carry the food, some guide them etc. they can't think of individuals, except for the queen, her heiress, princess Atta (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) and her sister Dot (young Hayden Pannetiere) but apart from this podium, all ants are just ants, the one who emerges from the mass is Flik, the outcast inventor who always fail (one of his last inventions will cause the destruction of the offering for the grasshoppers, forcing them to prepare food again hence depriving themselves from winter food). Flik is an individual yet the story can't allow us to root for one individual, they're insects and they all work as group, even the mercenaries he's supposed to hire, in reality circus workers covering different personalities, there is not one to stand above.The film is a triumph in characterization and high-scale animation, but take all the movies that succeeded after ""Shrek"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters & Co"", there was a core of significant characters, Shrek and Fiona, Woody and Buzz, the more you identify with one, the more positively you respond to the spectacle. In ""A Bug's Life"", we do empathize with the ants as a whole, but it's hard to feel any stronger toward them. You admire the artistic design, the set of colors, the little jokes here and there, but the only real lesson is that there is strength in unity, but this is a message you can respond to in a war or a sport movie and even then you have the main protagonist.Animation is a world of magic and dream, to be enjoyed in a more individual way, where you can hook your heart on one person. ""A Bug's Life"" should have been called ""Bugs' Lives"", it's great animation but not necessarily a great film.",A Bug's Life
24,paul2001sw-1,A semi-wonderful life,7,11 April 2004,"'A Bug's Life' lacks the mordancy that made the humour of 'Toy Story' so appealing to adults; but there's still much to enjoy in this animated film. The cutesy heroes are pretty bland, but the evil grasshoppers are wonderfully brought to life, the asynchronous movement of their multiple limbs a joy to behold.  The real thing that's lacking here, certainly compared to 'Wallace and Grommit' (but 'Toy Story' also), is a sense of pacing: as if the film-makers lack the courage to let you simply marvel at their vivid creations, the film is action-packed but fairly monotonous in mood; and again unlike 'Toy Story', the viewer's perception of the characters is not shifted during the course of the film.  These may sound like very 'adult' considerations; but the best animations can appeal to the child in us all.  'A Bug's Life' is superficial even for a children's tale; but fun nonetheless.",A Bug's Life
25,g-bodyl,Very Good Piece of Animation!,10,8 October 2008,"A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.",A Bug's Life
26,John6Daniels,Bug Life vs Antz,9,28 September 2021,"Bug Life is good although its Disney hash because it follows the same formula of movies past and present. Antz was the solider film of the two.Bug's Life is about bugs going on an adventure. It has the cool bug, the dumb bug, the ugly looking villain bug because they are evil and the other cliché Disney personalities. It also ends in the cliche final battle where the main character wins...Again. YAY!!Great animation. It was the 2nd batter after the juggernaut Toy Story, so you would imagine during production that there was a lot of stress to compete with Toy Story. In the end Toy Story has 4 and an upcoming 5th while Bug's Life has been forgotten.Overall, a good movie complete with the traditional Disney formula.",A Bug's Life

The movie was well liked and Pixar of course went on to be come a leader in animated movies.The movie is simple, and plays on the old Greek story of Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper.The all star cast and the superior animation really makes this a movie for the entire family. The only thing I don't like about it is forced scenes where deus ex machina is used to push the movie forward. It is my personal belief that deus ex machina is a lazy way to write a script. Deus ex machina has one usage with my support and that is when it is used to end a story, like in War of the Worlds.",A Bug's Life
30,Anonymous_Maxine,Another wonderful family adventure from Pixar!,9,28 April 2008,"Lately I have been watching a lot of Tom Hanks films and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson's early Bean performances, and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work, something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages, in a way that just makes you feel good. A Bug's Life has that same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects, because even though they talk, they still ACT just like real bugs. It's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.Honey, I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger, and to me, A Bug's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities. I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story (which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made), because the story of A Bug's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story's, but then again, almost nothing is. The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun. The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society, mostly geared around building a harvest of food, most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers, vastly superior in strength and general meanness, and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter. We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, the consequences will be dire. And incidentally, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the ""Great Leap Forward""The fun and excitement begins when Flik, the main character, sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers. You see, he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger, so he feels it's his responsibility, but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers. Great for the audience, not so great for the safety of the clan. The movie was released back in the late 90s, when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos, like Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and The Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antz, etc. Comparisons between A Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, although it seems clear to me that A Bug's Life is by far the superior film, and not only because it doesn't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role. This is great family fun!",A Bug's Life
31,southdavid,Ant-iseptic,5,29 June 2020,"I've always viewed ""A Bugs Life"" as the Pixar film that got away, the one that nobody loves like ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"" or even ""Cars"", but a slight rejig of the alphabetical order on Disney Plus pushed it up to being the next film on my list to watch. I remain underwhelmed.Flick (Dave Foley) is an ant, whose colony pays protection food to a group of violent grasshoppers at the start of the summer. When he accidentally destroys the offering, he leaves the village to look for a group of tough bugs to come and protect the colony from the grasshoppers and their monstrous leader Hopper (Kevin Spacey). Triumphantly returning with who he believes are just the creatures for the job, he's distraught when they reveal to him that they are, in fact, a circus troupe.So I really didn't enjoy ""A Bugs Life"". I don't want to take away anything from the monumental effort that goes into making any form of animated film, but the film does look pretty dated now. The tree and plant effects are pretty convincing still but the characters, particularly facially have a dull plastic-ness to them. There's a ""dead behind the eyes"" look to them that fortunately Pixar managed to overcome pretty quickly going forward from here.That's not the only problem though. The storyline is pedestrian and familiar given it's a reworking of ""Seven Samurai"" or perhaps more closely ""Three Amigos"", and the script lacking in genuine moments of humour. There's a dissonance between the world that the Ants inhabit - essentially, just an empty hole in the ground, and the trash reconfigured to reflect the human world that the rest of the insects have, with bars, restaurants and circuses.I don't want to go overboard with my criticism, there's no one area so spectacularly awful as to undermine the film, it's just that the experience of the film is consistently underwhelming.",A Bug's Life
32,Vartiainen,Kurosawa would be proud?,7,22 February 2018,"It's Seven Samurai... except with ants. Kinda sorta.Okay, allow me to explain. A Bug's Life, the second ever Pixar film, tells about a distant and isolated ant colony who have been harassed by a swarm of grasshoppers for time immemorial. Every summer they arrive, every summer they eat their food, every summer they promise to come back. Until one day, through an unfortunate accident, there is no food for the grasshoppers to eat, and they threaten to flatten to colony unless they can gather enough food for them. Unfortunately, there's not enough time left to do so. So an unlucky ant, named Flik, volunteers to go look for help. He finds warrior bugs. Or at least he thinks he does.That's a kid-friendly version of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Or a kid-friendly version of The Magnificent Seven, if you're more familiar with the westernized version.Of course it's not quite as cut and dry as that, but you can definitely see the inspiration behind the whole thing. And it works. It's a classic story for a reason and this is a mighty fine retelling of that. The characters are likable, the action is enjoyable, the film looks colourful and there are good morals to be learned.Then again, the computer effects have not aged particularly well. The grasshoppers still look menacing and scary, but the ants look plasticky, the backgrounds belong in a low-budget video game and overall it has this feel of where the bar was lowest to it. It also suffers from the problem of having a character or two too many. Seven Samurai could get away with it. That movie is over three hours long. A Bug's Life is barely over an hour and a half.Still, I have fond memories of this film and it was still an enjoyable hour and a half even as an adult. Pixar has nothing to be ashamed of, especially given that this was only their second outing.",A Bug's Life

Don't get me wrong, this movie can be enjoyed by adults, such as me. I was a child when I first saw this movie and now as an adult, I still really enjoy it.In this movie, we step into the world of bug's and see how they live. It's so cool. Every year, a bunch of mean grasshoppers comes to the anthill, our main characters, and eat what food they have collected. How rude is that? Anyway, one day, when preparing the food, Flik, accidentally drops some of the food and now the ants don't have enough for themselves and the grasshoppers. The grasshoppers give the ants one more chance to get the food, so Flik sets off to find bugs that are willing to help them stop the grasshoppers reign of terror, once and for all.Fun Fact: Robert De Niro turned down the role of Hopper.Overall, I give this episode a 7 out of 10.",A Bug's Life

The characters were developed well enough to allow them to endear themselves to the audience.I can't say this is a wonderful movie, but the kiddies will like it, and if you're into children's entertainment, you probably will, too.If you enjoy this work, you should watch James and the Giant Peach, a movie which was released 2 years prior, and is obviously the template for this one.

Great voice acting from an all-star cast, a few good jokes for every age range, villains that manage to be threatening but not terrifying and a plot that's simple enough to draw anybody in, but deep enough to snag them for the duration.

37,CubsandCulture,If possible the only underrated Pixar film,10,28 December 2020,"If I had my way there would have been a A Bug's Life series as a opposed to a Toy Story one because this is the more striking and complex work. Inspired in equal parts by Aesop's Fable and The Seven Samurai this tale of ant colony trying to free themselves from oppressive grasshoppers can hold a lot more meanings in it than the first Toy Story. I *honestly* think it is the best dramatization of Marxism 101 I have seen in American cinema-a deep irony given that Disney, Pixar have always been run by the ultimate capitalists. While a class reading is most obvious basically any social oppression can be read in the film. It handles these issue almost entirely subtextually and the *plot* reveals the *theme* without being preachy. Re-watching this today again reminds me how much the story stayed with me because of its themes of fairness and equity.Now this isn't to say the film is a mainly a political polemic. It is not. The surface entertainment is just great. The blend of insect inspired sight gags and the goofiness of the circus performers add up to a very funny film. The voice case embody the characters entirely. The little stories-Flick's romance, or the Queen's retirement or the circus performers various foibles-are blended into the main plot just so; the film is a charmer the entire time.The animation is just gorgeous; unlike Toy Story *all* of it still holds up.

42,aidanratesmovies,"Not perfect, but quite enjoyable",9,8 April 2020,"Although consistently entertaining, A Bug's Life fails to deliver on all accounts, by feeling more formulaic overall than its own interesting concepts sprinkled throughout. The film can be very humorous at times, but can also vary on the border of being overly-goofy and in result, some jokes do fall quite flat. The animation, although not as great as its work shortly before, is quite good and full of vibrant color, which makes it very easy on the eyes. The music in the film is really good, with Randy Newman providing a stellar soundtrack, as he always does. The voice work is fairly impressive, with the circus bugs taking the lead in terms of voice work and in character development. The circus bugs are often the best part of the film, and their humor seems rather genuine and their story very engaging, unlike some tropes used earlier with the ants themselves. However, the ant Dot in the film can prove to be quite an adorable change of pace throughout, and stole the show in every scene she was in. In the end, A Bug's Life is far from Pixar's greatest work, but is a mildly enjoyable time. It has a wonderful cast of supporting characters, and is full of vibrant colors, and a score that is very easy to listen to.

43,questl-18592,A Blah's Life,6,30 September 2019,20 years after the release of A Bug's Life and... It hasn't really held up all that well. The visuals are no longer impressive and the story is sort of basic. The misunderstood outcast gets shunned but then eventually saves the day and becomes a hero.It's no one's favorite Pixar movie and it's not hard to figure out why. It's ok. Just ok.,A Bug's Life
44,Spleen,"""An epic of miniature proportions"" ... that's the problem",7,1 January 2000,"So far as appearances are concerned, ""A Bug's Life"" is superb.  The art direction stylises the world of rural insects subtly but surely; and, although I can't help thinking it was a mistake to include any evidence of HUMAN civilisation, that was beautifully done, too. And I applaud the courageous decision to avoid pointless sophistication when designing the insects themselves: they have exactly the robotic design one would expect of creatures with exoskeletons, they move with a minimum of squash and stretch, yet they are not at all lacking in humanity.  Any aspect of the visuals I have forgotten to mention probably deserves praise, too. (With the possible exception of the ladybug design.)That aside, this is a ninety-six minute film that wants to be three hours in length. Compression has wrenched it out of shape.  It's a mess; and the computer-generated equivalent of fine camera-work and competent performances can't save it.  With a film that tries to do so many contradictory things with its allotted time it's difficult to know where to begin.Take Flik, the social misfit who makes good. Many of the crimes for which the colony rejects him are, in fact, serious ones: he DOES lie to them, he DOES wreak real havoc, he IS dangerous. This shouldn't stop him from being a sympathetic hero, of course. But it ought to give us pause. If his failings are real, which they are, and integral to the plot, which they are, they ought to have more than a few seconds of screen time devoted to them. Ideally, they ought to be resolved.Or take the civilisation-versus-barbarians theme, which the film's climax retrospectively underlines, but which is hardly even mentioned beforehand. Or take the relationship between Flik and the princess, which is never defined, which changes from scene to scene, but which, we are led to believe, is a central part of the story. What IS the story, anyway? It's hard to see for all the sub-plots. Or for all the characters. I don't object to crowding the world with so many characters and then paying attention to each of them in turn, but it takes a lot more than 96 minutes to do this kind of thing properly.Despite trying to do too many things at once and doing none of them well, ""A Bug's Life"" has some thrilling moments.  It's because of them that I'm reluctant to dismiss the film as a turkey -- well, let's be fair, a chicken -- in peacock's feathers. It's not that the film is positively BAD: it's just that it fails (visuals aside) to be positively good, as it's so obviously trying to be.One last note: I know people liked the ""bloopers"" at the end, but having seen ""Toy Story 2"", I think they were a mistake.  The gag suited the Toy Story world better. Toys are MEANT to be part of games of make-believe: they are ""acting"" almost all the time, so treating them as actors in the end credits doesn't jar. It sure jars in ""A Bug's Life"", though.",A Bug's Life
45,gazzo-2,oh yeah,8,4 January 2000,"This was a scream-I loved every minute of it. The animation, the voices, the action, laughs...you have all seen it am sure, so no need to go back into the plot.

Leary was good), and Bonnie Hunt too as the spider.*Update 10 years later!* I saw this for the first time in ages, it STILL holds up awfully well. It's easy to forget it in the shuffle of CGI movies-the Incredibles or Nemo or anything Dreamworks puts out, but this should be remembered fondly, too. What a clever movie, and it's so cool to have both Jonathon Harris and Roddie MacDowell in this, both now long gone. Ditto for Madeline Kahn.By all means, check this one out.

46,rosscinema,Another hit from Pixar,7,28 December 2003,"There are so many different stories that could be written about the world of bugs and this is an enjoyable one but I hope the creators of this film don't give up on making animated features about insects. The stories that could be used are endless! This story is about an ant colony that has to harvest food for the marauding grasshoppers that fly in every season. One of the ants is Flik (Dave Foley) who has big ideas but is accident prone and when the grasshoppers are about to fly in Flik makes a blunder that destroys the food that was picked for them. The grasshoppers are headed by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and he threatens the ant colony by telling them that when they return next time there had better be double the amount of food. The colony's Queen (Phyllis Diller) and her daughter Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are furious with Flik but he tells them about his plan to combat the grasshoppers. His idea is to leave the colony and venture out to find warrior bugs that he will bring back to fight off Hopper and the rest. They agree so Flik walks off to another area where bugs congregate and eventually he comes across a group of insects that want to help. The insects are ex-circus performers and are unaware that Flik wants them to fight grasshoppers. They think that they are brought in to perform for the colony.
This film was directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton who both created ""Toy Story"" and together they are helping to keep Disney's legend alive and prosperous. They have a good memory for the Disney classics of old and there are many observances (Both clear and obscure) of those films. The computer animation at Pixar seems to be getting better and better and a clear sense of this is the incredibly detailed scenes during the rainstorm. These scenes are a marvel to look at and its hard to figure how they could make these images so rich with intimate details. The story is rather amusing and I was reminded of ""The Three Amigos"" and ""High Plains Drifter"" as I watched this. This film came out the same year as ""Antz"" and I guess the comparisons are inevitable but I think that film has a more adult tone to its story. This film is more in line with its targeted audience of much younger viewers but I did enjoy both films for different reasons. Roddy McDowall is the voice of Mr. Soil and this turned out to be the last film that he ever worked on. This is another very entertaining animated film from the great Pixar Studios and probably the main reason for their success is that even though these stories are aimed at a young crowd both adults and children can enjoy them.

53,jaredmobarak,Flaming Death!A Bug's Life,7,25 November 2007,"When watching A Bug's Life for the first time in a long while, I couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's Happy Feet. As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort. Sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world. However, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. He is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages.When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. Compared to Antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. You don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production. The reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. All the bugs are finely crafted too. The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. While Ant Island is nice, it is just the outdoors. Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. From the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades, everything is done right.As far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices. No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit. I dare you to think of someone better. Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Princess Atta, as well as the always-fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper. Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits. Yes, A Bug's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar, a tradition that has continued on. With many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast. Full of ""those guy actors,"" it is people like Richard Kind, Brad Garrett, and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.Overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience. There are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun. Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters, Tuck and Roll, there isn't too much bad that I can think of saying about it.",A Bug's Life
54,Beta_Gallinger,"Not one of Pixar's stronger efforts, but it's still Pixar",7,4 February 2010,"Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length CGI animated movies they have made. ""A Bug's Life"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature-length debut, the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", which was the first ever feature-length CGI movie. I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's, but I never actually saw it until November 2006. I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time. It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've ever seen, but after three viewings, I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation.Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants. These ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year. One member of this colony is Flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions, even though he doesn't mean to. One year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! The grasshopper leader, Hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season, but they will have to double their offering! Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back. Princess Atta, the future Queen, lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering. The inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors, but after he takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them, he learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs!The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters. To me, none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland. Fortunately, however, it's not like ""Shark Tale"", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character. ""A Bug's Life"" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for. The story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on. The humour, like certain other aspects of the film, isn't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving Francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female. You can always expect great animation from Pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception. With all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment.",A Bug's Life

Seeing a different kind of world when venturing in the movies have always been a delight to me. A BUG'S LIFE, once again, takes me to that glowing escapade. Introducing me to a different world, meeting different ranges of characters and freshen up with a good story as it goes along. All those delightful pleasures are here in A BUG'S LIFE. It has terrific animation, colorful characters and pure storyline, what more could you ask for in a film.Pixar, ever since they made TOY STORY, has gone of in a winning streak. A BUG'S LIFE still keeps their victory running. Thanks, mainly, to director John Lasseter who keeps a Disney tradition when making these movies. In A BUG'S LIFE, The animation and quality is strictly Pixar, but the story, about the cooperation and determination against odds against them, are the stuff Disney films are famous for.The film was released alongside another ant film entitled ANTZ, which sounds like they have similar plot lines. But their plots aren't that identical. While ANTZ appeals more to a mature choice of audience due to its mature characters, despite the child movie plot. Ask for A BUG'S LIFE, which tells the story of a colony of ants, bullied by a swarm of grasshoppers, who has nothing to do but lay around, is a less complicated plot. Thus, A BUG'S LIFE is the movie to show the kids more often, while ANTZ will be the adults'.I'm not just rating A BUG'S LIFE high because it's a terrific animated film. But also because it takes us, once again, to a different world, one where we set are imaginations free, free from the bounds of reality.Rating: ***** out of 5.",A Bug's Life

58,Animany94,"One of the weaker Pixar movies, but still enjoyable.",7,24 November 2017,"Pixar really started at the top with the spectacular mega hit Toy Story which still holds up as a great story with great characters. That isn't exactly the same with their second feature A Bug's Life. The story is not that unique to begin with. Heck, Pixar had a ton to live up to after the surprise of Toy Story, so it is forgivable. Flik is our neurotic main character who longs after being special, but is rejected by his colony which must provide food to feed the tyrannical grasshoppers, lead by Hopper, to avoid them attacking the colony. Given the fact that Dreamworks' Antz came out shortly before A Bug's Life they are quite similar. I guess you know the controversy surrounding those two movies. I think they both a good in their own ways, and what makes A Bug's Life good is the colours and the circus bugs as the comedic addition to the plot. They are the highlight of the entire movie and can make both kids and adults laugh. In my opinion Hopper as a villain is also doing a great job. When his colony of grasshoppers arrived at the ants' near the climax used to scare me as a kid. Their tall and menacing figures slowly emerging from the fog is bone-chilling. All in all, A Bug's Life is a good children's movie and adults may also find one or two things enjoyable, too. Mainly the circus bugs, though.",A Bug's Life
59,mitsubishizero,One of Pixar's best movies,9,16 July 2019,"This was a childhood movie of mine and needless to say it's aged well. The story's about a misfit named Flik (Dave Foley) who invents gadgets in hopes of improving his colony's work conditions but unsurprisingly they backfire and attract the ire of the other ants. It doesn't help that the ants are basically enslaved to the grasshoppers led by the cruel, manipulative and sadistic Hopper (Kevin Spacey) who threatens them after Flik accidentally destroys their food supply when one of his inventions backfire. After the grasshoppers leave Flik is tried afterwards where he convinces them to let him leave to get help for when the grasshoppers return. He treks to the big city where he comes across the Circus Bugs whom through a misunderstanding on both sides go back to his colony.After several hijinks ensure such as avoiding a giant bird and witnessing a graphic play put on by the kids the Bugs slowly integrate into the colony and Flik begins to get to know Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who's nervous about being the new queen. The movie's enjoyable to watch. The animation's a little dated but it's still good. The characters are well developed and enjoyable to watch. Sure they can be a little cliched but to be fair they do something new with them. The story's based off The Ant and the Grasshopper with a huge, creative twist. It's almost hard not to talk about this movie without mentioning Antz. I like both movies but I think the former's better. It has better animation, characters and jokes. A Bug's life is a great movie both kids and adults can enjoy. I highly recommend you check this movie out.",A Bug's Life

To help Flic and his fellow ants out, a group of mixed-up screwball insects from a flea circus are mistaken as fighting warriors who will save them.

The characters are still charming especially Flik and the villain Hopper voiced spectacularly by Kevin Spacey remains interesting. The music score from Randy Newman is still good, the story is entertaining and even touching and the pacing never drags.So overall, while I prefer the Toy Story trilogy, A Bug's Life still has enough charm and heart to make it stand out.

63,rebeljenn,A story of cute bugs,5,10 October 2005,"A Bug's Life is a cute film that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Like most family films, it has a colourful array of characters and the typical cruel but incompetent (and often amusing) villains. Not only are the characters lovable and the story fun, but A Bug's Life is also a learning experience and a story about morals and teamwork. It is a good film in which to escape into the tiny world of insects.A Bug's Life can be enjoyed by the family, and it is certainly more enjoyable than Antz, which was released around the same time. The only problem with A Bug's Life is the pacing of the story. In some scenes, too much happens and leads to confusion. Other scenes are slow and drawn out. It's not the best animation out there, but it's still a good film and worth watching on a rainy day.",A Bug's Life
64,Igenlode Wordsmith,Disney by numbers,4,26 June 2020,"This was a massive disappointment. I saw ""Toy Story"" long after it came out, when the whole computer animation hype was long since old hat, but still loved it at once. I really enjoyed ""The Incredibles"" and thought ""Ratatouille"", ""WALL-E"", ""Up"" and ""Inside Out"" took animated film to a whole new level. But it turns out ""A Bug's Life"" is... a whole heap of steaming clichs.Almost from the very beginning it felt as if they were sticking in just about every Hollywood/Disney trope aimed at the under-tens, many of them painfully inappropriate to the setting. Sorry, but ants don't have cute little child ants who set up a 'clubhouse' and save the world when the adults are busy giving up; ants have squishy larvae. Grasshoppers don't have mothers or little brothers. Worker ants don't have romantic moments with 'princesses', because worker ants are FEMALE. (And seriously, if you were going to design an ant-powered flying machine, why would you power it with child ants, instead of the strongest team in the colony? On the other hand, if it was originally designed for adult ants, how would the little ones even be able to get the wings to move?)And then of course we've got the whole 'misunderstood loner whose brilliant ideas always go embarrassingly wrong' scenario, which I also found so clichd and obvious as to be almost painful. And 'the power of family/friendship can overcome everything' and 'you just need to believe in yourself'... it's practically a checkbox list of standard tropes, and while the same messages appear in many, many good films (there's a reason why they're standard), here I rapidly ended up with the feeling that it was Disney product being done by numbers. Watching ""A Bug's Life"" versus ""Toy Story"" is like watching ""Flushed Away"" versus ""Chicken Run""; the magic isn't there and it's gone corporate.It was also very noticeable that for all the gnashing mouthparts and serrated limbs, the worst anyone gets threatened with in the script is getting 'stomped' or 'squished', which doesn't really match up to the visuals and again is rather obviously by-the-book for small children. The hero's Grand Plan is discarded (for no very clear reason -- why would the discovery of his deception about the circus prevent the planned 'scare-crow' tactic from working?) and then heroically launched again at the last minute and then after a prolonged show fails anyway. In another context that might have come across as stunning originality, but by that point it just struck me as being an excuse for this film to have its cake and eat it; for him to be a Great Inventor, but also demonstrate that true strength comes from love and the power of unity and standing up to your fears, blah blah blah.As a result the finale is incredibly prolonged -- like much of the rest of the film. The 'botched circus' scene at the beginning in particular felt as if it lasted far too long, partly I think because it was presumably supposed to be funny, and that's not my type of humour at all. (But then, thinking about it, that goes for quite a lot of the would-be-funny parts of this film.)I'm afraid I found ""A Bug's Life"" actively annoying from quite early on, and I'm not quite sure in all justice why. It felt cynically manipulative and shallow, as if you could see all the cogs turning and buttons being pushed, and being stuffed with bad biology didn't help. (Heinrich the fat caterpillar pupates and turns into... a fat caterpillar with wings?) I felt zero chemistry where the characters were concerned. Yes, it's a U-rated children's film that was never aimed at the likes of me in the first place, but a good children's film ought to work for adults too.After all, I've seen plenty of pictures that commit the 'sins' mentioned above, and loved them. ""Chicken Run"", for instance, features hens with teeth acting in a highly anthropomorphic way, and it even has an artificial flapping bird... but that production struck me as simply brilliant. And compared to a lot of children's films, ""A Bug's Life"" does more or less show its villain being killed and eaten, whereas a lot of classic Hollywood movies go to lengths to indicate that if the villain dies, that's absolutely not the hero's responsibility in any way.I think perhaps what irked me about it was that there didn't seem to be any greater depth -- any references that adults could be expected to get over and above the target audience. The humour remains on the level of ""Francis is a male 'lady'bird... haw, haw haw"", the romance is school-gate stuff, and the attempts at emotional manipulation aren't exactly sophisticated. It was like being subjected to a lecturer who persists in talking to a mixed audience as if they were all six-year-olds.",A Bug's Life

The colony then sends him away to ""go looks for bugs to fight the grasshoppers"" But it was really just busy work.

The head grasshopper Hopper (Kevin Spacey) promises to come back and destroy them so Flik is sent to go find ""warriors"". He finds them but they turn out to be circus performers.

67,emm,Disney's visual feast scratches the surface!,8,22 April 1999,"Let's remember this analogy for a moment and see if this makes sense: TOY STORY (1995) is to three-dimensional polygons as SNOW WHITE (1937) is to two-dimensional hand-drawn art. We have here two little movies that set all-new standards in cartoon animation. Now, I'm finally glad that Disney and Pixar waited three years by not leaking out their secrets kept behind locked doors, and A BUG'S LIFE is ultimately worth the impatience. This is the best looking 3-D showcase I've seen so far, even surpassing ANTZ, and has applied the same technical formula that TOY STORY gave to us. Of course, there are going to be more and better 3-D movies coming our way, but we're already tasting the future right now.It will be interesting to point out the comparisons between A BUG'S LIFE and ANTZ, both that has tiny little ants that appear large when seen off a projection television. ANTZ was a tried-and-true effort by newcomer Dream Works SKG; it just wasn't satisfying enough to hold its appeal to everyone, not even the children. It was also a little too slow in its animation, and was keen enough to make a Hollywoodian image for itself. Or even ""Woodian"", as in Woody Allen. It needed a lot more bite than it could chew, but that's ANTZ.Here, in A BUG'S LIFE, ""family"" entertainment is a whole definition not just for its intelligent sense of humor, but in the way Pixar established a whole new environment for animators to take better advantage of handling three-dimensional objects and landscapes. You want a lifelike cartoon to become a surrealistic universe that's far beyond our imagination. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo would be wandering around reflections of the sun and getting lost in the dark shadows. It's amazing how fast and slick this movie goes on its motions of ants running and birds flying even with colors that appear and shine as a glossy liquid. Whatever more there is to the tantalizing visual quality, it's something we all are going to look forward to the next few years, and it could threaten to dethrone the traditional cartoon as we know it. Tempting but frightening words, aren't they?The visuals aren't the only best things about it, but you can't knock down Disney for its timeless heritage of magical fun-filled wizardry. Let's face it, the movie looks so good enough to burst a chuckle or two. Or, if you handle it, say 99! Just as appealing to grown-ups as it is to children, the comedy relief bodes extremely well for an animated movie running on ultra-high speed microchips. It makes a new statement for the term ""ladybug"", which is sure to fool many! This is the finest example of creativity and delightfulness in a ""family"" picture sitting next to the original BABE. Sure, we can handle the modernization of its jokes any time!There is just one quibble though: the celebrities give this the all-too familiar voice of Hollywood. I wish there were more talented voice acts to liven up this brilliant looking movie a la creme rather than hiring overpaid TV stars and film actors. Oh well, at least they contributed to the characters with all their diligence.For those sitting in the front row near the boxing ring watching the fight and have kept track of the action, you'll see why A BUG'S LIFE wins over ANTZ by a stunning knockout in the first round, and so does Disney. I hate to question about Dream Works' further potential, but the studio sure has a long, long way to go before managing itself as a triumphant pioneer in ""family"" entertainment. It may not become the next ""Disney"" than we'd least anticipate.And for a while, you'd believe I'd give this one the undisputed title as ""The Greatest Motion Picture Ever Made""! Not exactly! But what a fine ""family"" movie this is! (Are you at all convinced that a bold summary like that would be the perfect fashion statement for presenting user comments? Like in TITANIC?)",A Bug's Life

He's an ant that lives with other ants. I like how these ants look. These ants are far from safe. They're constantly threatened by a group of grasshoppers who want their food. Their leader is Hopper who is bad. He's also mean. Hopper was played by a popular actor named Kevin Spacey. I was surprised about that. I'm a fan of his other movies. The ants, though, far outnumber those mean grasshoppers, but the grasshoppers are big, so they decide to find a way to stop those grasshoppers. The one leading the way is Flik. He decides to go out on a adventure to look for stronger bugs to save his colony from these greedy and hungry grasshoppers. He finds a group of bugs to help him to defeat them. Can they defeat them? They live at a place named Ant Island. The ants have a Queen who is the leader of the ant colony. She has a daughter - Princess Atta. She's going to be the next Queen. Flik and Atta happen to like each other. She has a sister named Dot who is Flik's friend. Hopper happens to be scared of birds, so Flik decides to make a fake bird to scare the grasshoppers away, and leave the Ant Island for good. Will Flik plan work? You need to see it to find out. Flik happens to be the best character. A Bug's Life is a good movie. It's about bugs, and the life of a bug. I like the animation. Surprisingly! There is no sequel. I think the story is there for a sequel, but at the same time, I'm glad there isn't a sequel. Either way, it doesn't matter. I like the movie.",A Bug's Life

Colorful, vibrant and full of fun characters for children, ""Vida de Inseto"" also has great advice for parents! When someone tells you that ""Insect Life"" is a film that talks about ants trying to get rid of locusts, answer: YOU ARE WRONG! ""Vida De Inseto"" talks about leadership in several aspects: leadership within an organization or company, leadership within the family, and mainly, leadership within a country; and the subject is approached in different ways, exemplifying various types of leaders: the selfish leader, the experienced, the arrogant, the apprentice, the leader who is not a leader but leads, etc ... Everything is well written and developed, perfectly fit into one child's drawing. Another important message conveyed beautifully is that the united people are stronger than any oppressive leadership, it is a 1998 film that is more current than ever. Brazil needs to re-assist and reflect on ""Vida De Inseto""! From a technical point of view, the film has aged well. The change that the past 22 years have made with 3D animation technology is clear, but the animation was old and remained beautiful, not old and ugly. Vida De Inseto is a great and very funny film, with a remarkable adventure, full of tension and adrenaline, which is packed with great messages and advice for young people and adults in 2020.Film seen on the 1st to the 2nd of December 2020.",A Bug's Life

73,policy134,A not so perfect interpretation of the old grasshopper and ant tale,5,4 September 2005,"Pixar's computer animation is of course top of the line here and in every movie they made to this date. However, the story this time is a little too bland this time to really involve an adult viewer, whereas kids below the age of 10 will probably eat it up. Flik, as voiced by Dave Foley, is just too darn nice and to make him an outcast because he is the most accident-prone ant in the colony will probably strike a chord with a lot of us but it doesn't really make the character funny. All of Pixar's character's from Woody to Mr. Incredible have many quirks but both Flik and the ant princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are too ""normal"".Things pick up a little after Flik goes on his journey outside the colony where he meets the circus bugs but the circus setting in a bugs world has been done so many times that you almost wish that they had chosen a different setting (the factory like in Monster's Inc. could have worked). The misfit bugs are of course comedic distractions from the very real threat that hangs over the Ant colony, that of the abusive grasshoppers who intend to do terrible deeds if they are not given their ill-gotten food. By the way, the leader, Hopper, is the most terrifying creature in a Disney film yet and his ultimate fate (minor spoiler) will probably frighten some kids. The voice of Kevin Spacey was a real surprise because he expresses more emotion here than he usually does in his live-action roles. The less said about Richard Kind the better.When you compare this to the other Ant movie that year, I will say that this is superior in the animation department but as many Disney ventures it is too darn cute this time. Check out the baby bug who believes in Flik like nobody else does and of the circus bugs only the ladybug, voiced by Denis Leary and the Stick by David Pierce are truly original characters.So a good time if you have kids but to teens and singles there are not much to offer, except seeing spectacular animation.",A Bug's Life
74,dilipbts,A bug's life,8,10 June 2020,"After dazzling everyone with its unforgettable debut that revolutionised the entire animation industry in the long run, Pixar Animation Studios' follow up to their highly revered Toy Story is another wonderful piece of imagination, innovation & animation that once again presents a unique take on life but this time from a bug's point of view.The story of A Bug's Life follows a misfit ant who thinks differently yet only ends up causing more trouble for his colony so when his latest escapade wastes away all the food ants had gathered to offer to the greedy grasshoppers, he decides to make up for it by finding & recruiting tough warrior bugs to save the entire colony from its oppressors.Directed by John Lasseter, A Bug's Life marks Pixar's second consecutive home-run & just like their previous feature, brims with so much creativity & passion that the narrative it puts on the silver screen remains finely balanced in storytelling department and is then taken to the next level by further refinement & advancement in their state-of-the-art animation.There are wide range of bugs to be found in this fable and the animators have done a fab job in envisioning, designing & rendering all of them. While none of its characters manage to be memorable, it's the sum of the parts that makes it click. The themes it deals with are nicely addressed, humour is effectively used, score is lightweight but fitting & it never loses its sense of fun.On an overall scale, A Bug's Life is definitely one of Pixar's most underrated films that may not have anything as memorable as the studio's best works but it nonetheless scores high marks in all filmmaking aspects to make up for an enjoyable & entertaining ride that viewers of all ages can benefit from plus delivers its message of 'strength in unity' with remarkable simplicity & effectiveness.In many ways, I find it to be a reflection of Pixar's very own modus operandi for it offers an interesting insight into the way these talented minds come together under one roof for the sole purpose of envisioning, creating & stringently refining stories that are fun & entertaining but also not devoid of heart, soul & emotions, with an added incentive to be able to do that without compromising with the art or quality of its medium.",A Bug's Life
75,departed07,A real charmer.,9,19 March 2008,"1998 was the battle of the bugs between Dreamworks' ""Antz"" to Disney's ""A Bug's Life"". While Antz was an animated movie of a Woody Allen (the voice of Z in Antz) film making references to psychology, Judiasm, sexes and other trademarks, A Bug's Life was just plain good old' entertainment where there were jokes for both the kids and adults to understand and not have to worry about a moral or being bored.If Antz dealt with the underground of ants and their life styles, then A Bug's Life has all the insects we keep as either pets or a collection of squished items on the floor.This film is about a little ant name Flik (voice by Dave Foley of Kids in the Hall) an inventor/screw-up where he messes up during the most important event of the season. The season of summer for ants is probably one of the most dreaded season since all the ants have to gather food for the menacing grasshoppers where the vicious leader of the gang, Hopper (voice by Kevin Spacey), thinks of the ants as inferior slaves where at any time they could have their head squish. Flik does something to lose all the food where everybody depends on him to be the hero to find somebody to step up to the grasshoppers. So the little ant goes into town to find any insects where in a sort of ""Three Amigos"" scenario he finds a group of bugs and ask to help him and the ant colony where he doesn't know that they're a bunch of circus flunkies.""A Bug's Life"" is a barrel of laughs where not only will people find this better than ""Antz"" but find something within all the characters.As for the cast line up prior to Dave Foley and Kevin Spacey, there's also Julia-Louis Dreyfus, Brad Garrett, Richard Kind, David Hyde Pierce, Bonnie Hunt, Phylis Diller, Denis Leary and more to make you want to come back for more.",A Bug's Life

But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous film from Pixar, is a lot of fun.  The two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland(especially compared to the two leads in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it.  The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good(I especially liked Hopper's line ""If I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you!""), and the actors doing the voices, except the two leads, were all terrific(Denis Leary doing an animated movie; what a concept).

80,JakeBrinkman,Still holds up after 2 decades,7,20 February 2020,"I watched this movie in 2020 immediately after watching Pixar's detail animation masterpiece The Good Dinosaur (2015). I was expecting Pixar's 2nd film that is nearly 2 decades older to really stand out as a dated movie, but to my surprise A Bug's Life isn't a victim of the years. Of course it's behind when you really focus on the details, but the visuals are presented so well that it keeps the viewer focused on the most intricate items on the screen, allowing the brain to ignore rendering quality and be swept up by the story.The story begins fairly childish, especially by comparison to most of Disney and Pixar's other films. If you can put up with the intro, it quickly grows into a charming story with several clever ideas and jokes. And the villains are truly menacing, which had me filled with tension hoping the ants' plans work out. Unfortunately tension and humor were the only emotions this movie could bring out in me, but I have to give them credit for the rare feat of making me feel true apprehension from the kid's movie genre where heroes usually feel boringly invincible.",A Bug's Life
81,chrisbrown6453,Much better than Antz!!!,8,17 May 2002,"Ahh... The Disney/Pixar magic is back. I waited three years for A Bug's Life, and it did not disappoint. Unlike it's direct competition, Antz, A Bug's Life is a light hearted, fun filled adventure directed at kids, but good enough for adults. Flik (voice of Dave Foley) is an ant. And like all ants in his colony, he picks grains and fruits all year long. And once a year, the bad grasshoppers, lead by Hopper (voice of Kevin Spacey) come to the colony and take all the grain. The ants just accept this as their way of life. But one day Flik decides to do something different. He figures if the ants can recruit bigger and badder insects, they can scare the grasshoppers away, and keep all the food for themselves. So he heads to the ""big city"" to find some really tough bugs. Unfortunately for him, he finds some circus bugs who he thinks are tough. But he brings them back to the colony, and through the magic of luck, they manage to scare the grasshoppers away.Obviously everyone and their mother is going to compare A Bug's Life to that other bug movie that came out a couple months before. The biggest difference is that the other movie was aimed more at the adult crowd, while this movie is aimed towards kids. The characters are cuter, funnier, and more fun. With characters like Flik, and Dot, and Tuck & Roll (my favorites), A Bug's Life makes it fun to go to the movies. I didn't have any fun when I saw Antz. With Woody Allen's neurotic attitude, and all those dead bugs, I felt like I was watching an animated war film. With A Bug's Life, I felt like I was watching a light-hearted comedy with spectacular animation. I honestly felt that at times I was really watching bugs in my backyard. It felt so real it was amazing. And another thing I've come to realize, even in animation, it's important to have a story that people want to see. Now I realize Antz made a lot of money, but I'm not sure why. With A Bug's Life I felt like a kid again. I cheered for the good bugs, and booed the bad bugs. The circus bugs were cutely drawn, and the voices matched the bugs perfectly. Woody Allen as an ant just didn't fly for me. But David Hyde-Pierce as a stick bug was perfect. Basically what I'm saying is, if you want to see what real animation is about, a good story, fun characters, good voices, and most of all a good time, rent A Bug's Life. Besides, you get two pluses. One, they showed Pixar's 1997 Academy Award winning animation short, Geri's Game before the movie, and they had these hilarious ""outtakes"" during the closing credits. Quite possibly the funniest thing I've seen. So have a good time...",A Bug's Life
82,bsinc,Another great Pixar movie,8,11 February 2002,"I just love these animated Disney movies. They aren't made just for the kids and many adults find them to be very funny.

When the 2nd Toy Story was released they were the first to buy the tickets. This movie is very funny and entertaining and can be seen over and over again, a great DVD buy.   9/10",A Bug's Life
83,DavidSim240183,One of Pixar's less successful films,5,8 January 2008,"In 1998, an unusual coincidence occurred. The type that can only happen in Hollywood. Two computer animated films were released simultaneously about the world of ants. First off was DreamWorks Antz, an extremely entertaining journey into the social hierarchy of an ant colony. And A Bug's Life from those geniuses at Pixar.Any Pixar film is worth a watch because they're a delight in just about every respect. Flawless animation. Involving plots. Well defined characters. But most importantly, that shrewd level of intelligence that constantly keeps Pixar head and shoulders above other animated fare.But A Bug's Life is that rare thing. A Pixar disappointment. Its not a bad film. Pixar have never made an outright terrible film. Even the indifferent response to Cars seemed unwarranted to me.But A Bug's Life is a Pixar film that left me cold. Perhaps if I hadn't seen Antz first I might have liked it more, but somehow I doubt it. Because Antz is the type of film A Bug's Life wants to be but isn't. Its the one time where DreamWorks got one over on Pixar, instead of nipping at their coattails.Antz was a film conducted with a mind-boggling sense of detail. It convinced you there was a whole micro-sized world there beneath our feet. The failing of A Bug's Life is its story is so thin. It doesn't have the ambitious scope of most Pixar films, and its characters are some of the studio's most forgettable.ABL, it has to be said, falls into some very predictable storytelling. You can almost see the clichés being wheeled into place. The underdog hero. The comic sidekicks. The dastardly villain. There are none of the usual songs that Disney love so much, but ABL might have benefited from some.The comparisons to Antz are sadly unavoidable. Since it gets right what ABL gets so wrong, they make interesting bedfellows. Although I'm not much of a fan of Woody Allen, he was perfectly cast as the hero of Antz. A put upon ant suffering from peer pressure and his own neurosis. The hero of ABL feels like a lesser developed version of the same character.Flik, along with all the ants in his colony gather food for a gang of bullying grasshoppers every season. When Flik's bumbling puts a spanner in the works, Hopper (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the leader of the grasshoppers, demands an increase in their yearly supply.Flik refuses to stand by and watch his people work they're way into starvation, so he goes off to find help, and brings back a bumbling circus troupe of insects. But it doesn't take long for Flik to learn the truth about his would be saviours. Or for them to learn the real reason they've been brought to the colony. Even the most committed Pixar fan will probably be disappointed with A Bug's Life. A lot of people say Cars was the first fall from grace for the mighty Pixar. This isn't true. ABL was the first dip in quality for this great studio. Fortunately a rarity for Pixar.ABL is a film that cruises in neutral for far too long. Visually its a treat. Just like any Pixar film. But I preferred Antz' gritty, down and dirty aesthetic. They looked like real ants. The ones here are much too colourful and cuddly. They're much too user-friendly.The best type of Pixar film is one that opens itself up to a world of possibilities. Finding Nemo presented us with a breathtaking ocean world. The superb Toy Story 2 (also underrated in my opinion) brought Woody and Buzz Lightyear out of the confines of a kids bedroom and into the big wide world where they had one hell of a rollicking adventure!Because ABL stays in one place for so long the film suffers as a result. Perhaps if it had some engaging characters to focus on, it might have compensated. But nobody here registered with me that much. In fact as I write this, I can't even remember half of they're names. Flik is pretty disposable as a hero. So is the Ant Queen and Princess. And the circus troupe, though voiced by true talent like David Hyde Pierce and Denis Leary, is never allowed to cut loose.The only actor who gets into the show with any lasting impression is Kevin Spacey. He makes Hopper wonderfully loathsome. The type of villain you really love to hate. And his comeuppance is very satisfying (if a bit grisly by Disney's standards).What's missing from A Bug's Life is the smoothness Pixar films usually flow with. There's not a solid enough hook to hang the story from, like there was with Buzz Lightyear finding out he was only a toy. Or little Nemo getting lost in the vast depths of the ocean. A few nice ideas here and there (like a scarily realistic moving bird and some genuinely funny outtakes over the end credits) but A Bug's Life is by far Pixar's most disappointing film.",A Bug's Life
84,TaylorYee94,Comparison with 'Antz',8,19 December 2020,"Back then, it was a really heated feud between Dreamworks and Pixar. The storyline is surprisingly similar; one original ant who wants to find himself among uniform and factory-line colony ants ends up saving the colony and falling in love with a princess. (A. Antz B. A Bug's Life)Animation quality. B. The latter is more vibrant, dynamic, and realistic. It also sketches many different places other than anthills.Story. B. It is richer and more flavorful, bringing in many characters and perspectives to the main story. The plan the hero saves the entire colony is more full-fledged.Characters. B. The protagonists and their princesses in both movies are very attractive, having their own stories and overcoming obstacles. However, all the different bugs in 'A Bug's Life' are such wonderful and fascinating side characters, taking a slight advantage.Message. A. Both movies show how the common people's willpower, confidence, and solidarity can triumph over authoritarian power. 'Antz' is more dramatic at the end , and the existence of Colonel Cutter who comes to realization at the end and stands by the hero adds more excitement to the movie.Overall, both movies are creative and compelling. From many perspectives, 'A Bug's Life' has the upper hand, but the differences between two in each category are all narrow.",A Bug's Life
85,joelwatchesmovies,Excellant film,8,12 June 2020,"Some of the extra computer-y 90s PC game animation bugs me a bit (couldn't resist) but that's the only real flaw of this excellant offering of clever world-building (see the bug bar-where everyone can get a good buzz), great humour, and an engaging protagonist in the creative but hard-luck Flik. The surprisingly dark antagonist climax (""Let this be a lesson...Ideas are very dangerous things!"") and the inspiring hero moment after (""You're wrong, Hopper"") highlight some compelling themes as well.

""A bug's life"" tells the story of a colony of ants that are terrorized by grasshoppers who demand from them that they give them every year food so they can sit on their lazy asses. Everything goes well till some ant Flik (known for being the Baron Von Munchausen in his colony) is responsible for having the collected food dissapear, he is sent to town to find some fighting bugs who can make an end to the domination of the grasshoppers.

89,La Gremlin,Underrated but very cute.,9,20 October 2000,"While not as absolutely perfect as the ""Toy Story"" movies (indeed, that's a very tough act to follow), ""A Bug's Life"" is very enjoyable movie.  It's one of the very few animated movies that works well for adults and kids, the script is incredibly well written, and the artwork is bright and adorable. 
I want to make one last comment on that last aspect.  This summer, a lot of noise was made about how Disney's inventively titled (I hope you can all hear the sarcasm dripping off of that statement) non-Pixar-involving (and man, did that make a difference) computer animation -err- ""movie"" (""Dinosaur"", if you haven't guessed yet) had backgrounds that were real live-action footage.  Only the characters were animated.  Well, watching ""Bug's Life"" again, I have to ask, what was the point?  The backgrounds in ""Bug's"" are stunningly beautiful, and the characters interact with them convincingly.  The characters (if you can call them that) in ""Dinosaur"" were less convincing than the animated creatures in a Ray Harryhausen movie. Much less.  There's a lesson to be learned here.",A Bug's Life

The last thing I said was in ode to the fact that an ant hires a small band of outsiders to help with a raiding band of tough insects hellbent upon ruling over the poor poor ants ( even though there's millions of them). But this is all lost on children. all that would get through is the bullying and the colorfullness. Thats it. 5.5/10 is generous at best.

I haven't seen anything this detailed since Toy Story. It's also inspired by that fable featuring the grasshopper and the ant. I remember that story vaguely but could not find it again. Regardless of the source, if you're an insect lover, this is mandatory viewing. It may not be entirely accurate, but no movie is entirely accurate. Sometimes you just have to suspend some disbelief while watching movies. So get on it!",A Bug's Life
92,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Great on from Disney/Pixar!,6,18 June 2008,"There was such a magic on the screen in 1995 when the people at Pixar came up with the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story. Their second feature film, A Bug's Life, may miss the bull's-eye but Pixar's target is so lofty, it's hard to find the film anything less than irresistible. Brighter and more colorful than the other animated insect movie of 1998 (Antz), A Bug's Life is the sweetly told story of Flik (voiced by David Foley), an ant searching for better ways to be a bug. His colony unfortunately revolves around feeding and fearing the local grasshoppers (lead by Hopper, voiced with gleeful menace by Kevin Spacey). When Flik accidentally destroys the seasonal food supply for the grasshoppers he decides to look for help (""We need bigger bugs!""). The ants, led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), are eager to dispose of the troublesome Flik. Yet he finds help--a hearty bunch of bug warriors--and brings them back to the colony. Unfortunately they are just traveling performers afraid of conflict. As with Toy Story, the ensemble of creatures and voices is remarkable and often inspired. Highlights include wiseacre comedian Denis Leary as an UN-ladylike ladybug, Joe Ranft as the German-accented caterpillar, David Hyde Pierce as a stick bug, and Michael McShane as a pair of unintelligible pill bugs. The scene-stealer is Atta's squeaky-voiced sister, baby Dot (Hayden Panettiere), who has a big sweet spot for Flik.More gentle and kid-friendly than Antz, A Bug Life's still has some good suspense and a wonderful demise of the villain. However, the film--a giant worldwide hit--will be remembered for its most creative touch: ""outtakes"" over the end credits à la many live-action comedy films. These dozen or so scenes (both ""editions"" of outtakes are contained here) are brilliant and deserve a special place in film history right along with 1998's other most talked-about sequence: the opening Normandy invasion in Saving Private Ryan.The video also contains Pixar's delightful Oscar-winning short, Geri's Game. Box art varies.",A Bug's Life

94,adampkalb,"A great beginning to Pixar's lineup, and a great start to the careers of Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere.",9,15 July 2020,"A Bug's Life is an underrated Pixar classic that easily gets forgotten among the likes of Toy Story, Monsters Incorporated, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, all of which had sequels or prequels in the 2010s. It is still very good as far as standalone films with no sequel go, like Megamind or Turbo. I always admired A Bug's Life because it had a great universal message - if you stop doubting yourself, you can discover your true potential and do what no one else thought was possible for you. It works on so many levels because it is a lesson most characters of A Bug's Life have to learn - Flik, Dot, Atta, the circus troupe, and even Molt. All the casting choices are great. I liked having Dave Foley as Flik, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Atta, and Richard Kind as Molt, and I am glad they did not have more expensive or famous names whom voice acting was not for, like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Aniston and Jack Black. The best part is, Dave Foley auditioned for Slim, one of the supporting roles, but in the final cut, he got promoted to the lead role, Flik! A Bug's Life was the time of my life because it came out the year I was born, and it was also a big time for Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere since it was their first film role. A Bug's Life had a lot of talented TV comedy stars in it, with the only big movie names being Kevin Spacey (Hopper) and Denis Leary (Francis).Animated films are hardly any child's star-making role because you can not see them on screen, but Hayden Panettiere did such a great voice performance as Dot, it is a safe bet that this Pixar film was a good stepping stone to whatever her star-making role after A Bug's Life was. Ashley Tisdale also auditioned for Dot, but since she was 4 years older, she got another part as Lead Blueberry Scout, which was a much littler part than Dot, but still a good role to have, so this may have helped her too. I am happy for Ashley Tisdale and Hayden Panettiere to have a decent acting career after A Bug's Life because they never got too famous for animation like Jodie Foster did (after The Addams Family and The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan), and they had a lot of variety in their acting because of this. If you were a kid from Ashley Tisdale, Hayden Panettiere & Jansen Panettiere's generation, chances are you remember A Bug's Life and you are 4 years older than me. I was born 21 days before Jansen's 4th birthday.Dot was always my first most favorite A Bug's Life character because she always respected and believed in Flik when no one else did, and Dot was also an interesting child protagonist with an arc of her own. I believe Dot should qualify as a primary character of A Bug's Life as much as Atta or Flik are, especially since she got to narrate the Disney Storyteller audiobook adaptation, and she made an excellent narrator there. All of the circus bugs have interesting or endearing personalities, and my third most favorite character is Slim. David Hyde Pierce really stole the show with his deadpan delivery. However, my second most favorite character is another scene-stealer that I really want to talk about: Molt! To emphasize the Kind in Richard Kind, Molt is the only kind grasshopper of A Bug's Life, and I love how he was written as a character. He was made to be a comic relief for the uncomfortable scenes with Hopper, and he is Hopper's brother because we know Hopper would never keep around someone so witless and annoying otherwise. Molt worked as a character in the story beyond that because while he is not the sharpest tool in the shed, he never annoyed us the audience (only Hopper and other evil grasshoppers), he was not too stupid to live, he does not usually ruin things for the other bad guys, and I genuinely felt scared for Molt whenever Hopper approached him menacingly because I know Molt was always on the wrong side of this ant v. grasshopper conflict, so I am glad A Bug's Life's writers really thought his role through. :)If you like hearing Ashley Tisdale or Hayden Panettiere as children on their rise to stardom in the late 1990s, if you like inspirational messages about discovering your potential, if you like movies about bugs, or if you like revisiting early computer animation, A Bug's Life is the film for you! I highly recommend A Bug's Life over An All Dogs Christmas Carol, The Object of My Affection, Monsters University (just kidding), Antz, or Madame Blueberry. I never hated Antz, but compared to A Bug's Life, I found Antz to be darker at worst and forgettable at best. Though I am also impressed that A Bug's Life got a G rating in the late 1990s, since there was a drawing of Heimlich getting gored and two scenes of bugs getting ""drunk"" on blood or grain, and several other alcoholic references. At least A Bug's Life did not have any curse words like Antz, which was rated PG and it was much scarier.",A Bug's Life
95,patriciogl10,You are in for a treat.,9,20 August 2018,"Is this perhaps the most underrated Pixar film to date? It could be, let's see: it's super entertaining, it has funny moments, creative bits of action and also small tender parts. The characters were built to know their place in this film, which in my personal view I would describe its plot as an ""adaptation"" (quote unquote because unofficially it is not) of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), for they both consist of a small village or colony being subjugated by invaders demanding food during each invasion, but placed in a world of an animated colony of ants; so the protagonist, Flik, comes up with a great idea, to search for a group of ""warrior"" bugs (they are in fact members of a circus) to help them defeat the invaders, a group of malicious grasshoppers whose leader may be one of the best villains Pixar's creative team has ever offered, the evil Hopper. This movie also subtly touches the idea of revolution, as the ants ultimately wish to eradicate their raiders in order to live life peacefully. Another thing worth mentioning is the clever way in which they decide to deal with the grasshoppers, and although it is met with an unfortunate mishap, the denouement of the film is utterly satisfying, just wait and see if you haven't already! 
Oh, and the outtakes at the end of the movie are really ingenious and creative, not to mention funny! A great adventure that I would watch many many times, but I feel that with so many excellent films that Pixar has provided the public over the years this one may not rank as high as many others, which is why I believe that is somewhat underrated.",A Bug's Life
96,Stompgal_87,More memorable than 'Antz' but not quite as good as 'Toy Story',9,6 July 2014,"I first saw this film when my aunt purchased it whilst visiting her. The first part I remember laughing at very hard was P.T. Flea telling his troupe of circus bugs they were fired after a fire at the circus. I've re-visited this film a few more times since my first viewing and whilst watching it on Amazon Prime Instant Video this morning, I laughed at it more than I have done for ages. I know how easy it is for people to compare this to 'Antz' but I find this more memorable than 'Antz' if not quite as entertaining as the 'Toy Story' franchise.The animation is just as good as that in the first 'Toy Story' film with the ants looking more colourful if more cartoonish than those in 'Antz,' the grasshoppers looking more realistic, luscious natural backgrounds and a creative use of junk to make it look like a city. The water droplets were also well-made. It wasn't until today's viewing that I noticed this film was loosely based on Aesop's fable 'The Ant and the Grasshopper' and the story is pretty straightforward in terms of Flik searching for more bugs to help the colony gather more food for the grasshoppers after he accidentally knocks the first batch into the stream. Other parts I found funny were Harry getting zapped by the bug light and one glow-ant telling the other to turn his butt off. The dialogue is memorable for the most part with some funny and clever lines. I liked the use of ""Bug-eat-bug world"" as opposed to ""Dog-eat-dog world"" as well as a mosquito ordering an O-positive Bloody Mary at the bar. While there were only two songs used in the entire film, I liked Randy Newman's closing credits song but the most memorable piece of incidental music was unfortunately the most repetitive since it was used about four times throughout the film to accompany scenes such as Flik setting out to find more bugs, Flik returning with the circus bugs and the ending. The voice acting is very good. Dave Foley, although lesser known, gave Flik his touch of ambition and determination; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, also lesser known, gave Princess Atta heart; Kevin Spacey was menacing as Hopper; and Hayden Panettiere, who later went on to play Channing in 'Racing Stripes' and cheerleader Claire in television series 'Heroes,' was cute as Dot. I also liked the late Joe Ranft's German accent for Heimlich and John Ratzenberger was virtually unrecognisable as P.T. Flea but did a good job voicing him nonetheless. Overall, this didn't entertain me quite as much as the 'Toy Story' franchise did but it is better than its accompanying short film 'Geri's Game' and 'Antz.' 9/10.",A Bug's Life
97,Indy-52,it makes you think twice before squishing an ant!,8,27 December 1999,"what an adorable movie this is! Why i haven't seen a movie that was this much fun in ages! Pixar animation studios have created a masterpiece, which i think is better than Toy Story. This movie teaches that grass hoppers are really bad guys, i'd squish them anyday now.A bug's life is actually Flik's life, who is a very clumsy ant who can't stand that he and his fellow ants are being oppressed by a gang of grass hoppers led by Hopper. The grass hoppers come by once year to eat the food which the ants have picked through the year. One day, Flik accidentally drops all the food collected for Hopper. He is now the enemy of the ant hill, because now the ants have to pick twice the resource of food for the grass hoppers. Then, flik comes up with a great idea: to get help from other, bigger ants to help them stand up for themselves. The queen thinks it's a ridiculous idea, but she sends him anyway so he can't screw anything up. Unexpectedly, flik succeeds in his mission and comes back with a bunch of who seem strong enough. But, when these guys appear to be just a group of circus clowns, the chaos begins...I won't give away the ending, simply because it's too good to be revealed.

There were some good one liners, but I kept expecting something more to happen- but it never did. Probably the best thing about this film were the outtakes during the credits, some of them were really amusing.

101,f-88612,BETTER THAN ANTZ,10,25 January 2021,"A Bug's Life is a 1998 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It was the second film produced by Pixar. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed and written by Andrew Stanton, the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for ""tough warriors"" to save his colony from hungry grasshoppers, only to recruit a group of insects that turn out to be an inept circus troupe. The film stars the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Hayden Panettiere among others.The film was inspired by Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Production began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Ranft. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. Randy Newman composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film Antz, which was released the same year.",A Bug's Life

Don't get me wrong, a Bug's Life isn't perfect by any means, at least not in the adults point of view.

I feel its a good film to watch with your children, because it gives off good subliminal messages. Don't give up, regardless of how hard life beats you down.

104,CMTiago,Pixar's hidden gem,8,11 September 2015,"When looking back at the Pixar movies, one almost seems to forget A Bug's Life. Perhaps it's the fact that another similar movie from DreamWorks called Antz came out that same year and the two are often mistaken for one another. Or maybe it's the fact that Pixar has made even bigger and slightly better movies since. Either way, this was the last movie from Pixar's first few I had left to watch, and once again great animated fun was delivered.I'm happy to say that the Pixar mark was very much hit with this movie and my expectations were met. So this movie tells the story of an ant called Flik, who has to recruit ""warrior"" insects to fight off the Grasshoppers that demand double the amount of food the ants can supply. The movie really starts to get funny when the circus bugs that Flik gets as warriors (or so he thinks) come into play. Their interactions, as well as their quirks make for some very good comedic scenes. As for the main plot, the empowerment of the little ants over the mighty grasshoppers is endearing enough to pull you in. Overall, this movie is a sort of a hidden gem of Pixar, as it is overshadowed by movies that even I admit to liking more. Nonetheless, A Bug's Life is on par with those entertainment wise.Rating: 8/10",A Bug's Life
105,merrywood,Graphic excellence mounted on wafer thin plot.,3,24 April 1999,"The best children's stories in the literature have souls.  By this, we mean they have significance and nourish the growing mind with inspiration, motivation, or teach something.  The stories need not be seminal but should at least bring some value to the reader or audience. This is the case, for example, in Pinocchio, where a puppet loved life so much it wanted to be a real boy and by its goodness became one. In A Bug's Life, we find nothing even approximating a meaningful story.  It is tragic because the producing studio, Pixar, has developed the finest graphic animation in the world today in character renderings.That the studio limits itself to children's audiences is their choice and certainly, although more limited than a crossover or a family market the child market still yields enough box office to keep the doors open. Why they have chosen to produce superficial stories, however, so flat and wafer thin they will not have legs for the future, is a mystery.We hope that at some point this remarkably talented group of animators will somehow mature into a shop with a strong story group that can manage to locate a good source of literature to mount with their beautiful artistry.

While I will give the animation for being colorful and exploring the world of insects and creepy-crawlies sufficiently, I found that in comparison to Toy Story it hasn't aged well. The characters provided little entrancement to motivate myself to continue to watch the movie (especially with some of their voices), so I had to dig somewhere deep psychologically to ensure that I wouldn't switch channels. The main issue that I have with this movie, however (which may involve both the animation and characters), is that I found it to reek worse than a stink bug of monotony. I laughed at none of the jokes and even though the writers and the voice actors most definitely put valiant (Oh God, not that movie) labor into making A Bug's Life, it just didn't pay off for me. Before the cash-grabs corrupted Disney in some ways, many Pixar fans considered this to be the company's worst film.

Along with the beauty, this is a fun family film. Pixar continues to capture a child's eye with this story. Things go from magical to silly very quickly. They have an excellent comic flair. This is best shown with the grasshopper bad guys. There are touching moments but always with a light touch.A Bug's Life will always be compared to Antz because they came out the same year and seem to have similar stories. But look deeper and they are very different films. Antz is Woody Allen's show surrounded by mediocre, muddy looking animation. A Bug's Life looks better. Antz's dialogue is really at an adult level. While A Bug's life continues the long Disney family tradition but updated in the Pixar way. I especially liked the circus act, Kevin Spacey as Hopper, the living scenery and the out takes at the end which are very clever. If animation appeals to you at all, see A Bug's Life.",A Bug's Life

I must have missed the comedy before, but last year I listened to just the music at some parts, and it became one of my favorite movies. (Listen to just the music on the DVD) Kevin Spacey did the voice of Hopper, the leader of the grasshopper gang.

A schmaltzy cartoon, it is too frequently annoying and occasionally aggravating, yet there are moments where it rises to near-perfection. We can do without the ants, for there is nothing special about them, reflecting Hollywood's view of people as mindless, fear-driven conformists. The lead character is supposed to be imaginative and different, but he's written as a screw-up whose silly, mind-numbing antics are just plain foolish. Only a kid wouldn't be bored by him, while in contrast, it takes an intelligent, focused adult to truly appreciate the subtlety of the grasshoppers. The animation, personalities, and dialog are so effective and convincing that it is nothing less than phenomenal. Too bad so much of the script is contrived, predictable, and unoriginal, taking the wonderful parts down with it into a chasm of mediocrity.

Flick, the ant and protagonist of A Bugs Life is highly relate-able, a struggling inventor who strives to do right, but inevitably ends up doing wrong, such is so, that in the first act of the film, Flick's latest invention, the harvester that can slash production time in half, misfires and causes some serious chaos. This mishap lands Flick in some serious hot water with the ant council and Flick voluntarily banishes himself from ant island, to which the council agrees.The action heads to the ""city"" (a dirty little place under someones trailer), there Flick seeks out warrior bugs, and finds them in the form of Slim, Francis and the gang.The gang, including Flick head back to ant island, where the majority of the film will now take place, ups and downs and lovely subtle comedy ensue, resulting in the island hatching a plan to take down Hopper and the evil grasshoppers.Call me a baddie, but my favourite character was actually the films baddie, antagonist Hopper, he was so cool, but in a toned down kind of way, nothing genuinely nasty, like all lifeforms he's simply doing what he needs to to survive.The music was typical of any Disney or Pixar film, perfect in other words, it evoked excitement and calm at the same time, never once getting out of hand or too much, perfect for kids.Nature, the very essence of the plot, nothing in the story was false, every element was true to how would be in nature, only in an exaggerated way, oh so simple, to produce magic from a story so simple shows true genius, and they don't get much better than Pixar.As for the ending, a little weepy for the faint hearted, as the bugs and the circus they are employed by disappear off into the sunset, their work complete, Flick, the newly appointed Queen Atta, and the newly appointed Princess Dot watch on as streams of wheat act as fireworks being propelled into the sky and the whole ant colony waves goodbye.

Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as ""Antz."" The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some ""warrior"" bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus.

126,Jeremy Bristol,An animated remake of The Magnificent Seven (and by proxy Seven Samurai).,8,12 June 2001,"I would have never thought anyone other than Miyazaki could (or would) make an animated remake of a Kurosawa movie aimed at children, but that's exactly what PIXAR and John Lasseter have done.Does it work?  Yes and no.Yes, because the child-friendly changes to the plot are interesting and rather Aesopian, since it is also an extended version of the ant and the grasshopper fable.  There are great references to the Magnificent Seven, and the pageant the little ants (especially the picture of one of them dying ""because our teacher said it would be more dramatic"") is hilarious.No, because the seven-plus-two warrior bugs that Flick gets are stock characters, and only the ladybug has any resemblance to any previous incarnation (he is basically the Mifune character--he is ridiculed by others not for being a peasant instead of a samurai but because he is a male ladybug, and also he is the one who befriends the children).  There is not a stoic character like Yul Brenner or Takashi Shimura to lead the pack, which I find a bit of an oversight (the praying mantis is hardly stoic in my opinion).The animation is truly astounding, with beautiful scenery and ""camera"" shots.  This is Pixar's most Miyazaki-esque film, which is why I like it so much (look for homages to Laputa and Kiki).  In spite of this, I have to rank A Bug's Life below the Toy Story movies because of the ludicrous slapstick beginning that sets the plot in motion--the same sort of annoying joke that Disney deemed necessary to push the plot forward in Mulan (Mushu shooting off a rocket for no apparent reason) and Tarzan (the elephant stampede) when they were stuck for a logical reason.  Would it have been too much to ask for Flick to actually have been a hero?  What if, as bandits often do, they go down the anthole anyway just to harass them and make them work harder for them--then just have the movie go just as it is--the grasshoppers pick on Princess Dot, Flick tells them to leave her alone, and then Hopper orders double the order for next time and everybody starts worrying about that.  Flick could be banished for that reason--sort of like what happens in Princess Mononoke when Ashitaka saves the girls but gets cursed and so has to leave and never return.One other complaint--Dot believing she can and should be able to fly before her body is ready is an outright dangerous concept for Pixar to condone, despite society's current mentality towards girl-power and the ""youth are always right"" generation.  Knowing what your limits are is as much a part of strength as anything else.8/10",A Bug's Life
127,michael-3204,"A step down from ""Toy Story""",5,2 August 2016,"Not a bad movie by any means, but it's hard not to be disappointed by the degree to which Pixar's second feature falls short of the very high standard it set with its first, ""Toy Story."" Visually, ""A Bug's Life"" is almost as impressive and should be applauded for a completely different setting -- writers/directors Lasseter and Stanton certainly can't be accused of simply repeating themselves.Unfortunately, the characterizations here aren't nearly as rich and entertaining and the casting not as inspired. Phyllis Diller could almost make a good substitute for the function Don Rickles served in ""Toy Story,"" but she's not given enough to do and never really gets to cut loose. Kevin Spacey is always a good villain and adds some spice to the proceedings as Hopper, but the notion of making grasshoppers into a biker gang -- which should have worked well -- is half-heartedly executed. The rest of the cast, particularly Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, aren't especially interesting or memorable. After a slow start, the film definitely picks up with the introduction of the circus, performers of which provide most of the comic relief, but the only standout is Heimlich the caterpillar who can't wait to get his wings.Overall, the story is a bit too convoluted to convey the simple, powerful messages about conformity and perseverance the film wants to deliver as cleanly as it might with a tighter story structure.

One of the innovative attachments being the delightful ""out-takes"" added to the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these out-takes where as I?m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape. The DVD also features ""Gerry?s Game"" which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.This is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to Dreamworks? ""Antz"", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films, ""Antz"" is largely cast with big name ""movie"" stars with a few familiar ""TV"" star voices, where ""A Bug?s Life"" is just the opposite, loaded with ""TV"" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.Dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with Disney, you have your work cut out for you.

Seeing as this is the movie that came after the Toy Story movies I must say that they have come a ways with the technology...or at least I realized this once I watched the special features on the disc that told me so and pointed out all the little things that I didn't realize before like all the leaves moving and the different shadows and the hair on each bug's back....Really and truly this is Pixar and I don't feel that the animation quality should be the major judging point on this film as that is sure to be top notch. The story is where things really need to come into play. Well This story follows an ant that isn't quite getting along with the other antz in that conformist thing that they like to do. (Also seen in the plot from the movie Antz which now that I think about it is kind of creepy with both films coming out so close together) Anycase our hero ant has to save the colony that treats him like trash against evil bully insects that are out to extort them for food. This adventure brings up a cast of colorful and friendly characters that have many comic moments throughout the film.Overall the story is about working together to accomplish something that couldn't have been accomplished alone. Good lesson overall but still not extremely high class.In the end if you strip away the technological glitter A Bug's life is a charming little family movie with a plot that is entertaining but nothing highly innovative.

Flik is the black sheep of the ant colony, and when his invention ruins the tribute to the predatory Grasshoppers, he needs to right this wrong. He recruits a troop of circus bigs, thinking them to be mighty warriors, and the whole group rallies the ant colony to defeat the Grasshopper invasion. The characters are vivid, outlandish, and provide a logical (if strange) set of skills that come in handy. I tend to dislike movies or shows where a huge plot point is based around a miscommunication that could be avoided/solved with basic logic, but in this context, it makes some sense. I can understand the pressure and anxiety that would accompany correcting someone who has overestimated your worth. The emotional beats in this movie land with grace. When the colony discovers that the troupe is real performers, rather than warriors, the betrayal is palpable, and the loss seems personal. When, in the end, the caterpillar finally gains his butterfly wings, it is a small delightful moment of wish fulfillment. John Lasseter directed some of the most iconic films of my childhood and had the same magic touch in each. Toy Story, Cars, The Incredibles, and this movie all have the same magical sense of whimsy and crazy events that remain anchored in real, relatable people.",A Bug's Life

133,bobbyelliott,Interesting movie but not was good as Antz,7,7 February 1999,"Nice movie. Great animation. Well up to Disney quality. It reminded me of Toy Story - superb effects but lacking a little in the storyline department. This movie suffered badly in relation to Antz which is a better movie with a stronger storyline. The movies are very similar but Woody Allen and Sharon Stone are much better than their counterparts in Bug's Life. Of course, this doesn't matter if you're 10 years old - my kids loved Bug's Life. Probably more so than Antz. So my advice to anyone under 14 is go see Bug's Life; the rest of us should watch Antz. Two good movies - but only one is a classic.",A Bug's Life

135,jgarland-80537,The Second Film of Pixar,10,15 November 2021,"Flick was an interesting character he is a nerdy, intuitive, inventive, and courageous ant. Although he is a well-meaning bug of the ant colony and wants to make a difference to his colony's way of life, he has a tendency to make things worse in the process. His inventions include a telescope created by wrapping a blade of grass around a dew drop; an automatic harvester; several items of traveler's gear; and the bird-shaped aircraft used to terrify the grasshoppers. He is great friends with Dot, Princess Atta, the Circus Bugs, and the Blueberries. A great lesson about Teamwork, communication, resourcefulness, and courage can defeat a seemingly stronger enemy. Solutions to great problems can come from unlikely sources. It's important to believe in yourself and have faith in your abilities. Nature has a certain order which is to be respected: ""The sun grows the food; ants pick the food; grasshoppers eat the food; birds eat the grasshoppers.""Family relationships are important and special even in the insect world. Mothers provide for and protect their offspring. Flick, the hero ant, is smart, caring, loyal, and so brave that he's willing to sacrifice all for the sake of his colony. At first he faces ridicule and self-doubt, but ultimately he saves the day, and everyone learns to value and respect him. Other species rise above their fear and join the team in order to survive. A very elementary look at insects: each species has a purpose and a place in the circle of life. In this film, individual bugs are given personality, identity and purpose, which may help engender kids' respect for nature.",A Bug's Life
136,Lamia7609,Delightful,10,16 November 2000,"I worried about the people who have animosity for this movie. I think it's a great movie for kids and has an excellent message. It shows that thinking outside the box can be of great benefit to society as a whole.  It shows how team work can solve problems. Aside from that it was funny and great to look at.  Is it an accurate depiction of insect life...no.  I didn't care that the ants weren't anatomically correct.  The male mosquito ordering a bloody Mary was interesting as well, since males don't drink blood or so my degree in science from the discovery channel would have me believe.  Anyway check this movie out. I enjoyed it a lot more than Ants for the very fact that Woody Allen is no where to be found.",A Bug's Life

I just love it.It's all about a crazy scientist bug ant traveling to the city to look for help to save the colony he's from, from a grasshopper gang. Hilarious all the way through it. The scientist bug screwing up in the start, offers to help and turns up with circus bugs. Hahahahaaa. Just watch it guys.A Pixar animation movie is worth the movie. I'll be definitely buying the DVD.",A Bug's Life
138,anthonymichaelbangert,It Bugs Me that this Movie isn't More Loved,7,8 July 2016,"A Bug's Life was Pixar's second dip into the movie business and is widely considered to be on the lower end of Pixar's quality films. When I was growing up or was one of my favorites, and to this day I don't get where the hate comes from. This movie follows an inventor ant named Flik (Dave Foley) who is your stereotype clumsy dreamer. His colony is extorted through fear of the grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), for their food. The grasshoppers make the ants collect food for them to have during the ""Rainy Season."" After Flik accidentally destroys a large supply of food, causing Hopper to double the quota, Flik goes on a quest to find some big bugs in the big city to protect the colony and stop the tyrannical grasshopper rule once and for all. Unfortunately, he gets a group of bad circus performers instead, and may find a way to use their limited talents to save them all. This movie is underrated. The political undertones to this film speak volumes, especially in our current political climate. The voice acting is decent. Kevin Spacey definitely gives a menacing performance, and it's adorable to hear a young Hayden Panettiere as an ant princess. The animation is pretty nice for its time. Certain moments looked better than others, but the real triumph was texturing, especially in the grasshoppers' designs. This movie isn't perfect. Many moments were predictable, and the movie relied heavily on gags. But still, it's fun and funny. And it does craft moments of actual fear and shows kids the power people can have when they stand together. It's definitely aimed more towards kids (even if it does get a bit...*murdery* seriously, rewatch it, it's very dark), but adults can appreciate that there's something there for them too. Altogether I'd rate this movie a 7. Not a bad Pixar film. Should be seen. PS: Ratzenberger's role in this film was P.T.Flea, the ringleader of the circus bugs. It's a funny role that sits his voice well.",A Bug's Life

142,djansen24,"Still a very good movie, but one of my least favorite to watch",7,8 September 2011,"Pixar's 2nd feature, Bug's Life, finds them expanding their animation palette, expanding the boundaries of storytelling, and getting a little muddled in the process. This IS a very good movie, one that for the most part delights and enthralls, but something is lacking here. After reflecting on it a moment, I think the main element is forcing things in an unnatural way with not completely fleshed out characters. Pixar films have a way of taking great stories, telling them very effectively, and letting them unfold at a natural pace. And that's the problem (albeit a minor one) with Bug's Life. There are the multitude of jokes, but this time some work and some don't. Some of the characters, especially the circus crew, are not fleshed out well at all. Instead, they seem as superficial as cardboard caricatures who when they react to certain situation, leave us with no insights or surprises. And Flick himself is not the most engaging lead (maybe it was the high pitch of Foley's voice?). Couple that with jokes that aren't quite as funny and you get a movie where a lot of love was poured into the animation (which is fabulous) and good intent was poured into a potentially great story but where I felt something lacking. That being said, it still is Pixar, and it still dazzles! There is one scene at the locust hangout that might be a little too brutal for small kids, but it is for the most part age appropriate for all ages. A good, but not great Pixar film. They would correct this with a succession of absolutely brilliant films which would last from their next all the way through Up! Not bad from a single studio, eh?",A Bug's Life
143,Big S-2,A film for children aged 4 to 84,10,30 November 1999,"This is one of those real rarities - a true family film which REALLY CAN be enjoyed by the whole family. It has enough cute, funny characters and an easy-to-follow, eventful plot to keep the kids amused, while at the same time it also boasts a level of sophistication and subtle, adult humour to appeal to the grown-ups as well. The colourful animation and lots of subtle, clever details make this film a joy to watch again and again. My wife and I (we're both into our 30s) were knocked out by this movie and - like a couple of schoolkids - we can't wait for the inevitable ""Bug's Life 2"" which hopefully won't be too long in coming.",A Bug's Life

In this movie, clumsy but creative inventor ant Flick accidentally ruins the food for the villainous grasshoppers. He uses the help of a group of insects who are actually circus bugs to defend the ant colony from the grasshoppers. The story is OK, but most of the characters aren't very good. I thought that Hopper and Flick were the only good characters in this movie. The jokes were poorly delivered. The only good joke I found in this movie was ""he stared in a film called ""Picnic."" This is actually what I thought was the worst of the PIXAR films. If you're a big fan of PIXAR movies, then you may watch this, but isn't not done very well. My Rating: */****",A Bug's Life
145,kamerad,Light Years,8,2 July 2002,"The feature ""A Bug's Life"" shows the light years Lasseter's art had jumped in only ten regular years since ""Luxo Jr."".  No longer are the qualities of the faces affected by symmetrical shapes.  In ""Tin Toy"", Tinny was cute, but his face was a perfect sphere.  The baby was supposed to be cute, but because his face could not be perfectly round and still seem realistic, his face was ruined by unintended harsh angles that were supposed to give the baby a more ""human"" look.  In ""A Bug's Life"", we now have cute ants whose faces are not perfectly spherical, yet are not ruined.  The lines and bends in their faces and bodies are smooth and flexible.  The sharp features that made the baby so sinister looking are reserved for the evil grasshoppers. The scene where Hopper is about to crush Flick's head is frightening not only because of what is happening, but because of the intense looks of anger/pleasure on Hopper's face, and the extreme fear on Flick's face. 
     It's not only the characters that make ""A Bugs Life"" a triumph.  We see how far we've come since ""Luxo Jr."" when it was too risky to move the camera.  Now the camera swoops and swirl through the air.  The high-speed chase in the rain is particularly stunning.  The rain adds added atmosphere, as well as a way to indicate just how fast they are flying.  As the camera bobs up and down as it rushes through space, we can hardly believe that this is not real.  I think it works better than a live action chase, because there is not that awkward mix between special effects and reality.  Because ""A Bugs Life"" is all special effects, it is it's own reality",A Bug's Life

Definitely a childhood classic. It's also a lot funnier than I remember, which was a surprise. This movie gets a lot more hate than it deserves, just because it's a lower tier Pixar movie doesn't mean its bad. It's still an 8/10, which is great. In the end, I'd say it's a pretty average yet underrated animated movie. Can't wait to show all these Pixar movies to my kids (hopefully the world doesn't end before I get to have some).",A Bug's Life
147,mymangodfrey,"23 years on, this is still the worst Pixar movie.",6,21 June 2021,"I remember how stunning Toy Story looked on opening weekend, but also how smart it was: a refreshing break from Disney's animated-Broadway-musical format, a genuinely funny, character-driven, beautifully voice-acted movie with universal appeal. And I remember seeing Toy Story 2 and being blown away all over again at its epic leap forward in technical quality, paired with an even richer and smarter script. (Toy Story 2 belongs on any list of great movie sequels, alongside The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, and Terminator 2.)Although there have been a few flat notes since then, Pixar basically couldn't miss for 20+ years after Toy Story 2. Wall-E, Up, Ratatouille, Coco... it's amazing how many all-time classics this one studio produced during its golden run.Between the first two Toy Story movies, though, there was this weird year when Pixar and Dreamworks (in the Hollywood tradition of releasing competing Lambada movies, competing comet-catastrophe movies, and competing child-adult body-swap comedies) released rival computer-animated movies about ants.Of the two, Antz had the better script, and A Bug's Life had the better animation, but both movies were ugly, with weird color palettes and off-putting character designs. Both had a schematic, uninspired, corporate vibe. (Both movies also had bad titles, but at least Pixar's wasn't A Bugz Life.)It's a testament to how great Pixar is that A Bug's Life is the only generally boring and predictable movie they've made. The jokes fall flat, character concepts are stolen pretty brazenly from the Simpsons, and the casting feels like a pale attempt to recapture the magic of Toy Story's mix of beloved comedians and character actors. (Antz and A Bug's Life both feature actors who are now widely reviled as sexual abusers, but Woody Allen was a genius; Kevin Spacey was always overrated, in my opinion, and he's terrible in this movie.) Julia Louis-Dreyfus, one of the funniest people alive, is wasted on a passive character with even less appeal than the unlikeable protagonist. The screenplay for A Bug's Life is like a hastily prepared first draft that underwent a bit of revision by executives. The dialogue is bad all the way through, and the overall story is a prime example of Roger Ebert's ""idiot plot.""In 2021, now that its animation is primitive, A Bug's Life has almost nothing going for it. Toy Story, in spite of its dated look, stands as a landmark, but it's also got timeless storytelling and humor.With A Bug's Life, Pixar was working through all of its mistakes. Later movies like Ratatouille and Finding Nemo would begin from similar premises (zooming into the world of tiny creatures) but end up as animated masterpieces.",A Bug's Life

As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a good feature! I was right! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could hate a Pixar film!

150,oneofthesilence,Not amazing for Pixar. But still good.,8,25 May 2020,"Pretty much every aspect of this movie is just okay. How's the plot? It's OK. How are the characters? They're OK. How's the voice acting? It's good but nothing remarkable. How's the romance? It's not cringey but the development is non existent.The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing and the fact that it's a little boring at times. I only audibly laughed once or twice, and that was only me exhaling through my nose.The animation still holds up, but it's just kinda boring to look at. Like it's not distracting in a bad way, but it's not eye catching in a good way either. Again, this movie doesn't really have anything bad, there just nothing special either.The one exception is the villain Hopper. He's voice acted extremely well by Kevin Spacey, and he's legitimately threatening and entertaining. He significantly elevated any scene he was in. And the way he died was kinda brutal. I liked it.I do need to say thought that the 3rd act is much less boring than the first 2 acts. It increases the suspense significantly and is actually engaging. That chase through the rain is probably the best scene in the movie. Great stuff there. The movie goes out on a high-ish note. I do really enjoy the third act.Also the circus bugs were better than any of the ant characters. They were very memorable and fun. I liked them.While this is definitely one of Pixar's weaker films, it's still decent. Pixar never really makes anything truly bad so... This movie gets 76% from me.",A Bug's Life

Whilst being essentially a kid's cartoon, there are, as usual, some adult jokes in there as well.  All the voices are fantastic, giving life to the animated characters (and even more so in the 'bloopers'). Kevin Spacey was my favourite voice, but they were all excellent.Some real belly laughs here.  I found Antz a little un-funny in parts. The animation wasn't as good as ABL either. It wasn't a very good kid's film. Particularly, the termite battle.  Any kid under four would've screamed in the cinema.  I suppose that's why it was rated PG.ABL is on the best animated films to come out in a long time.  The plot is nothing original, but who cares?  It's funny.

152,Ryan_Barbakins,Enjoyable family film,7,15 February 2020,"A Bug's Life is a fun family film with an interesting origin. Being Pixar's second film, there was a great amount of pressure on it. Obviously I think we can all agree that Toy Story easily surpasses this film, but for what it is, it is a strong sophomore film that was necessary to kick off Pixar's 2000s golden age.
This film is based off the famous ""Seven Samauri"" japanese film, and takes the concept of a village under attack into an interesting point of view. We get to see why the grasshoppers act the way they act, while still siding with the heros.
Of course when compared to other Pixar films, this one can feel quite mediocre, yet not every Pixar film needs to be a home run.",A Bug's Life

The story, thankfully, is less manic than the 'Toy Story' series, and manages to keep you laughing through the whole movie.I highly recommend this one to anyone who might have thought that it was only for kids.

Full of quotable lines and excellent voice talent, and one of the funniest ""outtake"" reels ever created.The tale of a quirky inventor trying to make a difference for his colony is heart-warming and lesson filled. It strikes a chord in us all, the powerful need to make an impact, improve the world around us and better the lives of those we care about... especially when nobody believes you can do it! The humor has broad appeal. From some slapstick for the kids (Flick crashes into the river bed rocks)... to inside ""bug humor"" (the grasshopper with a sign ""Kid pulled my wing's off"") for those who understand more about the bug world. It's got jokes throughout the entire movie... even up to Heimlich sprouting little wings and saying ""From up here you all look little ants."" haha Not only are the visuals strikingly real in many places, but to take things down to the world of bugs creates a fascinating perspective on things. From raindrops that are like bombs to the ""city life"" of a country house's junk pile. ""This stop, Deeeeead Rat!"" Yes! All this, and more, from a ""kid's movie.""

157,joltjohn,a great movie for bugs and people everywhere,10,14 December 2002,"Everything that was great about Toy Story, Pixar's first feature (and the first-ever all-computer animated movie), is even greater in A Bug's Life. Visually, this movie is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. Its environments are far more ambitious than Toy Story's, and they deliver with far more nuance and texture. There are more characters in this movie, and they're a little better played. And the story is cute-- it deals with Flik, an outcast ant (Dave Foley) who is sent away by the colony's princess (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find some ""tough bugs"" to fight off the oppressive grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who steal the ants' food. Flik finds a bunch of circus-performer bugs, and mistakes them for fighters, and takes them back to the colony to save the bugs from the grasshoppers. Humor follows. Humor for the whole family. This film has great moments, like when the ants can't figure out how to get around a leaf that has fallen in front of them(although I didn't quite get that, since I would think the ants could see over the leaf, but I guess I was putting too much thought into it.) As many great visual moments as the film has, I just couldn't help feel that it's trapped by the Disney formula of one unlikely hero rising above ""it all"" to save the day. Again, the animation is wonderful and, to be honest, although it's more safe feeling than ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" does do a better job at providing the scope of this miniature world, from the leaves and grass to the stones and ant tunnels.  I did like the fact that the film is in the wide 2.35:1 ratio, making the wide spaces of the grassy colony and the insect city more fascinating to watch.  High marks once again. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack never misses a beat. All of the dialogue comes from the position of its speaker on screen. Sometimes stereo effects are very hot or cold-- they're either all the way right, all the way left, or straight center. Not the case here. If a character so much as turns his or her head while speaking, it's reflected in the sound field. Excellent.  And the score by Randy Newman sounds great and never overpowers the dialogue or sound. Above all, this movie is visually stunning. STUNNING. It is amazing to watch. 9 out of 10",A Bug's Life

When, the bird comes to eat the bugs, that scene was superb and good. Even, the last scene was awesome and cool. Even, Flik's inventions was good.

160,nickscheetz,The fourth and final act is phenomenal but the rest of it is a bit...... uh............,7,2 July 2018,"I loved this film as a kid but nowadays it's not really as good as I thought it was. Not to say that it's bad but honestly it's really really hard for me to decide whether I like this movie or not. Let's talk about the good stuff first, the animation, colors, settings, and character designs are all beautiful, it definitely matches up with the cheerful tone that the film is supposed to match up with. A lot of the voices are really good ranging from Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Denis Leary, Richard Kind, Jonathan Harris, David Hyde Pierce, Brad Garret, Madeline Kahn, and even some of the main Pixar guys voiced a few characters. The most memorable part of the film is the circus bugs, they are the film's biggest highlight, Denis Leary is Francis the Ladybug who's constantly mistaken for a woman, David Hyde Pierce is Slim the Stick-Bug who's always used as a prop, Brad Garret is Dim the Beetle who looks dangerous and tough but is actually a gigantic baby that's supervised by Rosy the Black Widow who's voiced by Bonnie Hunt, a pair of acrobats named Tuck and Roll who don't speak English and are my favorite characters, Jonathan Harris is Manny the Prey-Mantis who is a blind fortune-teller and is married to a gorgeous butterfly named Gypsy who's voiced by Madeline Kahn, every scene they're in is constantly hilarious, there's never a single moment involving where I would say ""that's not funny...."" or ""what was the point of that?"" Finally as mentioned in the headline for this review, the best part of the film is the fourth and final act, starting from when the last leaf falls, the grasshoppers have moved into the ant-hill and are forcing the ants to get every last drop of food on the island making them their slaves, Dot being the only ant who believes in Flik tries to convince him and the circus bugs to come back to make things right but Flik doesn't want to because the amount backlash he received from the colony after the truth about the circus bugs was revealed finally convinced him that what the colony thought of him was true, that he was a guaranteed failure who tries to make things better for people but instead always made things worse, Dot convinces Flik that it doesn't matter what people think of you, you can always achieve your goals if you just believe in yourself, thus Flik agrees to make things right by using the bird that he and the others built, at first it starts off really well but then it accidentally gets sabotaged, Hopper then forces Thumper to beat him half to death in front of everyone to teach them a lesson saying that ants were put on Earth to serve grasshoppers, but Flik convinces everyone otherwise by saying the best line in the movie, ""Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers. I've seen these ants do great things, and year after year they somehow manage to pick food for themselves and you. So who is the weaker species? Ants don't serve grasshoppers! It's you who need us! We're a lot stronger than you say we are... And you know it, don't you?"" Hopper fed up with Flik decides to kill him himself but right when he's about to Princess Atta and the other ants become convinced that they were wrong and stand up for themselves giving us that triumphant feeling that lots of epic climaxes give us, the battle between ants and grasshoppers begins with the all the grasshoppers getting scared away and Hopper about to get shot out of a cannon, but suddenly it starts to rain, which gives Hopper the advantage of grabbing Flik to finish him off, Atta comes to the rescue and Flik thinks up a plan, he gets cornered by Hopper and right when he's about to choke him to death, a bird appears and Hopper gets fed to its babies, the film then ends with the ants saying goodbye to the circus bugs, Atta becoming queen, and Flik is declared being a true hero. But unfortunately what causes the film to go downhill really causes it to go downhill, the adviser ants, Princess Atta, and the Queen are so unbelievably obnoxious, always talking down to Flik and Dot going on about how they'll never achieve anything and this isn't just occasional insults, it happens constantly throughout most of the film, they get on my nerves to the point where it's unwatchable, they even tried to get rid of Flik by saying they'll agree to let him look for warriors when really they're just trying to get rid of him, which is why my least favorite scene is when it's revealed that the circus bugs aren't warriors, therefore the colony has to call Flik a disgrace and kick him out because they apparently would rather be slaves than listen to someone who's just misunderstood, what were they thinking? So this film is nowhere near terrible, as mentioned before the fourth act starting from when the last leaf falls is spectacular, but I just feel that the ants having to be so mean-spirited and cruel towards Flik was just way too much for me.",A Bug's Life

162,davekeanu,The time of your life,8,11 June 2016,Pixar has had a lot of great movies and I loved all of them they have great stories and wonderful funny characters. I have been a huge fan of Toy Story I loved the plot of the film of being about two toys being separated from their owner and ending up at an evil nasty toy abuser who turns toys into horribly nasty looking things. After Toy Story was a huge hit at the box office pixar deiced to make of film about bugs which the idea came around in 1995 around the same time when toy story came out. But Dream works copy their idea and making a film about ants which is also a bug's life is also about. And people are saying that these two films are the same movie but their not while Antz is dark and the CGI is very lack. But A bug's life is also dark but Funny and enjoyable. Hooper is a great villain he has to be best pixar villain and one of the best Disney villains of all times. But Flik is the one who steals the show as He is kind funny and very smart which I can related to him a lot. While Antz is a good movie I not a fan of it but A bug's life is a I can watch over and over again the song from Randy Newman the time of your life is very catchy as gets stuck in my head telling me to enjoy my life while I can and to now to worry about the past or the further 8/10,A Bug's Life
163,borneobrian,Entertaining piece of cgi art,7,12 November 2019,"This was a very exceptional flick. It had heart, humor and a good cast of characters. The voice cast is extraordinarily cool. Kevin spacey plays a very menacing villain. The cgi is very well done and creative. This is definitely a classic.",A Bug's Life
164,Rhealist,"Great fun, but not a classic",7,28 April 1999,"This movie is fun for adults and children alike, and the animation is, of course, spectacular.The story is merely adequate, though, following well-worn conventions. Many of the plot twists were too convenient or incredible.What can you say when the best part of the movie was the fake bloopers during the final credits?  That the goal was to make a fun movie, I guess - which was the result achieved.Rating:  worth seeing once, the bloopers are worth seeing again.",A Bug's Life
165,say_andy,Yet another Pixar success,7,12 April 2005,"First off, let's get the technical details out of the way. Like all Pixar films, A Bug's Life looks fantastic. The animation is bold and bright, giving its anthropomorphic bugs the usual 3D rendering process that Pixar first showed the world with its first picture, Toy Story. Also, the film does a fairly convincing job with fire in the film, a tricky element to capture with animation.The voice actors all do a great job fleshing out their characters, and do so without upstaging their characters. Unlike other recent animated films, where the animators chose to tailor the animated figure to the actor, the actor tailor their performances to the animated figure. Kevin Spacey as the villainous Hopper is a particular standout, along with David Hyde Pierce's comedic performance as Slim.The story itself is engaging, following the protagonist ant, Flik (Dave Foley), in his attempt to redeem himself in the eyes of the colony by finding other insects to help him ward off the grasshopper gang that torments them. In this attempt, he stumbles across a group of fun and lovable circus bugs (a collection including a male ladybug, a preying mantis, a black widow spider, a gypsy moth, a walking stick-bug, a caterpillar, a dung beetle, and a couple pillbugs), who come back to the colony with him in a misunderstanding. Eventually, everyone teams up to save the day. Flik's journey to ""the city"" where he finds these bugs is the funniest part of the movie, and a perfect example of how an animated film can use sight gags for great comedic effect, without having them dominate the entire narrative structure.My favourite parts of the movie are when the bugs acted like bugs (mosquitoes flying into bug zappers, ants losing it when separated from the colony, flies having 24 hours to live). These parts are quite clever and contribute to some of the genuine laughs of the film. However, while a fun movie, and a great family movie, this movie doesn't quite capture the high levels of quality of other Pixar works like Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. Of all of Pixar's films, this one is probably the most kid-centric and has the least to offer for adults. Which, is to be expected since it's about bugs. Kids love bugs. Because kids are weird.Which makes it a perfect film for kids, but merely a pleasant film for the rest of us. I enjoyed it, but didn't love it.",A Bug's Life
166,eartherian,Amazing.. Even the Credits! ;),6,28 June 2011,"Is there a limit to human creativity? This is one of the questions that come in mind during and after watching such good animation flick.To give an example of creativity, even the credits were made interesting. Jelled with a good song which halts when they show all invented bloopers; and as soon as they finish, the song continues. Don't know, but such creativity even at the end gives a sense of completion and they rightly say, 'all is well that ends well'! :) As far as movie is concerned, it is a PIXAR baby, and it lives up-to the name. But sure, you have other good babies but when talking about good animation flicks, A Bug's Life is a must watch and that also gives a sense of insight into a real bug's life! ;) These movies are made after lot of research and thinking bundled with creativity.-- truthandme@gmail.com",A Bug's Life

The effects are right, OK, but it has not other message than the characteristic old-fashioned Disney's concept of ""funny things"".It's very different when you see other movies like Fantasia,  Toy Story or Antz, that are clearly innovative, not only because of their special effects, but because of what they ""tell"": at least, they ""transmit"" an idea to the viewer.",A Bug's Life

Everything about the characters and the story line was so stereotypical and two dimensional that this movie easily blends into the memory of so many other movies and it is then easily forgotten.If you have kids, they'll enjoy it and you will as well (at least on the first viewing).

171,WeslyM,"More of a kid-flick than ""Antz""",9,3 May 1999,"""A Bug's Life"" is clearly oriented more toward children than is ""Antz."" The story is more kid-accessible, and the characters as well as the overall style have a much higher ""cute"" factor.  (For example, consider the fundamental decision to make the ants in ""A Bug's Life"" light blue and lavender, while comparable characters in ""Antz"" are more mundane shades of brown.)  The central and supporting characters are a varied assortment of different insects, which makes for easy identification and increased toy sales.  The voice casting is a delight: Phyllis Diller is an absolute hoot as the ant queen; Kevin Spacey embodies sheer villainy as the head grasshopper meanie; David Hyde-Pierce gives dry voice to a worldly, jaded walking-stick.  Gary Rydstrom's sound design is remarkably rich and detailed, putting the viewer right in the middle of each meadow, underground anthill, and grasshopper swarm.  The story makes some of the same points concerning individuality and cooperation as does ""Antz,"" and they are no less meaningful (although perhaps a bit less original) for having been heard before.  If possible, Pixar's animation is even better than PDI's outstanding work in ""Antz.""  Exterior shots are unbelievably detailed, with single leaves visible being blown by wind in the trees and individual clusters of clover leaves weaving and bending as the bugs hop across them. ""A Bug's Life"" is a riotous, rollicking roller-coaster ride of a flick.  I saw it in a theater full of families with kids, and a good time was had by all.  The hilarious ""outtakes"" over which the end credits roll are an especially imaginative touch.",A Bug's Life

The characters are likable, charming, and overall funny, the big world that they create is creative, and also has a really good villain. But the problem lies in basically the story with the whole liar revealed storyline which has been done to death and it's boring as usual and also as a follow up to Toy Story it's weaker in every single way.

A Bug's Life is another excellent addition to this unique canon. It is made by Pixar, the company that made the even better Toy Story a couple of years ago. This film rides that finicky edge between appealing to kids and adults alike, a task notoriously difficult to accomplish. A Bug's Life showcases brilliant computer animation with a time-tested Seven Samurai story - young man must leave home to redeem himself, brings back friends, becomes a hero and changes the community for the better.

There are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public; but this IS one of them. My whole family came away from the film, awed, entertained, dazzled, and happy. We're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there. The children LOVED it and so did we (hubbie and I are 36 and 32, respectively)!Apart from its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (small as they may be, and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. There isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with. The personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents, combined with the skill and artistry of some of Disney's best animators. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney, himself. I think Mr. Disney would heartily approve of this new film... Flick, Dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time.This is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again.. and buy to own on video or DVD. I'm eager to see it again.. to pick up what I might have missed the first time.

178,jonnydmullan,Just OK,4,5 April 2020,"Pixar were really still finding there feet with A Bug's Life. There's nothing really wrong with it. It is just a little dull.A Bug's Life centres on the life of a bug. Funny that. Name of Flick. Flick's ant colony gets attacked by grasshoppers, seemingly frequently. They exploit them for food. When the ants try to stand up for themselves, they get intimidated and the grasshoppers demand their entire food supply.However, the grasshoppers don't really feel like a threat. I kept thinking that with the number of ants in the colony, they could easily defeat the band of 20 grasshoppers. And at one point in the movie the grasshoppers literally spell it out, but for some reason it goes nowhere.The circus characters are supposed to be quirky and funny. I personally don't find ""look at how stupid I am"" humour to be funny and the circus is filled with this. It felt like irony to me. Really the only character who is funny is the ladybird. The delivery of his lines and his comic timing is almost perfect. However, it saddens me that it wasn't achieved by the other characters. They became reduced to a few character traits and little depth of personality.And finally, the plot has two clichés that I really cannot abide in a film. Firstly, the plot hinges on the character overhearing the master plan of the grasshoppers, who just happen to be talking about it out loud, in detail, for no reason. It just didn't make sense. And secondly, the bugs aren't really responsible for their own victory. The bird just happened to be there and just happened to need to feed its baby birds that just conveniently hatched very recently. It didn't feel calculated or planned, which frustrated me.Overall, I think A Bug's Life is OK. I would be mad about having to watch it again. I mainly think Pixar was still finding its feet and it shows in A Bug's Life.",A Bug's Life

182,cobra-8,Far Too Predictable,5,21 February 2005,"In all fairness, A Bug's Life is probably an immensely entertaining film for kids. I know when I was a kid I loved it. And even now, I find a few moments in the movie amusing.HOWEVER: The biggest problem with this movie was that it was far, far, FAAR too predictable! I can give you some examples. Right from the get-go, you can predict Princess Ata will become Queen at the end. As soon as you see Princess Dot trying and failing to fly, you know she will be able to do so by the end. When you see everybody hating Flik and his inventions, you know that by the end everyone will love them both. The second you discover Hopper's fear of birds, you know that that is how he will meet his demise. You can also tell that Heimlich will become a butterfly before all is over.I honestly cannot believe how this movie beat ""Antz"" in popularity, when the latter film was an altogether funnier, cleverer, and more entertaining film with a more engaging storyline and characters. I give this movie 5/10, because I don't want to be too harsh on it when it has several redeeming features.

I only gave it a ""8"" though, feeling it would somewhat bore people at parts but I found kids that still found it entertaining if they are aware of what's going on. The animation in the film is just brilliant. This movie is a movie to talk about how great 3D animation is. The story is set on the ground in a somewhat vacant part or something, and from their level you can see all the details to the single rocks on the ground. And if I'm going to talk about this movie I would like to bring up the character Hopper. I just watched this movie recently and it just dawned on me this character is a very underrated villain. He is smart, powerful and scary. He is also very serious but what got to me was how clever he was. I think people forget this about him and the actor who plays him (Lord help me, I don't know the actors name) is very well at playing him. He is now one of my favorite Disney villains.

194,thegarf,Really great entertainment !!!,9,16 February 1999,"All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios' last productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds... Once and for all, A Bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake ""hand-made-old-Disneys-like"" drawings (see the Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).A bug's life (1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say ""Hey, this thing is computer generated !"". No weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3D bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.The scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness ! Curiously, and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life. Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate, but most others dislike (same thing for the parents or the anime fans, like me). This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story (a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen (who finally turn to be actors) to protect them, etc...). Simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.Since Microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I do think that A bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all. The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik's (aka Tilt in France) adventures.A big thank you for Lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera...And finally, especially for those of you who have seen the french version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie. A bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment, and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to extremely few movies, and that's not a problem of storage room :).

201,Mb19,A Great Movie,9,6 December 1998,"When it comes to making great movies, the guys at Pixar know their stuff. A Bug's Life was one of the best movies I saw this year. The creative imaginations these guys have is very good. This movie easily compares to Toy Story, I can't wait 'till Toy Story 2.",A Bug's Life
202,coralkrystals,Crushingly Boring,4,10 February 2019,"Bugs Life! Buuuugs Life! It's about bugs...yup!
I mean don't get me wrong it's not HORRIBLE, it's just not really noteworthy?",A Bug's Life
203,Steven-10,This movie is good eatin'!,10,6 December 1998,"""A Bug's Life"" is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.The story couldn't have been better; it's clever, has ""heart"" (emotion), and every character has a nice ""arc"" (a growth or change).  By comparison, the only characters in ""Toy Story"" to have an ""arc"" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz.  There are tons of laughs and cute moments in ""A Bug's Life"".  All of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb.This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the ""10"" I gave it.",A Bug's Life
204,rob-105,better the second time,9,29 November 1998,"delicious, and tasty fake out-takes... Woody Allen echoes and great Kermit-like voices in the circus bugs... we want the video.  This is 2d generation Toy Story done proud... we liked it even better the second time we saw it today!",A Bug's Life
205,Movieguy-21,Pixar makes great Movies!,8,22 December 1998,"I saw ""A Bugs Life"" and I can say that it is one of the most imaginative funny movies of the year. I was laughing throughout the entire movie. Kids will love the crazy characters and colorful scenes but I don't think they will appreciate the comedy like an adult will. Pixar also shows the academy award winning animation short, ""Geri's Game"" in the beginning and it is also very funny. Go see it.",A Bug's Life
206,worldofun,"Funny, touching movie with a lot of heart!",10,7 July 2000,"I have to say this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen! (second only to Toy Story 2.)  The animation in it was very smooth, and the backgrounds were gorgeous!  This movie has a lot of atmosphere in it, with bright pretty leaves in contrast with the blue sky in some scenes, and darker looking in others, all the atmospheric conditions really match up with the story in this movie.  If I have to compare this with 'Antz,' I would have to say 'A Bug's Life' wins hands down.  For one thing, a copy is never as good as the original, plus, as far as I know, Pixar worked alot longer on the story ideas, starting way back in 1995! This movie has a lot of funny sequences in it (just like any Pixar film so far!) yet it has a lot of heart, and a strong story.  If you haven't seen this film: Go see it!  It's worth it!",A Bug's Life
207,fdm25892,Not Disney's Best Effort,6,3 January 2012,"I have to be honest, out of all the Disney films on my shelf, this has to be the least impressive. Don't get me wrong, it's not that bad a film but it does seem like when Disney made this, they realised soon after that they were going to have to step up in their next efforts. The animation in the film is shoddy in parts, a vast difference from its predecessor, Toy Story which is almost note perfect. There are some quite clear mistakes which suggests to me that the makers were in a hurry to churn it out as a money making project. It has to be said that the cast of characters out with the ant community are superb, very funny and very clever, but they don't appear in the film until a good while in. Up until this point, the characters are dull, bland and they all look the same. There's no creativity. Yes they are all ants but some defining features would have been nice. That being said, it is still a good film to sit and watch with the family, it's harmless, there's little to no real violence and it's not easy for films to pass that off. I had a few good laughs but not quite enough in my opinion. I like the film but it's not up to Disney's usual high standards.",A Bug's Life
208,joybutton,Brilliant!,8,30 November 1998,"Brilliant! Nothing short of brilliant! We're not talking about a  leg-up over Antz, we're talking *light-years* ahead. Superior animation, superior effects, superior characters, script, plot, direction, facial expressions, physical motion, weight realism, textures, humor, colors, and music. Did I mention it's got loads of class? Hoorah for Pixar! Even if Dreamworks/PDI stole the current market for computer animated bug movies with their cheap knock-off, you've still won. I'm definitely seeing A Bug's Life again. :-DPS- Geri's Game! The credits! Freakin' *brilliant!*",A Bug's Life
209,AD-7,"Disney rules, ones again.",10,23 February 1999,"Disney (and the wonderful folks at PIXAR of course) offer a nice, humourous story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'Antz' and they only had four legs (in 'Antz' six...). But backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking. But let this be a lesson: it was not the computer who made it such a success : it was the man behind the machine, who added the nice little twists, which I missed in 'Antz'. Some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end (So keep watching at the end, it's worth it!), which were highly amusing and original. The line 'Filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer.",A Bug's Life
210,Sloe,"Entymology aside, Pixar has really worked the bugs out.",8,21 December 1998,"For everyone who's ever said ""The ants are supposed to have six legs"", my reply is ""It's a cartoon, people "". They speak English, build aerodynamic flying machines, and circus caravans all without the requisite 5th & 6th legs.   They're not supposed to do that either, remember??  Besides - any kid who's using cartoons to write a science paper already has serious problems.Now that we've gotten *that* out of the way - Pixar has done it again.  Like Toy Story, the creatures are well done, considering they had a more complex set of characters to build.....I say more complex, because this time almost all the cast share the same body type, so the differences were more subtle, and therefore more difficult to render.The story is a simple one.......Over-enthusiastic bungler with a heart of gold accidently starts a war.  In trying to fix it, he accidently becomes the hero.   Combine the inventor in Back To The Future with Jerry Lewis in any film and there's Flik.Great film  I'd see it again in a heartbeat....You should, too.",A Bug's Life
211,sheanazar,A movie for all ages,9,2 July 2002,"This movie is a journey, not soon forgotten.  This movie will hit home for many people.  If you are an adult, and don't like cartoons.  You need to watch this one.  This could have very well been named ""everyday life"". It's so entertaining.  I haven't been the first one in line to buy cartoons. But this movie change my way of thinking.  It puts relates to life in a way that is enjoyable.  I can now watch cartoons with my children.",A Bug's Life
212,noodleboy500,Good for the whole family,6,18 December 2002,"This is good movie for the whole family to watch, because it entertaining on many different levels. Dad, how many times have you been bored stiff watching crummy baby movies, just for the sake of keeping the kids happy? Well here's a movie that you can watch and enjoy along with children of all ages.While not quite up to the quality of Toy Story or Monsters Inc, it's still a nice flick... go rent it, you won't be disapointed.",A Bug's Life
213,Vickerend,Very Good.,8,29 July 2008,"A Bug's Life is said to be Pixar's weakest movie along with Cars. But well, everything Pixar does is amazing and A Bug's Life is a very good animation film.Maybe the greatness of Toy Story influenced in the hype for the movie with the consequence of being a let down for some people.I think A Bug's Life has a very powerful character development which makes the main characters so lovable. The adventure is more than interesting and the animation just wonderful. The sound is also very good.It may have a simple plot, but it contains a very complex heart which many people refused to understand.Great Job Pixar: 7.9/10",A Bug's Life
214,Decio,EXTREMELY CUTE.,9,2 January 1999,"Seen again with my 8 y.young daughter. Very nice picture, well written and bringing good message. I would recommend to any audience, and as a matter of fact, would go back to see it again.",A Bug's Life
215,Rancor-3,Better than Antz,7,1 December 1998,"I saw Antz before I saw A Bugs Life, and frankly I thought it was a lot better.  Kevin Spacey stuck true to his character and I loved all of the stars and their voices.  The best part, though was the end credits.If you walked out before the credits you missed out on the best part of the movie.  To all of you who have NOT seen it.  STAY FOR THE CREDITS!!!",A Bug's Life
216,Karlover,You won't believe it's animation,9,29 November 1998,"When viewing a movie like this, it is hard to appreciate the work that must have gone into making it. A Bug's Life is an animation masterpiece; an entertainment package for all ages. The experience starts with a short Pixar animation entitled Geri's Game, which won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Short Film. This film itself was amazing. As for the actual movie, it combines a good story, a good lesson, and great animation for an all-around great package. The casting of the voices was brilliant. You can recognize who the celebrities behind the voices are at first, but it takes very little time before their voices are permanently the possessions of their characters. The greatest thing I liked from A Bug's Life, along with all animations, is the attention to detail. From realistic shadows, to the intricate grains of sand, so the scar on Hopper's eye, I am in awe of how computers can create such a realistic masterpiece. I definitely suggest it for all ages. Great date movie. Wink, wink.",A Bug's Life
217,dgasior,Cute and fun,7,6 December 1998,"A Bug's Life was cute, fun, and light hearted.  The animation was cool, but there was no WOW factor to it.  Nice story and pleasant.  Be sure to stay for the credits though - the credits are the BEST part of the movie - really!",A Bug's Life
218,Will-58,A Good Laugh... and more,9,24 February 1999,"For starters, it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh (check out the two Russian bugs).A Bug's Life has a classical Disney storyline, but that's one of the good things about the movie. Family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end. And it also has a couple of great voice-overs by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course),... But actually, the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds... And the guys and girls at Pixar made it all look so realistic. All in all, a very nice piece of work. This is the best animation by Disney since Aladdin.",A Bug's Life
219,jessikalea,Even my Favorite!,9,7 December 2002,"My 3 year old daughter loves this movie and I find I tend to stick around and watch whenever its being played. She watches it quite often. For those Bug type lovers, this one is for you. I gave this movie a fantastic rate.",A Bug's Life
220,zweistein,Cute Bugs,6,17 January 2003,"I agree this is a nice, funny, enjoyable movie. It has a lot of good ideas, beautifully rendered scenery and cuddly characters. However, it lacks the depth of the competition, ""Antz"" which I watched right before ""A Bug's Life"". Do you know ""Maya the Bee""? This movie is a bit like this TV series, about all sorts of insects living together and having fun. The story is OK, bug not great - Ants are bullied by a gang of grasshoppers, but with enough courage they can fight them off by their sheer numbers. A bunch of circus bugs is needed to make the ants realize this. No one really gets scared by the movie, the well animated bugs look all cute, including the ""bad guys"". The movie is in the best tradition of Disney movies, good quality but very predictable. Pixar did a great job nevertheless.",A Bug's Life
221,qssmith,Excellent movie!,9,27 November 1998,"I was expecting a good movie, but it was even better than I thought it would be. Amazing animation, great character design, a nice plot with a non stop ending. Please stay for the end credits..you'll be glad you did. I haven't seen ""ANTZ"" and I know they are supposed to be taken as two completely different movies, but all I hear is ""ANTZ is great. ""A Bug's Life"" can't compete with it."" Well, this is the way I feel about ""A Bug's Life"". I feel it would be very hard for ""ANTZ"" to be better. I guess I haven't seen ANTZ yet because the character design looks very boring and the main character ""Z"" looks just like a typical Woody Allen character which, in my opinion, gets a little old. I won't comment any more on the movie since I haven't seen it, but do go see ""A Bug's Life.""",A Bug's Life
222,Britt-7,A Bugs' Life. Not just another cartoon.,10,23 April 1999,"I am a 12 yr. old girl and I happen to think that A Bugs' Life rises above all the rest. It has everything. Comedy, drama, action, and much more. It makes you feel like you never want to smush another ant again. The creativity in this movie was incredible. I believe very strongly that this isn't one of those Family-Movies - but-only-kids-would-really-want-to-watch- them-movies. Its real, quality entertainment that anyone can enjoy. This fantastic film is also one of the cutest and most clever. I mean, really. Who could say that Dot isn't cute? No one! Also, the way the script was written from a real bugs' point of view made the whole movie come together. I think that everyone who has the time should go see this clever, cute, and utterly wonderful movie. Thank you.",A Bug's Life
223,skinny-10,Even the kids lost interest half way through the film!,6,25 April 1999,"The characters were cleverly animated, but the story was just not that interesting. Better suited for a TV show of 30 or 60 minutes - not the extravaganza we were expecting after all of the hype.",A Bug's Life
224,gdhiskes,The Little Things - A Bug's Life Warrants Appreciation,8,15 July 2020,"While A Bug's Life is not the greatest Pixar movie, it's ahead of its time animation certainly warrants appreciation. Outside of the technical aspects, A Bug's Life also set the precedent for Pixar movies to discuss more complex themes that exist in our society, something that Toy Story is not so focused on. John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Joe Ranft's story about an ant going from zero to hero is really a facade for a deeper story or handbook about the virtues needed to empower the people and masses and bring about the changes necessary to solve problems of inequality.",A Bug's Life
225,ARRUHbeast,PIXAR's worst movie,4,23 February 2004,"I saw Toy Story and thought it was one of the most brilliant and creative films ever. However, when I saw A Bug's Life when it came out at the cinemas, though I was only 8, I still thought it was a pile of crap. It all just seems too happy compared to all of PIXAR's other films. Adults can enjoy all of PIXAR's other films, whereas A Bug's Life has nothing for adults. The story was weak and there was nothing to else to help the film, as there were no new visual techniques used.Compared to the likes of Monster's Inc. and Toy Story this film is nothing.",A Bug's Life
226,travis010,One of the best animation movies ever made!,10,5 August 1999,"I liked this movie a lot.  I think it is as good as toy story and better then Antz.  This movie has a great plot and great voices.  I would suggest that if all possible people see it on DVD.  On the DVD you get two sets of out takes, wide screen or full screen, and a bonus short story (Geri's Game(Winner of the 1997 academy award for best animated short story). I would suggest this movie to everyone.",A Bug's Life
227,Emma97,Computer animation at its best,9,3 December 1998,"I loved this movie.  Aside from the charming plot and characters, the computer animation deserves a whole other set of accolades.  I loved Toy Story and this movie has taken the incredible animation from that one and made it smoother, more seamless, and more beautiful.  It just amazes me how amazing the look of this movie was.  It was truly a technological feat.  I think that Disney has a real hit with this one.",A Bug's Life
228,Mike-433,Delightful!!,9,30 November 1998,An absolutely delightful film.  The visuals will entertain the children while the one-liners and puns keep the adults holding their sides.  Be sure to sit through the end credits; there's a few surprises hidden there.,A Bug's Life
229,danmaskell,"Captivating animation, decent storyline",8,2 December 1998,"I was in awe of the detail provided by Pixar.  They really made it seem like it was filmed with a camera.  Having the foreground and background come in and out of focus depending on the focal point was marvellous.  The storyline could have been better, but held its own.  The bits during the closing credits are the funniest of the entire movie - don't leave early.  Head and shoulders better than Antz.",A Bug's Life
230,Qui-Gon-14,Eye Candy,9,12 December 1998,It's rare that a film as entertaining as A Bug's Life comes along. It was one of the most visually spectacular films I've ever seen if not THE most. My only complaint was that Flik's redemption was a lttle unsatisfying.,A Bug's Life
231,KG140NY,Over a year and I still cry,10,26 May 1999,"This is maybe the funniest movie I've ever seen and certainly one of the most ingenious.  I saw it in the theatres twice and just got the DVD. EVERY time I watch it I laugh hard.  Every time I watch it I see something new to laugh at.  Whether it's the facial expressions of Tuck and Roll, Slim waving his hand while flying, or 'FLAMING DEATH!'.  If you've seen the movie you're probably smiling.  If you haven't, well, you need to.  Jeez, just thinking about it is making me crack up!",A Bug's Life
232,bennie.rothmann,Entertainment at its best!,9,28 December 1999,"I thought this movie would be the same as the ""Toy Story"", but to my surprise it was wonderfully different! The characters are portrayed very naturally, the plot is ""fresh"" and the humour is witty (though sometimes a bit too mature for smaller children). There were no dull moments in the movie. It is very entertaining.Only when I saw the movie three or four times I realized the immense amount of detail and ""background"" animation was done. It is not only a movie - it is a work of art. Virtually every frame of this movie you can make into a poster! I wish I could have been part of the production team of this movie.",A Bug's Life
233,dratthecat,Really cute film,7,18 August 2008,"This is perhaps one of the weaker of Pixar's efforts but even a weak effort by Pixar is better than ninety percent of the stories out there. A Bug's Life is a great example of what to do right in creating a story. They surround the main character, Flik, (voice provided by Dave Foley) with colorful characters much like in classic comedies. What a shame that Joe Ranft, the voice of Heimlich died. Such a lovable character. Then Pixar makes sure there's a good story to go with it. This story is about a colony of ants who are tormented by some bully grasshoppers who take what the ants work so hard for. Even though the story is animated, Pixar makes the world a metaphor for the real world. Another fine effort for the Pixar gang.",A Bug's Life
234,dimakop,A brilliant film,10,4 January 2004,"Without a doubt one of the most brilliant made. Definitely entertaining till the end. Everyone's a critic about everything, that's life, but if you can do better than that yourself then put up or shut up. Pixar has put up over and over again and the Disney / Pixar combo has done wonders. Top marks 10/10 for a great film. Good work Pixar.",A Bug's Life
235,z-40733,"A small, small world by Pixar",10,2 April 2021,"Even though we sometimes forget about this movie, A Bug's Life is a big story with small characters. This cute little movie by Pixar tells the story of Flik, an ant who lives in a colony of ants called Ant Island. From our view, it's just a field of grass and a tree in the center. But to the ants, it's their home. They are constantly struggling for survival, collecting food for the winter. Sometimes a gang of bullying grasshoppers, led by this big ruthless bully named Hopper, tries to steal the food, but the ant colony outnumber them and as always, the ants usually eat the foods they have for themselves. One summer, the Ant Queen and her daughter, Ant Princess Atta are tired of being constantly bullied by the grasshoppers. They send Flik off on a grand quest to search for the greatest warriors of all of bugdom. On his grand adventure, Flik hires an out of business circus troupe: the clowns, Slim, the stick bug who has been used a prop as a clown, Heimlich, a VERY hungry caterpillar with a thick German accent, Francis, a male ladybug with a very short temper who hates being constantly mistaken for a female, the lion taming act Dim, a gentle rhino beetle and Rosie, his caring lion taming black spider, the magicians Manto the Magnificent, a praying mantis and his lovely assistant, Gypsy Moth, and the pill bug acrobats from Hungary, Tuck and Roll. They are given the job as warriors, but things don't go according to plan, but Flik must rally the circus bugs and his fellow ants, including his best friend Princess Dot, young sister of Atta, to fight the grasshoppers and have food for winter. This movie is very adorable, with heroic music, cute characters (the good and the bad), and a fun story. It even includes a bunch of funny outtakes in the end credits, one of which includes Sheriff Woody from Toy Story, Pixar's first adventure.",A Bug's Life
236,lmb,A poorly written homage to Kirasawa,5,30 November 1998,"I was disappointed by the writing for this film.  Sure, the graphics are great, but that alone is not sufficient to create a quality film.  I went in expecting something fresh and original like Toy Story, and all I got was a retelling of the Seven Samarai/Magnificent Seven that missed the essence of that plot line.  The point of ""Seven"" plot is the self-sacrifice of the seven.  If the the writers' focus is going to be the single hero, why bother with a plot that gives away the entire story in the first five minutes.The most telling thing about this film is that everyone who sees it agrees that the out-takes at the end are the best thing in the picture. Sad.",A Bug's Life
237,renton_,A Funny LightHearted Movie,10,30 November 1998,A bug's life is a major step for Pixar and Disney. A Bug's Life was a cute movie about a little ant named Flick who just couldn't make it as an ant and was also trying to prove himself worthy to the queen and princess.The Cast of voices in this movie was amazing and Our own Canadian Dave Foley did wonders for the roll of Flick.I would have to say the this movie will do wonders.,A Bug's Life
238,Ralphie-3,Best Disney film since Aladdin,9,26 November 1998,"Not much to say, except that it was much more fun and creative than Antz, to my surprise. Dave Foley's personality is a perfect match for his character Flik, and the voice of David Hyde Pierce, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss and Dennis Leary are fun throughout. Don't believe any negative reviews--GO SEE IT! It is definitely fun for both adults and kids.",A Bug's Life
239,Mr. B-4,Absolutely fantastic!,10,28 November 1998,"This movie was bit darker than Toy Story and could scare some younger children, but the ending credits put this one over the top. Don't leave early, or you'll miss the out-takes. Yes, that's right, out-takes. I'll bet a lot more work when into these than anything at the end of Cannonball Run. :)",A Bug's Life
240,Graham-16,Nothing New.,4,2 December 1998,"Once again Disney puts out a good looking piece of fluff.  Sure the movie looks great, but there is little else there.  Sadly, the movie follows the classic Disney storyline.  Hero screws up.  Hero tries to fix screw up. Hero screws up bigger and loses all faith in himself.  Secondary character says, ""I believe in you.""  Hero saves the day.  Sure it was a good message the first ten times we heard it, but isn't enough enough?  Next time I hope they put as much thought into the story as they do the design.",A Bug's Life
241,andy-188,brilliantly imaginative,7,6 December 1998,"I thought this film was really brilliant and imaginative. Most films these days seem to lack imagination and so it is really something special when a movie possesses this quality. I did think the story was a little lame, but this was more than compensated for by the creativity of the artists who made it.   I thought it was a million times better than Antz which seems pedestrian and lacking in imagination in comparison.",A Bug's Life
242,Ahmad-4,Funniest film in a long time,9,23 December 1998,"This is a FUNNY film. It has all the usual Disney components (music, great range of characters, story, appeal), entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say ""Antz"" and ""Price of Egypt"".The characters work really well, and have a strong appeal, and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers. The movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience.Call me crazy, but I have seen the film three times, and I intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend. Many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.See it, and don't be put off because it is animated. You are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! The bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout.",A Bug's Life
243,CpnRinch,Here's why it's a great story.,10,17 June 1999,"The animation is superb. Enough said about that. The story is a fun and positive message. First: Countless ants that can all work together, yet still retain their individualism.Second: When you put that much force to work, you can achieve monumental goals(The bird)Third:Individuals can use a known ability they possess to overcome almost any challenge(The circus bugs do this)Finally: There is more good in the world than evil(evil just gets more press) This is the ratio of ants to grasshoppers.Enjoy this movie many times and realize that the positive message of it is also the reality of life.Have a Great Day :)P.S. It's really really funny too.",A Bug's Life

Something was definitely missing.  The characters lacked heart, the voices were thin, it lacked the heart that I expect from a film.Dave Foley was an appropriate enough voice, but could not compare to Woody Allen (whom I am NOT a big fan of.)   The princess's voice was still too weak and thin to be an Ant.  Someone with a more powerful voice (like Rosey) would have made (O'Donnell of course) a better voice there, just to make a more ant like voice (yes, I talk to ants all of the time :)Artistically, the film was woo hoo.  Cannot be stated any better.  Even if the ants only had four legs.  The crowd scenes were beautiful and had to be seen.Enough chatter, go see the flik, er flick...",A Bug's Life

Yes I know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. We have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. The great difference is the way that the story takes. Our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, HEROES.

248,solidsnake1986_61,One of the greatest movies ever...,10,16 June 2004,"I must honestly say for even being in my mid-teens that this is one of the only child/family movies I always like to watch. It can make me laugh each time I see it. Not to mention I discover something new each time you watch it. I have a stereo that has many features and with the help of closed-captions, I can hear and understand everything they say that I couldn't understand before. To me for a long time from now I will always go back to this movie to relive what it was like to see it for the first time. Despite what others have to say, this is one of the best movies that Disney/Pixar have made. My way of seeing it, if it's Disney, it's gotta be good.",A Bug's Life

But what the hey, i'm 17 and I enjoy watching it still. And the rescue scene couldn't have been plotted out better. Makes you wonder if the movie started there and grew form it. Every bugs roll is perfect. Back to the summarization. Another thing about it is that you can find something new each time you watch it. Through watching it so many times, I have noticed where music plays that you have never heard it before.With the help of headphones that is. I enjoyed it and still do to this day, and if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself and watch it. Whether it is by yourself, family, or with one other person. See it and enjoy.",A Bug's Life
250,turdturdturdturdz,What a .....FLik? ha ha,10,9 February 2016,"Woody Allen shines as Flik in this movie about little bugs. It was cool to see the animation that was made for the movie. It looks like you could touch it, but don't. Bugs are interesting because they are just like people it turns out. I'm glad this movie was able to show me how human-like bugs can be. They are just like humans, in this movie and life. What a lesson to teach. And the animation is otherworldly. You just have to see this Dreamworks classic. Pixar ain't got nothing on this baby. Oh yeah, the dang ladybug is funny too, who was that? Harry Dean Stanton? Whatever happened to classic bugs movies like A Bigs Life? They could've tried harder with Kung Chung Panda 2 to make it better, and about bugs. Hey this movie was made using a computer and I think that's pretty radical. These guys are truly wizards, taking the ones and zeroes and making Woody Allen into ant ant. Its gotta be seen to be believed, because it is truly a representation of nature in its natural habitat, nature.",A Bug's Life

252,Rishi,"Cute, though predictable film",5,31 December 1998,"This film depicts ants locked in a mortal struggle with their oppressors, the grasshoppers.The animation was superb, and probably the strongest part of the film. How often can you say that every frame in a movie is spectacular?The acting was adequate. However, in many of the roles, it seemed as though better actors may have been available. Though I think Dave Foley and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are great actors, almost anyone could have been cast in their roles and done a solid job. Some performances were brilliant, such as Phyllis Diller as the queen and David Hyde Pierce as Slim, but for the most part, the acting was forgettable.As for the plot, it was mostly predictable. There were a couple of interesting twists, such as the construction of a fake bird, but the story was extremely formulaic.Still, the movie was worth seeing. Some classic moments, including false ""outtakes"" at the end with actors flubbing lines, etc. but overall, the movie was just solid with occasional flashes of brilliance. Rating: 6.",A Bug's Life

The bird attack and the rain storm scenes were unbelievable.  The bloopers were a riot!But again Hollywood pumps out a high-gloss, low-impact movie.  For all its beauty, it was a pretty ho-hum story.  They could have really played up the Seven Samurai angle by offering a more in-depth, poignant view of the life of these oppressed ants.  Perhaps tugged on the heart-strings a little more. I found myself almost rooting for the grasshoppers against these simple, whining ants.

260,Flik,"A Bug's Life: Not Just Art, But Heart",10,4 January 1999,"(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was ""dazed and exhausted"" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'.  So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being ""wowed"" by each frame visually.  How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life?  ""Heck"" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...).  Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!).  But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color.  No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story.  But, I'm glad to say, it's not!  A Bug's Life has real heart.   Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them!  Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think!  Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has.  This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing.  The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots.  Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not ""dumbing down"" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not.  All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point.  Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?",A Bug's Life
261,idbin2005,Nature has a certain order,8,4 April 2006,"Abridged from 2,308 words to fit the IMDb limit of 1,000 words.Since drawings are inherently genderless, the animation of gender provides unique opportunities for distorting gender stereotypes.A Bug's Life opens with a portrayal of gender hierarchy. The ants are technically ruled by a queen, but in reality by her daughter, the princess. Hence we see from the outset the intrusion of human gender politics into a world created to amuse, and perhaps educate, human children. Note: real queen ants doesn't rule, they merely breed.In Disney's bug society the workers are subservient to female ants. That is nature. What is not natural is that in A Bug's Life the worker ants have male voices. Real worker ants are female: male ants only exist to inseminate the queen, and die shortly after mating.In this imaginary world all the ants of both sexes have enough to live healthy and natural lives. There are only two problems with this microcosm: and males cause both.Flik is a bumbling male inventor and engineer. Engineering seems to be a negative, destructive, patriarchal force. We see plant stalks damaged by one of his inventions, and the princess - a female - being crushed. This emphasises a stereotypical female victim/male destroyer role.The male worker ants gather food into a huge pile. They are directed by male ants. The gatherers are clearly of very limited intelligence: when a leaf falls in their path, they need help in order to get around it. The male helpers are slightly more intelligent, but not by much.The ants hide underground. The princess heroically ensures that her subjects are safe from what is evidently a dangerous situation. But bumbling Flik has been left outside. In an instant he contrives to lose the whole feast. The food pile was very precariously balanced to begin with - by male gatherers and male directors. The disaster is engineered entirely by males.Note that a real queen ant does not protect her colony, and has a smaller brain than her workers.The food was a conciliatory offering to a gang of grasshoppers: the matriarchal ant society had found a peaceful solution to a physical threat, but male action threatens that stability. The grasshoppers seem to be all male. They threaten, they swagger; yet they are bumbling and hypocritical. Stereotypical males, in other words.Cut to a fight between a beetle and a spider. The beetle is very threatening and appears to have all the physical advantages. Somehow, the spider hurts the beetle, which then bursts into tears. The spider consoles it. The beetle's voice is male, the spider's voice is female. Ergo, males can't really fight, despite their advantages; females are stronger and braver than males, regardless of size and strength. This message is repeated in the closing grasshopper scenes: aggression is all front. It is a questionable message. In reality, kids who confront bullies may find they win, or they may get beaten to a pulp: some bullies are tough.We soon realise that the fight is a performance in an insect circus: but that the snivelling isn't a part of the act. The circus is losing money. Through a quick succession of argumentative, vain, childish male characters, we learn why the circus has problems. The two females - the spider and the butterfly - don't share the blame.There are a couple of heckling male flies in the audience. Their comments are not only unhelpful, they are also sexist, referring lewdly to the ladybird who they believe to be female. Or perhaps they are joking about this. No females behave in an overtly sexist manner in the film, so sexism is being portrayed as a male trait. The ladybird is male, and doesn't like being mistaken for a female. His reaction is unduly aggressive, i.e. he exaggerates his maleness. This is instantly recognisable as a portrayal of male sexual identity crisis: but anyone who doubts this should note that at the end of the film we are told he is now ""in touch with his feminine side"".We learn that the beetle's name is Dim, i.e. he is stupid, as well as aggressive, bullying and cowardly. None of the females have such derogatory names. This is not to suggest that every single negative quality is associated with males, and vice-versa. Flik in particular is brave, intelligent and resourceful. However the very few female weaknesses are both relatively trivial and justified, for example the princess's impatience with Flik. All of the male characters, on the other hand, are at best deeply flawed.The ants win the battle. ""Nature has a certain order"", the princess tells Hopper. Females, it seems, head this film's view of that order. The final scene is in part entirely natural: hopper ends up being fed to some chicks. But it is made very clear that he is still alive, which may not be very realistic. His screams are certainly not realistic: grasshoppers do not have human male voices. Hopper's demise is merely another example of trivialising male death - even hideous death - in the name of entertainment. In this case, entertainment for children.Most films would have ended with the male and female leads beginning a relationship, but this one is so steeped in 1990s political correctness that it can't allow that to happen - despite the hints earlier in the film, and even with the female in the superior role. The final message, then, is that women do not need men.A Bug's Life is an entertaining film whose animation is never less than astonishing. The closing credits alone are amazing. Nevertheless it is a consistently sexist portrayal of gender roles.",A Bug's Life

264,gessner-jp,Love this over Antz,7,13 February 2012,"Several of Walt Disney Pictures' best animated films of recent years have been released or distributed through Pixar, an animation studio that specializes in computer generated animation and ""A Bug's Life"", their follow up to the hugely successful ""Toy Story"" ranks as one of the best and funniest Walt Disney Pictures animated films. Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as ""Antz."" The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some ""warrior"" bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus. Flik decides to bring them back to the colony and recruit them as warrior bugs. An inventive idea for a children's film with much of the same humor and ideas that helped to make ""Toy Story"" an animated classic.",A Bug's Life
265,palmer1-320-821321,Super Disney Flick!,9,22 March 2012,"""Bugs Life"" was blasted by the critics upon release, springing from the bowels of Disney not too long after the almost identical ""Antz"". However, as a stand-alone movie, it is difficult to fault. The characters and backgrounds are beautifully rendered but still look like computer animations. That might sound stupid but for those who think computer graphics can equal live-action, this film serves to debunk that idea. It does look good, no question, but compare this to the computer wizardry behind Gollum in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and you'll see what I'm getting at. This is not much of a criticism though - it would be akin to disliking Scooby Doo (the series) because nobody says ""Zoinks!"" when they're scared.I must confess, I rather enjoyed this film. It is imaginative and colourful and full of zest and energy - exactly how a kids film should be. The humour is a little on the basic side (dumb insects falling into walls and references to ""poop-poop"") but again, this is what you would expect. Another reason that ""A Bug's Life"" got the cold treatment from critics was because it simply wasn't as entertaining to adults as the ""Toy Story"" films and I'm afraid I agree. But what the film lacks in cross-generational appeal, it makes up for with enthusiasm and story-telling. It does for bugs what The Flintstones did for neolithic cavemen, fitting outsiders into our own everyday lives. Flick, the rebellious ant at the centre of the story, produces telescopes out of grass and water. Piles of rubbish are portrayed as vast cities and the characters, good and bad, behave as we might. Credit for this must go to the top-notch cast of voice actors including Kevin Spacey, David Hyde Pierce, Denis Leary and the others. Probably the only let-down was John Ratzenberger who sounded exactly like Cliff from ""Cheers"". Still, nice to know he's getting work after all these years.",A Bug's Life

These reviews tearing down kid's movies from getting close to 2 decades ago(check out IMDb's page on The Lion King, it's a disgrace) are getting ridiculous. These movies were created with the sole purpose of entertaining partially developed minds for 70-90 minutes. Give them a break.

BUT Kevin Spacey did provide for a very sexy [voice of] Hopper!I can see children loving this, and would recommend it for them.",A Bug's Life
289,bigtam-2,Not as witty as Toy Story,7,12 March 1999,"The movie was a let-down after Toy Story and Antz. The graphics are great, characterisation is not bad, but overall the movie did not provide the same amount of satisfaction that Toy Story and Antz did.",A Bug's Life
290,dochog-2,No pest worth seeing more !!!,10,5 April 1999,A must see by all - if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one.  Easily one of the best animation/cartoons released in a long-time.  It took the the movies Antz to a whole new level.  Do not mistake the two as being the same movie - although in principle the movies plot is similiar.  Just go and enjoy.,A Bug's Life
291,BillT-2,Fabulous!,10,25 August 1999,"I'm sorry I missed this in the theaters. But I finally rented the video last night and was very glad I did. It's been a long time since any movie has managed to get through a lifetime of emotional armor and get me to laugh out loud so often.And not just laughs. It's a truly hopeful and optimistic view of an individual's struggle to belong, to give and accept love. I hate the word heartwarming because it gets so overused. But that is exactly the effect it had on me!",A Bug's Life
292,hagorafobe,(yawn),4,17 January 2000,"It's beautiful to watch, but there's not a helluva lot of substance here. Kevin Spacey is great (natch) as Hopper, a badass grasshopper. David Foley is rather bland as Flik, the valiant ant who must travel far and wide to find bugs who will help defend the hill. There is so much animation out there that kicks this Flik's butt that I can't even begin to recommend.<p>The best thing about this film are the 'outtakes' played during the credits (they're made as though the animated characters have flubbed lines, and are *very* funny), and Geri's Game, an award-winning animated short from Pixar that falls into the Heartwarming category.<p>Forget this lousy picture, and go rent Pinocchio or Fantasia again. Or go out on a limb and see Akira.",A Bug's Life
293,barth002-1,"Fear, bullies, aggression, ugly stereotypes: a toxic brew for kids.",1,23 September 2006,"This is one of the worst films for kids I have ever seen with my four year old son. It is built around fear, bullies, aggression, and ugly stereotypes. This film is a bonanza for therapists and sociologists, and it goes a long way towards explaining some of the pathologies of this society. How about a movie that lets kids be kids, instead of this onslaught of cheap sentiments and terror? The calculated story uses every trick to scare kids. The limited imagination of the story writers is particularly insulting. Is everything just about good and evil and the fight for survival? For young kids?? In many ways the film is a throwback to Cold War films such as Red Dawn (1984), in which school kids fought a Russian invasion (no kidding!). Is ""A Bug's Life"" how we are supposed to prepare our kids for the war on terrorism? In sum, this film is a toxic brew. Kids deserve better.",A Bug's Life
294,dtheocharis,Great animation,9,13 February 2006,"Pixar created one of the best animation-films of the last years. The movie is pleasant not only for children, but also for adults. It is an adventure story with successful jokes and quite interesting and amusing characters. Flik, the goofer but brave and stubborn ant, Hopper, the satanic and wild chief of the locusts and the overstrung princess Atta are really hard to forget. The director John Lasseter and the co-director Andrew Stanton, who have also created the screenplay of the movie, are two of the best professionals in the Pixar Animation Studios. The ""Bug's life"" is the second long picture of Pixar after the successful ""Toy story I"" in cooperation with Walt Disney.",A Bug's Life
295,NickSilveira,An awesome movie for all ages!,10,23 January 2014,"An ant named Flik messes with the food offering for grasshoppers and is forced to search for ""warrior bugs"" to fight them. How fun! The movie is quite enjoyable, and I now realize there were some jokes I never got when I was a child and that I see now almost everyday. But I don't really think kids must watch adult jokes like ""Hey, cutie! Wanna polinize with a real bug?"" It can be also referred to homosexuality. Oh, well, let's put that aside. Some precocious child can understand some not-so-good scenes, seeing that the only I really got as a child were the violent ones. That's not really suitable for young kids. Anyhow, older viewers' eyes will be stick in the relationship between Flik and Dot. That is so cute! I really enjoyed the father/older brother relationship Flik has with Dot, and the motivational line ""Pretend that's a seed"" is with me since I was 8 years old. That's so awesome! It's great to see the friendship the movie tells you to have! The characters were awesomely elaborated, with a great plot and great visual effects that will make the viewers' eyes stay glued to the screen!",A Bug's Life
296,markvleedz,an Animation Classic.,10,14 March 2017,"In my heart a lot of us are like Flik. We might not be popular in school or at work but we have good intentions to help people improve their lives more than us being a hero. We are not too selfish and most of the time think more of others than ourselves. Being humble, share compassion, care and kindness. To appreciate one another without malice or expecting something in return. To learn and teach people to unite as one. I know many Animated films had themes like this but A Bug's Life have great real life lessons put all together in one.For a full review please check https://geekzarise.com/bugs-life-animation-classic/ Thank you. :)",A Bug's Life
