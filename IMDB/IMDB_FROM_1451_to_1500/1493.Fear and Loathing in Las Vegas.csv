0,Leofwine_draca,Not for me,2,9 July 2015,"Yeah, I'm not a fan of the drug culture and I'm not a fan of Johnny Depp either, so I predisposed to hate this movie. Guess what? I did. Despite the presence of former Python Terry Gilliam, who's directed some films I love like BRAZIL, FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS is a real mess of a movie. It's a plot less comedy that sees Depp and his companion Benicio del Toro travelling around the Nevada desert in their car which is filled to the brim with drugs and alcohol. Eventually they make the trip to Las Vegas, where things really kick off.The entire running time consists of Depp hallucinating and generally acting spaced out as ordinary, everyday situations become hectic fights for survival. There are rooms full of lizards and an overwhelming number of cameos from the likes of Gary Busey, Tim Thomerson, and Harry Dean Stanton, all of them playing generally offbeat, unusual, or just plain odd characters. Tobey Maguire looks weird as a sweaty hitchhiker. Depp tries hard, but this is merely another spin on his usual Jack Sparrow shtick which grew old for me many years ago. I hated him in it and I hated the film too.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
1,SnoopyStyle,Meandering surrealism,6,10 January 2015,"It's 1971. Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his 'attorney' Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) are on a drug-fueled road trip in the American west. They pick up a hitchhiker (Tobey Maguire) but he runs away screaming. They're on their way to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. They are joined by photographer Lacerda (Craig Bierko). Later, they attend a District Attorney's convention on narcotics.The surreal imagery is both ugly and tiring. I hoped the reptile vision is the start of some good visual attempts. I don't think Terry Gilliam is wild enough in this movie. Also the scenes are too long which stretches out the hazy feel of the movie. It feels repetitive. Johnny Depp is exploding with craziness but the early fascination fades. I'm not sure if Gilliam achieved anything other than tedium. It's not until the end that Gilliam comes up with something compelling. Gonzo pulling the knife on the waitress is the only truly compelling scene leading an interesting idea to conclude on. If only the rest of the movie had something to say too.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
2,kosmasp,Love it or hate it,10,5 February 2007,"After I watched this movie for the first time, I thought it was dumbest piece of ... whatnot I had ever seen! But as time passed (merely a few hours) and while I couldn't get that movie out of my head, I realised that Terry G. again made a movie, that nobody else could've done ... at least not like this! Everyone was saying that you couldn't possibly make a movie out of that book ... and nay-sayers will still be convinced that it can't be done. But I've come to terms and really accepted this movie for what it is! A crazy hell of a ride movie, that is just ludicrous! And I love it! Every f**ing minute of it! And how could you write a review without even mentioning the F-word. Try to listen to the commentary by the real Hunter S. Thompson! That's the guy who wrote the book, for those who don't know.So as this movie is just plain crazy, I don't know how to wrap this up ... maybe I just leave it open ... ;o)",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
3,lee_eisenberg,"Well, they did it.",5,16 September 2005,"Hunter S. Thompson's recent suicide brings ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" to mind again. Many people considered it unfilmable, so Terry Gilliam decided to make a movie. The result? Well, it's not a bad movie, but it's almost too weird too understand. Reporter Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) go to Las Vegas - aka the domain of Frank Sinatra, Henry Kissinger and Debbie Reynolds - to cover a convention. The only thing is, they're doing polypharmacy (many drugs at once) and they get SO-O-O-O-O-O-O MESSED UP!!!!!!!!! You can't even begin to imagine what they get like; you have to see the movie to understand, although squeamish people would do best to avoid this movie. My favorite scene was the whole sequence about the ""dope fiend"". This is gonzo journalism at it's best...and weirdest.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
4,jboothmillard,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,5,7 December 2005,"This is half way between being like a drug based film, and a road movie. So basically its a mix between Trainspotting and Thelma & Louise. Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke/Hunter S. Thompson and Licence to Kill's Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo/Oscar Z. Acosta are two heroin addicts, and are driving through Las Vegas for nearly no reason at all. Along the way they pick a hitchhiker played Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire, offend a café waitress played by Ellen Barkin. Also starring Christina Ricci as Lucy, Cameron Diaz as Blonde TV Reporter and Michael Jeter as L. Ron Bumquist. An interesting film from The Fisher King and Twelve Monkeys director Terry Gilliam, but kind of a one-time-see film. But Johnny Depp's voice and accent is very good. It was nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm for Gilliam. Johnny Depp was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor. Good!",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
5,Woodyanders,A wild and trippy journey into the vortex of the American nightmare,9,18 September 2021,"Flaky journalist Raoul Duke (superbly played to deadpan perfection by Johnny Depp) and his crazed attorney companion Dr. Gonzo (a gloriously unhinged and unrestrained portrayal by Benicio Del Toro) embark on a.no-holds-barred drug-fueled rampage in early 1970's Las Vegas.Director/co-writer Terry Gilliam presents a remarkably faithful adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's classic book that's every bit as manic, insane, and wickedly funny as it ought to be as it serves as a tragicomic eulogy to the failed optimism of the 1960's hippie counterculture that gave way to the selfish hedonism of the 1970's. More importantly, this film doesn't completely celebrate hedonistic excess; instead it offers an evenly balanced depiction of said excess which shows the potentially severe and ugly consequences beget by engaging in all sorts of crass and irresponsible behavior in a potent sequence in a diner where Gonzo terrorizes a haggard and frightened waitress (an excellent turn by Ellen Barkin) with a knife as well as several instances of Gonzo puking his guts out and Raoul having a nightmarish trip on some super strong dope.Moreover, this film further benefits from a neat array of vivid cameos by a game cast of familiar faces: Tobey Maguire as a wide-eyed naive hitchhiker, Christina Ricci as the underage Lucy, Cameron Diaz as a foxy TV reporter, Gary Busey as a lonely and loopy highway patrolman, Harry Dean Stanton as a stern judge, Christopher Meloni as an openly gay hotel clerk, Jeanette Goldstein as a hapless maid, and Flea as a stoned-out hippie freak. Nicola Pecorini's gaudy and careening widescreen cinematography delivers a wondrous wealth of strikingly surreal images. Spot-on period soundtrack, too. A delightfully deranged descent into mind-frying lunacy with a solid side order of stinging social commentary.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
6,Tweekums,"A strange trip to, and in, Las Vegas",7,18 June 2017,"Journalist Raoul Duke and his 'attorney' Dr. Gonzo are heading to Las Vegas; ostensibly to cover a desert motorcycle race but given the quantity and variety of drugs the pair have consumed things get weird before they have even arrived in Las Vegas. They only get stranger when they arrive; the hallucinations and paranoia escalate and strangeness ensues.It is hard to describe the plot as it is basically a series of weird things happening due to our protagonists' use of an industrial quantity of drugs. Terry Gilliam is just the man to bring such weirdness to the screen and he does a fine job directing. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro impress as Duke and Gonzo; it is easy to believe that they are really on something! The rest of the cast, which includes well-known actors in some minor roles, do well too. There are plenty of very funny moments as well as some disturbing ones I can't imagine many viewers will watch this and feel inspired to try various drugs. Overall I'd say that if you demand a solid plot you bay be disappointed but if you want surreal weirdness you won't get much more weird or more surreal than this.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
7,blanche-2,Mama told me not to come,8,16 July 2013,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is one of those movies you just have to go along with, or else turn it off - I say turn it off because I just caught it on TV, its theater days over.Written by Hunter S. Thompson, this wild tale is actually based on a true story: Thompson was attempting to get inside information on the killing of a Mexican-American TV journalist, Ruben Salazar. Having difficulty speaking to his source, Oscar Zeta Acosta, an attorney, in the atmosphere of LA, amidst racial tensions, the two travel to Las Vegas. Thompson has assignments there from Sports Illustrated, one to write a short paragraph, really just a caption accompanying photos of a motorcycle race.This was an example of ""Gonzo journalism"" during which Thompson would put himself in the midst of the story. In the film, Johnny Depp plays the Thompson character, Raoul Duke, and Benicio del Toro, who gained 40 pounds for the role of ""Dr. Gonzo,"" Raoul's ""300 pound Samoan attorney."" In the film, it is also arranged for Raoul to cover a narcotics officer conference.They're well stocked: with them, they have two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, five sheets of blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of coke, and assorted uppers, downers, etc., along with enough booze to keep all of Vegas happy for weeks.With Depp as Raoul narrating the story, we are introduced to 1971 Las Vegas, not the Disneyland that it is today, but the sleazy, rundown, crowded, liquored up Las Vegas with its glaring lights.It is here that Dr. Gonzo and Raoul search for the American dream in their paranoid, drugged out state, seeing enemies everywhere, trashing hotel rooms, skipping out on bills, wrecking cars, attacking the maid, seeing bats and monsters -- and after all of it, Raoul coming to the conclusion that the drug state glamorized by Dr. Timothy Leary was a big flop, referring to those participating in the acid culture as ""a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel."" You have to be in the mood for this film, because nothing actually happens much -- it's just one psychedelic trip after another, often hilarious. Johnny Depp, sporting a bald head, is absolutely fantastic, as is del Toro.This film is not for everyone, but it sports a fun soundtrack, some of the old Vegas, and some excellent acting.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
8,Quinoa1984,"Don't do drugs, just see this movie- Gilliam's masterpiece, perhaps",10,19 March 2000,"Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a psychedelic comedy, but also an astute piece of literature-cum-political science on a period in American history that was just really strange, thus reflected by its creator. It was the pioneer in 'Gonzo journalism' and sent Thompson's star even higher than it had with Hell's Angels. Although it's one of my personal favorite books, it could have been tricky to adapt it- Alex Cox tried and failed- but somehow Terry Gilliam digs into the Thompson psychology, dementia, and off-the-wall humor, while also putting his unmistakable mark on the material. Two sensibilities thus merge, alongside the tremendous performances (underrated, despite the praise from fans) from Depp and Del-Toro. It asks an essential question- how does society end up crossing paths with the outlaws? But there's more than that- much more in fact- but it takes more than one viewing. I remember writing the first time I saw it: ""This film is so bizarre you might just want to put down the bong and get high from this movie (after all, the movie contains every single known drug known to man since 1544).""Granted, it's immediate appeal is that of a midnight movie, the ultimate midnight movie, as a work where the visual style is cranked up to a queue that goes even further than past Gilliam ventures. Distorted, sometimes tilted, widescreen angles, very bright, strange colors via Nicola Pecorini, and a beating soundtrack loaded with everything from Jefferson Airplane to Tom Jones to Bob Dylan to Debbie Reynolds (what kind of rat bastard psychotic would put that on right now, at this moment)! And aside from Depp and Del-Toro, who immerse themselves to the hilt (Depp especially is in a form here comparable to his Pirates movies- you can't see anyone else play the character, and at the same time you almost can't recognize him, a credit to Depp's 'method' style), there's hilarious supporting work from Craig Bierko, Tobey Maguire, Gary Busey, Harry Dean Stanton (Castration!), and Christina Ricci, and even an extremely moving and dangerous scene with Ellen Barkin. It's not an easy film, to be certain, and it will likely appeal to those who may think 'ah, drugs, I like drugs, must be my kind of movie'. But it's not that simple; it's actually fairly critical of drug use, in an overblown, Fellini-esquire satirical manner (eg Adrenochrome, which is a tiny landmark of gonzo film-making to complement the author), and there really is no point where Gilliam, Thompson or the characters say 'take drugs'. On the other hand, there is also a critical attitude, a refreshing and brilliant one, on authority, like at the DEA convention at the hotel- again, strange times in society. At the same time the film is superb as escapist fun, in the darkest and craziest ways that only a maverick like Gilliam and his people can pull off, it's also got some layers in the substance, of Duke and Gonzo almost as relics from a former era already in 1971. With consistently quotable dialog, excruciating moments of depravity, and some of the most outrageous production design in any film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an unlikely cult classic, and in its own delirious fashion a possible definitive work from the director alongside Brazil.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
9,ComedyFan2010,"Like it drunk, hate it sober",6,8 March 2014,"A movie that brings back into the acid culture and shows the trip of the well known journalist.Now this is the movie that I kind of like and yet have trouble to tell why. My guess is that as I noticed I can't watch the movie when I am sober. It bores me. I can't ever finish it. I laugh only a few times. When I am on something, even if just alcohol, I love looking at it. Not that I am following the story then, it just seems like a lot of great colorful pictures.I am not even sure I like how Johnny Depp acted in it. Yes, I can't imagine anyone else doing it anymore, which seems that he created the right character. But there are so many parts where his overacting is just irritating.Sure there are some scenes which I think are perfection. Mainly the reptile scene, but all together the movie is just a combination of bad trips. It sure will stop one from doing LSD.And while I get the idea how it is supposed to be pointless and get you a look into the acid world of being on a trip, it still doesn't do anything for me.Still give it a 6. For being so unique and because enjoying it when drunk makes it do a partially good job.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
10,Theo Robertson,I Loathed This,3,24 March 2003,"This film is way too silly and surreal for a mainstream film fan like myself to enjoy . The director Terry Gilliam fails to keep the two leads under control which means this is one painfully embarrassing experience . Please note that a couple of actors doing funny walks pretending they`re on drugs does not make a comedy classic . In fact it`s nowhere near being a comedy film but more like a sub-standard David Lynch movie , that`s how bad it is . Yes the cinematography might be good but hands up anyone who sat down to watch a film because of the cinematography ?My final abiding memory of FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS ? Well apart from the fact it`s total crap I do remember that Dr Gonzo had too much hair and that Rauol didn`t have enough . Life`s often not fair where hair is concerned",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
11,Hey_Sweden,"Too weird to live, too rare to die.",7,27 July 2017,"One of a kind, drug laced odyssey from virtuoso filmmaker Terry Gilliam, based on the writings of notorious ""gonzo journalist"" Hunter S. Thompson. Johnny Depp stars as an alter ego for the writer, a man named Raoul Duke who embarks on a crazed journey to (and through) Las Vegas, the ultimate den of decadence in the U.S. of A. He's joined by his psychopathic lawyer, referred to only as ""Dr. Gonzo"" (Benicio Del Toro). Ostensibly on assignment to cover a motorcycle race, he finds his time taken up more heavily by his other pursuits.This viewer could see right away that, despite not being terribly familiar with Thompson or his writings, this would not be to all tastes. It's loud, garish, and over the top, filled almost non-stop with hallucinatory visuals (those ""lounge lizards"" designed by Rob Bottin are a treat) and very skewed perspectives. People do have to be prepared for such things as a close-up of vomit landing in a toilet bowl. But this viewer could also see that this is NOT exactly ""pointless"". Thompson does have some interesting things to observe, and comments on the entire ""counter culture"" era of the 1960s and early 1970s (this story takes place in 1971). It's also a pretty scathing indictment of mindless hedonism and substance abuse in ANY day and age; while a great deal of the visuals may be rooted in this era, they'll certainly have additional resonance for any person who lived through that turbulent time in American history. At just under two hours, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" does go on for quite a bit, but the robust, go for broke filmmaking and performances do hold some fascination.Depp completely immerses himself in his role, and is very damn funny (his narration is often a hoot); Del Toro likewise impresses as the often out of control lawyer. The cast is filled with cameos by famous people (Ellen Barkin, Lyle Lovett, Katherine Helmond (a Gilliam regular), Flea, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Mark Harmon, Tim Thomerson, Gary Busey, Harry Dean Stanton, etc.) and top notch character actors such as Larry Cedar, Richard Riehle, Richard Portnow, Steve Schirripa, Troy Evans, Jenette Goldstein, and Michael Jeter.This film establishes a tone early on, and maintains an element of surrealism throughout its entire running time. It may not appeal to a broad, mainstream audience, but some people are sure to just love it.Seven out of 10.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
12,zardoz-13,"Not Enough ""Fear"" and Too Much ""Loathing"" . . .",5,8 September 2008,"Not even a twisted comic visionary like ""12 Monkeys"" director Terry Gilliam can capture the satiric lunacy of the late Hunter S. Thompson's hallucinatory, semi-biographical tale ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."" Universal Studios clearly waited too long to shoot a film version of this screwball, drug-crazed 1970s' stream of consciousness narrative. The mocking novel documented a pill-popping, pot-puffing, coke-snorting buddy team on a psychedelic ""Lost Weekend"" in Las Vegas, enriched by layers of droll Thompson commentary that have a Groucho Marx spin. Like the Cheech & Chong comedies, ""Fear & Loathing"" suffers because it came out too late to cash in on the era. Drug campaigns, such as Nancy Reagan's ""Just Say No to Drugs"" and the ultra-violence of Oliver Stone's freaked out saga ""Natural Born Killers"" have make ""Fear & Loathing"" appear less than fascinating in retrospect. I read Thompson's entertaining tome long before Gillian brought it to the big-screen and it just doesn't seem as much fun as when I perused its pages in the 1980s.While Gilliam's film shows incredible fidelity to its source material, the cinematic ""Fear & Loathing"" seems hopelessly dated, thickly trenchant, predictably tame, often grotesque, and ultimately expendable. Despite its laudatory cast and first-rate production values, ""Fear & Loathing"" amounts to just another tedious anti-drug message movie, lacking both the characters and the witty ingenuity of Art Linson's ""Where the Buffalo Roam"" (1980) with ""Saturday Night Live's"" Bill Murray.The loosely-structured, episodic screenplay contrived by Alex ""Repo Man"" Cox, Cox collaborator Todd Davies, Tony Grisoni, and Gilliam is embarrassing nonsense, featuring one-dimensional, zombie-like characters, hazy motivation, and a meaningless plot that wanders in search of an ending. Many critics have argued with good reason that Thompson's book defied the standard cinematic interpretation because of Duke's stream of consciousness plot. The story follows Thompson's journalistic alter-ego Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") and Dr. Gonzo (a beefy Benicio Del Toro of ""Excess Baggage""), his free-spirited Samoan lawyer, on an odyssey to Vegas to discover 'the American Dream.' Ex-Monty Python member Terry Gilliam tells the tale with a heavy hand that deadens the satire in Thompson's literature. The result is a movie that generates little forward momentum after a promising start.Duke careens into Las Vegas in a blazing red convertible Cadillac. In narration lifted directly from the novel, Duke takes inventory of his narcotics: ""The trunk of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of uppers, downers, screamers, laughers . . . and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls."" Clearly, Dr. Gonzo and Duke are ready to rock'n roll.Duke's unnamed magazine dispatches him to cover a massive dirt bike race, but he spends most of his time smoking, drinking, snorting, and abusing just about any drug that he can when he isn't trashing his motel room. Only a few moments reward the audience that takes in this incoherence. When Duke registers at the front desk, the spiral pattern in the carpet begins to swim before his zonked-out eyes and the reservations clerk (Katherine Helmond of ""Brazil"") morphs into a giant moray eel. On acid, Duke staggers into a lounge populated a la ""Star Wars"" with goofy Ralph Steadman type lizards resembling TV's extinct ""Dinosaurs."" The rest of the time our heroes struggle to maintain their grip on reality while plunging ever deeper into their destructive fantasies. Dr. Gonzo abandons Duke, and Duke never files his assignment. Instead, Duke migrates to another motel across town where Dr. Gonzo rejoins him. The pair encounters a less than memorable array of characters, impersonated by Ellen Barkin as a waitress, Gary Busey as a gay highway trooper, Cameron Diaz as a bimbo TV journalist, Tim Thomerson as a hoodlum, Penn Jillette as a carnie talker, and Christina Ricci as a vagabond artist.Johnny Depp is ideally cast as Raoul Duke; he's a spitting image of the Thompson character in the Doonesbury cartoon. Thompson and his alter-ego Raoul Duke are both indebted to the late great comic Groucho Marx. Depp's Duke resembles Groucho's Captain Spaulding from ""Animal Crackers."" Depp very much looks the part of the gonzo journalist. Sadly, Gilliam and his scribes have invested Depp's Duke with minimal character beyond his wacky wardrobe. Duke prefers irresponsibility. He runs out on restaurant bills and refuses to pay for room service.Terry Gilliam took over the directing chores from Alex Cox about a month before the cameras rolled. ""Fear & Loathing"" lacks not only the audacious punch that enlivened previous Gilliam classics such as ""Brazil,"" ""Time Bandits,"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,"" but it also doesn't have the grand wit, devilish paranoia, and the fiendish forces that appeared in those earlier Gilliam movies. Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo seem pretty dull. Never are we meant to sympathize with them, mainly observe their destruction as the destruction of Las Vegas, pictured as a cheesy take on paradise. Gilliam takes some nasty swipes at middle-class America, particularly the District Attorney's Conference where ""Evening Shade's"" Michael Jeter gives a cretinous speech about drug addicts while puffing on a cigarette. Such barbs are not without interest, but Gilliam appears to be embroidering clichés.""Fear & Loathing"" ranks as Gilliam's most straight-forward and restrained film. Most of its physical action occurs over a 48 hour period in one basic location. Gilliam relies strictly on cinematographer Nicola Pecorini's use of wide-angled lens and Dutch tilts to give folks a clue about the warped perspective of the protagonists. Gone are the flamboyant touches that are a Gilliam trademark.Altogether, ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" qualifies as a major, mediocre disappointment from an otherwise brilliant director.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Thus, I can't for sure determine if this is more the result of his warped imagination, or that of Gilliam. Like few, if any, other films ever made, this puts you right inside the head of someone who is high. From start to finish, that is the look, feel, sound and mood of this(as far as I know). The paranoia, the 'logic', the fear, the bizarre sights, everything. Set design, costumes and effects are all excellent, and help build the freaky atmosphere. The editing is masterful, and the cinematography has a dynamic ""loose"" quality to it that really adds to the experience and the feel of it. This has brilliant and impeccably delivered, infinitely quotable dialog, as well as countless unforgettable moments. The acting is incredible, Del Toro and especially Depp are spot-on. All of the roles are perfectly cast; I even liked Penn Jillette. This is engaging, and immensely so, for how far out it is. There is a lot of disturbing content, constant strong language, explicit descriptions of sex, and brief nudity.

Thompson novel about paranoia and destination as Raoul Duke attempts to leave a hotel and believes that all eyes are upon him due to narcotics in his brief case. He sees bats descend from above and hotel guests become raving drunken reptiles. He is joined by his attorney and awakens to a flooded room with sudden memories vaguely placed. Basically a series of encounters while under the influence of drugs but Terry Gilliam visualizes their bizarre intoxication that highlights many of his films including Brazil and 12 Monkeys. Johnny Depp is amusing as Duke with muffled speech and cigarette clenched between his teeth. Benicio Del Toro plays his aggressive lawyer whose business tactics include LSD. Christina Ricci plays a Barbara Streisand obsessed teenager who Del Toro picks up and whom they must rid of. Tobey Maguire plays a nervous hitchhiker who abandons ship in the dessert when intoxication is at its highest. Both Maguire and Ricci surface later in a reference to their failed existence. Cameron Diaz makes an appearance in an elevator as a journalist. Illustrated world of an addict until you wake up with a blood crusted blade and attempt to put the pieces together.

The movie is just brilliant, it's all about the acting though as the story is just a list of different drugs and their effects on the body and mind. Johnny Depp is sublime in his role. His character looks exactly like Hunter S. Thompson, with his gold tipped cigarette holder, his RAF-style sunglasses, his hat to cover his bald head, and his fast paced, clipped and slurred way of speaking. Brilliant move from Terry Gilliam, best known for his Monthy Python movies. The weirdness of this movie is typical for Terry Gilliam, I don't think anyone else could make a better version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Like said before Johhny Depp was just sublime, but Benicio Del Toro did also a fantastic job with his character Dr.Gonzo, that is ironically also a nickname of Hunter S. Thompson. The chemistry between Depp and Del Toro is what makes this movie stand out from the rest.

Terry Gilliam's screen version of this book is so uncompromising from the very start that some (like me!) will find it difficult to get into. For me it was only the fantastic colours and surreal happenings that intrigued me enough to stay with the worrying antics of Johnny Depp, as the writer, and Benico del Toro, his assistant, as this whirlwind of psychedelia unfolds.

The attention to detail is fantastic and you can feel the love for the book. I watched this a few years ago and not only did I rate it poorly, I didn't even remember doing it. With some... extra focus, I watched the film again. Man, is it great! But also incredibly rough to go through. Because it doesn't relent for two whole hours in which there is no glamour, no gain, just a haze of filth that covers time and space and human depravity. It's a deeply depressing film and if you have to watch it on drugs, try to do that when you're coming down because it's enough of a trip when you're clean and sober as it is.Now, Terry Gilliam stuff is hard and awesome and weird. It feels like work when you are watching on of his films or you're not doing it right. This one has layers over layers of depth. Take your time.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

20,StevePulaski,Another case of the outsider looking in,5,5 January 2013,"I'm all for cinematic wackiness, especially when it's portrayed in a subversive style, which Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas certainly is, but there are times when it becomes overcompensating, overly loose, and without a clear method behind its overbearing madness. I'm at a loss when it comes to films based on Hunter S. Thompson's iconic works. I adore his writing style; after reading his novel Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs I felt I was transported to another world and was reading a newspaper story of an event covered by the event itself. Thompson wrote in a way that almost personified the story into feeling like you were given a firsthand account what was happening if the story wanted you to know itself. He labeled it as ""gonzo journalism,"" and one of the rules of gonzo journalism was before you could write the story, I assume, you had to get stoned to the point of being almost incomprehensible.But even if our writer at hand was incomprehensible through much of his publications, he found a way to make it all work to the level of professionalism and earned a heavy cult following that admired his writings, articles, and several film adaptations such as the 1980's film, Where the Buffalo Roam (unseen by me) and the most recent, The Rum Diary. However, no matter how hard I try, I can not seem to connect on a solid level with any film made off the works of Thompson and this is consistently isolating me from the cultists I so dreadfully want to connect with. I can admire Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas way more than I can recommend or even like it. There's a lot it does on the level of uniqueness and rebellion, yet there's little it does to give us clear insight as to what this whole trip represents.Our heroes are journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his alleged attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), who we first see speeding through the deserts of Nevada in a bright red convertible under the influence of mescaline, cocaine, marijuana, and several other drugs kept in their large suitcase that's stashed away in the trunk. They are heading down to the Nevada city to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race, so Duke can beat the deadline for his article.One of the first scenes we are brought with is Duke in a mescaline-induced haze, swatting at a swarm of bats only visible to him. From there on out, it's complete and total madness. Duke and Gonzo blaze through the hallucinated backdrops of Las Vegas, under the influence of drugs a man of an unhealthy, unstoppable addiction probably wouldn't touch, lumbering from setup to setup, causing havoc, threatening violence, or simply envisioning things that are not there.The rest of the film I'm torn. On one hand, I see it as a possible commentary on God knows what. On the other, I see it as an exercise in insanity. I've read up on multiple interpretations and can't seem to agree or come to a solid understanding on any of them. Some have said it represents the death of the American Dream (as hinted in the book's title, Duke and Gonzo are searching for the American Dream), yet I am unable to look past the idea that two archetypes hopping from a ridiculous drug-fueled cacophony to another isn't representing the philosophy and idea of success in America. At least not in any way I can identify. I've read that Las Vegas, Nevada represents the decline of decency in America as a whole and it's just blatantly shallow consumerism that has plagued us from ever reaching our goals. This sounds logical, but we never focus on many other characters aside from Duke and Gonzo, and never do we officially get a grasp on others vacationing in Vegas. And nor do are we ever presented with other peoples' point of views on this fit of drug haze that Duke and Gonzo are residing in throughout their stay there. Then there's the debate that this is a reiteration on the idea of social psychology, yet I'm not the one to try and elaborate on that. I read about two pages of it and how it is expressed in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and still don't feel that accurately describes it.This may be another film that I just can not fully grasp, but I'm sort of not content with that. I admire the film for its original use of quirky camera angles, visually potent style, two incredible character actors that work wonders together, and its transgressive attempt to take drug use into account, but I always felt disconnected from this film, cold, and unable to warm to its many vignettes detailing drug use. I can't extract a meaning for all of it, no matter how hard I try, and there's only so much of repetitive scenes that seemingly lack meaning I can take before I become bored and drained.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a film I won't soon forget, but will not soon watch again. Its madness and excessive amount of content seem truly relevant only one time around, and the following times I view it I might need the assistance of chemicals and maybe this modest review will magically become a glowing one. There's some truly wonderful cinema being articulated here, mainly in the fields of cinematography, direction, and shot formation. Yet the only thing I can equate the experience to is the idea of hearing your buddy tell stories and reminisce about days gone by that are funny to him, but lengthy and tedious to those hearing them. I wish I was reiterating the groundbreaking philosophy presented in this film rather than reflecting on repetitive madness.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,The whole movie is a friggin' acid trip,9,26 December 2004,"Johnny Depp. Wow. What can I say about this guy? He's amazing as an actor. But for his movie choices, he's a little weird. It took me a couple times to really get into this film. But it's actually pretty decent. You have to be in a strange mood to watch it. The whole story is kind of interesting. If you have never been on an acid trip and don't want to be, but are interested, watch the film. It's so crazy and psychotic. I thought it was good though. It has good acting and dialouge. I would recommend it. But like I said, you have to be in a certain mood. It takes a little bit to get used to.

22,=G=,The difference between this flick and Cheech and Chong is...,5,13 January 2002,"Cheech and Chong were funny. ""Fear and Loathing..."" is a big budget loser about a couple of druggies' odyssey around Las Vegas while hyped up and strung out and otherwise blasted out of their gourds on acid, ether...etc., blaaa, blaaa. The film makes no sense and relies on its star power and kaleidoscope of silly situations for entertainment. Unfortunately about the only way to enjoy this film is to be on drugs. Give it a try but remember, I told ya so.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
23,MovieAddict2016,"""We can't stop here. This is bat country!""",10,6 May 2004,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a twisted, outlandish venture into the mind of a warped junkie, a reporter who is traveling to Nevada in order to cover a Hells Angels motorcycle race, along with his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro, who gained forty pounds for his role). ""We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold,"" is the line that opens the movie in an expeditious manner, as a red convertible roars from right to left, in the direction of Las Vegas. The vehicle's trunk is packed with an abundance of deadly drugs. ""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers. Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, two dozen amyls.""The narrator of the story is Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp), a balding, stumbling shell of a man, constantly smoking or inhaling drugs, his body overloaded with deadly substances. He is in a permanent daze throughout the entire film, constantly consuming drugs every time the camera pans onto him. He is also the reporter, the main character of the film, and he is in such a daze that after the motorcycle race is over, he's not even sure who has won. So sitting cramped in his increasingly trashed hotel apartment, he begins clacking away mumbo-jumbo on his typewriter, desperately trying to make sense of the seemingly frenzied world surrounding him.The year is 1971, the beginning of the after-effects of the frivolous sixties. Raoul still seems to think that he is living in the past decade. He explains that his carefree ways were out of place for such an area as Las Vegas, and in one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, he visits a conference detailing the dangers of substance abuse, and inhales cocaine throughout the seminar (led by the late Michael Jeter).The movie is based on the semi-autobiographical memoirs of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, who traveled to Las Vegas in 1971 with an overweight ""Samoan lawyer"" named Oscar Zeta Acosta. According to Thompson's novel, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" originally published at the end of the decade, they broke many laws and were essentially high on various dangerous substances the entire time. In his novel, Thompson used the character Raoul Duke as a relation to his own past, and the pair's psychedelic weekend as a metaphor for the Lost America. After the sixties, during the Vietnam War, Americans were deeply confused, and turned to many dangerous substances for answers. Some critics claim that ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" glamorizes drugs. If anything, it demonizes them (sometimes quite literally), and the constant drug use is merely present to account for the duo's wacky behavior.That's not to say that ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a harmless film. Under the wrong circumstances, it could be misunderstood, which is why it was nearly slapped with an X-rating by the MPAA, and -- along with the book -- caused outrage when it was released in 1998, alongside the utter disaster ""Godzilla.""Depp is the reason the film's narration succeeds as well as it does -- a lesser actor might come across as annoying. Depp seems to be channeling the physical freedom of Steve Martin and the slurred speech patterns of Thompson himself -- although he was given ample time to pick up on Thompson's mannerisms, since they spent much time together prior to shooting and throughout the filming process.But what is essentially so fascinating about ""Fear and Loathing"" is its blazing style and blatant uniqueness. Brought to the screen by Terry Gilliam (""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Brazil""), one can only expect the movie to be strange, but it is severely distorted to the point of insanity. What is even more intriguing is Gilliam's use of his camera, cinematography and backgrounds -- the camera essentially takes on the role of a third person, as it is constantly moving, positioned at awkward angles against harsh, dizzying backdrops, wallpapers and carpets. The overall effect of the movie is the equivalent of getting high -- only this probably isn't as dangerous. Probably.In some ways, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is an utter mess of a movie -- pointless, sick, but yet it is also occasionally hilarious, and I found myself very entertained. I am not usually a fan of these sorts of movies, which only helps account for my extreme surprise in finding that I not only enjoyed ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" but found it to be an important art house movie -- bizarre, mystifying, strange, bewildering. It is as if Fellini directed a Cheech and Chong movie. It is an experience unlike any other, and although I can completely understand the negative reviews it received upon its release years ago, I find myself somewhere in between the haters and the die-hard cult fans. The film was released on a Criterion DVD last year; a sign that despite its infamous background it actually has a fairly strong legion of fans. In some ways the movie is as confused and wandering as its narrator. It's somewhat pointless, but incidentally, I think that is the point.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
24,Red-Barracuda,A fine cinematic version of a truly seminal book,9,21 July 2014,"It almost doesn't need to be said but the book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a true counter-culture classic. Its prose is dynamic, fearless and hilarious. It's probably writer Hunter S. Thompson's very best. It details the fallout of the 60's along with the inherent insanity that is Las Vegas. Like most of Thompson's other work it's an example of gonzo journalism, where the writer takes an active part in the story. But unlike a lot of his other work Fear and Loathing is curious in that it more blatantly blends fact and fiction together meaning that it would be a stretch to describe it as journalism per se. Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke is the main protagonist and he is accompanied by his side-kick Dr. Gonzo as they go on an escapade in Vegas to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle desert race; needless to say, the race is soon forgotten about and the madness of Vegas takes centre stage as seen through the eyes of these drug-fuelled lunatics.Director Terry Gilliam's penchant for phantasmagorical imagery turns out to be a good fit for the drug addled, insane world of HST. He wasn't the most obvious choice to helm this really seeing as the source material is so brilliant on account of the great writing. Could a visual stylist capture this well? The answer has to be yes really. It's unsurprisingly a highly stylized adaption with a fantastically colourful rendering of early 70's Vegas and some wild psychedelic sequences. But the beautiful text is never crucially forgotten. There is great voice-over inserts throughout that quote extensively from Thompson's book. It's this combination of cinematic style, with the meat of the text that makes this work so well. It actually feels quite faithful to the book ultimately and consequently is very episodic and plot less. Helping set the scene further is a soundtrack that nails things perfectly. It is half psychedelic rock, half Vegas lounge music; the former identifies us with the protagonists, the latter with the location. The final piece in the puzzle is the acting. Both Johnny Depp and Benico Del Toro put in borderline unintelligible performances as respectively Duke and Gonzo. Both are extremely convincing and disappear into their characters. On top of this there is an array of cameo appearances from a gaggle of well-known actors and actresses.When I first saw this film I wasn't convinced that it was a very good adaption of the book. But now I have come to believe that this is a very good adaption of a work that was considered unfilmable. If I was to be critical at all it would be to say that it maybe has one drug-fuelled psych-out too many. But overall this has to surely be considered a triumph.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
25,KineticSeoul,Might be pointless but still weirdly engaging and entertaining,7,29 March 2012,"This movie sort of reminded me of ""Dazed and Confused"" where it doesn't really have a plot. But it's still engaging because of the well crafted visual style that makes it really worth a watch. The weirdness of this movie is what really drives this movie like your watching the mind of someone that is really high on drugs. Well someone that is high on drugs and hitting up Las Vegas which can be a crazy experience. Which sort of sums up this movie, it's a crazy experience. I can't really say this is the most visually crazy movie I seen but it's still visually crazy. This is a movie for escape but for those looking for a actual story might be disappointed. What this movie is, is two guys experiencing drugs and through there eyes somewhat. Johnny Depp is great in this and you can tell he got really into his character in this. He is good at playing quirky, crazy and paranoid characters and this is no exception. This is a movie that lacks in the script department but it still has substance. This movie is hectic and all over the place in a good way you won't know what is going on the first time through but know it was one heck of a movie. If there is a plot though it would be two guys going on a trip while taking bunch of different drugs and their reactions to it, what they see from the effects and the actions that lead from it. Some may say this is a pointless movie and it might be true. But it's still weirdly engaging and entertaining.7.9/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

27,ElMaruecan82,Intoxicated by its own exuberance...,6,13 December 2016,"When it comes to Terry Gilliam, I noticed a strange pattern, either you have fans who claim this is the greatest movie ever, or one of the Top 10... or you have those who give it a 1 or 2, calling it a tedious mess. And the same goes with the movie ""Brazil"". Why do we feel the need to make these movies more brilliant than what they seem, just because Gilliam took artistic liberties, just because they deal with true, contemporary themes and just because they're trippy as hell, doesn't make them ""masterpieces"" for all that. Sure, they're ""special"", but ""special"" doesn't make a film ""great"" from beginning to end, with your eyes glued to the screen. There are two kinds of movies if you asked me, those where you press the pause button when you got to pee, and those where you don't care because you want to get through it or you know it won't make a difference, it's not like you're going to miss a big plot point. ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was perhaps the only film that made more sense the less I saw from it, which is a unique experience in its own way. I didn't hate the film, it's well-done, well- made, fast-paced, and Depp is as funny as Del Toro is annoying but we don't see Del Toro much time so it's okay. I'm okay with the film because I try to look at the half-full glass. But Gilliam has a tendency to make the same point over and over again... and no matter how aesthetically stylish it is, redundancy can get on some people's nerves, even when they try to focus on the good parts. My favorite film is still ""The Fisher King"" and it could have done without the needless hallucinations (you know, the Red Dragon...). I have a feeling that Gilliam is one hell of a writer and filmmaker seriously, but sometimes, he's like his worst enemy. And movies like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" are kind of brutal, in the sense that they're confusing, but you're not even allowed to acknowledge it. I read all the comments, and it's like someone who thought the film was confusing as hell, just ""didn't get it"". Ebert takes a lot of the heat because he didn't get the film's brilliance. This is the man who considered ""Leaving Las Vegas"" the best film of 1995, ""Crumb"" was the second and the film also dealt with the influence of the LSD wave on American art in the 60's, Ebert also admired films like ""Easy Rider"" or ""Apocalypse Now"", he's a baby-boomer who gets more than any of us the pleas and pains of his generations, so I trust his capability to read between the lines and enjoy a psychedelic experience or a self-reflective portrayal of addiction that has a few social statement sot make. Maybe he did miss the point with ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", but I don't think the film ever has a point, it's about an experience, told from the same perspective by people living the same experience. It says a lot about but in such a way that it's only by going through the experience that you can appreciate it, it's a bizarre, tautological therefore pointless mess. I say 'pointless' because it's like the film is so intoxicated by its own exuberance, it doesn't even need an audience for that. It's like this guy who's being a total annoyance because he's too drunk, he makes unfunny jokes but he doesn't care because he's not aiming for laughs, he's wrapped up in his own twisted belief that he's the funniest guy in the world. So, you're the one supposed to drink so you can put yourself at his level and enjoy the jokes. I don't think a movie or any piece of art should rely its enjoyability on the use of some drugs or whatever to be fully appreciated. I don't think one should use tricks in order to enhance some creativity, if the real experience is integral to the one narrated through the film, what's the point? Now, I'm not trying to bash the film, if someone tells me it's a stinker, I'll probably defend it as a fan would do, but when I read that it's a masterpiece, I'm pointing out the weaknesses. I gathered that it was all about the self-reflexive experience, and there was no point other than the experience itself from these two guys' standpoint as a psychological microcosm of America's youth in the late 60's... but the film ""Easy Rider"" did pretty much the same thing without being too verbal or psychedelic in the treatment of the story. Gilliam is an artist, no doubt about that, and he's a man of fantasy, but fantasy is tricky: to make it work, you must treat it as seriously as another genre, if you handle fantasy in a fantasist way, it's very likely to disorient the viewers and undermine the fantasy meant as the core of the story, it's like directing style stealing the story's thunder.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

A former cartoonist, he has his leads play their roles like characters from Tom and Jerry, while the tragically literal representation of Thompson's hyperbolic description of acid-psychosis is endless and unconvincing.

29,bowmanblue,A lot of style and some questionable substance (abuse),7,16 December 2014,"'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is one of those films that completely divides audiences. If you check out most of the reviews, they either describe it as a 'masterpiece' or 'absolute rubbish.' I can see both points of view, as both as technically correct, depending on what area of the film you focus on.There's a lot right with this filmic interpretation of Hunter S Thompson's novel of the same name. And there's also a lot wrong with it. But, staying with the positive, it's worth noting that the film's directed by one of the most visually stunning directors ever (Terry Gilliam) and if anyone can get a great performance out of a cast, it's him. And he does just that. There are a host of famous faces who pop up here and there as we join to drug-taking journalists on their road-trip through Las Vegas. However, despite all playing their parts perfectly, they're all eclipsed by (Hunter S Thompson's real life friend) Johnny Depp, who is almost unrecognisable (courtesy of a bald head) and steals every scene as the out-of-his-head loopy journalist.Therefore the film is stylish and well-acted - almost enough to make it a classic in its own right. And some people will only see this and love it. However, those who hate it normally point out that there isn't much in the way of a story. Perhaps this is down to having to complete junkies as central characters. Their exploits are never going to make much sense, let alone be particularly linier. What 'story' there is bounces from one mad scene to the next, therefore making it a pretty lame story.So, if you're happy to overlook what it lacks in the story department and simply enjoy the wild and psychedelic ride that it is (and Depp's brilliant performance) then you will probably see this as a classic.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
30,g-bodyl,Searchin For the American Dream!,8,10 June 2014,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a very strange movie, but it's often wild, colorful, vulgar, and fun to watch. This means it must be a Terry Gilliam movie and if you think so, you are indeed correct. This is a psychedelic romp that didn't fare well with critics, but pretty much with everyone else. My only complaint is how this film is repetitive. The entire film is consisted of these two men taking drugs, then wreaking havoc, then returning to their hotel suite.Gilliam's film is about two men named Rauol Duke and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo who both travel to Las Vegas in search for the American Dream. But they use these psychedelic drugs to help them get through this trip and offer them a fun time.I love Johnny Depp's style of acting which is method acting and it makes him unrecognizable, like in this film. This is a unique role and he did it well. Benicio Del Toro likewise did a great job as Depp's partner in crime.Overall, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a unique, colorful movie essentially about what happens when you take these drugs. The set design is great and there are some cool visual effects. Terry Gilliam, who is an off-beat director, does a great job in constructing these two men's vision of the American Dream.

31,secondtake,It's a personal taste thing...Depp overacts like no one before or since!,5,9 September 2010,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)There are some some strikes against this one--Johnny Depp is playing pure cornball, the wide angle camera wears thin, the bright colors are too bright, and the rest of the acting is pure silliness. But hey, this is exactly why people like it. I didn't. It lacked the wit of Monty Python (the director is an ex-Python man), and the intelligence. It depends mostly on being surreal, exaggerated, and overtly stupid, like a bunch of stoners might really be.So maybe you need to be high to get into it.Further, if you read the book of the same title, you catch this kind of cutting satire and smarts that is dumbed down here. When I read it I never thought it was slapstick stupidity, but a kind of pushing of acceptability, a fearlessness, and a willingness to experiment. It doesn't illustrate a psychotic world, and it doesn't recreate a drug experience, despite the visual effects. It throws painful narrative monologue voiceovers (Depp) too often. Things distort and it gets beautifully weird, but it doesn't seem enough. In fact, it seems like special effects.Be prepared that there is no ""plot"" exactly, but a series of incidents. This is not a bad thing...you are after all just supposed to dive into the world being created here. But the episodes seem to be free-for-alls, fun to make (I suppose), but maybe you had to ""be there,"" literally.What can you do to enjoy the movie? Well, be in a very silly mood. How do you get past Depp's self-absorbed zaniness? I don't know. I couldn't do it. Personal taste at work. Why does it have a cult following? Well, that's the nature of cult followings--offbeat movies find an appreciative audience and word spreads. Read the book, maybe. That struck me as brilliant.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

34,The-Sarkologist,A drug-fuelled romp through Las Vegas,9,12 February 2012,"I am actually not surprised that Terry Gilliam directed this movie, particularly since when I read the book the last thing that I thought could have been done was to turn it into a movie. Hunter S. Thompson generally does not write books that could easily be translated into movies, in particular this one, however if there is one person that can pull it off, it is Terry Gilliam.This movie is about two guys, one of them a journalist, the other, well, I have absolutely no idea who the other guy is, though he keeps on referring to himself at his Attorney, who go on a drug fuelled binge to Las Vegas. The subtitle of the book is 'an exploration into the dark side of the American Dream' however that is not their intention when they go there. It seems that Raoul is supposed to cover a sporting event, and then a DA's Conference on drugs, but instead they spend a bulk of their time travelling around Las Vegas in a drug induced haze.Much of the film is narrated by Raoul, namely the thoughts that are racing through his head as he wonders around the city. He scams a couple of hotels, runs up huge bills, and then disappears. By the end of the movie you get the impression that they simply trashed everything that they could conceivably trash in Las Vegas, and though it is suggested that they were rushed out of town, it does not seem that that actually happened.My favourite part of the film was when they get into the hotel and forced into the bar to wait for their room to be made up. Raoul then starts freaking out, as he sees the carpet begin to swirm, and the crowd in the bar turn into monstrous creatures, and has to be carried out by his attorney. Later it is his attorney's turn to freak out and have to be carried back into his room. This, as Hunter refers, is known as 'The Fear'. I guess people who have never done drugs would not understand what he means by the fear (and I certainly didn't when I first read this book), and it can be difficult to describe as it is a drug-fuelled emotion that rises up into your head and clouds your perception. The clearest explanation would be that you know that you are on drugs (and generally most drugs that I know of do not generally give an outward appearance, in the same way that alcohol does, like slurred speech and lack of balance) and then you begin to fear that everybody else does as well, and that they are all looking at you suspiciously. You begin to believe that you can read their minds, and that they are all looking at you in a disapproving manner, and all of the sudden you want to get out of there because they are going to do bad things to you and you cannot fight back.The Fear is not rational, in fact it is completely irrational. You may have not attracted anybody's attention, but once the fear strikes, you believe that you have. It is the paranoia that everybody speaks about when it comes to drugs. There is no fear when you drink alcohol, in fact alcohol tends to fuel your confidence, rather than force you into a corner to hide, that is what The Fear does. As I have said, The Fear is something that people who have not done drugs would not understand, however it tends to be the psychedelic drugs, such as Marijuana and LSD, that bring about The Fear, not stimulates (cocaine and ecstasy) or depressants (such as heroine).This is a really good movie, and it does indeed, as the author suggests, an exploration into the dark side of the American Dream. As the movie progresses, Raoul begins to contemplate the American Dream. Unfortunately he did not cover the race, and when he attended to DA's conference, he was so wacked out of drugs that The Fear caught him as well, particularly when the 'Drugs are bad' film clips were shown. This is an incredibly funny movie, though I suspect that it will not be everybody's taste.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
35,slightlymad22,Not For Me,5,28 February 2018,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas (1998)As someone who has never taken any none medically described drugs, this movie was never going to be my cup of tea. I considered it one of Depp's worst the last time I seen it (in the cinema in 1998) and not a lot has changed. Based on Hunter S Thomsons novel of the same name. This is just a mess, the movie pretty much repeats itself over and over as Depp and Del Toro take drugs, stumble into diffrent situations, wreak havoc, and go back to their hotel rooms. I can't fault Depp's performance, he'd already proved himself a talented actor by this point, and here (with a bald head, strange hats, big shades, and a cigarette holder between his clenched teeth) is no different, as he gives his all and totally immerses himself in his character. Much of the clothing worn by Depp in the movie were the real clothes Hunter S. Thompson wore in the '70s. Thompson himself let Depp borrow them for the movie, after Depp spent four months with Thompson learning his mannerisms and proper vocal inflection for the role.Benico Del Toro is fine as is Toby Maguire as a hitchhiker. Cameron Diaz, Gary Busey and Verne Troyer pop up as does a very braless Christina Ricci. Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas grossed $10 million dollars at the domestic box office to not land a place on highest 100 grossing movie of the year list.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
36,Thanos_Alfie,Drugs...,5,6 August 2020,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a journalist going on a road trip with his Samoan lawyer in order to find the ""American Dream"". With the help of many drugs and much more alcohol they continue to search for it across Western America.I have to admit that I was surprised by this movie since I did not expect this psychedelic ""roller-coaster"". I believe that as an idea and as concept ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is simply magnificent but as an execution was very poor. The direction which was made by Terry Gilliam was average and I think that he did not reach his potential. The interpretations of both Johnny Depp who played as Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro who played as Dr. Gonzo were very good. Finally, I have to say that ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a crazy movie that presents what drugs can do to people and I recommend it to everyone.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

And don't forget the Red Shark. Anyway, if you like to trip you gotta trip.

39,funkyfry,Rollicking satire,8,2 August 2003,"I left the movie theater when I saw this opening weekend in Santa Fe, NM wondering to myself -- how is middle America going to react to this movie? I had to shake my head because it had been sold as a road trip comedy, which it is anything but (except maybe to a 17 year old).  It stands up pretty well, probably Gilliam's best movie since the classic ""Brazil"".  The biggest reason are Benicio Del Toro and Johnny Depp's excellent performances in the lead roles, but there is plenty of other eye and brain candy here to enjoy, as I'm sure this is a film that can and will be enjoyed in all the various states of intoxication.  As someone who was myself stuck in Las Vegas for a week after a somewhat harried experience seeing the Grateful Dead at Sam Boyd Stadium (something of a trial in itself, despite their excellent performances), it definately struck home with me.

Because it's a delusion, from someone who's been on an drug induced orgy, naming it's author, the late great Hunter S. Thompson, who's book, this film is based on. Here it's seen through two guys, in great performances, especially from a flabby Del Toro, a couple years short of his Oscar win. A writer journalist (Depp) really on an overhaul of drugs, fear struck, and his burnt out attorney, a crazed Del Toro, head to Monte Carlo to cover a race. It's hard to believe they're these people, when drugs give way. Del Toro truly makes the film funny, even in it's starting, where they pick up unfortunate hitchhiker (Tobey Macquire) who ends up scrambling out of the car, and running for his life. Del Toro picks up as struggling teen artist (Christina Ricci) later on, which I admit was funny but a little bit sick too. Too, really near the end, the madness of this delusional film was taking it's toll on me, as though the film was losing it's potency or these scenes were garbage, like scraping the bottom of the barrel, but as I said, you have to take the movie through the eyes of the characters. I'm really glad for one, that this very funny film had Del Toro in it, as it's hard to imagine this film without him. Johnny Depp just shows us again why he is such a great actor. And would you believe Terry Gilliam of all people made this. The film has a lot of good cameo's and it's end, closing credit sequence to the tune of Jumping Jack Flash, was cool, which Del Toro definitely isn't.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
41,Vartiainen,Spiritual drug-haze madness,8,25 May 2015,"A journalist and his lawyer drive into Las Vegas. With them they have an idea for a story, trunk full of narcotics, a yearning for release and a fear of bats. Along the way hallucinations are had, drugs ingested, snorted, shot and dripped, women are met, dinosaur tails are worn, sand drunk and something gets written. And I never thought I would type a sentence like that in my life. It's that kind of movie. And it is amazing.Johnny Depp is known for his involved preparations for his roles. And this just might be the crowning achievement of that. Not only did he shave the top of his head to achieve the desired haircut, and wore clothes owned by Thompson but he actually hunted down the man himself - pun intended - and befriended him to get his mannerisms down. He actually lived with the man to truly absorb his essence. And boy did he succeed. Hunter S. Thompson is transferred to the silver screen beautifully in all his gonzo glory. Raving mad, yet strangely lucid and charismatic when the mood happens upon him. The script practically writes itself, which happens oddly often with Depp, now that I think about it.And yes, the story itself makes little to no sense. It's practically the acknowledged best way to experience drugs without actually taking any. Though being drunk while watching the film certainly helps, not gonna lie. But that's the whole point. It's an experience, a philosophical-spiritual-maddening journey into a man's psyche and an exploration of the underbelly of the American Dream.Do yourself a favour, watch the first ten minutes.

42,freemantle_uk,Parniod Drug Induced Dark Comedy,8,18 July 2009,"Drugs have often been a popular theme in cinema, with excellent entries like Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream and A Scanner Darker. Here is Terry Gilliam's take on this issue with this good dark comedy.Duke (Johnny Deep), a journalist, and his lawyer Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) are sent by their magazine to report on a desert car race in the city. They rent a car and have a hell of a lot of drugs sorted in the boot. On their travels they pick up a hitchhiker and scare the living hell out of him. Once in Las Vegas the pair take more drugs and are unable to report on the race. It was lucky that their editor send them to report on a anti-drugs conference.The film is based a novel by Hunter S. Thompson, which I haven't read. However the film seems to lack a proper plot and narrative. It may work in novels like Catch 22, The Catcher of the Rye, The Lovely Bones and the Man in the High Castle, but not so well in film. The film lacked focused. But what would normally be a fatal fault in an other film, it was saved by the quality of it director and actor. Terry Gilliam is a master of the surreal and his flair for direction is unmatched. Here the material is perfect for him. Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are both actors I like and both perfectly casted, especially Depp. He also doesn't look as attractive as usual so they is hope for us all. The film is played as a dark comedy and is very funny because of the jokes, the nature of the performances and direction.They themes within this film, such as the American Dream, the protest culture, counter-culture, the decline of the sixties, the corrupting force of Las Vegas and wealth. But to me the biggest theme of the film is simply drug really mess with your mind and enjoyable to watch.Perfectly good film, especially if you are a Gilliam or Depp fan.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
43,Polaris_DiB,On a razor's edge.,7,4 December 2005,"In a sense, this is kind of like the movie Terry Gilliam was born to do.Terry Gilliam is an awesome visual director in the same way that Tim Burton is an awesome visual director: every single frame bleeds its own distinct style of beauty, but sometimes the story just doesn't hold it up, or the stylistic elements get in the way. However, what could possibly be better to found Gilliam's surreal psychedelic imagery on than Hunter S. Thompson's story of his exploration into the American Dream? Still, it's a hard thing to pull off, translating Thompson to film, and while Gilliam does succeed, it's largely from the support of the incredible cast working under him to work out. Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro especially have to really work on exaggerating when needed, slowing down when necessary through what feels like hundreds of hallucinogenic scenes with just barely enough narrative structure to pull them together.Of course, the outcome is pretty fantastic, but it sets this movie squarely in the ""love it or hate it"" section of the world's video library, which is pretty much Gilliam's career simplified anyways.--PolarisDiB",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
44,ackstasis,"""Buy the ticket, take the ride""",5,6 October 2009,"Former Monty Python trooper Terry Gilliam is a wonderful director – 'Brazil (1985)' and 'Twelve Monkeys (1995)' are both close to masterpieces – but this one went straight over my head. An adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's ""unfilmable"" semi-autobiographical account of early 1970s drug culture, the film is basically a two-hour narcotics trip, ducking in and out of reality and surreal drug-addled fantasy without warning or explanation. Gilliam's direction is actually quite magnificent, every frame bursting with distorted colours and emotions, but his efforts are wasted on a story than meanders with perplexing aimlessness. The main character, Raoul Duke – a doppelganger for the novel's author – often launches into bizarre, pseudo-philosophical monologues on the crumbling state of American counter-culture, but these ultimately come across as little more than smoke and mirrors, the ramblings of a man so hopelessly addled by God-knows-how-many drugs that, to him, everything sounds profound. The best way to look at this film, I suppose, is as a very black comedy, and, indeed, the antics of Duke (Johnny Depp) and his possibly-Samoan attorney (Benicio Del Toro) are occasionally quite amusing.After being assigned to cover a motorcycle race in Nevada, journalist Raoul Duke and his lawyer Dr Gonzo strike off for the bright lights of Las Vegas. In a suitcase, they carry every illicit narcotic known to Mankind since the 16th century, and they aren't content to simple look at them. Is there a point to this film? No – or, at least, none that I could spy. Then again, the life of a drug addict is itself rather pointless. Gilliam strings together an assortment of vibrant, extravagant, and sometimes nightmarish, set-pieces. The camera distorts reality, tilting from side to side as though wielded by a drunken Robert Krasker; in this way, even the viewers' perception is tainted by the characters' drug use. However, while I did have an occasional chuckle thanks to Johnny Depp, whose performance is superbly eccentric, I didn't feel as though I was enjoying myself. I felt filthy, violated, and it's not a experience I'd care to repeat. Maybe, in order to appreciate this film, one must have used drugs or lived through the 1960s. I haven't done either, and I consider myself all the better for it.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

This film succeeds at wildly illustrating what goes through someone's mind when taking every drug under the sun; often concurrently. The bold and brash colors of Las Vegas and that environment add to the bizarre and falsely symbolic atmosphere. Depp and Del Toro completely get into their roles of irrational, erratic and disheveled guys who go through the film constantly on a cocktail of drugs. Deciphering the message of the film is as difficult as watching these grubby guys. Every scene is cluttered and grimy and highlighted with off kilter shot framing which compliments their states of mind and actually gets a little redundant. Upon reflection, it appears that the point of the film is no point at all aside from experiencing that false sheen of Vegas and the false promise of good times that type of binge will bring, which I read is what certain pockets of society were liberating themselves toward as the film takes place in the late 60s-early 70s.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

The canted, garish visuals and weird voice-over narration make you feel as though you're on drugs like the main characters, and the trip is not a good one. The world of this movie is threatening. It's a world of physical and moral decay, the graveyard of the American Dream that Raoul Duke is searching for throughout the story.Some may find this movie obnoxious or trashy, and there are moments where it leaves you utterly exhausted. If you are a person who gets what I have often heard termed ""Gilliam fatigue,"" then Fear and Loathing will push you past your limit. But I like how it dares to be grotesque.

47,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A blast of nutso fun,8,11 January 2016,"Terry Gilliam's Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas is a film you either love, loathe or are simply terrified by and confused as to which category to put it under. I happen to love it. It takes Hunter S. Thompson's seminal treatise on Gonzo journalism, a technique which involves getting about as messed up as humanly possible on every kind of drug and alcohol known to man and trying to do serious academic stuff (sounds like my college days). It's off putting for some, tantalizing for others, but no can deny that it's an absolutely one of a kind film experience. At the centre are two tyrannical performances from Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, as springy Raoul Duke and his crass, animalistic sidekick Dr. Gonzo. The two intrepid fools set out for Vegas to report on a famous motorbike derby race, bringing along with them bushels of drugs, including coke, weed, shrooms, raw either and a synthesized version of pure human adrenaline that makes an appearance in one terrifying extended sequence. All the film has to say is basically ""let's get as messed up as possible and go do stuff"". Pretty fitting for New Year's Eve. They are dimly aware of their surroundings as their nutty adventure plays out, but the film stays rooted to their corrupted consciousnesses, giving us the task of deciphering what's going on along with them, which is quite fun. There's a barbaric horse of celebrity cameos from Christina Ricci, Cameron Diaz, Ellen Barkin, Mark Harmon, Tim Thomerson, Craig Bierko, Tobey Maguire, Michael Jeter and Gary Busey as the world's creepiest highway patrolman. It's a walk on the wild side as only Gilliam and Thompson could bring us, Depp and Del Toror milking every inebriated minute of chaos and Calamity.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
48,rooprect,You won't get it,4,1 December 2006,"Browsing through the reviews & message board for this movie, you'll see that most of the audience falls into one of the following categories:A) Stoner wastoid drug user who thinks this is the coolest get-high movie ever.B) Nancy Reagan ""just-say-no"" type who thinks it's nothing but a glorification of drugs.BOTH of these people are dead wrong. This movie, for anyone paying attention, packs an anti-drug commentary which shows the losers who get high. It shows you the vulgar, disturbing, violent and vomitous things they do. And if I were a drug user, this would be enough to make me quit for fear of looking like such a wretch.In that respect, I thought this was a clever & ironic adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's psychedelic ramblings. But I'm giving it only a 4/10 because obviously it missed the mark.Much like Norm Jewison's ROLLERBALL (1975) which was supposed to be an anti-violence statement but ended up glorifying violence (to all the dimwits who couldn't see the satire), this movie failed miserably. You may argue that it is the fault of the dimwits for not understanding the point, but no, I believe the fault lies in the lap of the artist for failing to convey the message confidently enough. It's as if someone decides to do a parody of Hitler but ends up glorifying him in the eyes of the crowd.So if you're in category A, light up, shoot up, pop some tabs and enjoy the flick. You certainly will. But if you're on a deeper level than that, I think you'll be disgusted at Terry Gilliam's colossal balk. I think he lacked the confidence to hammer home the true point of the movie. In his defence, I admit that there is one scene (in the diner) which, in a very sobering way, shows you how wretched these drug-addicts are. But aside from that, it's mostly a silly romp through the world of psychomorphia.

To avoid the repetition of my own aghast reaction to this rubbish, I'll add the following observations: in films like ""Brazil,"" ""The Fisher King,"" and ""12 Monkeys,"" director Terry Gilliam's signature style--busy and chaotic--is anchored by characters who are slightly off-center, but possess a distinct humanity; in ""Fear and Loathing,"" all are dehumanized to the point of caricature. Both Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro (as Duke and Gonzo, respectively) create distinctive characters that are so 'out there' it makes them impossible to relate to, and the sight of them acting incoherent grows old quickly; everyone fades too easily into the acid-trip imagery saturating the film.

55,rbverhoef,One weird trip,8,26 April 2005,"'Fear and Loating in Las Vegas' is one bad trip from director Terry Gilliams. Johnny Depp as writer Hunter S. Thompson and Benicio Del Toro as his lawyer Dr. Gonzo go to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race in the desert. All they do the entire film is take drugs in every form before walking into a situation that could be funny for some and too weird for others. The problem with this kind of film is that you really have to see for yourself what you think of it. You can't compare and say if you liked that film, you will probably like this one as well. Even if you are a fan of Depp or Del Toro I am not able to say whether you will enjoy this. I can say that I did and I can try to explain why.First of all because I thought it was pretty funny at times. Directly after that I have to say I can understand a lot of people will not find this funny. I like weird, I like 'Ace Ventura', but also 'Donnie Darko' or 'Mulholland Dr.'. 'Fear and Loating' is weird, but in a way that has nothing to do with the above films. We see Depp and Del Toro take drugs, Depp's voice over tells us how they feel and how they could react to the stuff, and then they do react to the stuff. They walk and talk weird, become aggressive, have a lot of hallucination, sometimes shared with us as the audience, fall asleep and wake up in a mess. Time for more drugs. Yes, this could be funny for some including me.But there are some other aspects that are nice too. The performances from Depp and Del Toro. They become these unlikable people and they do a great job at it. Both Depp and Del Toro are actors who can completely disappear in a character. With Depp you keep realizing it is Depp who does such an amazing job, with Del Toro you forget who he is. Here I constantly was aware of watching the both of them, but I thought about the character the film wanted me to. The style of the film itself is another tricky point. It is perfect for a film like this. The camera moves exactly the way it should move, representing the state of mind from the two men. But by doing that the film becomes pretty hard to watch. That it is the intention is the good thing, but some people will not be pleased by this, which is not a good thing.Films that involve a lot of drugs like 'Fear and Loathing' always seem to be made for certain audiences. 'Trainspotting' is the best example, even the great 'Requiem for a Dream' will not be for everyone. All three films have a visual style that will be loved by many but hated by probably the same amount of people. 'Fear and Loating in Las Vegas' is not as good as 'Requiem for a Dream' or 'Trainspotting', therefore even less accessible. It is a film without any judgment about drugs, except that you will go crazy if you use too much. But it is original in its own way and unlike any other film you have seen. I guess I appreciate that.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
56,truemythmedia,Takes More than One Viewing,8,27 June 2019,"Gilliam has a flair for the surreal so when he turned his eye toward the gonzo journalist, Hunter S. Thompson, the results were an instant counter/drug culture classic. Although it was popular, I have never been one for straight up drug movies and that's what this film seemed to be to me from the outside.I don't think I was wrong either. I know that there are hosts of people who will tell me that the movie is about more, but those messages simply didn't take root with me as I watched.Don't get me wrong. Gilliam is always a great watch, even when I'm not totally feeling what he is doing. The visuals, as usual, are stunning and creatively explored as only he does and while the plot may not always be coherent, that simply makes the Monty Python Alumnus the perfect choice to direct.Particularly, it is Gilliam penchant for using elaborate stage and practical effects that makes him perfect for this film. Fly away walls and real lizard costumes brink an extra layer of heightened paranoia and mind bending surrealism.I really think that the main reason I don't care for the film is because it is a theme I don't particularly vibe with. It's a well made movie and it is obvious why it is a classic. At least that is what I think it was I didn't like. It's hard to say because the dialogue of the film is extremely difficult to understand. I fully intend to watch it again with subtitles on.

57,davidmvining,"Borderline insane, extremely profane, and really loosely told",7,23 March 2020,"I almost have no idea how to talk about this movie. I know that before this run through of all of Terry Gilliam's films I definitely had no idea how to talk about this movie, so that's a step in the right direction.This movie is aggressively weird in pretty much the only way a Hunter S. Thompson adaptation by Terry Gilliam could be. All of Gilliam's visual quirks combined with Thompson's gonzo stream of consciousness storytelling make for at least an interesting ride. Much like Jabberwocky, I think this movie's tangents are easier to take because I find so much of it funny. Gilliam just has a sense of humor that I get. Roger Ebert didn't get that sense of humor, and he never quite embraced Gilliam as I feel like he should have, but hey, there's no accounting for senses of humor.So, Duke and his Samoan lawyer are driving through bat country from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400, a dirt bike competition, and they are traveling with a briefcase full of just all the drugs. Duke has no interest in covering the race for his magazine. Instead, he's going to indulge in all the drugs while searching for the American dream in Las Vegas, the gaudiest single point in America.And that, right there, is the core of the film. It's two competing fantasies running up against each other. On the one hand is the detached amorality of Duke and the drug culture. On the other hand is the traditional America as it forms in his own mind with flashy consumerism and entitled police out to ruin his good time. It really is two fantasies that collide over the course of one long, drug filled weekend in Las Vegas.Duke barely attends the race, wandering off after it starts, and having nothing to write about. He goes with his lawyer to a circus establishment in town and get so out of their mind stoned that Dr. Gonzo can't get off of his stool without falling. Dr. Gonzo flees town in a panic but appears back in LA, cool and collected enough to get Duke another beat covering the national police chief convention on the other side of town. Having destroyed a hotel room in one place only to get booked in another has a certain appeal to Duke, so he goes only to find that Dr. Gonzo has already arrived with a young naïf from Montana with a bevy of cardboard paintings of Barbara Streisand.Duke makes another attempt to actually do his job and attends a talk by a doctor with an intricately layered theory on the labeling of and by people in drug culture, moving from cool to hip and so on. It's as much a fantasy of how the drug culture works, based on Duke and, in particular, Dr. Gonzo's reaction to the talk as the world that Duke choses to walk around in, soaked with ether.The misadventures are all filmed in the same, exaggerated Gilliam way, but there are two particular scenes that stand out because they are filmed normally. The first comes as Dr. Gonzo is having a bad trip in their hotel room and Duke goes down to the casino floor to gamble a bit. He places one bet, loses, and all around him the colors have been drained and there's little light. People look bored, and Duke simply can't stand the scene, so he leaves. The second comes late in the film, after Duke and Gonzo have left the law enforcement convention, and they find themselves at a tiny little diner on the edge of town. It's there, alone with the waitress, that Gonzo demonstrates his carefree drug outlook when it encounters the real world. After insulting the down and out waitress (who probably moved to Las Vegas to become a dancer and ended up waitressing at a terrible little diner), he threatens her with a knife and she goes catatonic. She's terrified, and Gonzo doesn't care, continuing to treat her terribly as he stuffs a five dollar bill down her shirt. Duke, on the other hand, is out of it, obsessed with his newspaper and purposefully ignoring the scene happening right before him.I think those two scenes point to the core of the film, that the real world is dull and dangerous while the real color of the world exists in fantasy. There are dueling fantasies (in particular, the one represented by Duke and the others represented by Las Vegas itself and the cultures that Duke needs to cover journalistically), but some of them are looking for color in life while others seem determined to drag the rest of the world to the harshness of reality.The thing about this movie is that it's really loose. You'd expect that from an adaptation of a Hunter S. Thompson work, but feature films with little to no structure are harder to pull off. While I do find large parts of the film entertaining, there are points where I wanted the movie to simply continue past the moment that had outlived its usefulness and entertainment value. Duke arguing with Gonzo about Gonzo's suicide attempt in a bathtub is one moment in particular. Still, the scene is funny, so I can't complain too much.I suppose that this is the best cinematic representation of Thompson's work we could possibly expect. It's borderline insane, extremely profane, and really loosely told. I have a fun time with it every time I watch it, but I always find myself drifting off here and there when I feel like I should be more engaged.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

59,Galina_movie_fan,"""There was madness in any direction, at any hour""",7,23 April 2005,"""Fear and Loathing in Las-Vegas"" is a narcotic story- autobiography of the lost generation of the seventieth based on the Hunter Thompson's novel. This is the most controversial but not the best work by Terry Gilliam, the author of such staggering films as ""Monthy Python and the Holy Grail"", ""Brazil"", Fisher King"", ""12 Monkeys"".I am very impressed by Gilliam's awesome power to get inside a ""man under too many influences's"" mind and show the distorted and grotesque hallucinating visions of that mind from inside. Johnny Depp was amazing - he is one of the greatest and fearless actors of our time. Depp and Gilliam's craft are the main reasons to see this film because there is not much else to see. Gilliam's films are usually very interesting because there is always a story behind the delirious shell. Often, it is an absurd story but it is always a strong one. The problem of Fear and Loathing... is - there is no story at all. For the first thirty minutes or so I was truly charmed: it was funny, crazy, and visually nothing like I've seen before but for how long can I be fascinated by the monsters that were generated by the constantly and shockingly abused brain?",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

His voice is hilarious!

I mean movies that revolve entirely around the experience people have when they're using. At their very best, I find them tolerable (like Smiley Face). At their worst, it's a struggle for me to watch them until the end. This adaptation of the Hunter S. Thompson novel of the same name definitely falls into the latter category.Fear and Loathing is really just one sequence or events, repeated ad nauseam. Depp and Del Toro take drugs, see crazy stuff, freak out, and then take drugs again. If there's a point to it all, it's buried so deeply underneath the hallucinations and narcotics-fueled paranoia of the pair that I couldn't be bothered to try to find it.

Some were good, others weren't; some were freaky, others were very normal; but never have I ever seen a movie as strange as this one. It just felt like I was high on acid myself during the entire movie. For your information: I wouldn't know what that is really like, because I've never used drugs in my entire life, but how else would you describe what this movie does to you?I haven't read the book, so don't expect an entire debate on how good or bad this movie was adapted to the book. I guess they did a good job, because others who have read it said that it was exactly the way they had expected it and I believe them. So let's not go any further on that subject. But what I can say about it is that it visualizes very well what LSD and other psychedelic substances do to you. Thanks to the nice imaging and the good acting, you get an interesting view on how it is like.However, what I really missed in this movie was some kind of story. OK, perhaps the movie speaks already for itself just by showing how these guys react to all the chemical stuff that they put in their noses and maybe it doesn't need a story because than it all would be too mainstream for some people, but personally I still like a good story in a movie. I'm not saying this is a bad movie. It had some excellent, really funny moments, but the lack of a story really bothered me too much to enjoy it fully.

63,brando647,Probably the Best Film of Thompson's Book We're Bound to Get,8,30 November 2011,"My friend turned me on to the work of Hunter S. Thompson a few years ago. He's a major fan and offered to lend me a few of his books. I found myself enjoying his self-proclaimed gonzo journalism but only managed to finish ""Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas"" (and about half of ""Hell's Angels""). I absolutely loved it and sought out the 1998 Terry Gilliam adaptation, primarily to see how exactly he managed to create a film based on Thompson's drug-fueled Las Vegas mind-trip. I'd read that Thompson had the possibility of a film adaptation in mind when he wrote the book, but I agreed with the majority of opposing viewpoints I'd read that the book was ""unfilmable"". The story was originally published as in Rolling Stone magazine when Hunter Thompson was sent on assignment to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. The book/film, using the pseudonyms of Raoul Duke (Thompson) and Dr. Gonzo (Thompson's associate Oscar Zeta Acosta), follows the duo as they load a convertible with every kind of drug available (from alcohol to ether, marijuana to mescaline) and head to Las Vegas. What starts as an assignment to cover the race and, eventually, a district attorneys conference ends with Thompson/Duke contemplating the state of the American Dream and the end of the 60s as an era.To anyone who hasn't read the book, this movie probably made no sense at all. Without the context and the knowledge of what's going through Duke's head over the course of these events, this movie must be unbearable. I understand how this movie has become a ""love it/hate it"" sort of film. To those who aren't familiar with the book, this movie is just a random string of drug adventures in the bright neon light jungle of Las Vegas. The movie doesn't do a fantastic job of tying it all together and, even though I'd read the book prior to watching, still had a hard time seeing this movie as anything more than a series of drug skits. There are a lot of criticisms that the film comes off as pro-drug, which is a load. There are a lot of drugs in the film (a LOT) but their use is rarely if ever glamorized. In fact, in nearly all scenes where the characters are on drugs (which is about 99% of the movie) they're portrayed as total buffoons or terrified of the experience. I wish the movie had managed to maintain some of the deeper aspects of the book, but there really wasn't any good means of doing so. We get some explanation in the form of voice-over's from Duke but a lot of it is lost in translation from one medium to another. The movie's great for some laughs at Duke and Gonzo's expense, but people actually interested in Thompson's work should just go ahead and actually read the book.What really makes the movie work (aside from Gilliam's fantastic visualsthe man's brought us some of the best, most hilarious cinematic drug trips in this movie) are Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro as Duke and Gonzo. The two are freakin' hilarious in this movie and Depp gives a spot-on impersonation of Thompson from what I've seen in footage of the real-life writer. If you find yourself having a hard time believing someone as strange as Depp's Duke can exist, listen to the DVD commentary with Hunter Thompson on the Criterion Collection version. The movie also features a boatload of cameos including Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Gary Busey, and TV's Christopher Meloni. It's a fun movie and a total mind-trip to watch, but it feels empty without any real narrative behind it. If Gilliam had managed to establish a better story flow, this movie would rank higher but it feels like it stumbles from one drug experience to the next and limits itself to become one of my cult favorites.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
64,Sergeant_Tibbs,I can always watch this movie,8,7 January 2009,"A fun ride which feels like an acid trip as well. Despite the messy screenplay, which in its second act aimlessly stalks the protagonist without motive or time scope just doing drugs, Terry Gilliam made this an exercise in style, considering the very uncharming characters. With vivid colours and disorientating camera angles - there is never a clear distinction between reality and imaginary; which is a very effective technique since the main theme is the effect of drugs. Johnny Depp gives one of his finest and most flamboyant performances as Raoul Duke, taking every opportunity to add in a quick line expressing his attitudes and behaviour - often being hilarious. The narration generally helps the film run smoother as does the soundtrack, though it would be relentlessly entertaining anyway.8/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
65,DeeNine-2,Don't see this straight,7,4 December 1999,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Funny, garish version of the Hunter S. Thompson novel directed by Terry Gilliam with the usual Gilliam brush strokes: cluttered sets, Monty Python remembrances, funky camera angles, relentless energy and a satirical eye. His ""shoot me if you find a plot,"" and ""torture me first if you find a subplot"" style is regressed to after the agreeable hiatus of ""12 Monkeys."" Of course such a chaotic style goes well with gonzo journalism on a bad acid trip-a VERY bad acid trip.Johnny Depp plays Hunter S. Thompson as Doonesbury's Duke with the FDR cigarette holder and pastel shades. Benicio Del Toro is offensively loutish as Dr. Gonzo, a fake Samoan from East L.A. or thereabouts. Most of this is pretty ""bad,"" but Depp got the cartoon character down pat. The psychedelic and day-glow sets, populated with lizards and ugly Americans, splashed with glaring reds and pinks, etc., captured well not only the ""fear and loathing"" but the seventies Las Vegas milieu as well. The voice overs from the novel seemed a bit miraculous in the movie since at no time is Duke ever coherent or sober enough to write. Piping Debbie Reynolds's ""Tammy's in Love"" into the Duke/Gonzo hotel room amid the brain cell mayhem was an inspired cultural juxtaposition. Ditto for the Barbra Streisand portraits.Best scene: Gonzo and Duke watching a clip from ""Reefer Madness"" at the narc's convention. Second best scene: Duke being admired by the highway patrolman who wants a kiss. Most fun: trash driving those two big Caddy convertibles.One of the amazing things about Gilliam is how he can make fun of people without their seeming to notice. Hunter S. Thompson looks like an idiot here, and Gilliam is really satirizing the sixties/early seventies drug culture just as surely as he trashes the cops. His rapier is razor sharp, so sharp you don't feel it until you look down and see the blood on your hand.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
66,sme_no_densetsu,Interesting to a point but fairly inconsequential in the end,7,16 August 2015,"Terry Gilliam's adaptation of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is not a film to be approached lightly. This is not for casual fans of Johnny Depp who simply liked him in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. This is a defiantly unconventional film about a defiantly unconventional man.Johnny Depp stars as Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke, a journalist who accepts an assignment to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. This forms what little of a plot there is to be found in the film. Instead, the story mainly focuses on the drug-fueled exploits of Duke and his partner in crime, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro).Both Depp & del Toro give committed performances and it's probably safe to say that Depp's work in particular is the highlight of the film. Gilliam's unique visual sense is also consistently in evidence. However, over a fairly repetitive and anarchic 118 minutes, the movie's charms wear pretty thin.While there is a rudimentary point to the story (ie. the failure of the 60's counterculture movement) it is likely better expressed in Thompson's book than it is here. Still, Gilliam's film does contain some (admittedly disjointed) memorable scenes, good performances and well-chosen period music. Mercifully cut, with something at least resembling a plot, this might have been deserving of the cult status that it has attained over the years. As it is, for those who consider the book essentially unfilmable, this is unlikely to convince them otherwise.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Situations are played out which I believe have never been seen in cinema.

68,Screen_Blitz,A bizarre and cerebral psychedelic acid trip with little cohesion or narrative heft,7,17 August 2016,"Terry Gilliam takes on the daunting task of adapting Hunter S. Thompson's psychedelic novel into an on screen feature, a task few directors including Martin Scorcese and Oliver a Stone attempted, but failed to make it pass the green lighting stage. The results aren't necessarily unsatisfactory, but show that some literacy works don't translate on screen efficiently, even with the most talented filmmakers working behind the camera. This black comedy starring Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro drags viewers through a loopy, psychedelic odyssey of a morally depraved duo who finds themselves intoxicated in what feels like more like a two-hour celebration of nearly drug in the book than a film with a cohesive story to follow. And with Terry Gilliam's inventive, but intoxicating visual methodology, it places it's characters through a loopy journey that is destined to leave audience either laughing hysterically or horribly disturbed by the vile nature of excessive drug escapades that pervades most of the film. The movie follows two stoners: the idiotic journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and psychopathic lawyer Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio De Toro) as they cruise in their red convertible through the deserts of Nevada and into the shiny streets of Las Vegas where he pursue their way to the American Dream, only to find themselves warped in a series of chaotic circumstances contributed by their compulsive drug addiction.If this film feels like a cerebral acid trip to you upon watching it, don't worry! You are not alone. With the characters letting wild on just about every drug in the book including pot, acid, heroin, cocaine, LCD, and what not; there is very little you can expect other than the feeling being sozzled out after taking a mind-altering substance. Terry Gilliam accomplishes this through a unique, but mind-bending technique involving visual distortion in intent of providing viewers with a feel of the condition Roaul and Gonzo are experiencing when drowning out in their excessive drug feud. During the scenes when the characters are experiencing withdrawals from hallucinagens, viewers watch as the camera bobbles at low angles back and worth, and the lighting obtains a reddish tint place an odd and uncomfortable feeling of intoxication. This technique is highly creative and shows the beauty of Terry Gilliam's immersive visual heft. Although the nightmarish imagery of Raoul's hallucinations such as the hotel clerk's head morphing into a monstrous alien creature is rather cheesy and unrealistic, it certainly paints a reasonable picture of the character's mental perspective. These scenes occasionally offer some good , but tend to be executed in an unsettling manner that towers surrealism over humor. By the end, the only humor we can manage to swallow out of these characters in some occasional solid one-liners but nothing memorable.While Terry Gilliam may have the visual style to compel the wild Las Vegas adventure, the film falls quite flat in the narrative department, offering an unwholesome mess of a plot with characters that are not only incredible foolish and vile in nearly every sense, but offer almost no backstory other than Raoul being a long-time journalist and Gonzo being an absent-minded lawyer, though it doesn't entirely defeat the likability of the characters. Their strange philosophy on the American Dream does provide at least some decent humor, but nothing clever. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are both funny every once in awhile, even in scenes when they're indulging in hardcore drug hysteria, and their performances are not bad to say the least. Raoul is arguably the most unusual and light- hearted role Depp has endure in his career, compared to his more clever outings. The same can probably be said for Toro as he is rarely accustomed to oddball, comedic roles. Though there performances don't link into the Oscar calibur, they do little to make up for the clobbered mess the plot delivers. The plot transcends through such choppy pacing it borders on the line of being incomprehensible. Although it seems Gilliam is trying to match the pacing with the psychedelic condition of the lead characters, the overall effect doesn't work in the way it should. Even though Gilliam supplements some liberties from Hunter S. Thompson's novel, it's clearly evident he's struggling to enhance the life and soul of Thompson's narration into from novel to the screen. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is probably not the most comfortable vehicle to sit through, nor does it demonstrate the best of Terry Gilliam's directorial talent, it still benefits from a humorous standpoint and provides a compelling cerebral that some will come to enjoy, while others will likely experience a sense of disgust.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

71,classicalsteve,The Strangest Journalist Who Ever Penned the American Nightmare,10,26 June 2007,"It was once said that the Austrian composer Wolfgang Mozart was ""not a man of this world."" If that was true of Mozart, then Hunter S. Thompson, the original Gonzo journalist, was not a man of this Universe, or any other for that matter. Or maybe, when Thompson came into this universe, he accidentally brought the other one with him. Thompson, the writer of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was a man whose perspective on life oozed from a pen filled with ink from other dimensions.Thompson made a following in the 1960's and 1970's with a two-fold avant-garde approach to journalism. Well, ""avant-garde "" is almost too tame a word. His style was the journalistic equivalent to Salvadore Dali or Thomas Pynchon where reality and surrealism become very reluctant bedfellows in a world that seems to have gone mad--or maybe it never really was sane to begin with. The other aspect in addition to Thompson's warped view of the world is his habit of engaging in the lovingly coined term ""Gonzo Journalism"". For those unfamiliar with it, Gonzo Journalism refers to an approach to reporting in which the reporter and/or journalist becomes as important to (or more important than) the story itself, in a kind of self-aggrandizement in which the story and reporter literally become one. And Thompson was, for almost five decades, the quintessential Gonzo journalist. He is sometimes referred to as Dr Gonzo.As Gonzo journalism is definitely not for all readers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is definitely not for all movie-goers. If you're shopping for a film to re-affirm certain steadfast precepts of logic, love, ethics, and morality, then your movie-buying dollar needs to be invested elsewhere. But if you're willing to forgo any predetermined expectations about how and what a movie should be, you're in for one hell of a ride. Fear and Loathing is a roller coaster from which you never seem to be able to get off.The story surrounds a semi-fictional character, Raoul Duke, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp in a role that even the most daring of actors would avoid at all costs. The only other actor brave or foolish enough to step into the twisted world of Thompson was Bill Murray in ""Where the Buffalo Roam"". The difference between Raoul Duke and Hunter Thompson is mainly the spelling. The character is still replete with Thompson's trademark long cigarette, California drawl, and a personality that is at once maddeningly low-key and as deranged as Dracula on speed. The Raoul Duke aka Hunter Thompson character is the type of person you might want to at first avoid by running into the nearest coat closet before peeking your head out to see what this space alien masquerading as a human being will do next. And Raoul Duke goes on this adventure with a side-kick known sometimes as his attorney and also as Dr Gonzo.The setting for the misadventures of these two interplanetary refugees couldn't be more perfect. Space Alien and his side-kick Godzilla go on a drug-infested trip to the loony-bin surreal capital of the US of A: Las Vegas. Duke is supposed to be covering a motorcycle race for the incomparable Sports Illustrated and gets sidetracked by the amusement park that is the Disneyland for adults. The road trip begins on the infamous two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in a 1960's convertible that has seen better days--and better owners. Even before they arrive in neon-ville, Depp sees bats all over the sky, but becomes concerned when his partner fails to see them also. He wonders that his partner may be ""losing it"" when he doesn't see the bats that Depp does. During the trip (and the ""trip"") these two maniacs enter Vegas and see strange creatures in and out of hotels, casinos, bars, and even on the race track. And people in particular sometimes show up as reptilian creatures looking to devour Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo.The result is a kind of endless romp through an amusement park from Hell that never lets up. At one point the drugs have so twisted all of their perceptions of reality that the world has become somewhat akin to the hideout of the Joker in the old Batman TV series from the 1960's, you know where the floor is always slanted to the side. This is the Hunter Thompson world to a tee faithfully executed by probably the only other entity on the planet twisted enough himself to bring this mayhem to the screen: Terry Guilliam of Monty Python fame. (He was the originator of the mad cartoons that combined European Renaissance art with the Python surrealist sensibility between sketches.) The story is a mosaic of drug-inducements that nearly drive the characters insane. I mean, is Las Vegas only the most inane choice of a location to engage in an intense drug-fest? Some have criticized this movie as advocating and glorifying psychedelic drugs, but I disagree. By movie's end I felt there was a reason I don't personally engage in these kinds of ""trips"". Maybe the world is mad enough as it is without using artificial means to make it seem even more insane.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

76,ajs-10,Very strange but strangely compelling Beware of 'Bat Country',8,4 December 2011,"This is one of those films that came across my radar several years ago but I never paid it much mind. However, when I discovered it was directed by Terry Gilliam I decided to put it on 'The List'. These things take time, but eventually it bubbled up to the top and I finally got the opportunity for a viewing today. I must say it's very strange, but at the same time it's quite compelling. I will tell you more after this extremely brief summary.This film charts the adventures of sports journalist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr Gonzo. They take a drug-fuelled trip (in more ways than one) to Las Vegas, initially, to cover a motorcycle race in the desert. Moving on to a conference on drug abuse, things descend into one crazy trip. I really can't say much more about it, I guess the Spoiler Police will be pleased, but I must say it just one of those you have to see for yourself.Full of great dialogue and also some great tunes of the day; I believe it is supposed to be set in 1971. The two central parts were played by Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro as Dr Gonzo; both did an excellent job. Some other well known actors made appearances; Tobey Maguire as the Hitchhiker, Ellen Barkin as the Waitress at North Star Café, Gary Busey as the Highway Patrolman, Christina Ricci as Lucy and Cameron Diaz as the Blonde TV Repoter.I guess it is the narration that holds this film together; it draws you in with great descriptions of events, feelings, thoughts and the whole drug culture and the 'American Dream' thing. I thought it was brilliantly scripted. A very difficult piece to put on the screen but I thought Terry Gilliam was the perfect man for the job. It may not be as flamboyant as many of his works, but it most definitely has his stamp on it; particularly the 'lizard' scene. I usually don't approve of films that depict drug use, but I will give this one a pass, mainly because it doesn't go on to 'glorify' it. Over all, if a little long, I did enjoy this one very much Recommended.My score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 103,670 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 48/100 (based on 50 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

80,ofpsmith,A strange surreal trip into the mind of Hunter S Thompson.,9,19 December 2015,"Hunter S Thompson's 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a pretty surreal experience anyways. With graphic descriptions of Thompson's hallucinations that show the brutish nature of Las Vegas, Nevada. However Terry Gilliam managed to bring Thompson's hallucinations to life with this movie. If you aren't familiar with the story I'll quickly sum it up. Journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) are sent on a writing assignment by Duke's magazine, to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. But while there with a colorful assortment of drugs, they decide to make it the ultimate business trip to search for the American dream. But they find brutal people that take the American dream and run it out of gas to search around for any money they can find. The acting from both Depp and Del Toro is good, and like in the book we feel as though we are on a trip with these guys. Also the strange images that Duke sees look frighteningly real. I really have to give Gilliam credit for bringing this nightmare to life. That said, it's certainly not a movie for everyone. If you didn't like something like the book, or a movie like Eraserhead, then the chances are you won't like this very much. And if that's you, that's completely understandable. But if you're into the strange and the deranged, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is some nice eye candy.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
81,PersianPlaya408,An Amazing film about drugs and much more,10,23 May 2006,"Terry Gilliam's quirky Fear & loathing in las vegas is my favorite film yet fromt his director. Gilliam impresses me hear much more than in Brazil and The Brothers Grimm, and even more than the memorable Twelve Monkeys. Fear & loathing is a dark look at a crazy trip by a journalist and his supposed lawyer to las vegas. The two experiment with virtually every drug possible and have halucinations that are brought to screen quite realistically. Gilliam style fits perfect here, as weirdness is exactly what people on these types of drugs feel. I thought Johnny Depp's performance was absolutely great.... this guy is pretty versatile. I liked Benicio Del Toro as well, one of his best performances. All in all this is a great film and if your viewing tolerance of some crazy *beep* is high than you will love this film as much as me. 10/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
82,Headturner1,Saw only part,7,25 December 2018,Ok. This was on showtime or something a few months ago. I don't know how long it was on when I turned it on. It wasn't long after Benicio was with the girl in the room. I thought it was incredibly surreal and cool for about 45 min and as someone who suffers anxiety it induced it to the point I had to turn it off. It got redundant. Not to say I thought it incredibly funny and entertaining but it was not at all real in terms of consumption. Like Let me take some bottle I was told to take a sip and drink it all almost and do coke and this ad that. But I love odd surreal movies and will watch the whole thing one day.,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
83,dave13-1,The book is better,6,15 April 2012,"Something was missing from Johnny Depp's attempt to portray the late Hunter Thompson, and I could not put my finger on what it was until I saw the cover for Thompson's book The Great Shark Hunt. Hunter Thompson was six feet three and filled with a kind of lumbering, growly menace that promised that not only weirdness, but random violence could happen at any moment. Depp captures the mannerisms but not the manner. He grumbles semi- intelligibly, but in a completely benign, non-threatening way. The whole movie is the same way. Imaginatively and colorfully weird, but without the threat and menace of the truly dangerous weirdness that Thompson himself embraced and made famous, the whole exercise lacks the bite and shock value of the book. Read the book first.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

What starts as a fun drug-fueled comedy slowly turns into a claustrophobic nightmare of grotesque imagery and sensory overload. I've never done any hallucinogetic drugs, but I imagine that after a while, the rush Would become a nightmare. This is an ugly movie. It's hard to watch. It's extremely uncfomfortable. And that's the point.Terry Gilliam said in his own words: ""I want it to be seen as one of the great movies of all time, and one of the most hated movies of all time."" Judging by the critics' reactions, he succeded.
The film has an almost perfectly split 50 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and many critics, including Roger Ebert, were completely appalled by it, and honestly, it's not hard to see why.But the movie survived. It has stood the test of time. It has risen from the ashes to become stronger than ever before. It is a paradox. A joyful nightmare. A horrifying treat.

86,phenomynouss,What is this? This is no movie!,1,16 October 2006,"This movie appears to have garnered a totally bipolar reputation among the reviewers here on IMDb. Many people absolutely love it, many people absolutely hate it, many people think it is OK.Honestly, I had no opinion on this movie when I went to see it on DVD with my friend. It had its amusing moments (my favorite of which being the start, ""We can't stay here! This is bat country!"") But it appears this movie is nothing more than a series of moments. Much like life, but without any cohesion or purpose. Why live a life without purpose? Why watch a movie without purpose? For a summary, I can honestly say it's nothing more than ""Two insanely high/stoned/intoxicated junkies wandering around Las Vegas, tripping out, and with Johnny Depp's character yammering rapidly on a variety of subjects, while Benicio Del Toro's character says virtually nothing save for the occasional line, and the scene where he freaks out in the bathtub."" There is nothing more to it than that. Not even any sort of depth to it or message like ""Drugs are bad"" or ""Drugs are good"" or ""This is what doing drugs is like."" It just shows the two characters doing drugs.For character development, this appears as if some effort has been pushed into it on a very flimsy front. Johnny Depp's character is the paranoid delusional maniac, whereas Benicio Del Toro's character is the big silent guy who occasionally flips out. I didn't even discover until near the end the entire purpose of them being in Las Vegas---Johnny Depp's character is a writer having to write an article about a car or motorcycle convention of some sort.Random characters appear to have some emphasis in the plot or in reviews I've read (such as Gary Busey's highway sheriff, or Tobey MacGuire's hitchhiker), but serve no purpose except to proverbially pop in and say hello to the protagonists, then disappear It's not that little effort has been made plot-wise to the story--- NOTHING has been done to advance the plot; they do drugs, they fail their mission (writing the article), Johnny Depp drives off alone after the other guy mysteriously disappears and never returns (unless he DID return and I simply forgot.) All in all, I saw no stylishness that I hear about in the reviews, I see no artisticness to it. I see a shitty movie about two guys doing drugs and acting wacky. STYLISH, ARTISTIC, OBSCURE if you like, those weird kind of movies that confuse some people and are done really eccentrically and not in typical fashion, movies like Rob Zombie's two movies House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Memento"", etc",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
87,ronakkotian,The most trippy and bizarre film I've seen in a while!,9,21 January 2021,"I've heard so much about this film and was very eager to watch it. I absolutely loved 12 Monkeys, another Terry Gilliam film, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas surprised me in ways I didn't expect.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas follows Raoul Duke, a journalist, and Dr. Gonzo, his lawyer, who embark on a psychedelic journey to Las Vegas with a suitcase full of drugs.The film is based on the famous book of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, who went through a similar experience, and after seeing this film I really want to read his novel. There have been films recently like Midsommar and Climax that capture the feeling of being on psychedelics really well but Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas takes it to another level. What really caught my eye was Terry Gilliam's impressive direction. This is such a departure from 12 Monkeys and I always love it when directors try something new with each film they make. Gilliam uses the camera and the environments to his advantage by adding a distirted feeling to them. The camerawork is crazy, frentic and placed in very strange and uncomfortable angles that elevate the disorientated look of the film which makes Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas one of the trippiest experiences I've ever been through. The neon lighting helps contribute to that trippy feeling as well and make you feel like you're under the influence of drugs.Raoul Duke, essentially Hunter S. Thompson, is played marvellously by Johnny Depp. He captures the slurred style of speaking and dazed look of Duke perfectly. Another outstanding performer is Benicio Del Tero as Dr. Gonzo. The way both these actors portrayed the feeling of being on drugs is praiseworthy and made so many scenes throughout the film even more memorable than they already were. The screenplay written by Terry Gilliam, Alex Cox, Tony Grisoni and Tod Davies is another excellent factor. The dialogues are very entertaining and thought-provoking and Depp as a narrator makes it even more fun to listen to.I heard the negative response this film got and how there isn't any character to it which I completely understand. However, I do think there are a lot of underlying themes to it. I see the film as an examination of the rampant drug culture during the 1960s in America. The opening quote sums this film up and shows how people would drown their sorrows in an overload of drugs and alcohol. The entire journey is pointless but at the same time that's also the point.I would honestly love to watch this film again. It provides such a unique and bizarre experience that not many films give. With two extraordinary performances by Depp and Del Toro and Gilliam's offbeat direction, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of a kind.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
88,braddugg,Madness. It makes no sense.,4,7 September 2014,"Madness. It makes no sense. This is for sure a hallucinating, surreal, Tripp trip to the Vegas I had ever been subjected to. Yet, I could not relate all the happenings in the film, substantiate them with a story and then take this is as one film. Terry Gilliam is a fantastic director who know how to play with written work and with the camera too. But here, something coherent in writing and camera work was missing. Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benecio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo have played the roles with such conviction and freedom that they seem real, natural and the best part they feel like the characters and not the actors. They have given their everything into these characters like Johnny Depp going Bald and Del Toro growing a big fat tummy. It should have been a very daunting task for them physical and psychologically to hold this film tight in grip and give away their everything. Johnny Depp we know is one of the finest actors and turns into a chameleon. But Its Del Toro who rose above the script so high that even a look into the guys of a girl, made me shiver as much as the girl shivered. Terry Gilliam made something creepy, hallucinating and even monochromatic with those red scenes sprayed for some good amount of time in the film. Yet, he did not stitch them well is what I strongly felt. Well, I agree that when under the influence of narcotics, its all random and nothing coherent or organized but when I look at the other films like Trainspotting and put this in that league, it had a big flaw. That one flaw is lack of a story. 2 guys go to Las Vegas, have fun and get back. OK, but how and what is the purpose. This is what is essentially lacking is what I felt.Having said that, it is surely one of the Tripp films and I may dare say indeed the best hallucinating films that hits the psyche when one is high. But sad part is, I was always sober when I watched it and also let me confess, this is the second time I watched. First viewing was random and I could not contemplate much, though I missed something. But in the second viewing now, I found that there is nothing much to talk or write or contemplate about this film. Having said that it is not be a film to be written off either, some may find it completely Tripp, of the cuff, brilliant and even flamboyant. Thus making it great. The music is used well, The cinematography, art direction, the costumes and the make up are just pitch perfect with the tone of the film. Even other departments like editing, casting must be appreciated. But yes, I believe it lacked Direction. A film that begins with a terrific monologue and made me delve for the first half an hour into a trip, just lost steam later and it took me places where I was not so happy to be. Having said all that, it is very difficult for me to give a rating for this. Though it did not work for me, it may work for many who appreciate many elements of this and give this away for the lack of direction. So for myself I am going with an average rating of 2/5. But please check it out and judge it. Hopefully you may find something which you will like about this film.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
89,PIST-OFF,"A look into the weird world of acid, mescaline, and ether",10,28 April 1999,"This movie probably has the most realistic look of acid ever. Fear And Loathing is a highly funny reaccount of a drug-loving reporter's two assignments in Las Vegas. Johnny Depp has probably the best acting job of his career to date as Raoul Duke. The accent is hilarious. Terry Gilliam, who in the past has given the twisted gems of Brazil and 12 Monkeys, serves us yet another plate of the bizarre. Insane special effects and wide angle lenses provide an offbeat look into America's most offbeat city. Cameos by Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz are an added bonus. The time frame is jumbled and half the fun is trying to decipher Raoul Duke's jumbled incoherent writing and narrating into something that resembles sane recollections and a plot.

On the way they are constantly intoxicated on drink and various drugs.This film completely messes with your head. It is completely psychedelic and all over the place. The imagery is great. I love the feel of the movie. Granted, it is not all easy to follow... there were times where I was wondering what the hell was going on.There are some funny moments in it, but none that made me laugh out loud. I just found the amusing.The film stars Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Johnny plays his part well... but I think he played it as a comedy character. The way he walked and acted was very funny. And he looks great with a bald head... not! haha. Benicio did well too... he had to put on a big beer belly for this role. It makes a change for the Hollywood stars to make themselves look horrible. There were also some great cameos in the film. Other faces that appeared were Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Ellen Barkin, Gary Busey, Lyle Lovett & Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.The story was completely out there... but we have all come to expect this from Terry Gilliam. The legend that once was a member of Monty Python has made a few movies now... and most of them are weird in some way. That is not a bad thing.There are some good effects, but it is not a big special effects movie. There are a few scenes where you are seeing what Johnny sees... and it is drug fuelled. There are things moving and faces changing and people turning into creatures etc... it is bizarre. But I have never taken any drugs, so as far as I know, this is what probably happens. It is entertaining.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Quite good and amusing... but I have seen better drug related movies.

92,bat-5,Could've been better,6,3 June 1999,"Filled with the usual wild imagery that one comes to expect from Terry Gilliam, Fear and Loathing... feels undercooked.  Perhaps is stems from the fact that Gilliam inherited this project in the middle of preproduction. All of his other films, he started from day one.  There is a sense of completion with the others, but something about this one just doesn't feel up to the high quality of his previous efforts.  Johnny Depp is fine as the gonzo Thompson, and he is pretty much the highlight of the film.

In essence the movie is just about the antics of two men under the influence of heavy drugs, which is the basis of the film's humour. The film's director, Terry Gilliam, seems to have had a major influence on the film's humour attempts, as it has a Monty Pythonesque style. That being that if it is absurd it is funny, and the more absurd the funnier it becomes. A style which the movie uses a lot.

97,XxEthanHuntxX,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - 76,7,15 June 2020,"What makes this film so effective in its performance is its abundance in amazing photography, scenography and image composition. ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is, in my opinion, one of the best looking films of all time. Every time a ""drug scene"" pops up, you are amazed at what Gilliam managed to squeeze out of the $ 20 million budget, the film feels both expensive and large-scale. I hope that even those who think it is too excessive and screwed can appreciate the shiny aesthetics that characterizes each frame.In this one, you shouldn't follow some sort of logical trail, because even if you understand the story it's better to go for a flair, accept the bizarre event trend and go as you do on a fun-loving roller coaster. Just sit back, relax and appreciate the screwed-up madness the film offers.
Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are a magical combination and I can hardly imagine how much fun they must have had during the recording.

98,gpeevers,I Didn't Loathe it but Neither did I Particularly Enjoy It,5,3 May 2019,"Semi-autobiographical story about a drug filled road trip to Las Vegas in 1971 to cover a big motorcycle race is sports writer (Johnny Depp) loosely based on Hunter S. Thompson who wrote the book upon which the film is based. Along for the ride is a not so stable lawyer (Benicio Del Toro) as they also attend a convention for District Attorneys concerned with growing drug problems.
The whole problem for me is the concentration on drugs, the different kinds, the hallucinations and the after effects. For me this simply not compelling or very enjoyable to watch. Admittedly the juxtaposition of drug induced hallucinations with unreality of the Las Vegas casinos is interesting, also the take on 1970's abandonment of the idealism of the 1960's. The humor is plentiful but so much of it is focused on drugs that it soon gets repetitive.
It is another very good performance by Depp in which he virtually disappears into his character and several of the small cameos are very big departures for those performers. But that alone doesn't make this worth seeing in my opinion.

99,TheMarwood,Pure Horatio Alger,10,20 October 2014,"Terry Gilliam's crazed adaptation of Hunter S Thompson's classic, is a mess of a film - but this is one mess I love dearly. There's little structure, absolutely no discipline on behalf of Gilliam and the film viciously plows through the narrative one drug fueled binge after another. Rarely does the film ever calm down and it's so aggressively psychotic that it transcends any of its problems by becoming so unhinged, you'll just go along for the wild ride. Everyone here is so committed to this material - from the insane and wonderful performances from Depp and a big bellied Del Toro, to the bonkers direction by Gilliam and the warped cinematography by the blind in one eye Nicola Pecorini. Years after its disastrous box office run, critical drubbing and a Cannes premier that was booed off the screen, Fear and Loathing has not just collected a larger audience through the years, but has been shedding its toxic reputation.

101,CelluloidRehab,We were somewhere around Barstow. On the edge of the desert. When the drugs began to take hold.......100X,10,24 February 2006,"(Warning !! This review and movie refer to a huge amount of illicit material. If you are easily offended by that, stop reading and never, ever watch this movie unless you wish to become a red-shirt-bathroom wonderer.)""I feel a bit lightheaded. I think maybe you should drive."" Thats how this movie was for me from the beginning. Prior to this movie, I had no clue who or what Hunter Thompson was. I actually remember the moment quite vividly. I was with my-then-girlfriend, and we had just seen Godzilla (the horrible Broderick version). I had seen the posters before and Johnny Depp. I then convinced her to theater skip in to see F&L. To my surprise the theater was mostly empty. There was a maximum of 30 people in the room (in a 300 capacity theater). It was also at this time that I had my first taste of chiba. I was simply stunned. I routinely tell the ""untrained"" that this movie would give one an idea of what it would it be like, without actually being there. I even developed a taste for Singapore Slings with Mescal on the side. This is also special in that its my centennial review.Two men. The dessert. In a fire-apple red convertible. Attacking bats?? Case full of all the drugs know to civilized men since 1544 AD. They pick up Tobey Maguire hitchhiking in the desert (who never rode in a convertible before). Raoul Duke (a.k.a - Hunter Thompson - Johnny Depp) proceeds to explain to Tobey and to us, why he and Dr. Gonzo (a.k.a. - Oscar Acosta - Benicio Del Toro) are precisely where they are and what they are doing there (a.k.a. - the plot). This is done mostly in a flashback to the previous Friday afternoon in Los Angeles. Hunter gets a call for a press assignment. He's to go to Las Vegas, check into his hotel and write a story about the Mint 500 motorcycle race. Dr. Gonzo, as Hunter's lawyer and confidant, advises him to pick up Acopolco shirts, rent a very fast car with no top, tape recorder for special music and cocaine. We are returned into the present where Hunter and Gonzo proceed to completely freak out Tobey. Most newcomers to this movie assume, after this opening scene and the next 15 minutes, that this is some stoner movie like Cheech and Chong or Half Baked. It's more than that. Hunter's words with Terry Gilliam's vision turn this movie into something more. F&L is part comedy, part satire, part homage to the 60's and the subculture movement (Gilliam's obvious tribute to Hunter, Jack Kerouac, Abbie Hoffman, William S. Burroughs, etc) and part introspective into the American psyche. The collaboration between Hunter, Johhny Depp, Benicio and Terry Gilliam help to infuse this movie with life. Hunter was a consultant to Terry and even makes a cameo in a flashback to the acid craze in San Francisco (funny scene as Hunter looks at himself, in the 3rd person). Johnny spent months with Hunter prior to shooting. Benicio gained dozens of pounds for the role. It's so good that it questions itself half way through the movie. Is it a mindless, mind-altering trip with no message or is it really a serious critique of the American lifestyle (a.k.a - American Dream) ?? There is also a nice peppering of cameos : Ellen Barkin, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz and Flea. The rest of the movie could be described as a series of vignettes as Duke and Gonzo go from one assignment to another (the other covering the Nation District Attorney's Conference across town at the Flamingo Hotel). Its all full of the people, places and drugs they experience. Don't fight the experience. You'll get brain bubbles.F&L is veritable cornucopia of quotes : ""All right. You stay here and go to jail. I'm leaving. Come on you fiend. Nothing. I want nothing.""""..Bazooka Circus is what we'd all be doing on a Saturday night if the Nazis won the war.""""One of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when it's waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye.""""...that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last minute pre-dawn chaos of a stale Las Vegas casino.""""No. No. Calm down. Learn to enjoy losing.""""Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side. This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop heart. Make the bastard chase you. He will follow.""""You took too much man. You took too much. Too much.""""Listen. Lets get down to brass tax here. How much for the ape?""""It was all over now. We'd abused every that Vegas lived by. Burning the locals. Abusing the tourists. Terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possible believe it."" Like all the other Terry Gilliam movies, multiple viewings is a requirement. Each new viewing opens another window. F&L is a look at the myth of the ""American Dream"" from a subculture point of view. Most people know the path for the main stream, but few know of the others. In the end, even that view is not sufficient. Perhaps the ""truth"" is somewhere in between, or maybe its neither. Or maybe it never existed. Maybe the truth is something that we figure out on a individual basis after experiencing a few different paths. The end is a blank slate, and there is hope. Or maybe there isn't ??

It's really sad that a masterpiece like this got so much panning, because really, Fear and Loathing was INTENTIONALLY pointless. And anyone who has read the book would know this. In fact, with how many rave reviews the book got and how many negative reviews leads me to think that only idiots become critics.Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is not a drug movie. Sure it has lots of trippy parts and the two characters are stoned almost the whole movie. But this movie is about the American dream and how we look at it.Raoul Duke is a young man with his sidekick Dr. Gonzo on a business trip. Along them is a hot convertible, lots of beer, Raoul's typewriter, and an entire suitcase of hard drugs. With the latter in mind, the word trip becomes a key word, as that's what they do. With time to kill in Vegas, Dr. Gonzo and Raoul go on a disastrous journey that involves misadventure after misadventure, bad trip after bad trip, which leads their lives into a downward spiral.Fear and Loathing is disturbing, but just so funny all at once. Despite the Canadian ""PG"" rating on the back, this is NOT for the faint-hearted. But if you really look at it, we may never get a movie like this ever again. And the ""White rabbit"" scene is worth it alone... I was in tears by the end of that scene.So if you can take a good film that's very unconventional you will enjoy this for sure. And remember, ""We can't stop here! This is Bat Country!""",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
103,rollernerd,Gonzo psychedelic trip,6,27 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the tripped out psychedelic flick Fear and Loathing in La Vegas (1998), which is based on a book written by Hunter S Thompson who from what I have gathered is a semi-auto-biography. The ever-versatile Johnny Depp plays Raoul Duke, a reporter who is on an epic drug fuelled bender and is accompanied on this road trip with his attorney Doctor Gonzo played by Benecio Del Toro.The film is based in the 1970's where the American culture has shifted due to political disruption. So these two characters who are legit junkies are driving around Vegas who have every drug known to man and are hopping around casino hotel to casino hotel. The story begins with a mission to cover a motorcycle race however they get really messed up as a result of an acid trip bender.To give you peepz a heads up there is no real coherent story but to me this was the fun side of the movie as a collective. Yes it was a pointless pursuit of personal greed and pointless missions which I guess was the dream back in those days. However that is what drives the movie and for those with pointless epic missions which get to no where yet it does somewhere will understand what I mean. In other words, its a film narrative on acid.The direction of the movie by Terry Gilliam focuses on the drug addiction and is smart with a first-person narrative by Johnny Depp which invites us to the drug addiction with the use of different vibrant colours and taking us to many levels of what these characters get into, is a ride to escape your current reality so you can free you mind.There are fun scenes including ""We can't stop here!! This is bat-country"" and both performances by these actors are top-notched especially to capture tripped out scenes including the bathtub scene is hilarious and acting as how a freaked-out junkie will be was top notch. The movie is relevant to today's society.Having said all this, this is a movie I won't be revisiting due to the length and was repetitive in terms of the characters indulging in drugs, drugs and more drugs whether it be smoking, snorting or inhaling. The movie tries to make sense in a world which is transitioning due to its current climate conditions, which it tapped here and there but never took hold of the youth movement. Rather it had more emphasis on hazy scenes including how paranoia plays affect with ones mind when the trip buzzes them hard. Overall, an enjoyable film and is over all the place - 6.8/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
104,eskimosound,Excellent Movie...,10,1 May 2020,"This is an excellent movie not because it's a great story (It's not, there's hardly any story..!) Not because of the special effects (they're good) not because of the camera angles and editing (all very good) nor the direction (excellent) but because of the performances by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro...
They are absolutely amazing, convincing, funny, wonderfully animated, crazy...it's the best performance I've ever seen from either of these actors and they are brilliant anyway!
The movie is engaging from the start even though all they are doing is driving to Las Vegas!!

105,MarioB,Groovy,9,12 February 2000,"The best Terry Gilliam movie. I have fun, because it reminds me a lot of thing from the early seventies. Not that I did all those things! But the idea of the Era is absolutely great, without being nostalgic. I also love the way Gilliam presents Las Vegas : ugliness at his peak (yeah! right!). The comments are amazing (never read the book. But I will) and, of course, this is a visual effort with great creativity. But most of all, Gilliam should be applauze to make such film in 1998, in a nasty world of PC, where smoking a cigarette can get you to jail.

Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro appear to wander aimlessly through their paper-thin roles and seem to do nothing in the course of the picture except ingest drugs, throw-up, trash hotel rooms and then ingest drugs a little more.  If you value your time and money, avoid this film at all cost.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
108,Christopher_Reid,Weird but fairly unique and enjoyable,7,5 March 2015,"This seems to be a bit of a confused and wandering movie, not knowing where it's going or what its point is. But I guess that accurately reflects the experience of its characters. However, that's never really a good thing in art, the situation where you have no idea what the work is even aiming for. There needs to be a strong vision or style or tone. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas certainly has a unique feel to it, plenty of style over substance and it's quite enjoyable even if it feels a bit pointless.It reminded me a lot of The Big Lebowski which is also about a couple of friends ending up in messed up situations just sort of breezing along. The main character has an inner monologue, constantly musing about America and drugs and politics. He is halfway between thinking he's smart and knowing he's dumb, there must be some truth to what he is thinking even if he's incredibly ignorant.I think this movie mainly works on a very casual viewing level, there is nothing much to be found on any deeper level. It's pretty off- beat and you never know where it's going, although it doesn't really go anywhere - no build-up of suspense or plot or emotions. The acting is fine. I didn't recognise Benicio Del Toro for quite a while, he's pretty overweight in this movie. Some of the lines and ideas are pretty funny in an awkward or absurd way. Most of the movie is paranoid and little uncomfortable to watch - it's hard to see so much mess and irresponsibility and not feel frustrated.Terry Gilliam created lots of interesting ambiguity of genre and tone with 12 Monkeys. It had many elements of comedy, drama, thriller, sci-fi and yet never seemed to clearly fit into any one. This movie is a bit similar in that it's kind of funny but otherwise doesn't follow any formula, which is refreshing. But still, it's a meaningless, random trip that makes no statements. It is nice to sort of experience some drug effects without all the risk and destruction of actually doing it though.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Benicio Del Toro (one of our best as well) completely inhabits the bloated skin of his lawyer.  Terry Gilliam does his best and I can't imagine getting closer to the fabric of this mad tale!A 7 out of 10.  Best performance = Johnny Depp.  Gary Busey is memorable in a tiny role as a highway patrolman.  You really need to read the book first.

They take every mind-bending drug imaginable to man and try to report and photo the Mint 400 off-road race, but end up visiting the various strange bars of Vegas and having the most dreamlike hallucinations, as they seem to be constantly stoned. It is perfectly set in the early drug-crazed 70's. It has some good cameos from Christina Ricci, Cameron Diaz, Ellen Barkin, and some oddball bit-actors like Lyle Lovett, Flea and Penn Jillette make an appearance. The music is great, too, from the early 70's musical artists in a good musical era. It has some funny comments from the two leads as they verbally spar with each other and other folks, and is endlessly watchable for countless viewings.

111,mr_popcorn,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,7,20 September 2008,"""Fear and Loathing"" has got to be one of the most bizarre and weirdest film I have seen. Terry Gilliam's psychedelic masterpiece is a movie experience you wouldn't wanna miss. Its like taking all the drugs they took in the film and you're experiencing the same surreal, whacked up, distorted scenarios Raoul and Dr. Gonzo went through in said film. Actually, the film itself is a drug, a very addictive one. Gilliam's imaginative vision add to that Hunter S. Thompson's true to life psychedelic book from which this movie was based on and as the creme de la creme, you got two of the finest actors in Hollywood, Benicio Del Toro and Johnny Depp getting high and loopy in a weekend in Vegas. That's it right there, the perfect formula why this film worked.Johnny and Benicio by the way, gave pretty amazing performances, although a bit over-the-top at times in my taste but that's a mighty fine performance nonetheless. Its hard to look like you're stoned like hell although you're really not, that's a tought act to achieve although with this film you can't really be sure, maybe the guys where really loopy all along that's why their performances were so spot-on.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

This movie is a funny and sometimes surprising look at one story told of a sports writer who was very deep into the life of drugs.  The movie was very strange at times and if you did not pay close attention you probably would get lost.It does glorify drugs a little but shows the bad things about them as well. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who does not understand that drugs are not fun but can kill you.  The actors were great.

114,daniellawson-14-787057,"An exhausting, unforgettable drug trip",5,8 June 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Johnny Depp's performance is fantastic; he's a magnificent physical actor
2) This is one of the few films in which the narration actually adds to the film. I normally hate narration in film but I like it in this film
3) The special effects are unforgettable
4) The production design is fantastically uniqueNEGATIVES:1) There is a line where Johnny Depp says ""what was the meaning of this trip?"" And this line perfectly sums up the whole film. There is no meaning. There is no coherent plot. There is no story. The occasional times where the film attempts to have depth, which as far as I could tell was about drugs laws and hippies, just don't really work at all or add anything great to the film
2) It is definitely too long for a film with no story. It is just 2 hours of Depp and Del Toro doing ridiculous things. After the first hour, they have been so ridiculous that nothing they do in the second hour can top what we have already seen. It just gets tiring after the first hour
3) Ultimately, our two leads are very unlikable and therefore spending two hours in their company with no plot driving them forward does not add up to a good film",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

There's no upside here, no angle on it other than the whirl of the experience itself, and it s quite incredible how quickly that gets tedious - it's a long slow haul. At the end, we get only a  few worthless voice overs about how Leary failed to acknowledge the real pressures and factors that would stand in the way of dropping out - not that the movie has been any help in illustrating this theme. The camera is busy, to no effect, and the performances are too hermetically weird to be even slightly enjoyable.

116,quinimdb,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,10,13 January 2017,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was a movie that worked with the specific group of people that ended up making it, and probably couldn't have worked had they not been involved. Terry Gilliam's particular insane and surreal style worked incredibly well with this film, utilizing incredible vibrant lighting and psychedelic visual effects achieved digitally and practically, as well as almost constant Dutch angles and low angles and close ups and frantic movement, creating a constant sense of disorientation and really putting us into the mind of the drug addled Hunter S. Thompson, a journalist supposedly on a business trip. The film is visually amazing on every level. Johnny Depp is fantastic as that character, reportedly spending lots of time with him in order to get down all his mannerisms and the right vocal inflection, and delivering the best performance of his career because of it. Benicio Del Toro is fantastic as his ""attorney"", and even Tobey Maguire is even great in a small role of a terrified and naive hitchhiker. It also has probably one of the best soundtracks of the 90s, with each song fitting perfectly to its scene.But the film's exploration of America in the early 70s, and how this contrasts with the zeitgeist of the 60s, is part of what gives this depraved film nuance. The film opens with a montage of those protesting horrible injustices in the world, and a quote that I think sums up the two main characters pretty well: ""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."" Hunter S. Thompson, named Raoul Duke in this film, and his ""attorney"" Dr. Gonzo both dive headfirst into such unbelievable amounts of excess that everything becomes skewed and distorted beyond recognition. Most take drugs to get high, but for them it is mostly confusion, fear, and loathing. But their twisted view of the world is an escape from the harsh and oppressive reality of the world they live in. There is a great moment near the middle of the film in which Raoul emerges from the haze of his drug trip and has a moment in which he reflects upon the state of his existence at that moment. He mentions how the 60s were a time that everyone felt they were all in it together, standing up against the oppressive forces of the world and whatever they were doing, they were doing it right. The drugs they took at that time were a symbol of the peek that they had reached, bringing them together and symbolizing peace, while the drugs that they were taking now only gave them negative consequences. They had fallen from the grace of the 60s and were only now beginning to realize the falseness of the American dream, no matter how hard they striped for it. What they find out about the American dream is essentially that most will never stop searching for it, even if it died long ago. Through drugs and the rest of their escapades, they were desperately trying to find the light at the end of the tunnel that they had believed in so strongly during the 60s, but as we see, nothings really changed. The elite classes are shown as reptiles (literally) and hypocrites, distracting themselves from injustices in their expensive clubs, and pretending to be above marijuana smokers while smoking cigarettes. Ultimately what Raoul is doing with drugs is the same as what the average American man is doing in a casino, and what most of us are constantly doing: we're betting on the American dream, and losing just a little bit more each time. The characters begin in a downward spiral that may seem repetitive, but is also strangely honest.While the film can be disturbing, poignant, ironic, and disorienting, it can also be incredibly hilarious. The sense of humor is another thing that keeps the film afloat. It allows us to view the scrambled events and inappropriate behavior and desperation, and laugh at the absurdity of it all. The editing of the film makes the chronology of events and hallucination and memory hazy and borderline incoherent at times, but that's what is so amazing about this film. There was so much that could've ruined it, yet everything worked so harmoniously for this specific vision to create such an original, revealing, and distinctive vision of America.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
117,jake-law123,"""This here's bat country"".",7,12 May 2012,"Anybody who hasn't seen this movie cannot say that they have seen it all. You will literally fall into confusion, dizziness, and mental retardation within 5 minutes of watching this. Johnny Depp is insane as can be, and proves it brilliantly within this film.Based on the novel by Hunter S. Thompson, The story follows Raoul Duke, (Johnny Depp) a photographer for a magazine, and attorney Dr. Gonzo (Bernicio Del Toro)to a trip to Las Vegas to shoot pictures for a bike race. From the whole trip to their time in Vegas, they are stoned with several doses of mescaline. Their trip turns for the worst when they experience several bizarre envisions due to their doses. Through several different situations and conflicts, they continue to struggle between the boundaries of reality and illusion.You will find nothing in this movie anywhere else. It's literally like nothing you've ever seen. Every scene is a crazy mad house full of random bizarre pictures. Each scene is more random than the other.From comparison to the novel, the best part is the detailed narration of Johnny's character, describing his experiences while they're being shown. It's so interesting to listen to. The movie would not be as good without the narration. I haven't read the book yet. A lot of people say it's better because it has more descriptive narration. Some criticize the film for having not much story arc, and focusing on the results of the doses. But that's the point! Thompson appreciated the film so much that when he watched it for the first time, he literally relived the trip for each scene, jumping up and down on seats. The things that the character's see make the film work, and the narration makes it work even better. Johnny does an amazing job capturing the actions of a dosed up hot head. Bernicio del Toro is completely insane! Everything he does get them deeper and deeper into the psychological despair they experience. He is completely random at all times. You never know what he'll do next, almost scary. But he pulls off a solid performance.Director Terry Giliam's purpose was to create a mood just like the novel, which he successfully does. This film is very underrated, and doesn't have the praise it deserves. This film entertained me from beginning to end, and will always stay fresh and crazy.

Johnny Depp becomes Hunter S. Thompson and gives the performance of his career in this adaptation. The film lifts a lot of it's dialogue directly from the book and that really helps bring the impact that Thompson was trying to have with his book. The film is not a normal cinematic story but instead a tale of the times, a diary of the excesses of the 1970's. Told by Depp and featuring the supremely talented Benicio Del Toro, this beautifully shot story takes us in and around Las Vegas on a whirlwind, drug soaked ride. The cinematography is wonderful as is Terry Gilliam's direction. He's a very visual director and was the best possible choice to direct this very visual movie. Bottom Line: Fear and Loathing is a great flick that not everyone gets. If you get it and you like it then you're in with the rest of us.

A friend of mine told me that this one of those films that only people who have experiences like it can relate to and love this film.  I disagree, you can love this movie for the sheer comidic value of of the exploits of these crazy individuals.

120,teh_mode,A Surreal Experience To Say The Least,6,9 February 2006,"I think Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas probably outlines why some people have it in for Mr Gilliam. A big, messy, hard to follow film which is light on plot but high in style. Whilst some of thosecriticisms may be valid of this film, I don't think they transcend all of his work. He's a genius in my opinion, and this shows glimmers of that. The problem for me is - just how interesting is this story - and did it really need to be told? Johnny Depp is just pure class. You have to admire the man for taking this role. For someone who is such a pin-up for so many people, he really knows how to strip himself of any ounce of glamour in order to depict a man of such debauchery as Raoul Duke - Hunter S. Thompson's alter ego. In my opinion he is one of two things that keep the film going. Benicio Del Toro rather mumbles his way through the stunning visual which - although understandable for a psychotic drug addled slob - is not the most pertinent screen presence.What saved the film for me was Gilliam's awesome vision. No one encapsulates you more on this side of the world like the former python. He is an artist first, filmmaker second. To understand the drug addled madness of Hunter S. Thompson's plight you must take a voyage through his world. It is one full of hallucinatory paranoia, hyperbolized by the overwhelming glitz of Las Vegas. It is both a dream and nightmare for our protagonists, and for the audience itself. You might walk out with a headache, but at least you won't take drugs again.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
121,RobertF87,Best Possible Adaptation of the Book,7,4 December 2011,"This film from director Terry Gilliam and based on the 1971 book by Hunter S. Thompson, follows journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and his crazed attorney Doctor Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) as they travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to cover a prestigious motorcycle race equipped with an astonishing variety of alcohol and drugs. The duo soon turn a simple sportswriting assignment into an insane, prolonged drug binge.Long thought to be unfilmable, Terry Gilliam manages to create a striking screen version of Thompson's distinctive prose. The film utilises a variety of visual and audio techniques to recreate the experiences of the druggy duo. The film features superb performances featuring a variety of well-known actors in small roles. Johnny Depp spent a lot of time with Hunter Thompson researching for his role and the two became close friends until Thompson's death in 2005.In keeping with the book, the film doesn't have much of a storyline and veers wildly between wild comedy and some genuinely disturbing sequences. The film deals with the disillusionment that many in America felt as the sixties gave way to the seventies, and Gilliam, who directs with a strong attention to detail, puts in many references to the Vietnam war, protests and politics of the period.The book is a modern classic and this is a powerful adaptation. Thompson fans may be interested in ""The Rum Diary"" (2011) , which also stars Johnny Depp in the lead.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
122,Blade_Le_Flambeur,"Bizarre and hilarious, a great adaptation of a classic novel",9,16 April 2003,"'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is the Terry Gilliam film adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's classic autobiography of sorts. The novel is written in hallucinatory first person form that is still literate but at times plain weird and often hilarious. The challenge for screenwriters Terry Gilliam and Tony Grisoni, as well as Terry Gilliam as a director was to take this unusual narrative form and turn it into a film that makes sense. And they did it with flying colors.Taking center stage of the story is Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), a journalist in the 1970's who gets the assignment to cover a motorcycle race in Las Vegas. Along for the ride is his warped out and sometimes psychotic attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro). They rent an apple red convertible in LA in order to make the road trip, and in the trunk pack a LOT of drugs. The plot of the film is rather complicated to objectively explain, sufficient to say the film follows these two oddball characters stoned through out Vegas, trying to make sense of what is going on while on drugs and trying to get to the heart of the American Dream.One of the most important things for a film that deals with drugs in the manner 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' does is the visual look. Since the audience is often placed in the shoes of Duke, either through what is happening to him or his narration, they too have to see the effects of the drugs. Director of photography Nicola Pecorini, editor Lesley Walker, and production designer Alex McDowell do a fantastic job capturing the feeling of 70s Vegas through the stoned eyes of the main character. Memorable visuals are layered through out, such as a classic scene in a hotel lobby involving a bunch of large reptiles. There are also many scenes in the Duke's suite that are filled with crazy vibes as the two slowly lose control of what is going on. Another film about drugs that uses its visual technique extremely well is 'Requiem for a Dream', although 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is comparatively much lighter.Terry Gilliam has the pleasure of assembling two top notch actors and both deliver fine performances. Johnny Depp, as usual, goes into his chameleon mode and never fails to amuse as wise cracking Duke. Del Toro adds a scary, sometimes masochistic atmosphere as attorney Dr. Gonoz, and the film is filled with great cameos from the likes of Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, and Christina Ricci. The screenplay allows for their dialogue to flow beautifully, adding a lot of hilarity and at the same time maintaining the crazy atmosphere of Thompson's hippie novel. As a director, Gilliam has an inspired visual flair that helps add to the quirky story. His great team of visual stylists are used perfectly, and the film has a constant rhythm and momentum to it that stays together the whole way through. Despite the fact that the second half is darker than the first, Gilliam still manages to hold everything together.The one flaw of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is that while the novel, despite its large comedic overtones, strives for something a little deeper. It attempted to really find the meaning of the American Dream, and to dissect the significance of the trip. The film seems to pass this over for more entertaining purposes, and while this doesn't significantly diminish the film's quality, it is still noticeable.Through its subliminal performances, skilled film-making, and great visual technique 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' becomes a very memorable experience. It is a showcase of some top notch talent and while it could have failed in many places, Gilliam and co. are able to hold it together. A very good adaptation of a very good novel.9/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Thompson seems like the man who has broken everything that every religion says about drugs along with his friend ""Dr Gonzo"". I haven't researched him up but if he sounds, looks, and talks like what Johnny Depp Portrayed in the film, then he surely is weird. Johnny Depp has probably made this character look presentable on screen at best. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor who has starred in a lot of masterpieces that, definitely, includes Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. I love his mannerism, his speech in the film, and of course, I loved his performance to the point of extreme madness. Benicio Del Toro on the other hand was immaculate as well for portraying an overweight lawyer and friend Of Raoul Duke (Hunter S. Thompson) who looks disgusting on the screen. His part was one of the most disturbing character studies ever, ""it"" was a mix between the cannibals out of Wrong Turn and Hannibal Lecter. That is how disturbing it was. The film itself will make you high with pleasure as you see life through the two mismatched pairs as they are being taken over by hundred drugs of drugs. The film will go all fuzzy and twirly, and swirly forever when the the duo are on drugs and at times, they see imaginary creatures like bats over their heads. Scenes like those are very hard to digest and very annoying because you don't really know what is going on. I give two thumbs up for the brilliant narration, spoken by Johnny Depp, because sometimes, as I have said before that, the film will be hard to take in and the narration will elaborate more on what is happening. The narration was also great to hear because it had a great voice saying the narration and it also contains a lot of expression. Tobey Maguire plays the ""Hitchhiker"", a character without a background and who has long white hair that looks vile. Tobey Maguire was still in his rookiness and so I fail to give him a positive review about his performance. Aside from this small role, we also see Camera Diaz who is listed on IMDb as the ""Blonde TV Woman"" taking on somebody who has a ""negative"" encounter with one of the boys who has a gun. Cameron Diaz will happily get a positive review from me.An adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's novel of the same name. The film details a whacky search for the ""American Dream"", by Thompson and his crazed, Samoan lawyer. Fueled by the massive amount of drugs they purchased with an advance from a magazine to cover a sporting event in Vegas; they set out in the Red Shark. Encountering police, reporters, gamblers, racers, and hitchhikers; they search for some undefinable thing know only as the ""American Dream"" and find fear, loathing and hilarious adventures into the dementia of the modern American West.The music used in this motion picture has been greatly chosen. This film contains songs by Jefferson Airplane who have a song called ""White Rabbit"" that immediately caught my attention and another song by them called ""Somebody To Love"" which was glamorous as well. There are also songs by The Blues Brothers, The Young Bloods, Frank Sinatra, and many, many more. One other thing I want to talk about is Johnny Depp's hair in this film and how absurd it looks. It might have belonged to Hunter S. Thompson but it doesn't look good on Johnny, I don't know why I brought up the hair thing but isn't it weird? Terry Gilliam has some notable films on his list and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has to be one of the notable film. This film came to be a surprise and I didn't expect much out of it but it is quite promising to those who understand it. I recommend this film to people who have ""no Life""! That was a joke, right? I recommend this film to people who want to watch it. That's it! The End!""Over and Out."" 27 May 2010.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
125,vonnoosh,Stalls a bit,5,13 December 2020,"It seems impossible to review a movie like this with spoilers. The plot is nil and that makes the movie fall flat a few times with an anticlimactic ending.I feel the point of the book is to condemn all the wasted energy spent by the hippies who were more interested in turning themselves on and dropping out instead of affecting serious and lasting change. Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo are not portrayed as much better than miserable caricatures of outdated hippies. They goof around and go to excesses and it is a myopic experience because they cut themselves out from the world around them. What had the hippy culture's obsession with drugs and drifting along in their own private world accomplished when the people around them don't know and much less care about what they are doing or experiencing? That was the question I felt Thompson was asking with the book. There are some asides in the movie that hammer that point home if it meant to be interpreted that way and I cannot see how it can't be considering Vietnam was over 5 years old and still raging, who was President in '71 when it was published, and who would be reelected in a 49 state landslide the following year. I suppose a book or movie like that doesnt need a plot as such, does it?The movie has alot of familiar faces, its visually stunning and funny at times but that's what it does have. A good story it does not have. This is a typical struggle it seems with multimedia adaptations of Hunter Thompson's work. Where the Buffalo Roam stalls and ends flat. Rum Diary, the movie is as weak as twice used coffee grounds compared to the novel. Where the Buffalo Roam at least showed it wasnt just about the drugs and drinking for the sake of doing both. The National Lampoon Radio story parodying Hunter Thompson called the California Story is probably the best I ever encountered in terms of story. That has Thompson, feeling humiliated, renting a Belvedere instead of the Cadillac and taking drugs nicknamed ""Tibetan Salad Oil"" and ""Uncut Siamese Tiger Balls"". It ends with a mock Grateful Dead concert that was supposed to be on barges and the show would continue as the boat drifts from San Francisco to Hawaii. Viva Brian Doyle Murray for his performance as the legendary writer in that.I guess this has a cult following. I was one of the not many who did see it in the theater when it came out. I remembered how well it all looked but my date and I left feeling like not much happened. I wonder what Alex Cox would've done with it. This type of movie seems more suited to what he had done in the past with Repo Man, Straight to Hell and Sid and Nancy than anything Terry Gilliam did but as I said, the problem is story. Drifting from one goofy scene to the next is still just drifting.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
126,Keemshave,Extremely entertaining film.,8,28 May 2019,"Wacky, spontaneous, and eye-opening. Depp gives one the best performances of his career playing Hunter S. Thompson, based on his true-life events in Vegas. The writing and direction aren't perfect, and some elements seem borrowed from other films. This doesn't make much of a difference, however, as this film will thoroughly entertain the majority of its audience.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
127,themarina1,Weirdly entertaining,9,16 May 2004,"Most people have heard some rumors of the crazy times that were the 60s but nothing quite tops this. A bizzare look at a weekend in Vegas (gone wrong????) with two guys with too much booz, money and drugs. Based on Hunter Thompson's book (which is somewhat autobiographical) this crazy story unfolds like a bad acid trip. And most of it does take place under the influence of some narcotic. As is typical with Gilliam's directing, you almost have to be on acid to make sense of it.With crazy stunts, fantastic acting and some of the most disgusting scenes I have ever seen, this is a great watch. Keep an eye out for guest spots and quick one liners by some very notable actors and actresses.A must watch for Gilliam fans and a purely wacky watch for the rest.9/10 for insane brilliance",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
128,Criticman12,A very weird movie filled with drugs and hallucinations,9,29 April 2011,"Hunter S. Thompson has been known for making weird and great novel's including one of my favorite book's, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.In 1998, Terry Gilliam, the director of, Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Brazil, released a film adaptation.The story is about a journalist named, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, going to Las Vegas to do some crazy things there, while Duke writes an article about a motorcycle race happening there.What I love about this film are the visuals. They were able to stay true to the one's in the book and they can be pretty cool at time's. I also enjoyed Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's acting in the movie. It also stayed true to most part's of the book.The only problem I have with this movie is that sometime's the movie dosen't stay true to some part's of the book and it just show's the guy's doing weird thing's throughout the film.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is a great adaptation and movie. If you're looking for a funny movie to watch, this movie is worth watching.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
129,stefstars,You Need To Read The Book First,7,15 May 2021,"I had heard about this movie for the longest and made the decision to read the book before watching it. I did myself a favor in doing so. Most of the bad comments are coming from people that don't realize this was a book first, a very important one that manipulative, hipster, stoner boyfriends swear by like Christians with The Holy Bible. Had I come to this film without ever reading the book, I would get frustrated and confused like most moviegoers seem to have gotten. The movie follows the book almost to a perfect T, the narration is straight from the book and some of the dialogue as well. It was really satisfying to see.Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Torro are fantastic. Casting these two characters would be tricky but I think the director did a great job with choosing these two. They worked well together and really captured their characters well. Johnny Depp though, you can tell he really gave his all to this performance and that he had a lot of fun with it. Of all the films I've seen Johnny Depp in, this is the one where you can feel the enthusiasm he had for this role. I'm glad he got this experience. You also get to see young Cameron Diaz, Tobey Maguire, and Christina Ricci perform. Maguire and Ricci are the most memorable, another instance where they were perfectly casted for the characters they were playing. Who else but Christina Ricci could creep these stoners out, she's the perfect Lucy.Making this story into a film is tricky work. Even Hunter S. Thompson himself said that it couldn't ever be done because a lot of the story has to do with what's going on in his mind, not just the drug trips but the thoughts racing through his mind. This gets lost in the film, despite the narration, because we mostly see through the main characters' trippy point of views and hear Raoul's thoughts here and there but not enough for the viewer to understand what's going on. Without knowing the story beforehand, you'll feel as high as the characters are and you'll understandably get frustrated.The way it was filmed and the effects they added to make it trippy has made this film a cult classic. Many music videos, shows and even other films have been inspired by it and reference it from time to time. It's one of the most accurate onscreen depictions of what someone sees while under the influence of hallucinogens - really brought Thompson's descriptions in the book to life.I enjoyed the film and as mentioned before, I love how it followed the book through and through but naturally it couldn't do that 100%. A lot of Thompson's thoughtful observations of the world he was living in get lost and how these observations connect to myth of Las Vegas. The movie comes off as one long thoughtless drug trip, when really there were some intelligent points made in this experience - that's why I gave it a 7/10.If you want to watch this film, I suggest you read the book first.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
130,commandercool88,"Incoherent, twisted, bizarre. A good time.",7,7 July 2008,"What the hell did I just watch? These were the first, the only, thoughts that came to mind as the perpetually bizarre 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' faded to black. Classifying Terry Gilliam's film a unique experience doesn't do the project justice, it stands alone in a league of its own. And while it makes very little sense and gets lost somewhere in the smoldering deserts of Arizona, the always fascinating Johnny Depp makes this a trip worth taking, even for a one-time deal.'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' finds Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro en route to Las Vegas, they're trunk packed full with drugs. Drugs, drugs, and more drugs. Depp, whose journalism character is on his way to cover a motorcycle race, narrates 'Fear and Loathing' through a constant daze of mind-altering psychedelics. It is perhaps the only coherent construct of an otherwise hypnotic wreck. A swarm of (invisible) attacking bats on a desolate highway and a reptile zoo in the middle of a hotel lounge are only two of the many oddities that helps jump start 'Fear and Loathing' to a hilariously trippy start.All good things must come to an end, and somewhere along the line 'Fear and Loathing' hits a bad trip. What little substance was there to begin with dries up in the Vegas deserts, and the film veers off-track and never fully recovers. And though the humor begins to wear out its welcome and what exists of a plot stalls with no forward momentum, the film remains watchable in an oddly transfixing sort of way. It's the dedicated performance from Johnny Depp that's the glue that holds the whole the together as he fully immerses himself in this indescribably strange role. Unsurprisingly, it fits him very well. With a mindlessly babbling del Toro by his side, 'Fear and Loathing' does at least one thing by the books: it boasts impressive performances.'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is a slice of American culture, a twisted and outlandish ride that takes us back to a country fresh out of the 60s. The Vietnam war still going strong, but the wave of optimistic free-love now just a memory. It's a nation-wide hangover, and Terry Gilliam is here to show us every sleazy, dirty, uncensored detail of a nation running low on hope. 'Fear and Loathing' doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and it probably isn't supposed to. But this is one incoherent mess that also doubles as a fascinating look at an American era, and I found it an intriguing study every step of the way.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
131,MrVibrating,A Great Trip,10,7 December 2005,"This must be, by far, the weirdest movie I've seen in a long time. Also, its the funniest. Terry Gilliam proves once again he is a great director with this spaced-out psychedelic trip of a movie. There is little to no plot, LOTS of acid trips, marijuana highs, ether drunkenness and God knows what else they did in the movie, and other weird things of the 70's.Johnny Depp portrays YET another extremely interesting character, and he does it wonderfully. The mumbling,(he has a cigarette in his mouth ALL the time)stoned, former revolutionary Duke, who is also a reporter, is great in every scene he's in. Benicio Del Toro is a fat, equally stoned, aggressive lawyer, who hangs around with Depp for no good reason. Together, they draw a wide line of chaos wherever they go. The busted up hotel-room after a day-long trip is a marvelous sight.Various actors make small roles, such as Tobey McGuire as a inexperienced hitchhiker who get's picked up by the dysfunctional duo while they're high on at least three different drugs, and Cameron Diaz plays a reporter in a small part.As for the plot, it's pretty basic. Depp goes to Las Vegas to cover a Hells Angels desert race. He screws up, bad, and his misadventures in Vegas starts.This is not a serious movie. It's weird, silly, strange, twisted and trippy. In that way, it captures the feel of that time better than any other movie, even 'Hair'.A has-to-be-seen movie. Has to be seen to be believed, that is.10/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

133,leftistcritic,"A strange, bizarre film",7,21 May 2019,"Last night I watched this film but needed until now to write about it, to let it sink in. The whole film is basically like a drug trip, hence the negative reviews on here about it having a weak plot and being pointless...but that is the nature of the movie itself! Its probably the most strange and bizarre of all of Terry Gilliam's films I've seen so far, more than Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Jabberwocky (1977), Time Bandits (1981, which was so bad I couldn't even watch the whole thing), Brazil (1985), The Fisher King (1991) or 12 Monkeys (1995). The two main characters, Hunter S. Thompson (played by Johnny Depp) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio del Toro) basically just go around Las Vagas and do whatever they want. It is, to take from vincent-27's review of the film in July 2003 on here, a ""magical ride"" which not only talks of the ""horrors of excessive drug use"" but the failed 60s generation. In this way, it actually shares some similarities with Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice (2014), which also showed the failures of those in the 1960s. Apart from the scenes where Hunter and Dr. Gonzo wave off invisible bats they think are attacking them, one of the more bizarre scenes includes Hunter and Dr. Gonzo going to a convention of cops talking about ""evil"" drug use while they high out of their minds!Neither of the main characters are really likable and are jerks to everyone, abusive to women and all around horrible people. But, the film does show you the depravity and greed of Amerika itself, looking at ""sickening excesses of consumption"" with the failure of the ""American Dream,"" with Malcolm X terming it an ""American Nightmare,"" which the two protagonists claim they are ""finding"" when going to the carnival, for instance. Many parts of the film involve not only a strange daze, with strange colors and shapes, but not knowing what is really happening, questions about the meaning of existence and feeling threatened out of their lives, with Depp's narration pulling the film together. Perhaps this makes it no surprise that Hunter Thompson liked the film when shown it in a screening.For the consensus on Rotten Tomatoes to say that the film is ""visually creative, but also aimless, repetitive, and devoid of character development"" is not incorrect. But this does not mean that the film is worthless, like those like Roger Ebert like to say, with critics evenly split on this film. As one critic noted, ""some people will see a godawful mess...Others will see a freewheeling comedy, a thinking person's Cheech and Chong film."" I would say the film is a mix of both., as watching it is an adventure in and of itself. That's why I give this film a rating of 7 out of 10.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
134,daveisit,Slippery Mice,8,10 July 2005,"This is far from your everyday movie, and only for those with a deep appreciation for the diversity of film-making, or fans of Hunter S. Thompson. This does not mean those mentioned will enjoy it, although definitely respect the attempt. I personally found it fascinating. To portray a permanently drug induced state to the big screen was done with creativity and subtle humour. You could expect nothing less from director Terry Gilliam who has played such a massive role in the brilliant and original Monty Python works. Having never read any of Hunter S. Thompson's work, I get the impression that justice is done for the adaptation to the big screen. An absolutely quality cast must be credited for this, ensuring a natural performance is achieved.

The choice of Deltoro as the attorney was very poor and I feel that his erratic acting style performed here was not up to par, if one is to compare the previous films based on this subject. Too much twisting and over all the movie seems to be a complete disaster. Johnny Depp is a great actor, and closely resembles Murrays' character, when I first began watching it, I thought that it was Bill again. I cleaned my lens and realized that the connection between the two is much closer than Lazlos character played by Peter Boyle. The two movies simply don't match up in terms of direction, and style, despite the fact that they are closely related to the same people, though 18 years apart in film making.

137,knsevy,Fantastic,10,25 November 2003,"It's rare to find a movie that really IS a full-throttle ride from beginning to end, even among those genres ('action', for instance) who constantly claim to be just that. On the surface, this would look like a low-key road trip, just another piece of Cheech & Chong harmless drug comedy. What you get is a surreal, sublime, even scary rocket sled ride through naked Americana.The complaints in the reviews section castigating this film for being short on plot are missing the point. This isn't a carefully-crafted, linear story. This is the addled recollection of a 72-hour drug feast, which the author himself admits he's not sure how much of it actually happened. You shouldn't go into this film looking for a PLOT. Go into it looking for an experience you can't get with any other film.Another group of point-missers are those reviewers who complain about the lack of comedy. You want drug comedy, go see Cheech and Chong. This isn't a comedy. The funny parts in this film are there by accident, set into motion by the brain-fried protagonists' attempts to function in their condition. They journey to the apogee of American excess, Las Vegas, and demonstrate just how crazed we all are - so crazed that two dangerous, insanely-high sociopaths can blend right into the crowd. This is ugly reality, based on a real event. There are no good guys and no bad guys.The movie never apologizes for the main characters' behavior. As viewers, we're not there to try to understand them, just to see the world through their dilated pupils. Maybe the mirror they hold up IS a little warped, but not so much that we can't recognize what we're seeing in it.I read the book before I saw the movie, and I was convinced that there was no way short of Ralph Bakshi animation that it could ever be made into a passable movie - the imagery was just too bizarre. Gilliam, Depp and Del Toro knocked me off my chair with this incredible interpretation.

Otherwise my expectations of this weirdly funny mad story to add up to something would compel me not to take delight in the film, and that's just not the case.I couldn't pay heed to every single aspect of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', since I've caught a flue and feel a bit weaker than usual today. Nevertheless, based on my humble history knowledge, I think the movie has a somewhat satiric attitude towards Richard Nixon's War on Drugs and a kind of 60's nostalgia is to be felt just around the corner. Terry Gilliam's absurdist extravaganza never ceases to entertain me, especially here with those ''Drunken Dutch'' Camera Angles that amplify the comedic effect and the sense of unrighteousness, aided by the hallucinations the characters experience.An 8 out of 10 from me.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
139,ericjg623,"""Dumb & Dumber"" do Vegas 3/10",3,3 December 2001,"This film, based on a book of the same name by Hunter Thompson, is about two complete idiots spending a weekend in Vegas, ostensibly to cover a motorcycle race, but primarily to see just how wasted they can get on just about every mind altering chemical known to mankind. Is there a point to this movie? Other than as an effective anti-drug ""message"" for teenagers, I can't think of any. Admittedly I haven't read the book, so perhaps this tale works better in print than on screen, but I cannot come up with much to recommend about anything in this movie.Is it supposed to be funny? Maybe, but mostly it's just sad, in a moronic sort of way, as we watch these two buffoons, stoned out of their pathetic minds, stumble from location to location, trashing hotel rooms, rental cars, and otherwise making total, obnoxious fools of themselves. It'd be one thing if they were actually having fun, but mostly they seem to alternate between raving paranoia and drooling cluelessness. If you want to see people being funny while on drugs, then the early Cheech & Chong movies are much better, or for that matter, ""Dazed & Confused"" or ""Scary Movie"".
Is it supposed to be a form of social commentary? Possibly, although about the only conclusion to be drawn is that these two bozos are so whacked out as to make even Las Vegas seem normal and wholesome. The Thompson character (AKA Duke) and his lawyer sidekick are simply too stoned to offer up any sort of insights into the Vegas scene, the ONE thing (short of genuine comedy) that would have redeemed this effort.Like I said, about the only value I can see in this movie is to show it to kids, since the message of ""This is your brain on drugs"" comes through much more forcefully than those cheesy old ads with the egg and the frying pan.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Thompson. Unfortunately, unlike the far more enjoyable ""Where the Buffalo Roam"", we are never given any reason for wanting to see him.""Fear and Loathing"" is one of my favorite books. It presents wonderful insight into the absurdities inherent in a society which attempts to simultaneously worship Calvinistic morals, rugged individualism, and self-gratification through mass consumption. In such a world, people from all walks of life converge on Las Vegas to capture a small distorted piece of their American dream. HSTs own small piece is an expense-paid drug-filled weekend in America's capital of instant gratification and over-stimulation. The story itself is structured as a madcap road trip, made hilarious through HSTs understated literary style.The movie, by trying to depict HST and friends with a certain degree of reality, completely abandons this style. What was funny in the book becomes simply disturbing or scary on the screen. Furthermore, the high energy antics of HST  completely overshadows any observations he is making. Any social commentary is completely lost in the noise. And so we get to sit and watch a loud, frantic HST indulge himself with drugs and wonder why in the world we should care.Ironically, the deadpan delivery of the book might have been successfully brought to film if Depp had used one of his stoic stare performances (Dead Man, Gilbert Grape) rather than one of his over-the-top emoting ones (Ed Wood, Cry-Baby). Perhaps HST really does look and sound like Popeye on speed, but it takes more than looking and sounding like someone to actually be them. In this case it's irrelevant because, as described above, the book really has nothing to do with realistically portraying HST.
If you liked the book as much as I did, you will probably want to see this out of curiousity.

145,jmerlino,Very true to the book,9,10 December 2020,"I was a huge fan of the book before this movie was ever made. When I heard it was being made I was a little nervous. Would they ruin one of my favorite books? When I heard Terry Gilliam was at the helm, I knew it was in good hands.I only really have two complaints with the film: 1) some of the CGI acid hallucinations are just a little too cartoony looking, and 2) when I read the book, I'd felt a certain insane glee on the part of Duke and Gonzo. In the film, the glee is gone - just the insanity and the fear remain. That's probably truer to Thompson's intent than my own reading was, but it was a tone that I was not expecting.Apart from that, Gilliam stayed really true to the book. Sure, there's a scene here and there that was added/removed/tweaked, but it's all pretty minor stuff. The vast majority of the book is adapted very faithfully.Hunter Thompson was one of the few writers of the 60s who understood why the hippie movement fell apart. In ""Hell's Angels"" he writes that Ken Kesey, who was on the run from the law at the time, should have ""stayed in Mexico and gotten a job."" We get the ""high water mark"" passage in a voice-over during a flashback. That passage may well be the best thing Thompson ever wrote. It's eloquent and insightful, and makes you wonder how such a perceptive guy could have been so much of a head case. (It's also worth bearing in mind that he was a pretty awful human being. He called his wife on the phone so she could hear him shoot himself. That's vile.)Johnny Depp gives a pretty solid performance as Thompson/Duke, but he runs up against a serious problem: Hunter Thompson in person was a very nervous guy who mumbled and muttered when he spoke. This does not make for great film. Depp wanted to be true to Thompson (having spent time at Thompson's house preparing for the role), but mumbling your way through a movie makes you difficult to watch and understand. He does about as well as he could have done without reinventing Thompson/Duke as someone with completely different mannerisms. He's clearer in the voice-over narration parts.Benicio Del Toro, as Dr. Gonzo, has much the same problem. Throughout the movie, he's usually so wasted that his speech is very slow and slurred. Even when he's approaching sobriety, he's kind of hard to understand. You have to listen closely to catch some of the dialog (unless you're an HST fanatic like me, and already had the dialog memorized).Visually, the film is somewhat restrained. Apart from the hallucination sequences, Gilliam takes a somewhat more naturalistic approach than in some of his other films (say, Time Bandits, or Baron Munchausen). Of course, when the hallucinations do come, you remember why you love Gilliam. And what he does with the hotel room set over the course of the movie is just beautiful in its ever-mounting squalor.In sum, this movie isn't what I wanted it to be, but it's probably closer to what Thompson had in mind when he wrote the book, than my mental version of it .(In my defense, I was like 16 when I first read the book).If I met someone who had neither seen the film nor read the book, I'd probably tell him to read the book first. HST's narrative style is something you kind of have to internalize in order to appreciate the film. (I'd probably also tell him to read ""Hells Angels"" and ""The Curse of Lono"")A previous attempt at adapting Fear and Loathing gave us ""Where the Buffalo Roam"" which was kind of funny, but it was more Bill Murray than HST. This film is far superior, and definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the book.Keep your head on a swivel. This is bat country, after all.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
146,MetalAngel,Take a frenzied/drugged-out ride through an EXCELLENT comedy!,10,20 August 2009,"I'm writing this review fresh off seeing the film. I can't risk writing it in a couple of hours or, God forbid, tomorrow lest the insanely intense emotion it has effected upon me should fade away. Terry Gilliam has mastered a profoundly affecting film which slowly starts gathering your senses from the beginning and has, by the end, exploded them in a hilariously shocking array of images and feelings unlike any modern film will expound on you.The film begins with a reporter (Johnny Depp) and his sidekick attorney (Benicio Del Toro) who are heading out to Vegas for a sports news coverage, and have decided to make this trip the ultimate drug-addled adventure. Armed with a suitcase filled with every kind of dangerous and illegal narcotic known to mankind and a crazy drug-induced scheme, we follow their misadventures through Vegas and their chance encounters with a cast of outrageous characters that will make you laugh your head off. J. Hoberman from the Village Voice calls this film ""excruciatingly funny"", and I couldn't agree more. It so funny it hurts.It is based on Hunter S. Thompson's famous novel, and even though I haven't read the book, I have to admit that the film portrays a drugged-out experience unlike any other drug-based film I've ever seen. Every thing in the movie, from the surreal and twisted photography, to the wildly insane production design, to the crazy wardrobe, to the inciting music to the spot-on performances from the two principal actors will transport you into the outrageous plot and will make you feel as if you are just as drugged-out as the main characters even if you haven't tried a single narcotic in your entire life! Unlike other crazy comedies which are as fictitious and improbable that can't be believed, this film's funny twists and turns are astoundingly believable, and unlike other drug-based comedies which simply seek to make you laugh and have you learn nothing out of the experience, this one aims to share some life knowledge with the viewer and lingers with you as you ponder each and every of the situations it presents. It doesn't take itself too seriously or too slightly, resulting in a literally perfect balance between entertainment value and artistic expression.Have I mentioned it's extremely funny? It's got that rare gift few films have nowadays: you'll want to watch it again.It may not be the best film of the year, nor the funniest, nor the most artistic, nor the most transcendental one...but I can assure you, it's definitely one you won't want to miss.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
147,ks4,"Weird, absurd and very twisted.",5,7 May 2004,"Fear And Loathing In Las VegasRaoul Duke and his attorney, Dr Gonzo is heading for Las Vegas to cover a desert race, their car is packed with drugs and their only intention is to get as drugged up as possible while their company is paying for their press coverage of the race. From here the movie follows their rampage in Las Vegas.Well, this is one of the most crazy and pointless movies i have ever experienced. To be quite honest the movie is actually very well constructed, Terry Gilian uses the camera very well in symbolizing the situation using crooked camera angles and a good amount of color impressions, however this can't save the movie from having no depth at all, all it simply does is giving a shallow description of drug abuse, it doesn't go into any deep moralizing questions about it, it doesn't bring any discussions up, it just describes and portrays, something that at first seems ok. But as the movie passes on it feels like everything is repeating itself, the same thing happens in a different way, it's pretty much the same, nothing that makes us think happens, and then it ends. The movie is simply too hollow and empty for being a great movie, all it describes it madness, pure madness, and the effect and possible feeling of drug abuse.I guess this has become a cult movie because of the madness it describes, in a very wild and obscure way, but towards that i can only say, cult movies does often divide the audience, and this time i got stuck on the negative side. Because this madness it describes so pointless just doesn't get to me, actually i found myself rather bored at times and especially towards the ending waiting for it just too end, i hated how the movie avoided all possible moral questions. Just as you thought it was gonna go in the depth with something, it turned around and walked out of it, something that for me made the movie feel very pointless and empty.What saves this movie is the great directing, and especially the amazing performances given by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. I can't even begin to imagine what kind of skill it have taken to play these two odd balls in this movie, this movie really shows how talented they REALLY are, if the acting had been awful in this movie, it would have been a completely useless movie, but somehow this does manage to squeeze in a few enjoyable scenes in a movie that pretty much makes no sense.To sum it all up, a crazy and absurd movie. However it's just too empty, the description of the state of being drugged is well done, but the movie avoids too many things and focuses only on a portrait of being drugged, it's a crazy movie, that some will like, and others will disllike, i disliked it. But it's worth checking out Del Toro and Depp showing off their talents.5/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

149,Asentiff2004,This is bat country,7,26 January 2014,"An oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer travel to Las Vegas, with a car full of drugs, alcohol and the pursuit of the American Dream. A psychedelic trip into the macabre, a chaotic spiral into madness. These terms perfectly describe Hunter S. Thompson's novel describing his drug fueled trip of the west. Depp does a perfect rendition of Thompson and truly is a marvel to watch in this film. In his rendition it is easy to see how Depp has become one of this generations finest actors. This film for the casual viewer may be difficult to follow and or watch, but to me personally is a fantastic film one in which does what it was intended to do, and that is to entertain and to darkly and at times humorously take the viewer on a chaotic ride. With a huge cult following and an eventual prequel that came out; Rum Diaries, this is a wonderful peek into the world of the not so normal and the drug fueled ride that is Hunter S. Thompson's life. The soundtrack is perfect for this film as it follows suit with the chaos that is viewed on the screen. I highly recommend this film to film buffs and lovers of dark comedies.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
150,aqua_swing,One of those movies you can't watch straight,8,1 May 2001,"Just like when you watched Wizard of Oz in mute along with Pink Floyd's ""Dark side of the moon"", Fear & Loathing is one of those movies that you have to at least live part of the lifestyle to get through it. I saw it the first time and fell asleep right around the middle, after they got out of the hotel (the incident with throwing the tape recorder into the bathtub), but it was only temporary.On second viewing (and after reading the book about 3 more times), I was in a state of mind that wasn't quite right. Lying in the basement of a friend's house at 4am with the carpet soaked from the leaking house, drugs, booze, just DIRTY. And then, the whole movie made sense.It is a great film. But it is also a great book. Some parts of the movie take things from the end of the book and mash them right in the middle, which ends up working okay.It's a good movie, just make sure you're in the right state of mind.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
151,Baldrick44,A truly unique movie,9,20 January 2006,"It's not often a movie can make you feel so many different emotions for tow characters and their situation. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, however is one movie. Before long I found myself being scared, angered, saddened, laughing with, and even empathising with Raoul Drake and his 'attorney'.The first thing that should be stressed here is that this is not a movie with a plot, more it's a movie with a theme ( or a couple of themes to be exact ). As Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro tear up the landscape in their drug addled haze there's no point in looking for a twist in the story or a 'rooftop scene'. Instead, this movie looks at a side of America that festers under all the happy goodwill of the American dream and Las Vegas, with its casinos and pokies, stand for everything that is wrong with it.Del Toro is great as the sidekick Dr Gonzo, giving a dark brooding menace and sliding from one extreme to the other while Depp is simply perfect as the paranoid and cynical Duke.This isn't a pro-drugs movie, rather it's a movie about a group of people who were once full of hope and energy at the height of the 60s only to find now that the energy has been sapped from them. I actually found myself being reminded a little bit of Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' as it seemed to sum it up- all they had left of the LSD protest culture now was...the LSD.This is a movie that without a true plot and without a true sense of story still manages to hit you like nothing else.

152,MyOpinionIsFact,"Awful, awful trash!",1,13 December 2003,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a terrible movie. It has no redeeming qualities. Only a loser could identify with anything in this movie. Ha, ha, screwing your brain up on drugs is *so* funny! If some day any of my kids try to use drugs, my punishment will be forcing them to watch this movie 10x in a row. It is kind of ironic that a movie by druggies and for druggies is the best argument against the use of drugs (too bad this wasn't intentional because then the movie would at least contain a message). Depp and Toro are both considered two of Hollywood's sexiest men these days, I don't think that would hold up if more women saw this movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
153,cormac_zoso,Unbelievable ... should have been impossible but ...,10,7 May 2013,"This film is based on the immortal Hunter S. Thompson novel ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" which would set the standard for the weird and wild literature many tried to write once inspired by it but failed wearily in most cases and only narrowly approached in a small few. This is one of the five best novels of last 30 years of the 20th century ... and one of the ten best of said century. This I know is subjective and many might object but for pure outright creativity, beautiful and hilarious and frightening prose, and many messages few are likely to ever forget, then it just doesn't get much better than this. And perhaps Thompson never got better than this ... there are several that are close but few that are the runaway stagecoach the novel is.But making this into a movie? I don't think anyone who ever read the book considered it the most remote of possibilities ... indeed, many, like myself, didn't want to see someone attempt a movie of it since how could you capture so much of the hallucinatory nature of the novel, the bad craziness, and the wonderful goings-on inside the head of the Good Doctor and Founder of Gonzo Journalism? It seemed impossible.But as the years went by and computer generated special effects became something most enterprising geeks could do rather well in the basement of their parent's home, it seemed as if it might actually happen.And when it was announced and the key players were listed, unlike most movie announcements of favorite novels becoming movies, I was quite heartened by the names.Terry Gilliam as director -- anyone who could make ""Brazil"", even in the studio castrated version, ""Time Bandits"" a hallucinatory journey if there ever was one, ""Fisher King"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" as well (not to mention the oddly-hilarious little animations he made for the Monty Python series way back when) well I thought if anyone could, he could.Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson -- I was worried about his looks frankly ... I mean, seriously, this guy is just too good looking to play Thompson, someone who once wrote that a photo of the ten best writers in America could also double as a photo of the ten ugliest men in America, was not a matinée idol to say the least ... but after living in Thompson's basement for six months, capturing every nuance of Thompson's persona and combining that with a bald 'toupee', well he had the character down, the funny odd duck walk brought on by a bit too much of everything at hand as well as the syrupy melodic voice ... outstanding in the end and one of his best roles among many great roles.Benicio Del Toro -- well can't say I knew much about this actor prior to this movie other than the ensemble piece, ""Usual Suspects"", a movie I was not nearly as impressed with as most others were ... but he put his heart into this role packing on 40 or 50 lbs it looks like considering the gut he readily shows as Thompson's Somonan attorney.And the many others who show up for brief but important parts: Ellen Barkin as the worn out waitress (yet somehow sexy); Gary Busey as the highway patrolman who has to make the extra effort to pull Hunter over as he explains the correct way to get out of a ticket (one of my favorite dialogs); Penn Jillette who is a barker at the Circus casino and he does it to perfection including once he ascertains that Hunter and his attorney are not interested is what he's pitching literally pushes them along and attacks the next rubes coming his way (having spent many years at the local county fair I can attest to his accurate portrayal); Harry Dean Stanton as the heartless judge, very small but he makes an impression; Cameron Diaz as the hapless documentarian in the elevator and her smile always brightens a scene I must say; Christopher Meloni taking a complete about face from my wife's favorite detective show cop to the gay desk clerk having to deal with an irate crew-cut, love-it-or-leave-it cop and Hunter's perfect assessment of the scene in beautifully delivered lines by Meloni; Christina Ricci as the whacked-out bible freak whose brain has been permanently pureed by various substances given her by Hunter's attorney; Debbie Reyolds actual voice singing when the two last only a very short time at her performance (Depp himself called Reynolds telling her she had to do the voice herself and apparently he was charming enough to get her to do the gig); and there are others but this is getting to be quite a list ... except for one last mention that the actual Red Shark, the fire-engine red Chevy Impala is the actual Red Shark they took to Vegas and Thompson owned til the end ... still in beautiful shape ... and for those of us who have owned an early '70s Impala, I'd wager that we'd all give quite a bit to have it back ... that was a great car ... of course, it had to have the big block 350 four barrel ... the old saying was true of that car: ""If it had wings ..."" So rambling as always, read the book, watch the movie ... take the ticket, ride the ride ... a perfect soundtrack also accompanies the wild ride through this two-hour wonderful romp of the good ol' days when drugs were handy and you could just look at someone and know they were one of us ...Just always remember: ""You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye.""

The narrative is hopelessly tangled, and every scene seems to be an attempt to outdo the previous one in over the top visuals and manic behaviour. Even the CGI seems predictable (though I admit it is well used). Benicio del Toro is almost entirely unintelligible, and you'll miss most of the other performances if you blink. Only Depp's performance was plausible enough to be enjoyable. But after two hours of sniffing, swearing, falling over, staring crazily into space, gibbering, spitting and passing out (and that was just the audience - joke), I'd had enough.

156,randreww,Another Bad Trip movie,3,4 December 2017,"The first 5 minutes of this film is pure genius. I must give credit where it is due. You realise very early on that the setting, the costumes, the wide angle lens capturing the dessert, & the uncanny dialogue compressed with tape distortion & 60's EQ is all so contrasted that it sails to hilarity. And that is drugs in a coconut shell.. it's funny. This film isn't. In all my years of watching film & TV, I have never yet seen Drugs portrayed honestly. I don't know what the deal is, but everyone has a really mediocre & cliché opinion of drugs affects on the mind. In reality, you don't have people being chased home by a party of mars bars. Instead, you feel relevant to your surroundings. So much so that it is easy to become paranoid, yes. But it never takes over as long as you have trust & communication. It is similar to experiencing the format of your childhood without the nostalgia. Everything feels new once more. It is both enlightening & cleansing. Almost spiritual, as felicity ramifies freely. And all the bullshit of the world's economic greed are left to destroy themselves with risk & hope. Where as in movies.. people just act like total raving loonies. Stumbling all over the place, & embarrassing everyone around them awkwardly until the director demands the wavering plot to return to drama & jokes based upon what people have already seen & accepted. Instead of the careful pace & dosage made by men & women who's metacognition is in perfect check, so that they may better themselves by exploring the countryside, whilst familiarising themselves with how time can slow down to a steady tick, in order to take note of every beautiful detail in a heightened punctilious manner... Instead, you have near invincible sebaceous men deploring decorum & forswearing moral alacrity as though their inner sanctum is filled with ever spurning antipathy. And the reckless craving to disturb everyone around them. Well, this film is one of those films where the noises in your own head become louder than the dialogue in the film. ""Drugs are BAD. Yes. We get it"". I fail to see how yet another typical film with this dull & tired message has anything fresh to contribute? How about a film that says ""Drugs are good""? Now wouldn't that be a controversy? Avoid this film. Unless you think drugs are cool.

158,Lt_Coffey_182,Gilliam's imagination ensures an acid trip for anyone watching,8,10 November 2005,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is possibly one of Terry Gilliam's best films, yet also one of his most underrated. The main reason for this is the over excessive nature of the film and the fact that it is highly unpalatable for average cinema audiences. What a lot of people don't understand, is that this film is not glorifying drugs in anyway and audiences appeared to ignore the main characters' unpleasant and embarrassing experiences throughout the film.The offbeat character of Raoul Duke could only be played by Johnny Depp. Depp's perfection at playing peculiar, awkward characters is what gives Fear and Loathing its heart and its incredibly funny sense of dark humour. The movements with his body are fantastic to watch and greatly compliment the surreal imagery of the film. The way he delivers his lines with such paranoid, sometimes schizophrenic, tones makes his character totally believable. This can not be said, however, of Benicio Del Torro as he acts more like a caricature but this does illustrate the effects of particular drugs suitably. Overweight, ugly and riotous, his character is utterly repulsive and demonstrates the dark side of drugs very powerfully.It is not Depp's great performance that makes this film so great, it is Terry Gilliam's surreal vision and speciality for the bizarre that gives Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas the edge. Gilliam does an awesome job at making the audience see the world through the eyes of drug abusers. The camera motions, the colouring and the hallucination effects enable the audience to be on the same trip without touching a single drug. Terry Gilliam was a perfect choice to direct this film as he is such an experimental, artistic director.The 60s/70s soundtrack is a terrific accompaniment to Fear and Loathing as it encapsulates the mood of the period perfectly. The psychedelic sounds match what is seen on picture to further enhance attack on the audience's senses. Depp's conclusive narrative at the end of the film is very introspective and does really well to bring the film to a more serious front and show that drugs isn't all fun and games and voiced the opinions of many people from the same generation.With great imagination and Depp on top form, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wonderfully different, enjoyable film that puts the audience on a trip they'll never forget.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

At some point the audience must wonder when the money (and luck) runs out, someone dies, an overdose, an accident, or any number of things you see in a drug movie are going to inevitably occur. Terry Gillam turns this on its head and sends us on a gonzo ride through Las Vegas in the height of 70s drug culture. Keep an eye out for the cameos.Johnny Depp is unrecognizable in this film as a fictionalized insert of Gonzo journalism creator Hunter Thompson, and Benecio Del Toro is equally as oddball and distorted as the sidekick, the lawyer Dr. Gonzo.

It was originally published as a two-part article in Rolling Stone magazine, at which time it was described to me in detail by my attorney. I saw the film again last night on TV, on one of the ""Starz"" cable channels. It reminded me of my attorney's words, and of how right his advice was. Having read Thompson's story BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE, this film was and is A SCREAM!!! Director Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python fame - he made all the truly silly transitional animation for the ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" TV show, and was the only man of American heritage involved in the otherwise British comedy troupe). Gilliam Directed the Python films ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", and ""Life of Brian"", co-Directed with Terry Jones. Gilliam also Directed a number of delightful movies for George Harrison's production Company, Handmade Films, including ""Time Bandits"" and the somewhat fanciful and effects-laden ""The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen. ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas"" is remarkably faithful to Thompson's writing in a way few other film adaptations of published written works have ever been, so if you think the movie's weird and have not read Thompson's book, you really should. Thompson was the inventor of what he called ""Gonzo Journalism"", and the articles he wrote for Rolling Stone are prime examples of it, especially THIS STORY!

164,jerome_horwitz,A reprisal of the American dream,10,27 November 2005,"This is a thinking man's story. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (FLLV) is based on a short novel by Hunter S. Thompson. If you're reading this, I hope you've probably already watched the movie, and/or read the book, and are at least vaguely familiar with the story.But what is the story? What is all this madness about? Did these events actually occur? That's the questions I hope you find yourself asking at this point. I've considered this story to be many things for the past year, since my first viewing of the movie to reading the book and more. I finally understand why this story was ever made.Hunter Thompson is well known to his fans and is vaguely popular in general as a journalist. His focus primarily political, even up to his final years.FLLV is about the search for the American dream. But how do excessive abuse of drugs fit into this picture? How does destroying two hotel rooms and two cars add up in this story? Why is excessively loud music in such demand? In what way does pack ratting excessive amounts of food and supplies from the hotel account in this crazy story? It seems to be Hunter's opinion of the American dream is only one thing: wretched excess. We are flooded with this in the story. Even the verbiage is excessive! Hunter Thompson is a true genius, if for no other reason that he could consider a story on so many excessive levels! Drug abuse isn't the theme of this movie. No, instead it seems to be that excessive drug use is the only way Thompson could ever imagine himself truly embracing the wretched excess that is the American dream. It would take a lot to twist someone sensible into accepting that Las Vegas represents everything that American's, or human beings for that matter, want in life.Las Vegas could easily be considered the epicenter of this excess. It's the perfect place for excess. People can excessively gamble and enjoy it, and the casino operators can smile excessively while their collecting all those lost bets! The question is, who own's the American dream? Gambling represents something very special in this story. It's a metaphor for those who live in futility trying to ""win big"". Does it really matter if you're considering odds at the craps table, lottery, stock market, or illegal drug trade? It's still a huge gamble any way it goes. Blowing your paychecks or life savings gambling, is that the American dream? ""No no, calm down, learn to enjoy losing."" But just as in real life corporate America is running everything. Or are they? Perhaps they're only enablers of our wretched excess, simply their to help themselves as they watch us live piggish? This is why Thompson wrote ""the wave speech"" in regards to Las Vegas. If there's any place in the world that represents corporate control and propaganda, it's Las Vegas. I hope that what I've written here is somewhat accurate. One thing's for sure, this edited review is much more meaningful than the tripe I had posted before.

Everything looks like a parody. That was the very first blow, trying to picture early 70s Vegas in 1997??? It could be more fun for the audience and less money out of producer's pocket to just set the movie at present time even though its based on true story but who cares? who knows those REAL guys? Cut this period crap and leave the old image for Rat Pack, that's my advise. Now to the main point, screenplay! Awful! Nothing is in its place. We have 2 supposed to be heroes who are disgusting, not funny and no one sympathize with them. They have no goal. came to Vegas to cover a race but started to wander around for their own sake, so what? If it was not a parody quality period movies, with a well written screenplay it could have been a trendy Vegas guide-movie like Hangover and then a classic on enjoying Vegas in 1998 but what we ended up with was pure boring nonsense. I was a torture to watch this movie, I barely stayed awake to watch it till the end although it was too obvious by end of first hours that nothing special would happen.

168,Teebs2,One bad trip....,6,5 January 2006,"""He who makes a beast of himself, gets rid of the pain of being a man"" is the opening quote of Terry Gilliam's film based on the writings of Hunter S. Thompson. As I'm not familiar with Thompson, I approached this film on it's minor cult status, along with a strong cast and director.The plot, what there is of it anyway, revolves around Duke (Depp) and Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro) as they embark on a drug fuelled road trip to Vegas, to cover a desert bike race. Gilliam brings his strong, expressionistic visual style to the film, turning Duke and Gonzo's drug fuelled experiences into a subjective nightmare. From surreal scenes involving giant lizards, to a grotesque circus-themed casino and totally debauched hotel rooms, the film is one long, bad trip - too long in fact. Gilliams usually distinctive and very personal visual style feels a bit restricted, perhaps attributable to sticking to Hunter's vision, rather than his own.Depp provides some hilarious moments as he stumbles, bow legged and muttering incoherently from one weird incident to another. Del Toro gives Gonzo a more dangerous, even psychotic, character. This culminates in the film's most ""realistic scene"" - the terrorising of a waitress which exposes, and brings consequence to, both of the characters chemically fuelled immorality.Unfortunately, the film is successful only on a superficial level. There are hints at the importance of broader 1970s American culture, notably the Vietnam war and the death of the 60s ""flower power"" counterculture. It is only when considering the film on it's opening quote that the film's pointlessness and immorality takes any meaning. After a period of great optimism in American history through the 1960s, all was shattered by the 70s, leaving an empty and uncertain future - it seems for some the only refuge was to leave a painful reality via chemicals and become immoral beasts - only perhaps this route brought nightmares infinitely more disturbing.For all the film's visual style and hyperactive performances, I found it ultimately unsatisfying - not just through lack of plot - but also because I couldn't help but feel that the film may have had more depth, and arguably been more disturbing, had the social context which formed this American nightmare, been explored further. It does however, make me interested to read some of Hunter S. Thompson's work, just to experience such a mad vision in literary form. 6/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
169,bean-d,Awful. Just Awful.,1,25 May 2011,"Terry Gilliam's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (1998) is one of those rare movies--oh, how rare indeed!--that I turned off without finishing. I'm amazed at how unfunny, unenergetic, and unimaginative this movie is, considering that it comes from the director of such bizarre fare as ""Time Bandits"" (1981), ""The Fisher King"" (1991), and ""12 Monkeys"" (1995). If there is anything that can be said about Gilliam, it is that he rarely lacks imagination. But the movie is simply boring. Boring! A movie about two men on a drug binge is boring! And lifeless too. I simply had no energy to care about Johnny Depp's character. Heck, I would have been glad to have even been annoyed! The film was literally a collection of images running in front of my eyes that I could not care less about. Abysmal. For those who love the film, I honestly do not know what you see therein.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
170,ashi-lance,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998),8,9 February 2013,"ONE LINE REVIEW:The movie is a good example of Johnny Depp's own defined genre – bizarre, strange, full of mystery and might seem pointless at times but in the end it is all entertainment and about wild side of life & more or less about those rare beings that do exist around us.""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a twisted, outlandish venture into the mind of a warped junkie, a reporter who is traveling to Nevada in order to cover a Hells Angels motorcycle race, along with his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro, who gained forty pounds for his role). ""We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold,"" is the line that opens the movie in an expeditious manner, as a red convertible roars from right to left, in the direction of the movie. The vehicle's trunk is packed with an abundance of deadly drugs. ""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers. Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, two dozen amyls."" The narrator of the story is Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), a balding, stumbling shell of a man, constantly smoking or inhaling drugs, his body overloaded with deadly substances. He is in a permanent daze throughout the entire film, constantly consuming drugs every time the camera pans onto him. He is also the reporter, the main character of the film, and he is in such a daze that after the motorcycle race is over, he's not even sure who has won. The movie is based on the semi-autobiographical memoirs of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, who traveled to Las Vegas in 1971 with an overweight ""Samoan lawyer"" named Oscar Zeta Acosta. Many claim that ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" glamorizes drugs. If anything, it demonizes them (sometimes quite literally), and the constant drug use is merely present to account for the duo's wacky behavior. I personally feel ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a harmless film. Under the wrong circumstances, it could be misunderstood, which is why it was nearly slapped with an X-rating by MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America). Depp is the reason the film's narration succeeds as well as it does -- a lesser actor might come across as annoying. Depp seems to be channeling the physical freedom of Steve Martin and the slurred speech patterns of Thompson himself -- although he was given ample time to pick up on Thompson's mannerisms, since they spent much time together prior to shooting and throughout the filming process.MY RATING- 8/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
171,Syrchek,Hard to classify,7,22 May 2005,"This film seems a bit hard to classify. Personally I enjoy provocative, uncommon or controversial if you will kind of films. This is definitely one of them. The film is based on a novel (wich I have not read) written by Hunter S. Thompson. OK that fact isn't really important to me but I've read in other comments that it's a very actual depiction of the book and that it's better to read the book first before seeing the film.I thought the performances especially by Depp were good. Raoul Duke/Hunter S. Thompson seemed like a very odd character. The same or worse could be said about Dr. Gonzo/Oscar Z. Acosta played by Del Toro. The funny thing about these characters is that about 90% of the film we see them behave in extremely thoughtless, irresponsible and immoral ways. But on the other hand we get an assumption that there is this careful, conscious or even responsible side of the characters (well at least for Depp).At the end we don't know why the characters behave the way they do. Maybe it's to show the double morality of the modern world. On one hand Raoul Duke is a doctor of journalism on the other hand he is absolutely thoughtless and irresponsible some would even say a criminal.The thing that bothered me about this film that there isn't a red line or an obvious message and not even a plot. It seems hard to classify because on one hand we have good acting, interesting monologues by Depp, good direction but on the other hand the film seems like a bit of a mess because of all the various events that are taking place and that don't seem to make a lot of sense........ +3/5 (I guess)",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
172,Aphex97,Finding reality in the chaos of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,7,13 May 2001,"I didn't enjoy Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas that much...Well...wait maybe I should start with what I did like about the movie. For example, Duke's (the main character expertly played by Johnny Depp) narration is at times completely hysterical and almost always clever. As usual Johnny Depp plays his role with great depth and sincerity, he is truly a great American actor. Del Toro also gives a great performance. I liked the actors and I think the movie is very clever in several respects (e.g. how it presents several different views on reality).Having said that, one might think I enjoyed the movie but...First, The plot was minimal; two men trying to deal with reality while on a drug bender. This is not a particularly strong or compelling plot and can only be shown in one movie from so many different angles before it starts to feel redundant. I think this whole movie could have been shorted to 30 minutes without sacrificing the main points or deeper messages. The last hour 1/2 or so is completely redundant; watching 2 guys get really high in one hotel is not to much different from watching 2 guys get really high in some other hotel. Despite flashy direction by Terry Gilliam, I still felt it was a completely directionless experience. Certain parts are very entertaining in a comedic sense (e.g. The ""Reefer Madness"" video showed at the Police convention), but the film often (more often than not) seemed boring to me. It seemed like it was trying to entertain me by shocking me with drug reactions rather than provide a good story for me to be interested in. I was not shocked by Del Toro or Depp's reaction to the mass quantities of drugs they consumed nor did I find their reactions particularly amusing. Since their reaction was supposed to be the entertainment, I was left feeling mighty bored during most of the drug crazed hotel scenes.FINAL RATING: 7/10 I give it a decent rating because the narration is most often very clever and there are some good deeper messages about drugs, reality and perception in the movie. Good job by Terry Gilliam and all actors.  However, good direction and good acting can't make up for a weak plot drawn out past its abilities to be entertaining, annoying and boring redundancy, and the overall depressing hopelessness ever present in the cinematic mayhem that is Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

173,DylansFearFiles,Comedy Masterpiece,9,27 May 2009,"Hunter S. Thompson (RIP) was one of the greatest journalists in the United States. He worked for the Rolling Stone and is highly revered. His most famous work was written in 1971 called ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey Into the Heart of the American Dream"" (originally published in the magazine), which told the story of journalist Raoul Duke (fictionalized version of Hunter Thompson) and his Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo (really the Chicano attorney, Oscar Zeta Acosta) who cover the Mint 400 while experimenting with a large amount of psychedelic drugs.After suffering a large amount of failures trying to adapt this great novel into a feature film by such great filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese. The duo was played once by Peter Boyle and Bill Murray in the 1980 film ""Where the Buffalo Roam"", which was heavily panned by critics. Academy Award winners Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson were also once considered to play Gonzo and Duke, but we got two very good actors with very good chemistry in this final and successful attempt to bring the wild world of Hunter S. Thompson to life.Johnny Depp (who is the spitting image of Thompson when bald and wearing the sunglasses) is Raoul Duke. Benicio del Toro is the psychopathic lawyer, Dr. Gonzo. The two begin to plan for a 3-day trip to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 race. The two bring almost every drug you can name with some booze, all in a suitcase in the trunk of the infamous Great Red Shark convertible. While in Las Vegas, the two friends take a hilarious journey into Hell while on their trip, from torturing the help to terrorizing the citizens.This movie, is a masterpiece which totally captures the vision of Hunter S. Thompson. The novel, is probably also one of the best and funniest books written to date. The film is very faithful in the portrayals of the characters and the recreations of the scenes. All in all, Johnny Depp, Benecio del Toro and Terry Gilliam made one heck of a movie which will leave you laughing for a long time. Classic film.10/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
174,MundaneNoodle,completely underrated,9,4 October 1999,"This movie closely follows Hunter S. Thompson unforgettable classic. It is a Terry Gilliam masterpiece, second only to 12 Monkeys. This is NOT your typical movie. It shows the hedonistic drug habits of a famous writer ""Duke"" (see Doonsebury comic) played by Johnny Depp and his half-samoan lawyer Dr. Gonzo, played by a ferociously talented Benicio Del Toro.The two set off on a journey to find ""The American Dream"", whatever it may be. Much to their chagrin, they find it in Las Vegas. Most of the movie consists of the two abusing various hard drugs, including human adrenalin from a bottle. There are some very deep commentaries and reflections of the 60's and the failure of the hippie generation. The movie spirals down from funny to scary to depressing, as the two get further and further strung out on drugs. It also takes a vicious stab at the authority ""zero-tolerance"" attitude. Thompson and Gilliam do a remarkable job of making the policemen and narcos look as unappealing and as hedonistic as the two protaganists. The movie is dotted with Gilliam's trademark weirdness and symbolism. It is beautifully filmed, and much attention to detail. It is true art, and not to be missed.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
175,cottrellpj,Adapting the Unadaptable for Screen,8,27 December 1999,"Terry Gilliam and Johnny Depp do a very good job adapting the seminal (ha ha) 70's counterculture book by Hunter Thompson.

The colours and camerawork always end up making me feel queasy about 3/4 of the way through (10 or 15 minutes could have easily been cut).",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
176,jackharding89-1,Acid House...,8,1 August 2008,"""He who makes a beast of himself,"" reads the opening line of Hunter S. Thompson's offbeat cult novel ""gets rid of the pain of being a man."" Words spoken from experience, perhaps, but what to make of this? Well- judged ideology? Homespun philosophy? Complete and utter boll**ks? Call it what you want. All that matters, here, is that it's a relevant and telling preamble to the outrageous and loyal film adaptation of one of modern literature's most controversial texts.Despite plans to translate Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas from print to screen some 40 years back (with the likes of Scorsese, Akroyd and Belushi supposedly keen to chip in), it wasn't until the unsung success of Bruce Robinson's Withnail and I (1987) that anything had come close to capturing the spirit, motifs and sheer mayhem of Thompson's semi-true tale: two blokes, a fcuk load of drink, drugs, a twisted journey and a bittersweet sense of cynicism as the swinging sixties dispersed into nothing more than memory.While Withnail and I didn't fare too well at the box-office, it grew an avid cult following and in the early 1990's, Hollywood producer Stephen Nemeth revived plans to bring Fear and Loathing to the big-screen.Directed, fittingly, by ex-Python Terry Gilliam, Fear and Loathing is a vicious, semi-surreal assault on not only everything in correspondence to tee-total nobility and the American way, but on all things currently bathing in the mainstream of contemporary cinema. Canted camera angles, out of sync dialogue, dreamlike imagery, senseless plot development, fast-cutting and slow-moing to the max'- the film, like the novel, is outrageously droll and wildly entertaining in its take on jangled reality and western capitalism.The acidic verve and eccentricity kicking in from the off: a monochrome montage of anti-Vietnam war protests followed by an abrupt wipe cut of a red convertible hurtling along a desert highway to the sound of Big Brother and the Holding Company's Combination of the Two. It's 1971 and Hunter S. Thompson aka Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) is driving to Las Vegas with his attorney, the Samoan (Benicio Del Toro), in a warped pursuit of the proverbial American Dream. Decked out in Acapulco shirts and Aviators while twisted on a variety of drugs with an arsenal of uppers, downers and every which wayers locked and loaded in the trunk, the two doctors of journalism dive head-first into the depths of a mind-blending drug binge. Sin city, though, is no place for psychedelic drugs and what started out as a business trip put up by headquarters, descends into in a perilous frenzy and delegation to shed light on the dark side of the acid culture and the crumbling American dream. Fear and Loathing is a jittery, unpredictable film that shifts between sublimely executed set-plays and bizarre imagery. Like Thompson's original tale, the film portrays the seventies as the failure of the sixties and achieves a balance between the two main adjectives all directors and authors care about: ""unique"" and ""brilliant"". Here, Gilliam has a freehold on both of them. As does the ever-impressing chameleon of modern performing - Johnny Depp - who vanishes into a character of great absurdity (""look, there's two women fcuking a polar bear"") yet great insight (""you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture."") Depp, who spent considerable time with Thompson in preparation for the role, succeeds in bringing the raw charisma, peculiarities and estranged physical and vocal gestures of the renegade writer to life.Del Toro's performance as the odd Samoan counteracts that of Depp's well. The chemistry between the two makes for some compulsive, Withnail and I-esque viewing. Where Thompson gets lyrical in his trips, the Samoan gets paranoid and violent. On top of threatening a photographer with a razor-sharp hunting knife, the foreign attorney proceeds to terrorize random pedestrians, threatening castration on numerous occasions and demanding Duke electrocute him in the tub to the sound of his favourite tune. A request that goes side-splittingly wrong.Like Duke's concerns early-on regarding his and the Samoan's handling of the drug binge, the film struggles to ""maintain"" in the final third. It borders what could be defined as laziness; Duke gets another writing assignment, another car, another hotel room, another batch of pills and booze. The second half of the tale runs almost parallel to the first which could be viewed as a manifestation of the zany, drug-fuelled antics or, perhaps, as a figurative reload that's reminiscent of peoples' views at the time regarding current affairs; externally, things may change (as in the reshuffling of Nixon's cabinet), but on the inside, things remained the same (the Vietnam war raged on).In its entirety, though, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas shouldn't be written-off as a mindless drug-culture fable-cum-road movie. Much like the book itself, Terry Gilliam's adaptation is an atypical creation that won't, by any means, appeal to all. Or many. But it is a cult classic in it's own right; a riotously funny film on the surface and a deadly serious one at heart. Perhaps too weird to love but far too rare to hate.

177,nelsonhodgie,Point no point,5,27 August 2020,Depp and Del Toro either took too many drugs to prepare for these roles or not enough. They never appear as more than two actors acting like they're high rather than really tripping. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda did a much better job in Easy Rider. Hopper also used effective images to convey narcotic induced experiences much better than Gilliam does. Gilliam relies on CGIing everything to death and the result is disappointing.

Depp is perfect for this role and narrates it very well. What makes this film stand out from other films is the humour and the fact that we get to see what they are seeing and hearing whilst high. One memorable scene is when Depp sees everyone as Reptiles in the hotel bar. It is hilarious and later on in the film we see Depp with a Lizard tail attached to him.At times the movie is sick and twisted like when Depp is talking about Police doing an under age girl and also the mess these two characters leave behind is quite disgusting.The director made good use of the camera and lighting and has crafted a film so strange and so bizarre that you have to see it to understand how brilliant it is.

There is very little material that is missing.  Most of the dialogue has remained more or less intact.  Secondly, Gilliam has a great eye for set design.  The visuals are stunning and truly capture Las Vegas as seen through the eyes of HST.  Thirdly, the acting is simply sublime.  Dep has the Thompson manerisms down to such a high degree, you have to keep reminding yourself that it's not actually HST up there on the screen.  Dep and Thompson formed a friendship during the production of this movie and if you look at Dep's more recent films, you can see the influence that Thompson imparted in his friend.

To his credit, Gilliam does a very good job, serving up a completely off-the-wall affair which compliments the spaced-out goings-on of Hunter S. Thompson's source novel very well indeed. Gilliam takes a novel widely considered unfilmable and translates it very cleverly to the screen. I would love to know what the late Hunter S. thought of this movie.America's favourite actor, the wonderful Johnny Depp, is splendidly wacky as dope fiend extraordinaire Raoul Duke. His partner-in-crime is the loathsome Dr Gonzo, portrayed by Benicio Del Toro. These two actors bounce off each other extremely well and spend the whole film pushing each other towards more and more manic mischief.A writer for Rolling Stone magazine, Duke is assigned to cover the Mint 500 motorcycle race in Las Vegas, Nevada. So he teams up with his attorney, the aforementioned Dr Gonzo, they pile into the 'Red Shark' - a gorgeous cherry red 1971 Chevy Impala convertible - and head for the bright lights of Vegas. In the trunk they have stashed a suitcase which contains a veritable cornucopia of mind-altering substances, which they partake of with wild abandon. Pretty soon they are hallucinating and spiralling wildly out of control. Vegas - with its bright lights and non-stop party atmosphere - is the perfect place for this drug-addled pair, and they stagger through its many attractions with crazed abandon.The motorcycle race soon takes a back seat to the non-stop, drug-fuelled partying. The two run up an outrageously large room service bill which, of course, they have absolutely no intention of paying! How long can they maintain this insane pace before reality must inevitably descend? 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is a wild ride and definitely not for all tastes. The scene in which Dr Gonzo humiliates a waitress at the North Star Cafe in North Las Vegas (the waitress is played by the sultry Ellen Barkin) is genuinely unpleasant to watch and shows just what a repellent character this Dr Gonzo really is. Thankfully, Duke is nowhere near as nasty as his sociopath friend.

It has the courage to have absolutely no plot, no catharsis, no ""emotional rollercoaster,"" basically none of the traditional cues that instruct you on what you should think and feel. Many people can't handle that, and I pity them. I found it totally liberating. You'll quickly realize you're unable to predict what happens next (I'm usually good at this) and you stop trying. I've never seen a movie succeed better at being a first-person narrative. The occasional ""wisdoms"" and observations spouted by the characters were just really great, without being presented as ""oh, look at this, here is some clever and zany dialogue to show the screenplay writers are COOL and can, like, RELATE to, you know, other kinds of people."" I really ended up liking these guys. They were over the top in the way that too few people are these days.If I were going to get more analytical, I'd say the movie is a statement about freedom. Looking at the lives portrayed and comparing them to yours will inevitably make you feel confined and ... domesticated.

187,nyarnebbanot,This movie sucks,4,17 April 2021,"Ok hey guys, I always pondered about this strange looking Boxart film. I thought it was going to be about anthropomorphic alien bugs on their way to Las Vegas. I was so disappointed.Like most bad films, this one starts out strong then SUDDENLY turns into a ball of poo. So you see there is this guy you see. These 2 gentlemen and they are paranoid so they go to Sin city with some hitch hiker and have weird war memories. But that's not all they do drugs! Lots and lots of drugs. And that's really just it.They hobble through Las Vegas for 2 hours which more feels like a month or a trip to jury duty than an actual movie. No one gives them any flack for their destructive hedonism. No punishment. They just get really irresponsible. It's so boring I looked at my smart phone and then got yelled at by my dad's friend for being on it during this movie. Then they destroy a hotel and kill people.So we just watched it for 2 hours. Not the extra minutes it forced us to watch.But hey hey, if you like a 13 year old's thoughts on what it would like to be in Las Vegas or just can't get enough of LV then by all means watch this film. Or just watch Austin Powers.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
188,Crannicus_Maximus,"Pointless, But Fun, Nonetheless.",7,2 September 2006,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is another great film about almost nothing.Well, that isn't entirely true.Fear and Loathing appears to be the tale of a journalist and his escapades into the drug world with a friend (portrayed nearly flawlessly by Benicio Del Torro). Once again, Johnny Depp is at an oddball role, playing Hunter Thompson (the journalist, who was a real person and actually wrote the book the movie is based upon as a form of memoir).Humorous, at times, and twisted, the movie features such memorable lines as ""We can't stop now, this is bat country!"" and ""Tell me about the... golf shoes!"" among a myriad of others.Certainly entertaining, and definitely a suitable time waster.7/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

The film quickly goes from VERY BIZARRE and QUITE SICKENING, to strange. The 2 main characters bounce off  each other trying to keep the other alive. Good? Sure. if you didn't really care to start.

190,dover,"So Close, and yet so far....",6,29 January 2002,"When I first saw this movie when it came out in theatres, I was very impressed with the visual aspects and overall feeling of this film. When I first read the book, then watched the movie again, I thought it was an amazing adaptation. A few years later, after becoming more familiar with Hunter S. Thompson (whose real-life adventures this film is based on), and reading and watching the movie again, I realized just how flawed an adaptation this really is.The film does do an outstanding job of visually representing everything in the book. There's a scene in the hotel, where Thompson's character (who is also his alias, Raoul Duke, and played by Johnny Depp), in a drug-induced haze, begins to see giant lizards swimming in blood in the hotel lobby, and the scene looks right out of a Ralph Steadman drawing.However, the film presents Thompson and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" as a kind of drug-induced escapade, sort of a less coherent Cheech and Chong type of film, with Thompson running around, drugged up in a frenzy with his ""lawyer"" Dr. Gonzo (based on real-life Chicano activist Oscar Zeta Acosta, and aptly played by Benicio Del Toro), getting into to trouble and acting like idiots. This is wrong. This is not what ""Fear and Loathing"" in about.Rather, the book itself is among the most profound epitaphs for the hippie-counterculture movement that formed in the sixties, something that only lip service is given to in the film, in the form of a short Thompson monologue. The book is also an in-depth (though rank outsider) look at the establishment of the early 70s. The second part of the story, which takes place at a National District Attorney's Convention on Drugs, is in large part a running commentary on the failure of the old-school centrist political/economic world (Thompson's white whale) to grasp the youth movement that had budded in the sixties, and now had nowhere to go. This serious, meaningful commentary does not come across at ALL in the film - very little of the myriad of social commentary apparent in any part of the book is in the film.Every technical aspect of the film is solidly done - the main actors, Depp and del Toro, are quite good. Depp, in fact, is more or less a dead ringer for Thompson, almost exactly how you might imagine the author in the early 70s. But the film doesn't take itself seriously enough to be anything more than a fun visual experience. Which is a shame, because director Terry Gilliam does, at times, seem to have a real feel for the presentation of feel of the book. But he makes too many changes (Lacerda's weird personality, for instance), cuts the wrong parts away (much of Thompson's introspection and commentary), and adds the wrong things (*and this isn't really a spoiler, but I'll put a small warning anyhow* such as the final scene, where we hear Depp's Thompson doing a voice-over from an epitaph he wrote for Acosta two years after this, which does not by any means appear in the book, nor particularly apply to anything else that happens in the story - which is as good a summation for the film as I can give - this is a group of wierd experiences missing the overriding feeling and commentary that brings it together so brilliantly in print.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I really don't know why but I just kind of like this movie. No punches are pulled when it comes to the insanity and depravity of all the actions in this movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
192,greg-e-porter,Well done and very trippy movie.,8,31 August 2015,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the story about journalist Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo. Duke is on an assignment to report on a big motorcycle race held outside of Las Vegas. The two decide to make the trip a drug fueled journey to search for the American Dream.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the adaptation of the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson. Thompson, if you aren't familiar, was the Rolling Stone journalist responsible for inventing ""Gonzo Journalism"" which focuses on the experience of an event rather than event itself as in the case of traditional journalism. The product of Gonzo journalism is something of a stream of consciousness: half fact, half fiction.This is a really rather grotesque movie and, quite honestly, I didn't really like it. At the same time, it was quite a good movie. That sounds contradictory. If it was a pretty good movie, why wouldn't I like it? Well, the guys in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are taking an obscene amount of drugs. It's a trip that might very well kill them. It isn't a happy experience and the movie illustrates that well particularly through the cinematography.The acting in this film is really good. I was initially turned off because I saw Johnny Depp acting like Captain Jack Sparrow or the Mad Hatter or Tonto and I for one am sick of drunken Keith Richards. But this is the first movie that he ever acted this way. With that in mind, I'll let it pass. And after watching some interviews with Hunter S. Thompson, I found Depp's impression spot on. Benecio Del Toro's performance as Dr. Gonzo is stellar. The pair jump between the effects of the drugs seamlessly as naturally as if one drug wears off to be replaced by another.Throughout Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas we never really know what is true and what is a drug induced hallucination. You can say this type of thing about lot's of movies but here it transcends the movie itself. When I said that Thompson's work is half fact and half fiction, I really meant that we can't really take very much of it as ""fact"". I always thought Fear and Loathing was about Hunter S. Thompson and his friend going to Vegas but, really, it is about the invented character, Duke, going to Vegas. I wasn't particularly familiar with Hunter S. Thompson so I watched a 1970's or '80's BBC documentary about him. The documentary maker, like so many of Thompson's fans, confused Thompson with Duke. The filmmaker even took Thompson the Vegas hoping to see the cult hero in action. Thompson then spoke about this tendency. When he is invited to speak at a university, are they hoping to hear Raoul Duke or Hunter S. Thompson? I originally thought that the premise, a motorcycle race, was the ""fact"". I made the mistake of reading fiction as ""non- motorcycle race"" instead of ""everything."" The identity of Raoul Duke, the film's narrator, adds another layer of fiction to the film; even though Depp looks and sounds like Thompson, he is Raoul Duke.To add another layer of uncertainty, consider the marketing campaign for this film. According to an interview I heard, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas focused heavily on TV spots and the majority of them featured Cameron Diaz even though she's in the movie for about a minute. It feels like the truth of this movie is muddled into fiction on every level; from the story to the marketing, nothing is reliable.Would I recommend Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas? You might want to pass, for the time being, if you are looking for something light and fun, but other sure; it is a weird and disconcerting movie but enthralling.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Though some of the book's high points are missing in the film, and though the film doesn't quite depict the 1970s as it was at the time, the film is still a potential cult classic. Great performances from Johnny Depp as Duke and Benicio Deltoro as his lawyer, Dr. Gonzo, though Christina Ricci is wasted (though still effective) as a reserved artist.

196,Dr. Nick*#3,"Eccentric, surprising, funny, thoughtful-great movie",10,28 July 1999,"This is one of the funniest, most satisfyingly outlandish movies I've seen in a while.  I love it for the same reason most critics and audiences hated it-it's rambling, incoherent, and overblown. Johnny Depp is simply brilliant in his performance, cartoonizing the character but in a way that enlivens the whole film and keeps you mesmerized and laughing out loud at this most eccentric creature Raoul Duke.  Benicio Del Toro's excessive mumbling got in the way of an otherwise good, intense performance(Between this movie and the Usual Suspects, he has about two sentences worth of intelligible dialogue). I love his performances but I never know why. The situations and set pieces were all inventive, especially the scene when they first check in to the hotel and spaz out at the bar(perfect recreation of being inebriated in a crowd, where the people around you seem to be bizarre caricatures, talking their own language). Same with the hilarious Drug Convention scenes.It's understandable that fans of the book(which I have yet to read) are disappointed (I read L.A. Confidential almost ten years ago and I found last year's critically hyped movie an overly sanitized, pale shadow of the brutal book) but I'm glad I came to this movie without the prejudice and expectations. This is my favorite Terry Gilliam movie, in fact-funnier than Brazil, more fantastical than even Baron Munchausen- although bingeing on psychedelics on the Vegas Strip is not quite as fun as it looks in this movie.  The movie(by way of the book) even manages to sneak in some pointed criticisms against the kind of aimless and/or idealized hedonism that the characters engage in.I highly recommend this movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
197,res0owwh,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas can assist one in breaking denial regarding the world we live in.,9,20 November 2001,"WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER! The movie is a perfect example of how a group of people, sometimes classified as dysfunctionals - addicts, alcoholics, and people hailing from backgrounds which contained addicts and/or alcoholics, and also classified by some as the low-dopamine gang, view the world.  A major circus, or as the Main Nerve residing in the center of a circus.  The Main Nerve and The Matrix being synonymous.  ""What is control?"" There is a lot of philosophy contained in the movie, if one is looking for it.  Raoul Duke openly talks to his God and to the devil.  The best one in my opinion being, ""Lord, you better take care of me or else you'll have me on your hands"". It is a classic scene when Dr. Gonzo is attempting to open the vial, or whatever, of cocaine in the top-down convertible traveling at a high rate of speed.  Naturally, the coke flies away, and he asks something to the effect, ""Did you see what God did?""  Raoul Duke replies something to the effect, ""God didn't do that, you did.  I always knew you were a narcotics agent"". These guys may be addicts but they are brutally honest, which is a Godsend. Both are intellectually with us, Gonzo is an attorney and Duke is a journalist.  Their I.Q.s are obviously above average, which is standard for chemical dependents.  Their comments and sarcasms are adorable and accurate.There are some esoterics involved in the movie; the bat country scene, Duke sees another of his selves in the club The Matrix, and experiences another consciousness dimensional shift in the men's room when he has spilled the white powder on his sleeve and also consumed some of the white powder.  Even though his dimensional shifts are drug-induced, they are no less valid. The data regarding adrenochrome is accurate and some dealings with the Dark Force are portrayed.  The bar scene with the reptiles is also a classic. Spiritual seeking is referred to frequently and the movie leaves us with the knowledge that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, operated and/or owned by a Force or a Being.  The movie contains more truths than untruths and can be classified as ""fiction with a purpose"".",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
198,mikeg994,Loathing and Disgust at the Movies,1,18 October 2008,"It would be difficult to assess the literary merits of Hunter S. Thompson's book ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" from this film. As I have not read the book I will leave that issue aside. It seems to be some kind of broad satirical look at Las Vegas the premise being that the only way to appreciate the weirdness and loathsomeness of this gaming mecca is to get weird on various kinds of hallucinogenic and mind-altering drugs. Instead we are treated to a kind of journey through the bowels of the protagonists complete with infantile orgies of destructiveness which are supposed to be some kind of expression of the well-deserved contempt one feels for crew-cut mentality of the early 70s political milieu. In the end like whatever it is one ate last night, it courses through the dark passages of one's interior only to find an exit in a toilet bowl.

The visuals might just be the closest thing on screen to an LSD trip you can get. The story is told so well by a narrating Johnny Depp who also stars as the main character Raoul Duke. Let's not forget about the insanely accurate job Benicio Del Toro did portraying Oscar Zeta Acosta or better known in the movie as Dr Gonzo. All these factors added up to really create a beautiful piece of art here. This movie like the book- isn't only about drugs. It's about the failing counter culture of the 60's and how some of those lost souls from the love generation used to make beasts of themselves instead of facing the pain of being men, which is the quote from the beginning.

I put the movie on and start watching it and I figured maybe it'll get better when they go to Las Vegas but it really didn't accept for the really (trippy) parts when Depp starts to see all these lizards. Then it starts getting more interesting when Del toro is gone out of the picture cause he was so wasted that it got really annoying then boring when he's back then interesting again. It seems like Del toro kinda ruins the movie sometimes.

Having watched it without using any of said items I found it to be almost devoid of entertainment value.  I have not read the book from which it is based and am now even less inclined to do so.  The acting by Depp and Del Torro presents two rather bizarre individuals who seem to be both addicted to multiple substances and to random violence.  The are quite believable in their presentations.  The pacing is even through the film and the effects to try to give the viewer an idea of what the mind altering substance is like are good but not unique.

What better symbol of the hopeless pursuit of wealth than Las Vegas; a plethora of vacuity. Gilliam's masterpiece (still second to Brazil) follows two men, a ""journalist"" and his ""attorney"", through their drug-induced misadventures around the titular city. To say that nothing happens during the film's two hours is exactly the point: the characters do not undergo arcs, and the narrative does not unfold in a conventional three-act structure. All we see is misery and excess, the despair of a country broken beyond repair. The Times They Were a-Changin', indeed - a flashback to simpler times, an acid trip in 1965, is a key scene; the social upheaval of America in the late '60s is reflected in the juxtaposition between the perceived innocence of this sequence and the perverseness of the rest of the film. The opening credits likewise contrasts the saccharine ""My Favourite Things"" with footage of civil rights protesters. A news headline on the radio tells of drug addiction among G. I.s in Vietnam, before the channel is promptly switched. This, then, is the underlying reason for their exploits in filth. In Duke's own words, they are ""hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of Our Lord, nineteen-hundred and seventy one."" The Vietnam War (one of Duke's hallucinations takes place on a battlefield), Charles Manson (""This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family""), and police brutality (officers are consistently ridiculed throughout) are all forgotten once high. See the opening title card: ""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.""Terry Gilliam directs the film as one long trip. Wide-angle lenses, handheld camera, varying depth of field, and Dutch angles are some of the tricks used to convey the different stages of the drugs' effects. The lighting and colours are hallucinatory, often bright neon and vivid. Shifting carpet patterns and animatronic lizards are both used well; effects used to stretch people's faces are unfortunately dated. The surreal visuals, the editing, and Duke's rapid, meandering narration creates the desired effect of feeling under the influence. Both lead performances are impressively brave - Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro capture a wide array of emotions and do not hold back at all when portraying the deepest points in their trips (case in point: Del Toro's scene in the bathtub). All the other actors are also great, many of whom could count as cameo appearances (e.g. Tobey Maguire, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, Cameron Diaz, et cetera). The soundtrack is a suitable collection of psychedelic songs from the period.A thrilling ride from beginning to end, complete with incredibly creative visual work and fantastic performances.

In effect Fear & Loathing totally misses the dark heart of the novel and just becomes an incoherent, thundering mess. Next: Johnny Depp. With funny hats, cigarette-holder permanently affixed to lower lip, bandy legs and quick-fire gags (albeit drug related) is he simply playing Groucho Marx? Maybe Hunter S Thomson is like Groucho Marx, but I somehow doubt this conveys all of his character?And thereby hangs the central problem with what is, in all probability, and unfilmable book. Should it be a slapstick comedy, a social commentary, a satire, a road trip, a drugs movie.... Unfortunately this fails on all fronts.Even if the script does delineate a non-stop drugs orgy in the strange town of Las Vegas it cries out of some coherence of narrative (compare the acid scenes in this this to the one in Easy Rider to get my drift).Much more balance and pace was needed. What we are left with is a kaliedoscopic hell of pharmaceutical paranoia (the Fear and Loathing of the title) and an almighty hangover.

211,ralphgillis,An Endless Spiral Of Trippiness,3,13 October 2021,"13 October 2000Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is based upon the book by the same name by Hunter S. Thompson. The story involves two drug addicts played by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, they take a road trip to the eccentric and queer town of Las Vegas in the early 1970s. How will they cope in civilised areas, they are constantly under the use of a particular substance that separates them from reality? A question that seems entrancing but actually isn't.The director (Terry Gilliam) displays a bold and sleazily energetic picture, the extravagant characters are constantly digging up their own grave. They consume a multitude of narcotics and they firmly invite the viewer to the psychedelic trips they experience. The film is visually creative, the imagery can be so bizarre and uncomprehendingly strange. Las Vegas is such a sensational, lively and dynamic town for our two greedy addicts, they can sink their teeth into the opulence and acquisitiveness that Nevada's heart holds onto so dearly and with such passion.Repetitiveness, a thought that was stuck in my head after the 40 minute mark. The movie's look is thrilling and captivating but such effectiveness could only last for about half an hour. This movie would work better as a short film than one with a feature length runtime that only seems to have one sole purpose, damage it. It is an incessant whirlwind of rehashed material being re-introduced on what feels to be a limitless basis. It gets tiresome very quickly, discovering the adventures these characters go on almost feels like a chore. I ultimately became bored and uninterested in the aftermath of a bumpy and treacherous journey.Johnny Depp delivers a memorable performance, his personality can be comedic at times. Benicio Del Toro is without a doubt a lot more dull and uninspiring compared to Depp's persona that he acquires just so well. Toro's role has no charm involved in it, he is just a hopeless drug addict. Depp's character has a lot of soul and enthusiasm, he shines on the screen and that's all due to his bipolarism. The ending is tasteless and insignificant and makes you think that the entire road trip was a complete waste of time for the characters and for the viewer.I don't recommend Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas because it leaves behind a scent of indecisiveness. The film making and imagery is exciting and poignant but the main plot wears down rapidly and becomes repetitive. The conclusion of a faithless and violent journey into the bowels of psychedelics amounts to an aimless ending. Our characters learnt absolutely nothing and they will keep on ruining their health and risking their lives until death gets a hold of them.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

The depiction of the LSD experience and general visual approach of Terry Gilliam is interesting as always, but that's hardly enough to support an entire movie. Even the slightest sign of a plot would have helped enormously, but the film is just a stitching of scenes comprising of... pretty much nothing at all. The movie's subsequent cult success is probably due to the fact that people with drug experiences can identify with certain events of the movie, but definitely, experiencing an acid trip yourself must be much more enjoyable than living it through the eyes of a bald Johnny Depp.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

When was the last time that you said to yourself: ""God Dagnammit! We're all in the same soup together!""? When was the last time you decided to trash the conventions that were meant to hamstring you and the rest of us into perpetual wimpdom and hypocrisy, and just said: What the #@$%? I don't care. ""Fear and Loathing"" is a true and entirely realistic account of what it means to be human, conscious, and self-directed in this world. Who, after all, is tending the light at the end of this journey? Hunter Thompson was just another one of us, only he went ahead and balled the jack on experience.

But it had been his suggestion to see it again. There must be more to it, I thought.I laughed and laughed.That is it, quite simply. An incredibly funny drug-taking and vegas-trashing film. You feel as if you are actually there on the road with Duke and Gonzo. Of course, I've never actually been out on a bender with them, but if I did then I would probably be pretty well prepared for what to expect. Captures the feeling of a session gone wrong very well.About those of you who say the most predictable and boring thing that anyone can ever say about a film of a book ""It's not as good as the book"", well forget about it. Let's get this straight. THE FILM IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE BOOK. OK so there are a couple of scenes that are different, and there is a bit more inner dialogue in the book, but hey, forget about it. If there will ever be a book-film conversion this good again then I simply wouldn't believe it. This is a carbon-copy if ever there was one.

I'm not saying this was a bad movie, just bizarre, EXTREMELY bizarre, perhaps the MOST BIZARRE movie that I have ever seen! Yes, that even includes the movie ""Brazil"" (also directed by Gilliam).  I liked parts of it, though.  It has some very memorable quotes and superb, difficult acting by Johnny Depp.  The movie is also packed with cameos (Cameron Diaz, Flea, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, and others).  However, the bottom line in judging this movie is, no matter how ""artsy"" and ""symbolic"" it is, was I truly entertained?  I had to really force myself to sit through it.  ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is humorous and packed with symbolism, but it made my head spin and I found myself checking my watch every five or ten minutes.

218,beetleborgs69,Beautiful and eloquent subversive weapon,10,20 December 2013,"In the basic frames of plot, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" appears as a dystopian sci-fi horror comedy about two psychotic heroin addicts getting stalked by anthropomorphic reptiles in the jungle. Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson as Raoul Duke has warped his mindset into a freeform kung-fu stance, believing the people surrounding him to be lost descendants of dinosaurs come back for revenge. He uses psychedelic drugs as a way to prevent the reptiles from properly profiling his behavioral patterns. Hunter S. Thompson is not a hero but he is strong, clever and likable in his ostracization. The major revelation is in his means of flirting with disaster to escape from it, led like a blind samurai to the heart and soul of the infestation, whispering the magic words like he knew them all along. Does he even know what he's doing? No... that would take too long. If he stopped to think about what he was doing the reptiles would get him.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

For us good sober Americans, this movie is entertaining for at most a half hour, simply becuase two heavy drug addicts are somewhat funny to watch. But then it just drags on and on. And worst off, there is no plot, none that i can discern at least, other than two drug addicts go to Vegas and walk around high. Thats it! For two hours and more cameos than Charlies Angels, we see Depp and Del Toro walk around stoned, most of the time muttering unintelligable gibberish. This movie will not capture your attention. You will be sitting on your couch and when you wake up two hours after you started you will realize that yes, it is still going on, and no there is no way of knowing when it will end. Its amazing how much this movie can suck, seeing as how the director is great as are the two lead actors. All i can say is whoever greenlighted this project that at most should have been a ten minute gag needs to be fired. If you want to see a funny trippy movie, rent Brazil.

It is just an overdose. But it sure makes for an entertaining movie. Plot? What plot? This is NOT about plot development...let's get that out of the way, now.I couldn't take my eyes away from most of it.

I was very impressed when i first saw the movie with a friend of mine. He was always into Hunter S Thompson and wanted me to get a feel of some HST. So I watched Fear and Loathing and absolutely loved it.

222,kheops,The best Terry Gilliam film,10,19 January 1999,"with this movie we can see that there is still creativity in movies today, if enough time is given to them. What did Hunter Thompson's book look like ? I looked like that. Terry Gilliam gave to this story his creativity and his ""former Monty Python""'s spirit. How is bat-country like ? Just like in johnny Depp's glasses. That's the first time I'm not disappointed by a Terry Gilliam film (in Monty Pythons movies he was not alone). I liked ""Brazil"" but I didn't love it (I thought it was too cold). There the madness of the movie can't let you still, you learn new words of vocabulary (mescaline overall), and you're amazed by the actors. Johnny Depp is more than perfect. He shows that taking risks in american movies can make improve a way of acting and allow an actor to be put into the ""top 5 of american actors"" (with Harvey Keitel, John Travolta -think about ""She's so lovely-, Robert DeNiro, Sean Penn and William H macy). He proves he's no longer an idol for young girls (think about it, Will Smith). Benicio Del Toro can't be recognized in the street after this movie, he took the risk to break his repution of ""latino actor"" with a nice face as ""The Usual suspects"" or ""the funeral"" may have ""done"" (I don't have enough vocabulary to say how this movie is great).

All I have to say is that it perfectly captures the absurdity of Las Vegas as well as the paranoia from extreme drug use. While some of the drug scenes are more obvious, the viewer is often not 100% sure when the narrator is in a stable state and that's a great thing from a narrative perspective. The creative cinematography and the goofy drugged up duo keep this film engaging from start to finish.

225,captelephant,A drug epic,10,15 January 2008,"Fear and Loathing is one of those rare films that manages to be both a wildly entertaining, highly quotable comedy that plays well at parties, and an intelligent, introspective character study to be watched alone with the lights off and the mind open.The character being studied is not Raoul, but you, or anyone from any generation that identifies with the post-60s American drug culture.If you have no understanding of (or harbor disdain towards) said drug culture, you will probably not ""get"" Fear and Loathing. That's okay. It was not made for you.Amidst the seemingly non-sequiter madness that makes this movie such a comedy classic the attentive viewer will find a sobering self-appraisal of the social revolution that was the 60s, and the sad state in which its children were left. Raoul (Thompson), here a larger-than-life lunatic Johnny Depp, is also an everyman with whom any past or present drug user can identify.The outwardly hilarious weekend in Vegas is, in fact, dark and miserable, overwhelmed with debauch, depression, fear and loathing. Raoul's ""friend"" Oscar sinks to depths that even our anti-hero finds despicable, generates one terrible experience after another, and violates every law of God or Man. Yet no ties are broken. No promise to change is made. It's all accepted as part of the trip and left behind on the highway.Needless to say: This movie contains a strong anti-drug message.But this is no phony, government-subsidized ""Dope is Whack"" campaign told by FBI-shoed business men you'd never listen to anyway. It's the truth as told from the front lines of the movement. A burn-out king who knows it's all evil, and will tell you as much even as he taps another needle.

229,Tyler_Bateman,Absolutely Brilliant,10,6 April 2005,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas This is by far the strangest film I have ever seen. And yes, I have sat through my David Lynch, my Bunuel, my Spike Jonze, and everything else. The only film that came anywhere close to being as strange as this was Mullholland Drive, and even that wasn't weirder. This film was everything to me: hilarious, disturbing, unsettling, tragic, beautiful, ugly, dumb, clever, awful, brilliant, and everything in between. I had an incredibly hard time sitting through it without getting up, and I ended up taking several breaks throughout. The film made me laugh, made me feel sick, and made me happy and sad. Never have I ever been put through such a wild trip. And I love film so much more because of it. Basically, this film has no plot, no story, no purpose and no point. It starts and ends and is filled to brim with wild drugs. Never is a character completely sober that I can remember. Or at least a main character. A strange writer and his misfit lawyer are on their way to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, the writer planning on writing a story on a motorcycle race. However, this is not the center of the picture. In fact, the race has started and ended after about twenty minutes. Everything after that is just spontaneous and plot less fun. The two characters are spun out on every single drug there is it seems (except heroin), and feel almost all of their emotions throughout. Essentially this is just a character study of two losers, and we experience what is like to be them. If that is all this is, then what is so great about it? why is it worth watching? I'm here to answer that question... this is film-making at some of it's best. The dialouge is hilarious, the direction is brilliant. Gilliam has made a colorful but difficult acid trip of a film, that glorifies and harshly depicts drug use within moments of each other. It is surreal, absolutely. Disturbing? Occasionally. Hard-tow-watch? Yes. But incredibly worth it? Definitely. Not only that, but the acting is some of the greatest acting I have ever seen. Johnny Depp gives easily his best performance, and one of my all-time favorite performances ever. Benicio Del Toro also turns in a hilarious and classic performance. He gained forty pounds for the role, and it shows. Depp never failed to amaze me throughout the whole film. He did it perfectly. The accent, the rubber-legged walking, the hilarious faces, everything, Never did I believe more that Depp was his character. Depp has possibly the most talent in the film, but Gilliam is also an absolutely outstanding director. Rarely do I ever see a better directed film than this. Kudos to you, Gilliam. Plus, there are the cameos. If somehow you get bored with the story (or lack-there-of) and characters, you can look out for tons of famous people. Look closely, you will find Spiderman, Cameron Diaz, a guy from Penn and Teller, Flea from The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Christina Ricci,Gary Busey, and a hilarious moment with Hunter S. Thompson himself (There I was...Mother of God, there I am!)And I'm sure I missed some too. Not only that, but if you watch and listen closely, there are small jokes scattered throughout, including repeated sceneries, scenes gone backward, and self-referential jokes. And considering I only saw it once, I may have missed a ton of stuff. Overall, this film is superbly made. I find this to be one of the greatest directed films I have ever said, even if the story is missing. I loved it, however, there were times when it was very hard to enjoy. I found scenes queasy and hard to stomach, not because the material was very disgusting and disturbing (though occasionally it was) but more just the way it is made. This is, of course, intentional, but every so often I had to take a break. However, I think it would be incredibly unfair to give this remarkable film a ***1/2 out of ****. So I settled with that rating, and will be giving it another viewing soon. Overall, I highly recommend it to all film buffs, and I think more than one viewing would even be great to catch everything. I shall be watching it again soon. Please, do yourself a favor, and let Gilliam and Depp amaze you with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Thompson's novel.  I have never used drugs or alcohol in my life and I probably never will.  This movie is one of my favorites. 
It's very fast-paced (although some short parts of 2 or 3 scenes may drag a little, but perhaps that's only because I was so eager to find out what happens next).  It's also very funny.  How the 2 main characters talk and dress is funny in itself.  Depp's narration really helps with that too, how he's always talking with his ciggarette holder in his mouth.  And those huge yellow sunglasses!The cinematography is wonderful.  The camera seems to be a character too. It's always just floating around, tilting, moving, even running in reverse in one scene.  There's so many vibrant colors jumping out all the time. ---The following is a spoiler for the first 30 seconds of the film---I think this movie seems to be based on the opening quote, ""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.""

Thompson's book, we follow Hunter and his buddy, Dr. Gonzo as they cruise into Vega$ to cover a dirt bike race only to disregard the race and end up doing as many drugs as they can sink their hooks into.  If you just sit back and watch this without worrying about conventions of plot, acting, common sense, etc, you should have some fun. Highlights are the various tripped out scenes that alledgedly capture an acid trip.  Now you folks will have to figure that out if that's the case for yourself as the strongest thing I've put into my body has been a cold Pabst Blue Ribbon at the Port Beverage House in Kenosha.  The lowlights are the very disgusting scenes of what doing too many drugs will do to you. And I must tip my hat to Del Torro for his beer gut.

234,parenthetical_expressions,Bacchanalia at its best?,6,8 April 2001,"""Fear and Loathing"" the movie is a bang on adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's same-named book. The book itself was a rather meandering, plotless tale -- an account of a frenetic drug-fueled escapade thinly disguised as a journalistic assignment -- expect Gilliam's movie to deliver much of the same.What the movie does have that the book doesn't are amazingly, frightful visual effects. One might think that a film that portrays such gross over indulgence in illicit drugs would persuade impressionable youth to do the same. Not so. Having been a life-long abstainer from drugs, watching this film only reaffirmed that choice. The psychotic highs and lows to which these two rise and fall would be enough (one would hope) to scare any adolescent to ""just say no"".Both lead actors forsook their vanity to bring these roles to life. Depp sported a receding hairline and Del Toro an extra 50 pounds -- all of which were accentuated by tight polyester of the 70's.While the movie focuses primarily on this hedonistic duo, the movie is filled with some unexpected cameo appearances: Cameron Diaz, Lyle Lovett, Tobey MacGuire and Christina Ricci, just to name a few.As the film is a very accurate depiction of this tale, one does not need to read the novel prior to viewing it.

I've frequently been intrigued by the philosophical movements it evoked in the 1960s, but my own personal experiences with drugs have been quite limited.  Still I find Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to be irresistible.  It is certainly askew from the norm, and true, it has no plot in the traditional sense.  Some have also called this movie pointless, but with this I must disagree.  I would suspect that most people who dismiss this movie also dismiss the drug culture in general, and I fear that this is a grievous mistake not only in cinema but in life.  I would like to think that I understand Fear and Loathing, but I do not.  It would be folly to think that I did, because I am outside the drug culture.  I haven't felt the euphoria nor have I experienced the terror necessary to really see things in the same light as Hunter S. Thompson.  It has also been said that this film glorifies or attempts to excuse recreational drug use.  The movie itself is a testament to drug life, with all its hills and numerous valleys, but it always shows the consequences that follow the characters' actions.

237,keithanddeenie,"A terrific movie, but you'll enjoy it more if you read the book first.",10,14 July 2000,"""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.""  This quote from Dr. Samuel Johnson is found as a preface to both the movie, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, from which it was adapted.  Having previously read the novel no fewer than eight times, I think I finally understand the full scope of what Dr. Thompson meant to say, and I have this film and director Terry Gilliam to thank.  There have been numerous historical eras that can be described as painful.  Surely the time of the undeclared war in Viet Nam was one of these.  On the advice of Timothy Leary, a lot of the young people in this country dropped out of the mainstream.  Many became part of the drug culture.  It was a  combination of the horror of this war, driven by the military industrial complex and paid for with the blood of thousands of American youths, and the convenient, but dangerous escape route offered by drug gurus like Dr. Leary that gave birth to a warped concept of the American Dream.  In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Raoul Duke (the personification of Thompson himself) and his companion, known as Dr. Gonzo, set out to find the American Dream, or at least to determine what became of it.  They are Hope and Crosby in the most bizarre ""road"" movie ever made. They take Dr. Johnson's warning as advice and make beasts of themselves. Two men from two of the more civilized professions, one a journalist and the other an attorney, ignore most of the known rules of polite society and leave a path littered with the assaulted sensibilities of those who have grown comfortable living in the shell of this once great country and strewn with the remains of whatever corporate property they consciously or unconsciously choose to destroy.  The genius of Hunter S. Thompson is that he is able to project so dire an image in an amazingly entertaining format. The novel sweeps the reader along with the clownish antics of its two main characters but never lets go of its central message.  The genius of Terry Gilliam lies in his ability to clarify that message while retaining every drop of humor.  Once before, in Where the Buffalo Roam, the works of Hunter S. Thompson were assayed for the screen.  That attempt was disappointing largely because of casting.  Bill Murray is a very funny man but a mediocre actor.  He was able to imitate Thompson but could not portray him.  Johnny Depp, conversely, gives us the all externals and all the internals of a brilliant, complex and highly eccentric individual.  Depp conveys to the audience Thompson's deep disappointment in the American Dream which he ultimately discovers in a all-night restaurant north of Las Vegas and leads us through the metamorphosis of a search into an escape.  Johnny Depp is simply one of the finest actors, if not the best, working today.  Peter Boyle is another terrific actor, yet as a Dr. Gonzo-like character in Where the Buffalo Roam was unable to play the part as written.  I would instinctively blame the direction in that case.  In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Gilliam made the brilliant casting choice of Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo.  Del Toro, with Gilliam's direction, brings out the menace in his character.  Here is a person who could really hurt someone.  In Depp's character we appreciate the disillusionment of many Americans with our government in 1971, but Del Toro shows us the anger that relents only with the recognition that he is among friends.  This is a terrific movie, not only for its own merits, but also for the many celebrity cameos, including Thompson himself.

What would be serious drawbacks in most other films by most other directors become this film's greatest assets. There's certainly no other movie like it, and perhaps there shouldn't be. This is a one-of-a-kind experience, and certainly not for all tastes.But if you're in tune with Thompson and Gilliam's respective world-views, sit back and enjoy the ride, and just be thankful you're only experiencing it through the safety buffer of a movie screen, and not first hand.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

241,zleverton,Requiem For Hunter S Thomson,8,21 August 2005,"""in the most godless of years, nineteen hundred and seventy one,"" hunter S Thomson, a sports journalist, took a trip to Las Vegas, armed with a pistol, a Cadillac, and a cornucopia of hard drugs.the memoirs of this strange journey became a best selling book, and now, a feature film.Thomson is portrayed in perfect fashion by Johnny Depp. and his lawyer, doctor Gonzo, by the great Belicio DelToro.The film, while plagued by problems, such as a third act that drags on like a dead body attached to a tricycle, is great in its own right. there are many classic moments in the film, that amalgamate into a deliciously confusing romp on 70's drug culture. the fast-paced, clever, and utterly none-sencical dialogue can only be understood to its fullest around the third viewing, so if your going to rent it, rent it when you've got the time to give it a couple viewings.READ THE BOOK! when you've read the book, especially after you watch the movie, the film takes on a whole new light. one of the hilarious points about the film is Thomsons insane, drug-fueled hallucinations, humping lizards, giant bats and fish-headed secretaries seek to give the film a strange, tripped out experience.so give it a try, if you don't like it, you probably don't get it, and if you get it but don't like it, then you where probably made fun of in this movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

244,icgsinc,Fear and Loathing in the Mind of an Addict,8,23 June 2006,"A ""wild outlaw with a pen,"" the rules were definitely not made for Hunter Thompson (the ""rules are not for me"" attitude, symptomatic of early- to middle-stage alcohol and other-drug addiction, is fully described in my book, ""How to Spot Hidden Alcoholics: Using Behavioral Clues to Recognize Addiction in its Early Stages""). His 1971 semi-autobiographical story ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" the book on which this movie was based, was proclaimed a masterpiece of ""New Journalism."" Yet, it portrayed drug-addled brains and outrageously destructive behaviors which, while not quite glorified, were not deeply criticized. In classic alcoholic style, he was termed eccentric and a ""cult"" figure, while sharing his nihilist views that life is absurd and the world has no meaning. He was successful because he put his feelings to paper apparently succinctly at a time when so many others of his ilk in the '70s who couldn't write held the same vacuous beliefs. He wrote nonsense very well indeed, reportedly never wasting a word.The story portrays two druggies in grown-up bodies with the minds of, at best, the fraternity boys in ""Animal House."" Benicio Del Toro, who gained 40 pounds for the role, beautifully plays gun- and knife-toting lawyer Dr. Gonzo. Gonzo accompanies seemingly cogent chain-smoking journalist Raoul Duke (Thompson's alter-ego, which served as the model for the thinly disguised sleazy ""Uncle Duke"" in the Doonesbury comic strip), played by Johnny Depp, to report on the 1971 Mint 400 Desert Race and a District Attorney Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, both held in Las Vegas. While the movie clearly does not glorify the use, it leaves us bewildered over the incredible luck in failing to get busted for destroying hotel rooms and endangering others on the road as they drive to and around Las Vegas with a suitcase full of every drug imaginable while stoned out of their minds. Snorting coke during speeches at the D. A. Conference, they haven't a clue as to what's going on. Nothing gets written on either event for Duke's employer.The movie was billed as one about two guys who find that ""sometimes going too far is the only way to go."" No it's not. It's about two addicts on a binge who destroy cars and hotel rooms, steal room service (averaging $35 per hour for 48 hours in 1971 dollars), and adversely affect more than a life or two. While there was no real message to the movie other than ""it's the only way to go"" for those who enable such behaviors and ""disgusting"" for those of us who don't, there were at least a few laugh-out-loud moments (but then, I have to admit to having a bit of a taste for ridiculous Leslie Nielson movies and, even, ""Animal House"").More importantly, although you'd have to listen very carefully to notice, inflated egos, the central clue to early- and middle-stage substance addiction, were evident. As he's readying himself to cover the race, journalist Duke comments, ""Those of us who had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts; we wanted strong drink. We were, after all, the absolute cream of the national sporting press."" While cruising the Strip and thinking of themselves, he says, ""Stoned, Ripped. Good people."" After running into a beauty in an elevator (played in a cameo by Cameron Diaz) and threatening her boyfriend with a knife, Del Toro's character tells Duke, ""She fell in love with me, man; eye contact, man,"" claiming she was flirting. While the first two comments may have been sarcastic, the latter was a clear sign of euphoric recall, which causes the addict to view everything he says or does in a self-favoring light (which, as I explain in my book ""Drunks, Drugs & Debits: How to Recognize Addicts and Avoid Financial Abuse,"" leads to the massive ego-inflation of the typical early-stage addict).They also consistently display a ""rules don't apply to me"" attitude. I explain in ""Get Out of the Way! How to Identify and Avoid a Driver Under the Influence,"" my book on detecting DUIs before they become tragically obvious, that parking wherever someone pleases is a telltale sign of alcoholism and likely DUI. They do exactly this as they arrive at a Debbie Reynolds show, which they are quickly thrown out of after talking their way in without paying (no doubt, using alcoholic charm, which I discuss at length in my other books). And one astute point is made when Duke talks about leaving, with Gonzo wielding his hunting knife: ""One of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug. Especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye."" Note his use of the term ""it,"" suggesting that even Thompson, in a rare moment of total honesty, knew he was dealing not with a real person but, instead, with an addict, and that the problem is not the person or the drug, but rather the person on the drug.The movie was directed by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam (""Life of Brian"") and was billed as a comedy. While for the addiction-aware it's more of a tragi-comedy with a decent-enough portrayal of poly-drug addicts, I must admit to laughing out loud at several scenes, particularly the check-in scene at the hotel where Depp's character is hallucinating. In addition to Diaz's cameo, Gary Busey plays an enabling cop, and you will also find Tobey Maguire and Chris Meloni of ""Law and Order: SVU,"" in amusing cameo roles.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Thompson is a very talented writer though, and with the expert direction of Terry Gillium this film comes off very well.  Unfortunately the book was, in my opinion, meant more to be a statement of the times than it was a story.  Therefore while the film presents itself well as that, it does not include a classic Hollywood narrative.  So I think many people will be disappointed.

Duke's sidekick Dr.Gonzo is here played by Benicio Del Toro, who makes him into a monster, rightly or wrongly.

I want to say that if you look carefully and the most important thing is to try to find meaning, and not start looking already with a preconceived opinion. Then this very meaning will definitely be found. I'll explain everything now.I see this tape has 2 layers of semantic load. The introductory part of the picture is dedicated to the first layer.This idea consists in ridiculing Western mores. And a satire on the American dream. Think about it, people from all over the world come to one continent to find this ubiquitous American dream, and in the end it (most often) does not end well.The second layer is devoted, respectively, to the conclusion of the movie.The idea is to show freethinkers who are independent of any opinion. These people are mutants of the 20th century, with the help of various substances, they just want to find their place in this world.I won't even talk about acting, camerawork and adaptation of all the nonsense that was in the novel, it's beyond praise.Conclusion: It is impossible to recommend this film to everyone (especially snobs), but fans of excellent counterculture could watch it.7.9.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

You can see it in different ways.If you look for simply entertainment its great: a funny, witty LSD trip visualised on the big screen. If you want to go deeper you can see that this is a serious anti-war movie picking up on the Vietnam war story and the parallels of a similar war within society. It also gives an interesting, perhaps nostalgic portrait of that time.The cinematography is truly amazing. Wide angles, witty cuts, great subtle sfx. As for the actors: equally amazing. Jonny Depp is quite convincing and fun to watch as a permanently stoned reporter.

258,I_actually_am_sam,Infinitely Rewatchable,9,24 October 2008,"I am not one for watching movies repeatedly but this movie is an exception to the rule. Perhaps it is the fact that there is no discernible plot or major twist that makes numerous viewings possible. Or perhaps it is the sheer joy to be taken from the two main performances of Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro. This has to be del Toro's greatest achievement as an actor, he is positively terrifying as Depp's drug buddy and ""attorney"". And Depp's wacky mannerisms and rambling monologues are pitch perfect.Depp plays Hunter S. Thompson, who, for the purposes of the movie goes by the pseudonym of Raoul Duke, the father of so-called ""Gonzo journalism"". The official purpose of his trip to the titular city is to cover a desert motorcycle race. The actual purpose being a mind bending, all-you-can-eat drug buffet.Terry Gilliam brings his unique style to this movie. The psychedelic visuals that the viewer experiences through Duke's eyes are a real joy, and are straight out of the Gilliam school of bizarre animation first seen in his Monty Python days. It would be hard to imagine anyone else at the helm.Interestingly, on my most recent viewing of this movie I was watching it with a number of non-native English speakers. None of them had seen it before so I thought, given the leads' slurred speech throughout, it would be a good idea to opt for English subtitles. It was a revelation! I hadn't realised how much dialogue I hadn't grasped or even heard before. There were some truly hilarious lines newly discovered that night. And you know, that is another reason this movie is suitable for multiple screenings, as there is always something new to discover.The only reason this movie did not get the full 10 from me is that every time I watch it I am surprised by how long it is. It definitely starts to sag a little bit when Duke returns to Vegas for the second time but then quickly picks up again, only to sag again towards the end. 15-20 minutes shorter would have been perfect.And no, you don't have to be on drugs to enjoy this movie.

259,zer0oskul,Holy Crap!,10,24 February 2005,"The funniest thing about it is that director Terry Gilliam never used drugs.Recently deceased, writer/journalist/all around psycho freak, Hunter S. Thompson's real life 1971 drug induced 'trip' to Las Vegas to write a story on the Mint 400 motorcycle race for the national sporting press.Subsequently, the story was never written and the hero finds himself in a psychadelized nightmare of high powered blotter acid and an assortment of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers and screamers. . . .and some pure human adrenochrome along with the wild night life and flashing neon that makes Las Vegas so full of. . . .Fear and Loathing.With more cameos and better acting and finer cinematography and a better all around believable story than any three Oliver Stone movies that you could take in on any given night(unless one of them is Salvador which is about on par with this minus cameo).Get the special collectors edition DVD featuring a 1978 BBC documentary following the real life 'Dr.Gonzo' across the U.S.A. with artist pal Ralph Steadman. It is uncanny to compare Hunter Thompson from the documentary to Johnny Depp from the feature because Johnny Depp, for at least this movie(see lingerings of the power of playing Dr. Thompson in Depp's character portrayals in Once Upon A Time In Mexico and Pirates of the Caribbean), is a perfect depiction of Thompson's own impression of his fictional character based on himself.The moral of the movie, I have noticed quite a number of 'educated smarties' pass it off as though it has no moral, as though it's just two maniacs doing maniac things in maniac ways to nice 'normal' people so that maniacs will become agitated and perhaps copy it. The story of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the entire Raul Duke catalogue, Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision, Where the Bufallo Roam and the entire Hunter S. Thompson book series is a genuine look into the mind of a dreamer who just wanted to find something nice. When he couldn't, he would smash up what was already ugly and people would complain that he made the ugly. The morality behind the entire life of Doctor Hunter Stockton Thompson is that evil is not out there. Meanness and anger are not out there. They are in here, inside us all, waiting to break out and do something that we must apologize for. As though it were impossible for another person to commit the same evil you'd apologized for.

260,His_Dudeness74,"You scurvy shyster bastard, I'm a doctor of journalism, man !!",10,2 February 2006,"This movie is a strange beast and kinda difficult to describe - sorta based on true events, sorta fabricated, I doubt the story's original author would know himself what was real and what wasn't ...Director Terry Gilliam (former Monty Python animator, director of such films as Brazil and 12 Monkeys) adapted a great screenplay from the writings of famed 60's San Francisco 'gonzo' journalist Hunter S. Thompson (who goes by the pseudonym Raoul Duke in the film, for reasons I'm only partially sure of), a quirky, cynical drug-fiend who's character is brilliantly interpreted by Johnny Depp (whose balding appearance, muttered speech and trippy hand movements are a hoot).Set in 1971, with the hippy age of enlightenment nearly dead, we pick up the action on a highway in the middle of the Nevada desert - Depp/Thompson/Duke's narration eventually reveals in it's convoluted way that he and his ever-present attorney, Dr. Gonzo (more on him in a moment) are on their way to Las Vegas to cover a car race for Rolling Stone magazine ...However, secondary to that concern is the copious amounts of drugs the two have brought with them and intend on consuming ...A minute into the film, Duke's LSD-induced hallucinations of large Bats are brought to life in Gilliams distinctive style (indeed he handles all the drug/hallucination scenes brilliantly) - dark, threatening creatures swoop and gather in the sky as Duke warns Dr. Gonzo ""We can't stop here, this is bat country !!"" The trip quickly dissolves into a frenzy of drug-taking and misadventure, Benecio Del Toro (who gained 40 pounds for the role of the 'fat Samoan' Dr. Gonzo) steals half the movie with some downright scary portrayals of bad acid trips, aided by Gilliams incredible visual touches ...having recently read a little bit about 'Dr. Gonzo', he sounds like an even more larger-than-life figure than Hunter S. Thompson himself - Dr. Gonzo's real name was Oscar Zeta Acosta, and he was known as 'the Brown Buffalo' - apparently he defended the rights of countless Mexicans and latino's during the 60's, and his work is still required reading in Mexican schools - *however*, he also had a legendary appetite for mind-altering drugs, and eventually disappeared ""off the coast of Mazatlan sometimes in 1974"" never to be seen again ...Thompson somehow manages to avoids overdosing, being stabbed by his paranoid attorney and paying his ridiculously high hotel bill, and eventually produces the paper that would go on to form the basis for this film ...man, one helluva film, incredibly funny and scarily surreal.Obviously not for everybody.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

263,dr. gonzo,a wonderfully demented cinematic masterpiece,10,9 November 1998,"After more than 20 years of failed attempts and missed opportunities, Terry Gilliam has done what many thought impossible -- transformed Hunter S. Thompson's classic novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, into the cinematic equivalent of having a sledgehammer whacked across your frontal lobes. Thompson's book has been fully-realized and brought to the big screen in all of its demented glory.It is 1971 and journalist Raoul Duke (Depp) and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro), drive to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race for Sports Illustrated magazine. The assignment is merely an excuse for the duo to abuse their expense account and indulge in a galaxy of drugs. What was initially a simple trip to cover a sports event mutates into a search for the American Dream.Fear and Loathing contains many funny moments, bits of dialogue, and visual zingers as Duke and Dr. Gonzo make their way through the surreal landscape that is Las Vegas. The humour in this film is simultaneously disturbing and hilarious -- a pitch black satire of American culture and excess. Around the 3/4 way mark, Fear and Loathing veers off into really dark territory as the horror that accompanies chemical dependency rears its ugly head. I was worried that this element would be lost in the transfer from book to film in favour of a more straightforward comedy. Thankfully, the darker edge of the novel has been retained and reinforced. After all, their odyssey is supposed to be a savage journey into the heart of the American Dream.I think that Fear and Loathing is indeed some kind of genius film, but in a really demented way that I would have a hard time explaining to someone who didn't tap into what Gilliam and Co. were trying to do. Visually, it is a masterpiece with a whacked out kaleidoscope of colours and insanely inventive camera angles and perspectives that make you feel like you're actually on drugs.I can see why Fear and Loathing has received a critical shellacking from all the usual pundits (Ebert et al). It's a very odd film -- a 128 minute acid trip from beginning to end with no respite, no rest stops, no objective distance from which to view the whole insane picture safely. You are plunged headlong into this weird, wild world along with the characters.This is the kind of film that people will either really love or hate -- there is no middle ground. Gilliam's film is going to be one of those movies that's destined to become an instant cult item. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a monster movie, complete with the grotesque Dr. Gonzo, a malevolent creature who gobbles up drugs and then goes on a chemical-induced rampage. It's pure gonzo filmmaking for people who like weird, challenging films.

268,jeepcj5guy,"the myth, the legend, the Gonzo",10,14 August 2005,"Fear and Loathing is the most infamous and brilliant drug culture film ever made, right alongside Trainspotting, Half-Baked and Requiem For a Dream, although it stands alone in it's own sub-genre of hilariously perverted, crazy-psychedelic Gonzoism. Hunter S. couldn't have written a better story and Gilliam brought it into film with a masterful hand and a true reverence for the man, the myth and the legend. Whoever cast this one with the Depp and Del Toro combo was a genius and really must have read the book because I couldn't imagine a better Duke and Dr. Gonzo. I must have watched this one two dozen times (often while partaking in similar recreational activities as the characters on film) and it made me smile and laugh out loud every time and every time I saw something new I hadn't noticed before. The film is layered so thick and has so much going on, it's impossible to take it all in after seeing it one, two, even three times. Not everyone gets this film and that's perfectly okay.

No sense of acid whatsoever. Except the carpet pattern swirling, that wasn't bad, in the first few minutes, but I think that blew the special effects budget. God knows why anyone thought it was worth spending $18.5m on this. Depp mannerisms started driving me crazy after about two minutes. Trite little cut-ins of ""60s"" footage were daft. All in all - given how mega brilliant is Hunter S Thompson's original book - this movie, fillum, call it what you will. was a rollicking great disappointment.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
270,dan_o_toole,A Beautiful Visual Mess of a Movie,4,19 August 2019,"I'll keep it brief..This was a perfect project for Gilliam. Not one for creating films that follow strick and rigid narrative structures, he is able to focus on crazed visuals through use of camera lenses, image manipulation, back projection, projection on set and cgi in order to show the drug fulled experience of Hunter S Thompson. He does reference the book closely for the parts he's adapted however if you're the type of person who likes their clear narratives and characters bound by he rules of traditional story-telling then you will want to avoid this film at all costs!!! You will find yourself switching it off after ten minutes as you ask yourself what the 'F' is going on...
If you are more of an open minded movie connoisseur, then you may appreciate the production values of this movie but don't forget that what you are watching is a film that's only premise is to have fun with the camera and visually take the viewer on a drug filled acid trip...no holds barred.
Yep Gilliam gets away with murder on this film which is a very difficult watch. Unfortunately most of his works after this have been terrible failures as he himself continued his quest to break visual and narrative rules on some weird trip to show that mainstream methods are boring..yet failed to appreciate that audiences have been conditioned to read mainstream formula and if you break it too much they'll hate your movie...",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Twice have I tried to watch it without being able to finish it...and I hardly ever do this no matter how bad a movie gets. And this is the peculiar part because Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not the worst movie I've ""seen"". My experience has been this (twice): I start watching it and it's hilarious for about half an hour. Then it flattens out. It doesn't change after this half hour, it just gets old really fast and I get the feeling that it's not moving forward. After about an hour it's like ""enough already - get on with it!"" and ""OK OK - I know now that you have a lot of different drugs with different effects, will anything actually happen soon?"". The acting is good, and Depp is...well he's different than how you usually see him, and yet the same - he always gets a part in those mystical movies. I'm actually close to being a Depp fan, but I'm sorry to say that I still haven't been able to keep this movie rolling to the end, or at least I can't remember an end to it.

Gilliam shows directorship well beyond his league.To sum in one sentence: It is a road movie that will grip you, put you through a washing machine, and make you shake with laughter.Some of the things that make this film special will be lost on the fans of industrial light and magic ( although there were some good effects in here... ) The film is really about a head trip. It doesn't necessarily place itself as a ""drug"" movie - even if that's a main prop in it. It is a masterpiece of literary transcription. It is far more interesting than the book.All in all - this film is, as usual a way - underrated classic.

279,alex-law321,"I was reviewing ""Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas"" on IMDb.com when the drugs began to take hold",9,13 May 2012,"When you start watching this movie, you'll decide if you like it or not. But if you don't want to wait, I'll tell you. This movie is so trippy, so gross, so insane, so bizarre, and so friggin' crazy! Now with that said, it's also brilliant, funny, surreal, dark, entertaining etc. The story goes like this; a Dr. Journalism, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and his wolf man attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), are sent to Las Vegas to cover a Mint 400 motorcycle race but end up abandoning that in search of the American Dream. The two characters are out of their minds on drugs the entire time which is where the surreal factor comes into play. The film is based the famous novel by Hunter S. Thompson, which was based on real life events he experienced. I'm not kidding when I say that five minutes into this movie and you'll feel that someone drugged your drink or something. This is more than just a movie, it's an experience, and an experience like no other. If you haven't read the book or don't know what your getting yourself into, then you're gonna have one hell of a ride. Johnny Depp (of course) nails the performance of the character that the book created. What director, Terry Gilliam, did is take the book and match the images that we thought of while reading it, perfectly. Throughout the film, watching the two characters wander witlessly around Las Vegas tripping on acid, I felt like I was part of the experience. Also, Depp's performance is so good, that I started to forget that he wasn't really Hunter S. Thompson. The characters are both psychotic but in different ways. Raoul Duke has one foot in reality and another foot in a pit of madness, Gonzo, however, is off his rocker. He's just a ticking atom bomb ready to go off, I'd be scared to stay in the same room as him. But what keeps this movie going strong is the narration by Depp. Some of it's recited from the book but other times it's whatever's on his mind. Without the narration, the movie would be just one wacky thing after another. Overall, watching this movie is like being hit by a car, sucked into a tornado, spat out into a trampoline factory, raped by a wild tiger, eaten by Godzilla, thrown off the face of the Earth, and plummeting right down on the TV. Any negative reviews you may have heard about this movie make no sense. They love the book while hate the film for being so crazy and shapeless (oh, you mean exactly like the book). This is a perfect adaptation of the book. So great performances, surreal scenery, flowing narration, and a clever cameo by Thompson himself. When I first saw this movie, I liked it just fine. I've seen a few more times and every time I see it, it gets better. Now it's gotten to the point where I think it's one of the best films ever made. So if you're a Johnny Depp fan, or a Terry Gilliam fan, or a Hunter S. Thompson fan, or just in the mood for something different and I mean REALLY different, definitely check it out.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

We were three guys watching FLLV. One fell asleep within 30 minutes, and my other friend and I just sat there quiet, trying to keep our eyes open. It wasn't worth it.

285,Nylar,A spectacular artistic failure,3,30 May 1999,"Terry Gilliam, with FaLiLV, has crafted a textbook example of bad art. The movie has a number of points to make, and generally manages to convey them (albeit with the lucidity of a drug addict). However, Gilliam constantly goes way over the top, hammering the same ideas into his audience's heads incessantly. Forty minutes into the film, Gilliam has already made his points, and the next eighty minutes are incredibly redundant. Much of the voice-over narration, particularly in the early parts of the film, creates an astonishingly pretentious ambience which only adds to the sense of malaise felt by viewers. While there are a couple of good scenes in the film (the rotating, mirrored bar, for example), as well as a great deal of visual brilliance on Gilliam's part, the majority of the movie is overdirected and overwritten. In the end, I'm more interested in figuring out exactly how Gilliam went wrong, rather than further considering the themes of the movie, which have already managed to completely play themselves out.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

291,The_StickMen,Dazed and Confused,10,26 July 2004,"First off, I'd like to set up my critique of the film. I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, it had be recommended to me by a friend once with him simply stating ""its hilarious"". So I wasn't quite sure what kind of hilarious experience I was in for. Usually when I see movies, I read up at least a little on the making of it, or someone involved. I knew that Depp and Del Toro were in, and I knew that Terry Gilliam directed it (I had seen Holy Grail and 12 Monkeys before this, so I really really didn't know what to expect at this point, those were two very different films). I also had never heard of the author of the book or any of the hype or popularity surrounding the movie when it was released (if any).OK so thats what I went into the movie with, coming out of it I was...well...dazed. I really did not know what to think about it, it definitely wasn't the drop dead, laugh out loud, funny experience I was expecting it to be, although I did laugh at a lot of the stuff in the film, it was a different kind of humor than I had ever witnessed on film. I definitely dug the psychedelic style of the picture, the drugged out effects were definitely cool, creepy, and funny to witness (I have never done drugs, so this was new to me). The acting by both leads was simply amazing, you can tell they really got into their roles and were having a blast playing these drugged out losers. The dialog was a little hard to follow so I turned on the subtitles to help me out. The cameo appearances were fun to see. All in all, I have to say that I don't know what to think about this movie, I enjoyed it quite a bit and I think with repeated viewings I might enjoy it that much more.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Some kind of creative force of nature, this man is. If it seems to get dragging and messy in some spots...well...creation is messy. I love this piece as a whole, including the imperfections.Fear and Loathing is about a lot of things, much more than just two men on a demented, depraved, prolonged drug binge. And it is more than just an adaptation of Hunter Thompson's famous novel. It has a life of its own, makes political, social, personal statements, and the way Gilliam's wit and imagination synergizes with that of Thompson's makes this a compelling and unique experience. I would give it two or three viewings initially, to let it sink in. The Perl of the whole thing is when the narrator reminisces about the mid-60s...a glimpse of peace and beauty amidst the chaos that surrounds it...the centre of the vortex.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

301,eMpTy84,Directly under the influence.,9,17 February 2017,"Paranoid, unpredictable and out of control, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) venture through a drug bender in Las Vegas. Adapted from the legendary journalist's book of the same title, Hunter S. Thompson's real life experiences and Terry Gilliam's strong direction create a marriage in psychedelic heaven. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas delivers all of the drugged up wackiness of a binge gone too long and taken too far.To the inexperienced with psychedelics, most of this film probably won't make sense on a few levels. There isn't much of a discernible plot: stuff happens, but nothing truly develops logically. Dialogue is spoken, but most of it doesn't seem important except the narration. Francis Ford Coppola famously stated that Apocalypse Now, ""...is not about Vietnam...it is Vietnam."" Fear and Loathing isn't a film about drugs, it is a drug.Much like the desired and adverse effects of taking too much LSD or smoking too much marijuana, there are two major tones in the film: The fear, then the loathing. The adventure begins as they start the drive into Vegas. The fear sets in as they arrive to check into the first of many hotel rooms. The acid kicks in, and Duke panics when he concludes he is too gone to deal with the check in lady. This continues with many funny and baked results. Then the mood shifts into a darker, much more menacing half where lines are crossed and the altered states feel inescapable.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas isn't just about the hallucinogenic trip either. It draws parallels to an era of transition from the 1960s to the 1970s. After the drug trip, the movie concludes as if it all was a prolonged haze of confusion in a city with empty promises of the American Dream. Drug culture became more of an escape from the brutal realities than a movement for peace and love.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
302,tuulitex,You have not seen this movie? * heavy use of a fly swat*,9,4 July 2007,"I was somewhere around East Estonia when I got hold of the book. It was the summer of 96... I never returned it to my friend. There was not much to return. Then in 1999 There was a movie in our cinemas they had translated into estonian as something like ""To Las Vegas on Wheels"". I had no effin idea it was a movie based on that very same book! You can imagine my surprise when I went to see it....no, actually, you can't. There is no way of expressing the surprise I felt. I had just gotten 18.... I had no guts to tell ANYONE I had even seen such a movie. My parents had seen the book lying around, but they don't speak English. I had plans to mention it, but I was delayed when a local newspaper published a review with a picture of Dr. Gonzo as SPOILER!a hairy - titted devil. Besides, I know what my parents would have said. ""We are right in the middle of an economic crisis and someone is showing drug movies to our goddamn children!!!!"" Yes, a very bad moment. Now it has been almost 8 years...It HAS been 8 years! What the F***? But, man, I tell you, you'd have to be crazy on electric bills to think this movie's advocating drugs to anyone. It is THE trip that no person can ever have again. So why bother trying? Besides, it is a scary trip, yes sir, morey eels, huge bats and polar bears and maniacs in the bathtub. How about some ether? You can handle your parent screaming at you for watching men slicing Z-s on each others forehead, but no one should be asked to handle your mom saying ""Oh, great-grandmother sipped ether every night in her rocking chair, falling asleep with her legs spread and mouth wide open. And we the girls had a bottle along on cold winter days going to school in PRESCHOOL. "" This makes me wonder....Duke and Gonzo only got their high by sniffing? Softies. The body language, both of them - brilliant! Maximum input....and out...put...It has caught every side of the story. The crazy, the absurd, the violent, the nostalgic, the outrageous.

But it is more than that. Even when you are not drunk or stoned you will love this unforgettable road trip Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are making through Las Vegas. Terry Gilliam (he deserves a statue in Hollywood for this film) made the most bizarre movie-scenes I have ever seen: the hotel-room aftermath, the circus-bar, the elevevatorscene. Nothing beats Fear and Loathing. Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro play the best roles of their life's, the played it so well that at the end, you want to become them..

I knew already that it had fantastic people having worked on it, but I was curious to see how it would turn out.Sure, some bits were left out. Some bits were different to how I imagined them to be. But I can't help but love every second of this film.On the surface, it's two dudes getting wasted and trashing Las Vegas. But if you look deeper, you'll see that it is an examination of the ""American Dream"" and the culture back in 1971.It's just the conveniently placed ""how did i get here?"" type of line in between long periods funky, far out humour that make this film a film to be reckoned with... even if you haven't taken enough drugs to appreciate it.Buy The Ticket...

Gilliam proves he is the master of absurd movies and the acting is fantastic, both Depp and especially Del Toro are totally insane in this movie. There is also a funny cameo of Tobey 'Spider-man' Maguire. The special effects are really good to (the scene with the dinosaurs in the restaurant is hilarious and looks great) The movie has a great script and is very quotable, the voice-over which is delivered excellently by Johnny Depp is highly entertaining and very well-written. This movie gets slayed by critics, but that is probably because it is a very 'different'' and absurd movie and there is almost no storyline but that is no problem at all because Fear and Loathing doesn't NEED a storyline.

""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" encapsulates a non-stop drug trip through strange environments and transcendental perception. The film follows a journalist and his lawyer as they travel to Las Vegas to report on a local motor cross race. However, their psychedelic-fueled personalities create all sort of mischief for themselves, ushering the main plot into a backseat as we enter an altered-reality. At a deeper thematic level, the setting of a Vietnam involved, 1970s America provides a deep contrast. While men are off fighting at war and much of the country is tense, these idiots are still able to engage in a psychedelic adventure, leaving their troublesome reality and journeying into oblivion.

If I could make Gilliam do a punish lesson (like Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard after class), I would make him write ""Brevity is the soul of wit.""  He needs an editor.  I'm still waiting for his masterpiece, not a film where which insists on continuing many scenes beyond where it could have ended.

311,euhafshzs,A milestone relic,9,25 June 2021,"I've first watched this movie when I was 18, and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Teenage, 60es-obsessed rebellious me had taken in all the wrong lessons, and started applying them broadly. The ultimate gateway drug.I still watch this movie once in a while, often with other people. I've noticed that it's harder and harder to sell a 90'es interpretation of 70'es nostalgia for the sixties to my younger friends. A lot of symbolism and themes simply do not land, and the movie becomes a stoner classic at best, and a quaint spectacle at worst.The good news is, as the youth says, ""if you know, you know."" No mix of words or music or memories and all that, but if you are even remotely interested in ancient crafts of gonzo or psychedelic counterculture, the movie is an aesthetic masterpiece.Some more observations I made through the years:
* No other movie will reward you this much for re-watching it. You'll pick up on details in visuals and dialogue, and even understand a completely schizophrenic storyline!* No other movie will reward you this much for watching it in different altered states. You'll pick up on details in visuals and dialogue, and even understand a completely schizophrenic storyline!* Don't read the book. Seriously. If the violent, sociopathic diner scene serves as a shocking low point in the movie, the entire book has the same tone. I suggest sticking to the pink (yellow?) tinted glasses vision of the movie that's less upsetting and more upbeat than Dr. Thompson's unsettling vision.* Bloomquist's book is absolutely real and is sold on amazon. I have a copy, and the page quoted in Fear and Loathing book is a perfect match... so maybe you should read the book.See you in Gonzovision.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
312,PeterPPK,Not too bad of a movie,8,7 November 2009,"Fear and Loathing is a movie that requires you to think sometimes. And a lot of people don't and therefore, they dislike the film. It's a pretty good movie and a great representation of the 70s.The acting is superb. Depp and Del Toro are flawless. You might think that they act stupid when trying to portray a person who's under the influence, but I'll guarantee you, that's how those people act in real life.There's a lot of funny moments. Some people found this movie to be boring because only the first half-hour is funny, and that the rest is just them on weed. I disagree. There are a bunch of humorous moments, you just have to think about it sometimes. And the reason why they're on drugs is because this is the 1970s. There were a lot of potheads back then. Also, the stuff that happened in the movie, happened in real life. So blame real life events if you don't find the humor humorous. Some people even go the extra mile and watch this movie high. Well, don't do that. Trust me, you will understand WAY more if you're sober.The plot(like everything else in this movie) requires massive amounts of thinking and don't expect yourself to get it on your first time watching. It's not just about two guys and their intoxicating adventures. Noooo. It's MUCH more than that. The plot is about a journalist and his attorney who, during the early 70s, try to find the American Dream.All in all, the movie is great. Now, it's not a cinematic masterpiece or anything, but its still a good movie that's fun to watch. You may need to watch it a second time in order to completely understand it, though. I myself, recommend it.8/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

So what then do I do as far as rating it is concerned?
I pondered for a while and then decided I would average it out. A 1 out of 10 for the story itself and how much I didn't enjoy it. However a 10 for consistency with the novel. Divide that into two and arrive with my rating a 5.5 rounded up to a 6.In short, if you enjoyed the novel, the movie is perfect. If you enjoy the movie you'll enjoy the novel.

314,static_addict,Fear And Loathing Dr. Gonzo,7,22 February 2007,"The last time I saw this film was in the theaters when it was first released. Now this film has became a cult classic because of its drugged out nature, stylistic picture, and good acting, especially on Johnny Depp's part. But other than that this film has almost no story. It is basically about a drugged out weekend in Las Vegas. Roule Duke (aka Hunter S. Thompson) and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, are in Vegas to cover some sort of off road race. But the real objective is to get messed up on any sort of drug as possible.Dr. Gonzo played by a heavily overweight Benitio Del Toro, who is annoying and sadistic. And while Duke is the ""sane"" one of the two, they seem to completely trash two hotel rooms. Del Toro really put a damper on this movie. His character was very annoying with him always flashing his gun or knife around and getting mad for no reason. But when he is ""sane"", Duke is messed up on either ether, LSD, or artificial adrenaline.Finally, after this mess of a movie, we finally get to the end. Apparently after ""overdosing"" on some sort of experimental drug. Duke wakes up to find himself with a tape recorder duct taped to his chest and is wearing a huge vinyl lizard tale. The hotel room is trashed, and he starts to listen to the tape and pick out moments of the events that happened over the last few days when he was pretty much blacked out. We see some more of Dr. Gonzo being crazy with a knife to some waitress, and then Thompson getting Gonzo to the airport on time. Then the movie ends with the strange ramblings of Duke ala Jerry Springer's ""Final Thoughts."" This film is directed by Terry Gilliam (Monty Python, 12 Monkeys, Brazil, The Brothers Grimm, etc.) and has a large amount of cameos: Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Toby Maguire, Gary Busey, Flea, Verne ""Mini Me"" Troyer and even the great Hunter S.This film could have been so much more but is still a good, not great, achievement in film as an art.

315,michaelthonger,A film for pretentious stoners,3,24 April 2010,"I went into this film expecting a visually exciting, interesting, funny drama, and I was seriously disappointed. After the scene in the bar at the hotel (the first few minutes are quite good), the film dives into a boring slog through weird unlikeable characters, random events and irritating performances. This film proved nothing to me except that Hunter S Thompson is a pretentious hack and a waster who spent his time getting high and spending weeks coming to conclusions anyone could have reached. I myself am ashamed to know a group of stoners who all think they're Oscar Wilde when they're high, and I can assure you; they're not. The 'jokes' are unrecognisable and mostly unfunny. It uses needlessly derivative and meandering vocabulary (delivered in a way that will make you bang your head against a wall in irritation about 1 hour in) to disguise the fact that, ultimately, this film has nothing to say. If you found Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow annoying after 3 films, avoid this like the plague; he overacts to death. Benicio Del Toro's character is just a dickhead who mumbles incoherently for two hours and does whatever his character requires him to at the time; every other character is either unfunny, stupid, or a pointless celebrity cameo. If you're seriously delusional and think that getting high turns you into John Lennon, by all means watch this film.

Visually, it's quite interesting.If only he'd understood a single Goddamn word of what the book stood for.At best, it's a naive adaptation, more intent on showing off neat visual tricks than making a point. At worst, it's a lousy mess with some good performances that elevate it above a complete disaster; a very weak movie worth watching.

Whereas Brazil was a complex, graphically challenging film, with masterful performances; this film is an almost two hours long dull frivolous spectacle!! I hope Terri returns to his ""Brazilian"" roots, instead of making another awful movie.

Johnny Depp does a great and carefully prepared role as a strange journalist who spends time on mostly anything but what he came to Vegas for. Using drugs and fooling around. First I thought he was overacting, then I understood that this is how it's supposed to go. Benicio del Toro also delivers a good performance of the main character Duke's lawyer and friend Dr. Gonzo who is at least as crazy and messed up throughout the whole flick as Duke. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas barely had a plot but with this idea, I wouldn't even expect it. It was really fun anyways, though with a dark twist. Drugs are bad, m'kay? But seriously, the main characters stupidest moments made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I still laughed... My friend showed me some kind of depicting of the day in the novel's writer Hunter S. Thompson's life, where he mostly uses drugs and smokes cigarettes all day before starting to write in the middle of the night. I don't know how much of it was true but after watching this movie, I sure can understand that there lies somewhat the truth.Seven out of ten, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas doesn't shine all the time but does entertain and makes you wonder what the hell is going on.

I heard a little bit about it but I never had the chance to watch it, and It was surprisingly better than I thought it was going to be. A lot of people say that it is a ""road trip movie"", I wouldn't say so. There's a little bit of them driving around in the beginning, but that's about it. Most of the movie is spent with them in Las Vegas. If you ever read Roger Ebert's review of the movie one of the things he complains about is how there is no real main plot. Duke and Gonzo just take drugs you probably have never heard of and go to an area, get in trouble there. and then do it again at a different place. But I think that's the point, every time they go to another place it's different. The plot is like a drug high it starts out of nowhere and then just kinda stops. About the acting, I think that both Depp and Del Toro did an amazing job, sometimes it was hard to even realize it was them. Now to the drug sequences, oh boy. Now in some movies there are maybe like one or two drug sequences. But in this movie, at least 75% of the time, one or both of the main characters are on some kind of drug. Apparently, this movie is a hit or miss with most people. Some like it, some hate it. I'm trying to think of something to complain about, but I can't. If I do, i'll add it in later. To wrap it up, the movie is kind of the hangover if instead of the movie focusing on what happened after the crazy night, it was about the crazy night itself.

Depp never fails to amaze with his choices of roles and he is so superb as Raoul Duke (Thompson's alter-ego) you hardly realise that he is Johnny. del Toro also ignites every scene he's in with such ease and is an excellent counterpart to Depp's Duke. Chaos is definitely at the center of the visual theme and yet some people complain that they don't understand what's going on, which is exactly THE point. This one has 'cult classic' written all over it and it is definitely way ahead of it's time. Despite being set in the early '70s, you can actually feel it's current validity.

Sober and tired, sober and excited, drunk, on weed, mushrooms, and other psychotropic enhancers. I have been to Las Vegas 6 times in all of these states of mind and have never seen a performance by any 2 actors more worthy of international recognition than Benicio Del Toro and of course the infinitely dynamic Johnny Depp.I remember when a friend I worked with at an Animal Care clinic told me to go see ""A Clockwork Orange"". I respected him and thought he was a maniacally brilliant observer of human behaviour. So I watched Stanley Kubrick's greatest masterpiece with awe and complete reverence and ecstasy! The same feelings were experienced when I watched F.A.L.I.L.V. for the first time. I had some how managed to miss F.A.L.I.L.V. due to living in Newfoundland Canada at the time. Of all the movies of my generation from Star Wars to The Matrix no other movie or book has impacted my conscious the same.No matter how messed up things can get you can always maintain your mind with focused ego. I have remembered Johnny's portrayal of H.S.Thompson (aka Raoul Duke) and that alone makes me howl in fits of laughter.It saddens me today here in the Summer of 2006 that when I ask co-workers or certain people about those movies that they have no idea wtf I am talking about. But I do my best to spread the word so that just like myself back in 1992 when I first saw ""A Clockwork Orange"" and changed my life, that I may pass on the same experience to someone else is worth it.Go see this movie as my highest of high inspirers Hunter S.

326,Broudie69,One of the best films ever.,10,1 November 2002,"It's hard to describe how good this movie is without sounding sycophantic but it really is that good. This film is based on the ""true"" story of when the notorious reporter Hunter S. Thompson and his then attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta went to Las Vegas to cover a bike race for rolling stone magazine but instead spent the entire trip going out of their minds on various illegal and legal chemicals. This may sound like a one trick pony for stoners and 60's throwbacks but I am neither and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Very few films based on books manage to tell the story or capture the spirit of the original but F&L certainly manages both. The story sticks closely enough to the book without alienating the books fan base but also trims out the right areas so that the film doesn't become overly long and uninteresting.
     The film is still fairly long, compared with most popcorn fare, at around 2hrs and does sag a little in places but the pace quickly picks up again. The performances are absolutely spot on with Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro virtually becoming their characters. Both are heavily disguised under make-up but their acting ability shines through. On first viewing I wasn't that impressed, it was a good film but not a great film, but after a second viewing I fell in love with it. You notice things and pick up on gags the second time around that you missed the first time. You immerse yourself in their world so much that you feel like you were there with them on the ""trip"" in both senses of the word. I have shown this film to most of my friends and they also have become hooked after viewing the film twice, it's such a shame that this great film works like this as I'm sure there are many people who are unwilling to give it the second chance it deserves.

It's a collection of not-very-imaginative drug-induced visions coming from a hedonist journalist. Johnny Depp looks good as a bald, sweaty guy, but you know it's all a put-on from the start. You KNOW he's going to survive, he's going to have some cynical comments about the American Dream (or Nightmare), and he'll drive away wondering about it all. None of the scenes really add up to anything. It's a collection of half-hearted attempts to match ""gonzo"" filmmaking with Thompson's gonzo journalistic style.On the other hand . . . no one but Terry Gilliam could put together such a visual feast. And who cares about plot? That's not the point. It's great to see a movie about drugs that's completely free of the hippie vibe. Very few movies depict drug use in this way, as self-induced psychosis. Gilliam captured the spirit of the book by making bright colors ugly, showing everyone at their worst, and essentially forcing you to watch people act the way they really do.

It seems to me that this movie, not only communicating a deeply-meaningful feeling of ""fear and loathing"" at the end of the freedom and promise of the 60s as portrayed by one of the most creative writers of the 20th century.Combine that with one of the best and most creative directors of recent times (Terry Gilliam) with the best actors of recent years (Depp and Del Toro) and you will have this amazing movie.I am sorry if most people who watch this movie will not be intelligent nor open-minded enough to appreciate the genius of this movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

334,b-doyle,Travelling to the heart of the American dream,8,10 January 2006,"Based on the recently deceased Hunter s. Thompson's book of the same name, Johnny Depp plays Raul Duke, a hedonistic, slightly deranged journalist heading to Vegas with his attorney, played by Benicio del Toro. The film essentially depicts the two characters searching for the American dream and lamenting it's loss on a drug fuelled journey of mayhem. Having been written in the afterglow of the swinging 60s, Raoul Duke and his attorney choose to follow acid guru Tim Leary's advice and 'turn on, tune in, drop out', seeking a chemical enlightenment, which ultimately seems to be a false promise. Depp is superb as Duke, displaying Hunter S Thompson's quirky characteristics to a tee. Del Toro's performance is equally as impressive, and Terry Gilliam's direction gives the film a wild, anarchic feel that was very much at the heart of the book. Watch out for a brief cameo from Christina Ricci as a young, tripping artist. Overall, an interesting, compelling examination of the realities and myths surrounding the American Dream.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Where should I start from? Spotless acting from both Depp (that feels like he's made for these sick roles) and Del Toro (at the pick of his career while this was filmed,he gave his soul in this psychedelic maniac with a knife). The Acid culture takes a solid hit throughout the movie that strips naked the downfall of the sixties and the ruins that it left behind both in the hearts and souls of people that fell victim to it unwillingly or willingly. At the last monologue of Duke, I was left speechless for a awhile trying to understand the meaning of never understanding an essential fallacy that is fundamentally a desperate assumption..""that is the Acid Culture"".Only blind spot: Casting Maguire as a Hitchhiker?What's up with the wannabe Spiderman on such a serious movie?

It's even funnier when you're on something.The characters are so absurd and over the top but somehow totally believable. Knowing the story of Hunter S Thompson you can imagine a lot of this actually took place.If anyone has had a friend who always goes that one step too far and makes you really anxious then you can also relate to this movie. There's a brilliant edge to the film always worrying that the Lawyer is going to go too far.It's fun to watch it and fantasize about being that free.

Thompson's novel (of the same name) and it drove me to the brink of my own madness. The film does that to you, but it also gives you enough fodder to keep you thinking. Through all the insane drug hallucinations, psychotic and savagely brutal themes strewn within the vast outer layer of this story, lies an engrossing view of the North American culture and our own stumbling collapse. Although I did not live in the 60's or the 70's, this film gives the viewer a very extreme but believable account of one man's life as it, willfully, spirals out of control. For showing the American culture at it's most vile and primal nature, this film is worth a 10 in my mind and is a must see for any movie buff looking for a wild ride and/or a thoughtful journey in the Red Shark. With enough twists and turns to keep you enthralled, you will not let go until the end.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I did and throughout the entire film I was beaming. Only Depp and Gilliam could produce sucvh a good adaptation of THE greatwest book of all time. The acting is brilliant - Depp sometimes acts like Chaplin which produyces a lot of the laughs. Its visually stunning and leaves you breathless after every hilarious scene.

It is like watching a series of train wrecks hanging upside down from a helicopter over the tracks.I discovered reefer, mescaline and acid more or less at the same time in my 27th year (1969), and must admit that the roller-coaster ride of the ""psychedelic experience"" was always as frightening and enjoyable for me as it seemed to be for Raoul and Dr. Gonzo.

347,rob94,"I bought the ticket, I took the ride... it was worth every penny.",9,26 January 2008,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has one of the most fast-pace beginning scenes I have ever seen in a film to this day. We follow the half fictional character Raoul Duke (created by and roughly based on Hunter S Thompson)on his insane and fearful trip to Las Vegas, with the companionship of his outrageously behaved attorney and a suitcase full of hallucinogenic drugs. For me, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a ""feel good"" film, I always end up watching it on a rainy day for some reason. Proberbly because it has comedy, alterations to reality and a fantastic performance by Johnny Depp as the mumbling, animated, permanently tripping Raoul Duke! I am a big fan of the book of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas and the movie was just as enjoyable as the book, for me anyway. The only other film I have seen in which the film was just as good as the book was Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.I think Terry Gilliam really did have the artistic license from behind the camera to really make this film an excellent, somewhat warped experience to the viewer. The uses of red in the film are just one of the many fantastic mechanisms that Gilliam used to make the viewer feel the same way as the disorientated and comedic characters. As I said before the film has a very fast-pace but I did not drift off it due to the frequent narration and jilted camera work. Some of the scenes in fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are simply just some of the most memorable and entertaining I have seen in a long time, for example the brilliantly set scene in Which Duke attempts to avoid a confrontation of any kind with one of the local police officers or the scene where Duke comes in to the hotel room discovering his attorney(Benicio Del Toro)lying in a bathtub, half clothed simply out of his mind on illegal drugs.. comedy and madness combined to make something too complex for words themselves.

The screenplay was original and kept to the spirit of the book and the characters had a unique quirkiness about them.

349,jduke,Visual masterpiece with Thompson's message intact and strong as ever.,10,5 September 2002,"I have read countless reviews of this movie that have derided it for everything from glorifying drugs to being unchristian to being boring. Maybe my mind works very much like director Terry Gilliam's (I loved 'Brazil' and '12 Monkeys'), but the last thing I would do to this movie is deride it.  It is a brilliant adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's generation-defining book of the same name - it stays very faithful to the events in the book.First of all, this movie literally glows with Gilliam's eye for detail that he has consistently displayed throughout his career.  The sets are so elaborate, one could never take in all the scenery from any number of viewings without slowing it down and watching very closely.  The bombardment of the bright, flashing lights of Las Vegas and the bizarre camera angles, as well as surreal sets make for an interesting and entertaining presentation regardless of a lack of coherency and taste. What we have here is a movie riddled with black humor and a horrifying satire of the American dream.  I'll admit it takes a very `unchristian' viewpoint to laugh at the `straight economics' of allowing policemen to gang-f**k a girl for $30 a head.  Therefore, people bound by a constricting sense of morality should never have watched this movie in the first place.  It is for people like me who enjoy living a very un-stoic life (at least vicariously through movies) by having radical ideas and perspectives forced upon them.  Fear and Loathing is the embodiment of such a perspective - it is a gruesomely accurate depiction of the bi-product of the often-glorified 60's drug culture.   And one thing that countless critics seem to carelessly omit in their analyses is the constant references to the `American Dream.'  Johnny Depp (Raoul Duke/Hunter Thompson), in his verbose verbal narrations, makes quite a few references to a desparate hunt for reason behind the madness of not only this `American Dream', but the drug culture as well - ""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."" - Dr. Johnson (displayed before the opening scene). The problem with the waning popularity of this movie is simply that its design was not meant to appeal to the buttoned-down mainstream.  People that want to laugh and cry in a movie theater and then get the hell on aren't the type of people that would enjoy seeing an unjustified drug-induced frenzy on Las Vegas.  This movie has everything a critic should be looking for in a masterpiece - magnificent cinematography, lovely acting, shock value, provocation of thought, and a meaning behind it all.  To freaks like me it also has immense entertainment value as well.  This work will be one of my favorite movies of all time.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
350,puck447,its halfbaked only better acted with no plot.,5,19 June 2003,"The movie as a whole was not great. There was no plot, and the humor which isn't great begins to drag on after no real point is established. The only thing that really kept the movie entertaining and sometimes amazing was Johnny Depp. He is absolutely astonishing with his voice and character mannerisms. He was absolutely incredible. I can not praise him enough. However most of the drug effects were exaggerated for comedic reasons and were sometimes unbelievable. Acting goofy doesn't make you high. I couldn't really find much of the humor funny due to an earlier comparison of the movie to requiem for a dream. I kept feeling bad for these people and the fact that they were never sober was scary. It was sad, and these feelings finally came to play in the scene with the waitress at the end. I couldn't really find the drug effects funny because these people are so messed up. People say I'm looking too into it; however this is a ""true story"". Johnny Depp delivered most of the funny lines and they were due to his character not the drugs he was using. Without him the movie wouldn't be half as good.   5/10 not three because of Johnny Depps amazing talent for characterization.   Jake",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
351,johnnynarcissist,Can't stop here... Bat country,9,24 July 2003,"Fear and loathing as a novel was loved and despised in seemingly equal measures by all who read it and how fitting that the film follows it's source material so faithfully.  The movie, directed by the genius who is Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits, Baron Munchausen), is a truly bizarre piece of cinema.  Based on the novel by Hunter S. Thompson and loosely describing the events 'enjoyed' in his colourful life the film documents Raoul Duke (Depp), as a drug crazed lunatic of a journalist, and his 'lawyer' Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro) as they spend a fateful few days in Las Vegas.  Inevitably their journey soon becomes a massive drugs binge and reality is lost.Both the direction and the acting (Depp is awesome in the lead role and Del Toro is bizarre beyond description) are superb and the script is genuinely hilarious.  Unusual camera angles, a brilliant soundtrack (Jefferson Airplane, Three Dog Night, Dead Kennedys) and truly weird events, each more strange than the last, convey the madness of mass drug intake superbly creating a very funny if confusing film.

Thompson's novel has been brought to life by the master of outrageous visuals, Terry Gilliam.My first viewing of this movie made me realize what a complete wacko Hunter S. Thompson was. I read the book after I saw the movie, and the book was even more insane than the movie.There are the typical Terry Gilliam visuals in the movie which make the film a memorable experience. Johnny Depp was absolutely stunning as Raoul Duke, the alter-ego of Hunter S. Thompson himself. Benicio Del Toro is absolutely at his disgustingly best as Doctor Gonzo, a repulsive character, which I believe represents the title of the film. He is fearful and loathsome in Las Vegas.All in all, a grand film of drugs, drugs, drugs, Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro and the visual master of the bizarre, Terry Gilliam.

It's a master work of our director, Terry Gilliam, one of the many men behind Monty Python which conspired to made that act great and infamous. I know there are people out there who will disagree with me, probably running up into the millions. I'll say this about them though, all of the people I've watched this movie with who haven't liked it, have all been either pretty sheltered, or were not the sharpest knives in the box. Not to say there aren't intelligent and experienced people out there who dislike it, for whatever reason, but I'm betting the asshats are in the majority of the nay-sayers.I won't ruin anything about this film in my commentary here, because a lot of the jokes will take explaining to some degree. I will say this, if you haven't seen this film, and especially if you don't know who Hunter Thompson is, you are missing out on people and events which may eventually wind up in our history books.10/10 - One of my favorite movies of all time.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I wouldn't recommend it, though, for the more conservative among us. As a person who has an idea of what went on in the '60s, I could appreciate it. Couple of too-old dudes go around off their proverbials on drugs.Dialogue is excellent, Terry Gilliam's direction is fantastic, and the acting is beyond reproach.

356,mantarayinvasion,an absolute blast from start to finish,10,15 June 2007,"I'm not sure how many times I've watched Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas, but it's well over 30 times. This film is a masterpiece on so many levels. I'd rank it with the best of modern American film-making, along with Coppola, Kubrick and Scorsese's finest work. Firstly, the way this film is executed despite the tiny budget is nothing short of unbelievable. It made me respect Terry Gilliam in a whole new way. Despite the potential for fancy CG given the subject matter, almost all the scenes of delusions and hallucinations are done using 'analogue' techniques (to brilliant effect) and the few touches of CG are tasteful and blend in well with the immaculately realised early 70s setting. I've heard that the lack of CG was due to funds running out, but I'm very glad this happened.I'm not a big fanboy of the book or its worldview. There are things I deeply admire about Hunter, and things that I detest too. This still doesn't detract from his story or the film based on it. Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas makes me laugh harder than anything else I've ever encountered, even after the number of times I've watched it. Yet it also has some very poignant and atmospheric moments.The film makes you feel, intensely, the dripping sleaze, pouring sweat and hot, dry desert air of Vegas. The psychedelic soundtrack conjures the era at the crumbling end of the revolutionary 60s. You feel the lurching highs and crushing lows of the two main characters' drug binges as vividly as they do. You live their darkly introspective nightmares and spiralling paranoia. And you revel in their lunatic adventures in the vortex of the American dream, urinating in the face of the supposedly wholesome and decent society in which these strange mutants exist.Depp and Del Toro are ridiculously good in this movie - I'd be gobsmacked if they ever produced better performances. Del Toro in particular is a powerhouse, at times he's mercilessly cruel, invincible and terrifying, and at others a hilarious train-wreck. He always remains immensely likable and charismatic - a perfect portrayal of the Dr. Gonzo character. Depp is also great as Hunter, manic and helplessly cowering from his hallucinations while still trying to maintain his composure and eloquence as a journalist. They pull off every scene incredibly well, especially when taking turns to be the 'responsible' minder for his drug-wrecked counterpart, when just as ripped. The supporting cast is also spectacular - the actors playing even small parts like Sven the clerk at the Tropicana, Lacerda the photographer, bellboys, traffic cops, car rental salesmen and countless high profile cameos all display great comic timing and clearly have a good understanding of the material.It is so easy to totally fail to hit the mark with this kind of subject matter, but this is one of the most perfect feature films I've come across. There are never any dull moments and it's a trip in itself. Every scene is a masterful set piece full of energy and brutal humour, and the structure is fluid and compelling. Even though it obviously helps to have great material like Thompson's book to work with (and it is virtually an exact translation of it), it's no mean feat to pull it off in a motion picture format.One of the greatest achievements of this film is the accuracy of its portrayal of drug subculture. Gilliam denies ever having touched a chemical substance in his life, but I find this frankly impossible to believe... the detail and authenticity of his direction is just too good. At no point is the film judgmental, preachy or unrealistic in how it depicts events which most normal people would find horrifying. It shows the highs, excitement and enhanced perspective and perception offered by chemical substances, while showing how they can also reduce you to a shambolic mess. Anyone who thinks this is a pro-drug movie has simply not understood it at all.I highly recommend this movie to all intelligent viewers, especially the Criterion edition which features a lot of extras, including a very good BBC-produced documentary/interview of Mr. Thompson himself.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
357,chodefacemcgee69,Much deeper than you think...,10,7 November 2005,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is much more than people make it out to be. Sure, its funny; its interesting for drug enthusiasts; and its quite strange. But remember that it is based on the book by the late Hunter S. Thompson, a very satirical and often cynical writer. The book was a criticism of society, with different occurrences, objects, and even trips symbolic of the political and social turmoil of the era. Thompson was the founder of ""Gonzo"" journalism, and a great modern writer. Director Terry Gilliam translates the book beautifully, which is a great feat for such a deep book. He retains many of the main ideas in the book, while condensing the novel into movie form, and many of the deep literary elements of the novel are still present in the movie. He also does this without making the movie completely boring. That said, some people WILL find the movie boring. However, I can say that you probably will find the movie interesting if: 1) you are a Hunter S. Thompson fan. 2) You are a patron of narcotics. or 3) You like deep movies, with meanings beyond simply making you laugh, or action movies.I personally thought the movie was excellent. However it is not comparable to any other movie I have ever seen. For me this adds to how great I think the movie is. For others, however, this may leave you wondering 'what the f#&k?' I think this was one of the best movies ever made, based on one of the best books ever written, right up with the ranks of Faulkner, Miller, Camus, and the rest. I hope you find the movie just as enjoyable, and if you don't, don't blame me; it's not for everyone. But those who understand it will love it.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

One of the best movies ever made!Some people are plain offended with this movie, I've even heard it be called drug romanticizing, but it's far from it.Like the title says, it is really about the fear and loathing in their trip to Las Vegas.Still it is hilarious even though the whole film is about two men's drug abuse, hallucinations, fears, and even child molesting, try to do a funny film about that, still I promise that it will have you laughing through the whole movie.Gilliam is a master of detail, and you will notice new things in it every time you watch it(at least the first 6-7 times or so).",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

However, I really could not figure out what people less passionate about Mr Gilliam and Mr Depp or with no hallucinagenic experiences would make of. I think that you only have to have been outrageously drunk to get a lot of it, and it is visually stunning and wonderfully surreal throughout. And the soundtrack's great too.

I was also a fan of Johnny Depp (although not as much as my mother), and I would even grudgingly admit that Terry Gilliam has redeemed himself on the odd occasion with a flicker of genius.You can imagine, then, that I was looking forward to seeing the words made flesh, or at least celluloid (whatever that is...). And then Fear and.... splattered across the screens and I began my slow descent into utter boredom.  Where the book was a non stop, rollercoaster ride (oh, cliche) the movie seemed to creak from one indistinguishable piece of dialogue to the next, flinging in some cool special effects to wake me up.  The weird thing being, of course, it was exactly like the novel. And yet it was truly dreadful. How can this be?

366,anthonyo-2,True to the book,10,24 March 2001,"Terry Gilliam has excelled in translating Hunter Thompson's book into film. Although I did see the movie before reading the book, so perhaps my opinion is retrospective... but again Johnny Depp has shown his flair for oddball roles (Edward Scissorhands).  In acting terms, playing the part of Hunter S Thompson and making people actually believe in him is surely difficult. The role did not lend itself to a more conventional or method actor, it takes someone with the X-factor, and who better than the man who convinced us he was the real Don Juan De Marco!It's a pity that Benicio Del Toro seems unhappy with this movie, I believe he critised the film and complained about the money?  He convincingly plays the part of Dr Gonzo (who those in the cult following out there will know is a hedonistic freak!), Depp does not steal the show by any means.True to form, the director Terry Gilliam pushes the visual medium to it's limits (does Gilliam have limits?) .  His visual style and use of the camera remind me of an Oliver Stone movie.  Fear and Loathing was not a mainstream success, mainly because it is adapted from a book that doesn't seem to make any sense either!Maybe the secret to it lies in Dr Johnson's quote (found in the start of the book and also at the start of the film) -'He who makes a beast of himself, takes away the pain of being a man.'",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

368,thisdjsucks,One of the best movies ever made,10,2 May 2009,"I always love when I turn a person onto this movie. Too many people think this movie is just about drugs and the logic of a half crazy narcissist. It has a deep underlying tone that taps into the core of American culture. The evolution of a culture has to be violent, crass & revolutionary. This movie is that. This story takes place at the end of the civil rights movement where a blind and far too conservative America changes into something else. The narration where HS Thompson is talking about that ""wave"" sums it up. What was going on in America when this story happened? The end of Vietnam, The Civil Rights Movement, Watergate, etc. Those who went along for the ride at that time wanted to change America. Maybe it didn't turn out the way they really wanted but what do we have now that we didn't have before? It's not only socially acceptable to question authority, to not do so is Un-American. Thompson was the fulcrum in this. Before him journalism was too conservative. Thompson blew this away. He was everything that needed to push America into a new era. The best thing is that he makes no apologies for anything he did. He had to open that inner-eye. That is what this movie captures and it makes no apologies. Terry Gilliam, Johnny Depp were ""Gonzo"" enough to make this movie and they did this in the most excellent form. Johnny Depp portrayal of Thompson conveyed the message of this story perfectly. The best part about the story was the fact that it never set out to be one, it just happened. Thompson was the underlying kick in the ass that America needed to look inward and see itself for what it really was. A movie that can be a literal time capsule of the reality of a specific culture is a beautiful thing. It is even better when it isn't America trying to speak for another culture. This movie is the reality of America as dissected by an American. It looks at itself for what it is, like a naked person in a mirror. This movie will always be a favorite for me. Whenever I can expose someone else to this it's more precious than a bought education. Watch the movie without a joint and go beyond the chaos. Watch this movie for what it is.

I wasn't sure what to expect from the reviews I'd read. most of them were pretty bad. However, everything about this film from strangely colored drug trips, which are countless to the beautifully bizarre and great preformances given by both Depp and Del Toro this film is amazing.

Duke, played by the always glorious Johnny Depp, and Gonzo, played by Benicio Del Toro, steal the show with this delirium of a film. Two guys with a head full of drugs searching for the American Dream, as how they put it, and breaking almost every law known in Las Vegas. Not exactly a nice movie for the whole family on a lost Thursday night. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of those movies you like, or hate.Maybe that's the power of this kind of movies. Eventually, you'll find more people who appreciate it than hate it. The humor is recognizable and therefore hilarious. People can't simply neglect the simplistic brilliance of this movie. It's genius is hidden beneath the rough and chaotic story, that on his own way is trying to mislead the viewer with two clowns of characters who seem to be simply tripping their way through two hours of film. I say, look closer and be amazed by the subtileties and recognizable situations that carry this movie.Director Terry Gilliam has really done a brilliant job with this movie. All the time you feel like you are there to, also with a head packed with drugs. It is filmed on that way that you can't watch this movie like the normal film fan, but rather as one of those guys, totally under influence, standing on the sideline and watching it all happen. This takes quality, to summon a feeling by the viewer so that he actually thinks he is part of this film. Watch Fear and Loathing a couple of times and it will become drugs to you. It will stay with you like it is one of your own memories.Fear and Loathing is definitely one of my favorites! A film representing finally something different. Another side of society hilarious brought to the screen, with a wink! But it is indeed a delirium, and not everybody will be impressed by it like I was. Just see it, though.

""Fear and Loathing,"" like the book, is as much if not more about politics and reaction against the boringly insane culture we live in. It's as relevant today as it was when Thompson wrote it. Both actors turn in brilliant performances, the direction is appropriately breathless and manic, and even the special effects still hold up well. In these times of new age conservatism and general stupidity on both sides of the political divide, we need more writers like Thompson, freaking out in front of everybody just to spark a reaction. We certainly need more movies like this.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Thompson- the author of the novel on which this film is based- then you are undoubtedly going to be shocked and confused, and perhaps a little repulsed. The film is essentially the crazed alcohol and mescaline- induced ramblings and travels of two so-called drug fiends, during a trip to Las Vegas. This movie may be described as incoherent, outrageous, and weird to a previously undiscovered degree. I mean, it is weird.If you are the type of person who likes a strong plot-line, or well-developed characters, or any pretence of normalcy at all in a movie, then by all means watch this movie to expand your narrow perspective. If you are the type of person who prefers chaos, or weirdness, or being shocked, or maybe a good strong hit of any type of drug, then by all means watch this film because it is right up your alley. My recommendations to you, the review-reader, is to not make any important life- decisions in the first few days after viewing this film.IN SHORT: perfectly envelopes the style and feeling of the Hunter S. Thompson novel, it's fun, it's funny, it's weird, Johnny Depp is amazing, if you haven't seen it yet you must watch it now!!!!!!!",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
377,alevinadresi,"to get the true essence of it, you need to watch it more than once",10,24 March 2017,"I watched this movie in my senior year back in college. It was actually assigned to me as a translation project. Back then, I was like Lucy in the movie, hadn't had a sip of drink, let alone drugs. So when I watched it to translate, I was like ""what's this?"". Nothing seemed to add up or make any sense to my sober mind. But the technician next to me who was helping me with the subtitles were cracking so much that at one point she fell from the chair while laughing:)) She helped me understand the movie back then. I hated the movie for years thinking how crazy it was but there were days when all of a sudden I would remember the carpet scene and would crack also. I think this was by far the most unforgettable movie for me, and believe me I forget almost everything. And years later I watched it again, and man, I think I have fallen into love with a movie. Acting is amazing, the scenes are so funny with meticulous attention to every detail. I think for an average individual this movie has three states: you hate it, you find it funny, and then you relate to the character's longing for the past, their soul pain, and you get sad for them. I laughed all along the movie, but some scenes really made me feel for these guys. These guys wanted so badly to go back the good old days but you can't rewind time like you rewind a cassette. Past is past. Drugs are there to take the pain off, but even under their effect, they still face their rotten souls and they hate themselves like in the scene with the waitress. I mean how can you hate the movie if you look at it from this perspective? As a final funny trivia, did you notice that Benicio turned into a werewolf in this movie and actually played the Wolfman later in his career? And there was a Che photo in one of the hotel rooms, and he later played Che? I found it really funny too. He had said that after this movie he couldn't find a job for two years, and these two things seemed like a bizarre coincidence:))",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
378,drgonnzo,most successful try of turning a book into a movie,10,13 September 2006,"First I wanna say, every movie that was based on a book, no matter how good the movie has been, is nothing compared to the original book. Every true reader would agree with me. Its not the question either the books or the movies. Some people are fans from movies some like books more. I am talking about book fans now. When you read a book you imagine the whole story, and automatically you adapt it to your person. When they write the girl was pretty, you imagine a girl that is pretty for you, it don't has to be a concrete person, just a imagination of a pretty girl. You just know she is pretty. And the second thing by books is that they describe also feelings and opinions of the characters and also of the writer. Thats why the movie cant give you the experience you have while reading a book, the actors cant capture all the feelings with acting. Every movie is maybe 10% of the books quality. Except of this movie, this movie is same quality. There is nothing in between for me. I never seen movie that was more than 10% until this, whats 100%. Congratulations to Terry Gilliam, Benicio del Toro and of course Johny Depp. They should get academy awards for their performance. I watched the movie maybe 30 times. You have to watch it at least three times to get the right impression. And also after 10th time, something can surprise you. There are so many little details, you have to watch everybody in this movie and listen to every word spoken, even in the background. This was the first movie when I was laughing out loud like crazy in a movie theatre. I usually just laugh a little, but here I couldn't stop, my stomach was hurting me already. It is also the first movie I went 4 times in movie theatre to see it. This movie is great, is beyond any judgments. And I am still talking only about capturing the book. I am not talking about the story, which is great as well, thanks to autor Hunter S.Thompson.Between 1 and 10 its 29. its the best movie ever.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Thompson's 1971 novel of the same name, Terry Gilliam's Cult-Classic 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is Utter madness! Its bleak, high & absolutely nuts! But Gilliam's brutally honest Storytelling along-with Depp & del Toro's mesmerizing performances take this unusual film to dizzy heights.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not just a psychedelic comedy, but also an astute piece of literature-cum-political science on a period in American history that was just really strange. This is far from your everyday movie, and only for those with a deep appreciation for the diversity of film-making. The directing is fast paced with offseting angles a lot of wide angle lenses. Gilliam has a style which is unmistakable, it's like walking around inside of a Dali painting, everything is distorted and stretched to create a strong sense of surrealism. Yet his approach is much less offensive than Oliver Stone, who desperately throws every single filming trick at you repeatedly until you are pummeled into submission.

When I say that this is Depp's best role, I'm well aware that that is not a statement that should be taken lightly. But his efforts to reveal Raoul Duke's twisted, drug-abusing persona, must surely be considered one of the finest performances in the history of film. Del Toro's efforts are only eclipsed by his work in ""The Usual Suspects"" and possibly ""Traffic"". This movie didn't go down well with a lot of people that deemed it to be a useless and unnecessary display of moral vulgarity. That is one way to look at it. I choose another. Sure, drug taking is what this movie is about, that, and the effects it had on people in a time that was confusing and change was right around the corner. A serious issue becomes comedy, simply because of the fact that the characters are so utterly over-the-top in their indulgence of illegal substances, that you, as a ""fly on wall"" viewer, cannot resist laughing at the chaos that these distorted minds are creating. So in short terms: If you're a kind of person that will have a moral objection against this kind of a movie, just don't watch it. If you on the other hand, have the ability to enjoy two of the greatest actors of our time, directed by an immensely talented director, and take it for what it is, run out and get yourself a copy right now.

Christina Ricci is fortunate that her vapid role in this travesty didn't stall her career before it actually caught fire. Ellen Barkin is totally out of place at the end as a waitress in a run-down dive of a restaurant in North Las Vegas. Her make-up job was so BAD that I failed to recognize her at first. What can I say about casting Gary Busey as a California Highway Patrolman? Not much. The scenario as such is disjointed, pointless, and lacking any kind of real social comment or value.

I was expecting something totally different, so the first 20 minutes bored me. I became biased and didn't like the movie while I was watching it, but a couple of days to think about it, and I understood the whole concept. There was a meaning behind the seeming madness. I watched it again and understood the whole thing. Most of the good moments of the movie, you wouldn't catch when you watch it first. You'd think that the whole drug induced paranoia is a 'part' of a bigger story, but that's why you need to watch it twice. This is not one of those movies you'd watch to get laughs, and not a movie that you'll hope thrills you.The scenes where they're high, especially the ones where they go to the circus high on ether, and the other where Gonzo asks Duke to throw a radio in the bathtub, are exceptional. The whole concept can drive you into a different world if you let it, really. And then the scene where Gonzo just wants to 'Carve a Z on your forehead' sums everything up. It's a different movie, and it's aimed at a particular audience. It's not a feel-good movie, it's tragic. But then it isn't Requiem for a Dream either, so I don't know where to classify it. Watch it once and you'll probably not like it. It might be too 'slow' or you'd curse the 'lack of action'. Watch it twice and you'll probably understand the last lines of the movie, which is truly chilling, and I'd say it's one of the best lines ever said on screen.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I had briefly read about the film and as I started watching it, there created a weird trippy mirror reflection in my mind of my hero playing his hero who was fast becoming mine. Like a set of Russian dolls, each one beautiful and detailed as the one before but no less or more important. Words smithing their way into my mind with a semi-familiar voice-over admitting to oversized bats and flying manta rays in the otherwise clear desert sky - OMG man, that piddly flyswat ain't gonna cut it! Then surviving bat-country, my mind became deeply immersed into the pool of swirling paisley floor carpets that undulated as Raoul Duke tried to walk across them, inconveniently causing his footing to be fraudulent. My eyes were very wide and like a mildly stunned mullet flapping around in my seat, my laughter was inconsolable.Since watching this film, I've learned more about who Hunter S.

390,WhiteTortoise,The Savage journey into the heart of the American Dream goes bigscreen.,8,5 June 2002,"Johnny Depp brilliantly portrays Dr.Gonzo, or Raoul Duke, or Hunter S. Thompson whichever name he goes under, in Terry Gilliam's excellent adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson semi-biographical Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Gonzo and his faithful attorney/drug buddy played by Benicio Del Toro set off to the artificial world of Las Vegas in search of the American Dream. These twisted and absurd individuals represent what is left of the 60's drug culture washed up and left hanging by the passing fad they were promised was a revolution. They bring with them their hope in the spirit of the sixties and their complete lack of self-control on the funniest drug binge imaginable. This movie is enjoyable to watch many times over if not for the comedy then for the brilliance of the star actors, watching them change into their roles is a real treat. I've seen this movie half a dozen times so far and I'm still picking up on elements of it I missed on earlier viewings, that is a sign of a great movie. The plot at times is buried between boughts of drug enduced madness, not only for us but for the characters as well but at its heart this is a movie about two drug abusers (that word doesn't come close to describing what they are) whose dreams of the sixties have vanished much like the so called American Dream did in the late fifties so they set out for the booming and confusing realm of Las Vegas in search of signs of either. This book is required reading in many colleges now for the same reason it makes a great movie, in the end everything from the actuality of the characters and events to the question of the existence of the American Dream is debatable.

One, a writer, the other, a lawyer. They go to Las Vegas to ""write"" a report for a magazine on some bike races, but end up getting smashed, stoned, twisted, and becoming utterly beautiful human beings. The movie is an alluring piece from the guy who brought us Brazil and 12 Monkeys (yes, this is also the guy who did all those little drawings for a small BBC show on a short time ago). The movie is, in itself, a hazy narcotic dream which sheds its elegant glare upon you within the first minute. It is a completely insane look into the drug world of the 1970's, except, not. Here's the thing. THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE MOVIE. It was originally a novel, Terry Gilliam made a movie out of it. Take it from there, formulate your own ideas about what the movie will or won't be like, but whatever you think up will be shattered by a dreamy world unlike you have ever experienced before. You will finish watching the movie, after trying to keep up with its COMPLEX plot line etc. and you will be utterly worn out. I guarantee that you will begin having stuff pop into your head that you will have no idea where it came from. This is normal, unless of course, you are currently fluent in the language currently in the spotlight. You will have fun with the movie, but, maybe you won't. Judge for yourself. This is a pound of a movie, and yes, it tries to shed some occasional light on something of actual importance, but not that hard. My take on it is that one of the members of Monty Python's flying circus accidently bumped into the film and poked a hole in it somewhere. This lead to the eventual leak of occasional greatness here and there. Do whatever you want with this movie.

The plot was very slow moving, and most of the time, it was just two druggies swatting at non-existent animals. I was surprised at how two-dimensional Benicio Del Toro's character was. I think it was the script that was horrid, because the directing seemed great. I guess we could call some of the quotes 'clever,' but, using an analogy, just because I recite pi to the 400th decimal in a mosh pit does not make it a brilliant film. It reminded me of the films by Andrei Tarkovskiy or possibly David Lynch, in terms of how slow moving it is, but even their films appear to have a point to make.Perhaps I'm missing something, the TV monitor was turned at a bad angle, or a subliminal high-frequency noise was bothering me, but this movie, from the very few minutes in, had me turned off.

Though I haven't read the book, I read a biography on Thompson, and he was really a fascinating man, he had some interesting philosophies and no one ever knew what he was about to do next. I was excited to watch the movie, but once I watched it, I found nothing intriguing in his character. He came across as a grade A idiot. Benicio Del Toro was alright though. I guess I was expecting something a little more dimensional from Depp seeing as he was such good friends with Thompson. Maybe he could have given his character more of a posed and captivating side. To sum it up the movie was goofy and painful. oh welll.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
394,mmmCookies,"""Impossible to walk in this muck!""",9,8 January 2003,"The first time I saw this film, I thought it was funny, confusing and not much else. But after a few more times, I noticed the pure brilliancy that went into this film. Gilliam does a superb job at transforming the famous book written by Hunter S. Thompson, into this movie. Why is the storyline so hard to follow? Because drugs cause confusion and paranoia and users lose the ability of reasoning. Depp and Del Toro do a terrific job at that in their roles and both pull very strong performances. If your looking for a movie that dives into the depths of drugs and shows the humorous side of them,  then you must see this film. If you become confused, don't worry. The characters are as confused as you are. An overall excellent movie!! 9/10.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

396,ph_matt420,Daring drug comedy is a non-stop laughing classic,10,13 July 2003,"Terry Gilliam, the man behind Brazil and 12 Monkeys, brings us a drug comedy unlike any other.  If you thought Half-baked was good, you ain't seen nothing until you see Fear and Loathing. The lead characters are Raoul Duke(Johhny Depp) and his lawyer/companion Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro).  Duke gets an assignment to cover the Mint 400 bike race in Las Vegas and the two figure that this was the perfect way to live out their American Dream.  That dream being drugs, and lots of them. The plot is pretty useless as the two wonder Vegas while tripping, rolling, smack,crack, and ether to just name a few.  The camera work is also as erratic as ever (Gilliam's style) but it fits well with the under-the-influence characters.  Del Toro gained quite a bit of weight for the role, and I think it made his accent slur even more because alot of what he says sounds like he is talking in his sleep.  Depp steals the victory with Duke. Always with a cigarette holder in his mouth, Depp shows much depth and craziness in the wild mind of Duke you'd think they gave him the drugs to get the feel for them.

401,omygot,"Great Movie, One of the best in the last twenty years.",10,18 December 2004,"What a fantastic film! Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a film based off of the book of the same name, written as a semiautobiographical account of one crazy weekend in Las Vegas. The book was written by the famous journalist, Hunter S. Thompson, telling the story of Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his good friend, the Samoan, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) during their short stint in Las Vegas. They receive an advance from a magazine to cover the largest motocross event in the country. With this advance they fill a suitcase with every kind of illegal drug, they can find, and several cases of beer. With this suitcase, and the beer, they rent a fast convertible, ant head for Las Vegas. The rest of the movie is completely without plot, it simply spells out a series of events that happen over the weekend.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the modern-day western. Two buddies go out west and break every rule there is. They show up at the hotel completely out of their minds of acid, and the entire population of this hotel turns into giant reptiles. The rest of the movie is very similar, showing what is happening, and showing it again with the wildest special effects, simulating a drug trip. From start to finish, the film never ceased to entertain. The movie, by the end, showed the capable devastation of drugs. One of the more memorable scenes of the movie was when Raoul takes the adrenal fluid and everything goes to hell and a hand basket. He ""wakes up"" and he has a dinosaur tail, his tape recorder tapped to his body and there are several inches of water on the floor of the hotel, and realizes his lawyer, Dr. Gonzo, is missing. When he finds Dr. Gonzo, the Dr. has taken a young girl (Christina Ricci) captive, and is drugging her into being his slave. This scene in particular shows how harmful drugs are, and what evil they can create.The paramount facet of this film was that it gave Terry Gilliam a chance to take his creativity from the odd and hysterical animations he made for the Monty Python movies, and turn them into a live action motion picture. The style of the animation present in the Flying Circus, and especially in The Holy Grail has transitioned beautifully to a live action cinema.Above all else, the acting in this movie was superb. The ability to act so completely out of one's mind is quite possibly the most difficult thing to do as an actor. The characters are practically unrecognizable, compared to their Hollywood images. Del Toro gained forty pounds for his role, and could not find work as an actor for a long time after Fear and Loathing. The casting directors thought he was a druggie. Depp is totally bald and looks absolutely nothing like any other character in his other movies. My sister (a worshipper of Johnny Depp) walked in while I was watching the movie and proclaimed ""Who's that? He's ugly."" I looked blankly at her and said Johnny Depp, and I could swear she almost wet herself. Beyond Depp's image, his actual acting was amazing, his acting has never ceased to amaze me, but this was defiantly his strongest act I have ever seen. Not ever has an actor so convincingly played out a demented psychotic maniac (who remains lovable at the same time) better than Depp. When an actor tends to overact (Al Pacino) it normally detracts from the movie (Scarface). However, in this movie it fits Depp's character perfectly. Because it fits the character so well, and Depp does not overact in other movies, it was perfectly acceptable in the film.This is the movie that comes to mind when I think about what movie coming out now will be a classic when I am older. Absolutely brilliant, I loved every second of it, and would recommend it to anybody looking for a good movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I have driven on that road many times to Vegas over the decades (most of them giant-bat/cocaine/ether free). I was expecting much from this film. However, I had never had an image of the lead (Raoul Duke) as some kind of psychedelic Groucho Marx. I think that it may be correct to say that this story cannot translate to the cinema and might have been left well-alone. I do not know how any reviewer could give this 10 stars. There are only three or four films in my 50 year old lifetime that I would award 10 stars. Thus, my rating above is higher than it would be, simply for effort if nothing else.

I was bored from the very beginning watching Depp stumble around in a way that was more akin to a Jim Carrey film than some supposedly intelligent view of a drug-related '70s trip.  The plot was barely existent, and the film flapped around from scene to scene with no real direction.

That particular portion of the search for the American Dream is integral to the main focus of the book, so it seems strange that it didn't make it into the film.Still, great performances from Depp and Del Toro, as well as the many cameos in the film, a great script, and some excellent directing from Terry Gilliam all come together to make this a full 10 snowflake movie.Buy the ticket, take the ride...

One of the many outstanding characteristics, besides a flawless performance from its main actors, excellent direction, and maybe the greatest achievement, one of the few literary adaptations that don't have you leave the cinema with disappointment, is the visual interpretation of the influence of LSD and other psychedelica. Though it has been tried many times, in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' it has been done in a way that in my opinion deserves an Academy Award like 'Best Visual Interpretation', were there one like that (btw, number 2 in my psychedelic charts is, interestingly, a scene from 'The Simpsons', episode 809, 'El Viaje de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)', where Homer eats super-spicy chili made from Guatemalan chili peppers grown by mental patients- that causing him an incredibly accuratel realized 'trip').Well, I guess up until now you, the reader, can guess that I am one of those that loved the movie, and think it to be a mile stone in cinematographic history, along with 'Apocalypse Now', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'The Matrix'.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

421,kanstlerotis,Catatonic!,9,28 August 2006,"To dismiss this film, as a film of obscene drug use and crude behaviour is simply ignorant. What are films after all? They explore art and this film certainly achieves this with promise.let's start off with the characters, Johnny Depp plays Raoul Duke ( Hunter's fictional character) and Del toro as the attorney (oscar costa). The combination of these two actors, both method,as i should point out, is the stand out of this movie to the point where you are so immersed in their mannerisms and behaviours, that you seldom forget to watch out for so many interesting backdrops that Gilliam(Director) intended to show. Its simply a movie you have to watch over and over again, and just keeps getting better. I've been a fan of Johnny Depp for a while and have always admired him as the greatest actor in our generation, not only for his acting but also his attitude toward Hollywood. Which is why he has done such a brilliant job in this classic, having the ability to let go and show his real acting capabilities in true anti-Hollywood manner. Del Toro also gets a standing ovation, and I have certainly gained new found respect for the man.You can watch this movie without drugs, but what for? You'd be missing out on the true hunter S. Thompson experience, for which this movie was made for. Gonzo Journalism. The act of story-telling on the move.

422,Grahambo47,One Hell of A Trip...,10,24 May 2001,"Hunter Thompson's original novel was certainly a sight to behold. For the time period, and even now, it stands as one of the most unique first-hand non-fiction tales told. The idea of the novel itself sounds incredibly simple and almost too boring: A journalist and his lawyer take a weekend trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race. Although when you begin to mention the entire car trunk full of mind-altering pharmacuticals, it becomes more interesting. Even still you discover that they are not merely out to cover a race, but to seek out the heart of the American Dream and experience it for all that it's worth. And that's all within the first 30 pages of the book.Once actually arrived in Las Vegas, that's when this modern epic of psycadelic proportions begins to take place. Totally lit on almost every drug imaginable over roughly a one-week period, journalist Raoul Duke and his attourney Dr. Gonzo partake in some amazing sights and adventures. The irony lies where this story is only so unique because of their mind-altered and drug-enhanced perspectives on, what would seem like to us, a normal, almost dull, trip to Las Vegas. Things that could only happen if you were clearly sniffing some ether.The main misunderstanding in this tale is, quite obviously, the incredibly high drug-influenced theme. While some people choose to not take this too seriously and only find the drug-induced adventures of Hunter Thompson extremely funny, others do not. They see this story as basically pathetic, since their lives are so incredibly overtaken by the substances they use. One should not choose one extreme or the other: Of course it is a highly amusing story that is guaranteed to make you laugh, but is also a cause-and-consequence story, showing how much drugs like these can ruin a lifestyle. The main thing to focus on, I believe, is their particular perspectives on the world around them. Their viewpoints on life and people of the world are much different than any normal person's. It almost has a ""Catcher in the Rye"" appeal because of the main character's unique and cynnical views on the world, which can prove to be extremely interesting.The film itself I believe was put out much too late for the book, since it basically revolves around the San Fransisco acid generation of the late 60's. Still, this is by far the best book-to-movie transfer I have seen. The story in the film follows the novel almost identically, including much of the dialogue. Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke is fantastic, since Depp can so perfectly nail the strange accent and the paranoid personality of Hunter Thompson. Benicio Del Toro also does an exceptional job as Dr. Gonzo, and no one else can do such a good job of several random freak-outs in a single scene.All in all, I highly recommend this film to anyone, although it is not for the faint of heart. It still remians incredibly realistic, which includes a few vomit-induced hallucinations. But there is a great deal of humor as well as realism, but this film is certainly more than a comedy. But the first-hand experiences and general perspective of the characters can't be beat. Overall this story is more of a day-in-the-life of an average junkie who's put into extraordinary surroundings and the mayhem that insues.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

See, I've watched this movie straight, and I've watched it with hallucinogens. Personally, I don't really believe this movie was intended to be watched sober. That might sound like I'm very liberally assigning intent to a piece of art that isn't mine, but after watching this movie multiple times under each mental state, the imagery and flow of the movie seems very explicitly designed to appeal to the perceptions of someone who has consumed specifically mushrooms or acid.The film warps your perception, and completely sucks you in under the fog of these substances. Watching it sober, the film is incredibly hard to follow, and you have to really focus to get the point behind the movie. As well as the heavily LSD influenced imagery, there is deep and intense perspective on two types of American culture; the greed and excess driven culture that Vegas (and the rest of America) have adopted as their modus operandi, and the hippie drug culture that sought to change all that, but ended up becoming a fruitless endeavour full of mindless individuals looking for the next high.There is also significant social commentary about the police and conservative values, demonstrated very well when the hotel clerk (who we can assume is gay) uses HIS authority to make an ignorant cops holiday miserable, or when the man in the suit spends the rest of his life in terror worries that he might once again be confronted with ""men, wearing red woollen shirts, are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know.""The levels of meaning behind this movie aren't lost on you if you indulge before watching. As a matter of fact, I'll say that it may actually help to see the point behind the madness. Many of the scenes are spurred on by excessive drug consumption, and you get to see just how brutally ugly drugs can be, and what they can do to people. For someone like hunter s thompson, this is fine. But for average folks, some proper education on drug use would probably help to mitigate harm when it comes to these substances. To me, this movie demonstrates that both excessive consumption of drugs, or puritanical, ill informed reaction to their use are both bad. And so is anyone thinking they can ""purchase enlightenment for $3 a hit.""Final thought: I will watch this again next time I get a day to drop a tab. The way everything is designed, and the way everything flows, is specifically catered to people in a hallucinatory state of mind. It is the best movie to trip to, period. That being said, if you want to watch it straight, a lot of it won't make sense, and you will have to concentrate very hard to get to the meaning behind the madness.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

It's based on the book of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, a profound, and pretty much the only, Gonzo journalist. While the book shines in its own weird ways, Terry Gilliam's adaptation to the screen really brought out some of the sharpest points of the book and made them very funny. Additionaly, the actors are some of the best, and the weirdest seem to feel right at home playing their strung-out roles as doped up newsmen and Las Vegas locals. If you're looking for one of the greatest dark comedies about one of the most drug-induced periods in America's history, this is your film.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
427,tomjoe,If you read the book you'll get it.,10,17 September 2001,"On first glance, F&L is not a  book that is ideal for film. It is the surreal images of bats, giant lizards and cannibals that one would think would only work on the written page. I read the book before I saw the movie and was happily surprised that it does indeed pay homage to an extraordinarily original tale. The dialogue is very close to the written text and the images created are exactly as you'd imagine as you'd read the book. Looking at Duke's completely decimated hotel room near the end is testament to this fact. A couple of my mates have seen the film without reading the book and were unable to understand just what was going on, and I suspect most of the critics fell into the same boat. If you haven't read the book and been engrossed by HST's dialogue then there is no way on earth that you'll have any clue what the madness is about. So read the book, watch the film and sit back and understand just what Thompson was on about. Johnny Depp is great, Benicio is excellent. This is a movie that was always destined to be something of a cult classic. Even if you hate it, you'll understand its greatness.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
428,mjs320,Pitch-perfect depiction of drug culture,10,21 April 2003,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a perfect movie, but it is not a film for everyone.  If great art presents an insightful and accurate reflection of reality, then Gilliam's film is certainly great art.  Every note in the film (minus one: the actual Hunter S. Thompson's cameo) is carefully choreographed to represent precisely the human mind on drugs.  Of course, not everyone has the same reaction to drugs, and not everyone would have specifically this reaction to the mountain of drugs that Depp and Del Toro's characters consume (many people would probably die).  However, the film perfectly embodies the overall sensations, emotions, and behaviors of drug use (albeit often exaggerated, due to the exaggerated drug intake of the characters).  Not much happens in this film plot-wise: the characters drive to Las Vegas, Depp attends a bike race, they do drugs, they go around town at night, the start heading back to L.A., they go back to Vegas, they do drugs, etc. etc. etc.  But that doesn't matter, because this is not a film about its content nearly as much as its style: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is Terry Gilliam's supreme stylistic achievement, a virtuoso piece of filmmaking sensationally depicting the consciousness of drug use.  It is sort of the comedic cousin to Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.  I would also like to say that there are certainly deep and profound understandings of drug use in this film, often specific to America in the 1960s: Del Toro's angry disgust with all things Vietnam is perhaps the best example.  But the film does not dwell on these facets.  It focuses on the reality of drugs, while maintaining a quiet intelligence about the place and role of drugs in society.  Depp and Del Toro's characters are men who no longer feel they can cooperate with a culture that kills and excludes and injures so casually.  They have no easy answers, and all they can think to do is live by their own rules, offering a tacit condemnation of the accepted American lifestyle.  However, Gilliam never preaches or grandstands, and these elements are present but never dominant.  For people who have never done drugs or have no interest in them, this film may seem a facile joke. However, it is not; it is very deliberately considered portrayal of drug use and drug culture, a film that reflects a reality in our world with wonderful comedic exactitude.  The cast is outstanding: Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are at their absolute best, plus the film features wonderful cameos from Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Gary Busey, Cameron Diaz, Ellen Barkin, and others.  Special praise must also go to Jenette Goldstein for her absolutely fabulous scene as Alice the Maid.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

430,statsmit,"a wild, wacky, drug induced ride",10,22 February 2003,"In typical fashion, certain brilliantly conceived films are machine-gunned by many critics only to have them emerge as cult classics over time. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has certainly achieved cult status in record time.
This wild, wacky, drug induced ride along the phantasmagoric highway known as America's Cultural Revolution was Hunter S. Thompson's most famous contribution to our modern day literary annals trying to encapsulate the absurdity of our society at that time.Kudos to director Terry Gilliam for tackling a difficult book and keeping the spirit of gonzo journalism alive. It took nearly 30 years for Thompson's ravaging prose to leap off the page and onto the screen, and at times it's difficult to absorb. However, the performances of Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro force the viewer to pay attention throughout.I can appreciate how hordes of viewers and critics had problems with this film during its theatrical release. It was severely misunderstood by many folks who were not even aware of life in the 60's and 70's or Thompson's acerbic wit. It's disjointed, insane, But, now with the advent of home video and especially special features packed DVDs, viewers can have a second chance along with some fabulous background material to refocus on this cultural masterpiece. Criterion has just released a new 2-disk special edition of this film which speaks volumes about how highly they regard this production and its ultimate place in cinema.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

In order to better understand the film, one has to have read the book. Even having not read the book, paying close enough attention, many things can be caught. Fear & Loathing is a book that has & will continue to span generations. The film, which closely follows the book, is full of insight into the state of western civilization. The things observed are very awe-inspiring. It is not blunt, things are subtle. This is, if anything, very satirical.

I rented it the other day for the first time, and I have watched it 3 times already, and will probably watch it a few more times before I have to return it. I love this movie. Already entered into my Top 20.Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro star as a journalist and his attourney on a trip through Las Vegas to, original, do a reporting job on a motorcycle race. Instead, they take an exorbitant amount of drugs and alcohol and from there everything goes straight to hell.Save for the very basic plot set up to get the two main characters to Las Vegas, there really is no point to the story. It just meanders through the experiences of the two main characters as they take drugs, trash hotels, and act like total idiots.The parts of the main characters are played extremely well by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable as Raoul Duke, using body language to get across the character, and Benicio Del Toro plays the paranoid addict to the T.Terry Gilliam was perfect for this movie, using a large number of camera tricks to give the film a very surreal feel to it. The cinematography wasalso done brilliantly for this movie.So, in the end, if you have a twisted sense of humor, and find watching the psychedelic antics of two drugged out guys sound like a good way to spend a Friday night, then you should definitely see this movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Rather, the film was the telling of a story, and also the most accurate and loyal conversion of book to movie I've ever witnessed.Overall, ""Fear and Loathing"" was offensive, crude, vulgar, grotesque, and provocative... ...and I positively loved it.  In a world of popcorn cinema, ""Fear and Loathing"" is that kernel that wedges itself between your teeth and doesn't let go.  A film that gutsy and well executed is a rare and bracing treat.

It's one of those movies that I can watch with some friends and have them cracking up, or with other friends and they're looking at me like WTF? This movie is one of my favorite comedies because you can pretty much find something to laugh at in every scene. Whether it's the acting (Depp and del Toro, and even a cameo by Tobey Maguire provide some great laughs), the dialogue (""I've never been able to properly explain myself in this climate.""), and the wacky visuals, this film has so much comedic genius in it. Depp really does a great job here, and for those that are sick of Depp in Tim Burton's films, or in Pirates, well here is a great example of Depp's ability to act outside of that. Granted, his character in this does share a lot of similarities with Jack Sparrow, but this came out five years before Pirates did. Benicio del Toro is great as Depp's attorney, and friend who accompanies him to Vegas on this LSD joyride. The scenes between them are priceless. This is probably my favorite Terry Gilliam film, not counting the Monty Python films. Most of the time movies about people partying (Hangover, Superbad, etc) are boring, and predictable to me. With Fear and Loathing, the drug scenes are filled with clever dialogue, and great visuals, not pointless sex references and party jokes. This is an intelligent comedy. Some of what comes out of Depp's mouth really is great stuff. Just the sheer nature of the film is enough...it's mental.

442,shubey696,quirky brilliance,8,24 April 2004,"Truly a great movie of the modern times. It is accurate to the book and very well acted. Johnny Deep and Benecio Del Toro make you feel like your actually watching the real people. It shows that they put a lot of time into preparing those roles. Johnny Deep lived in hst's basement for three months just to get down his mannerisms and speech patterns. Everything they did was real, no wigs or any of that. Benecio Del Toro put on 40 pounds for this role. Also if you look around his wrist u can see cigarette burns, and those are also real. People who say this is just a crazy and pointless pro drug movie obviously don't understand it. It's more so an anti-drug movie than pro. Some people also say that it has no plot, no point. Well it doesn't really, but that's what you have to appreciate about it. It moves smoothly and consistently. Although most of it was shot onsite the 2 sets, bazooka's circus and the flamingo, were beautifully set up and very accurate to the times. I love Terry Gilliam's style of shooting all the 1st person scenes. He did a very good of representing the trip. The narration is also a bonus. Johnny Deep does it with emotion and sounds like hunter thompson. I also like the soundtrack, it aids nicely in the movie as a whole. You have to really appreciate the accuracy of the movie in general. all the clothes worn were HST's. Even the ""red shark"" was his. The only downside someone may see is that there isn't a solid plot. But I don't think that detracts from the movie at all.

Once I really started watching, then I began to pick up on a lot of the twists and the complexity of the storyline. I think this movie really shows the audience the funny side of drugs and in the end the comedic part of the 60's & 70's.

But jonny depp in the film is just unreal. He studies Hunter obsessively and it paid off big time. He was nominated for an Oscar as Jack sparrow, but this is his best performance ever. If you have not seen the film, you must. I must admit that the first time I saw the film I was not blown away despite the obvious comedy, but the more you watch it the more you pick up and the humour starts to jump alive. When you are drunk the film is even better to watch but you must watch it sober. Benicio del toro is a great doctor gonzo and camio's from Cameron Diaz, Tobey maguire, and Gary Busey add other class actors into the equation.

It has all, and more that the books offers, it is an amazing art of film.First, the cast is awesome. The lead roles casted perfectly with Depp and Del Toro, these two guys just transform into Thompson and Gonzo on screen... Depp totally got Thompson's weird moves, while Del Toro often looks scary as Dr. Gonzo. The bathroom scene looked quite scary the first time I saw it... The other roles are also well cast, with the likes of Flea, Gary Busey and Tobey Maguire making a brief, but comic appearance.The music is great 70's all the way, and it sets the right mood for you. The likes of Jefferson Airplane's White Rabbit (in the bathroom scene) and the Rolling Stones' Jumping Jack Flash (at the ending) are to stay with you for your entire life...The direction is well done, Terry Gilliam is the perfect choice for a film like this, after doing a couple of surreal masterpieces, he had no problem of the visual portraying of the usage of different drugs. From the strong visuals of the LSD to the slow confusion of mescaline, Gilliam always finds the way for the perfect visualization of hallucinations.Overall, it is a great movie, and I think it will stand as a timeless classic.

Either you get it or you don't. To enjoy this to the fullest, you probably have to: 1) Have an idea who Hunter S Thompson was (which the character is based on) 2) Be more than 30 years old, and at least have some concept of how ""old"" USA or Europe was like, like it used to be in the 1990s, 80s, 70s and 60s. In cocaine cowboys they tell how they in the early 80s could walk into an airport with a suitcase full of cash and buy an airplane (try that today). If what goes on here played out in 2016, these character would be in jail max 10 minutes into the movie.3) Have some knowledge of drugs and they're effects or be familiar with shady characters that has been heavily into this so you know whats going on. This movie would be a good one to watch for a young police officer.I rank it as one of the best I've seen, along with blow, requiem for a dream, wolf of wall street and other absolutely top notch movies, it belongs to the elite division and the best that has come out of Hollywood, along with series like ""breaking bad"", which all are either based on actual stories or portray things and settings in a very realistic way to what actually is going on out there in the underworld, though spiced up a little extra with more action and humor added to it.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

459,mac_diddy,Like reading the book in two hours,10,29 September 2008,"In hindsight, the timeliness of this movie being done is uncanny. Hunter was still alive, Vegas still had parts of it that hadn't changed since the seventies. It's like the producers and Gilliam knew it was ""now or never"". I remember reading the book and thinking how would they ever make this into a movie? But Gilliam did it! And I don't think anyone else could have. He's the only guy out there with the correct acid hazed vision.Every time I watch it, it takes me right back to where I was while reading the book...High School 1976.The set designers had way too much fun... and that's why it all looks perfect.The casting is, of course, perfect. It's like they read a page about a character, called the actor they wanted and presto! I'm not just talking about Depp and Del Toro... everyone! Busey as the Cop, Katherine Helmond as the Desk Clerk, etc, etc. The acting on everybody's part is spot on. Depp was superb, but he hung out with Hunter prior to shooting. Benecio del Toro really, really got Oscar Zeta Acosta! He was brilliant and possibly a bit overlooked. Depp was perfect, but so was del Toro.I realize the movie is not really that close to the book, if it was, it would be an eight hour ride.

464,Michael-92,Life is a freak show - with or without the drugs,9,4 October 1998,"FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGASWhat they don't tell you when you when you front the counter to buy your tickets for this film is that the price includes a two hour hit of movie mescaline.So you never did drugs in the 60s? The 70s? Not even the 80s? Worry not. Now in the 90s this movie is as good as, or better than, the real thing. And you won't get busted.This however is not a film about drugs. It is a film about the excesses and freaks of society, with or without your head being blown away with substances. It does not glorify drugs - quite the opposite.This is a time warp film, designed to light up the remaining brain cells of baby boomers with memories of all that social anarchy and chaos that characterised the late 60s and early 70s. Gen Xers seeing this movie however will probably continue to be quite mystified about what exactly the olden days were like.This film is not a story. It is an experience. There is no plot. A few circumstances form a flimsy backbone for a few drug crazed days, mostly in Las Vegas. The film is utterly faithful to the book by Hunter S Thompson. Johnny Depp is utterly faithful to the spirit of the lead character, Raoul Duke.  Benicio Del Toro taking the off lead as Duke's equally drug riddled attorney Dr Gonzo is also true to his part. Terry Gilliam as director brings in the best excesses from his days involved with the hallucinogenic Monthy Python team.But this film is something more than a drug riddled orgy of carnage and destruction. It is also a pithy social documentary, focussed on the late 60s but equally relevant to the late 90s. It is a sick view of a sick society. In both a literal and metaphorical sense Fear and Loathing is an acid commentary on the worst excesses, not only of drug taking, but of social existence.The two lead characters are quite obviously sick, depraved, drug crazed animals, by any reasonable construction. They are never seen in anything other than a totally wasted condition, and invariably behaving in the most outrageous anti-social manner imaginable. They have a briefcase loaded with every conceivable drug, all of which are swilled down with copious amounts of alcohol. The entire film is shot through their eyes and hallucinations abound as the special Fx team morphs the carnage that is their external reality into the bizarre visions that reflect their drug induced internal reality.However  and here is where this film is so really outstanding  every other character, every other scene, every other circumstance in the movie is also a circus side-show or a freak attraction. The essential difference is that all these other bizarre cameos all reflect an ordinary reality, uncoloured by the Hunter S Thompson orgy of drugs. As such they are, by and large, taken as unremarkable. It is only when this other kaleidoscope of human freaks and weird events is juxtaposed against the lush technicolour hallucinations of the two lead characters that the blurring between drug induced fantasy and everyday reality becomes so obvious. The distinction becomes impossible to detect.Without exception every secondary character in this movie is a freak of one kind or another. They are social misfits, they are physically abnormal, they are distorted personalities or, as in the case of the DA Convention Against Hard Drugs where every participant is seen with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, they are living contradictions of any notion of sense and normality. Even Hunter S Thompson plays a cameo role  fortunately for cult followers as yet another social freak masquerading as Mr Ordinary.The setting for most of the movie is Las Vegas  a classic freak show environment of its own. Utterly segregated by both physical location and its inherent raison d'etre from any ordinary reality, this isolated city in the desert offers the perfect surreal platform from where the two lead characters can wreak most of their own hallucinogenic carnage.This movie is rich in many ways. It is rich in its filming and its execution. It is rich in its pace and  short of walking out -  the viewer has no option but to go along for his own two hours of drug induced madness. It is rich in characterisation and totally over the top. It is rich in special Fx and it is rich in its ironic view of straight society. It is as enthusiastically politically incorrect as one would expect from all of its other excesses.As every bit as much as this is a film of its time, Fear And Loathing is also a film of this time. Little has changed about the freak show that constitutes much of the fringes of our society, and which we somehow have come to accept quite uncritically. It is only when the acerbic lens of this movie is trained upon the absurdities and paradoxes with which we all more or less peacefully co-exist that we realise how fine the line between madness and sanity really is. Importantly, as well, how impossible it is to actually know where that line is drawn. Not to mention on what side of it we each stand.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I'm a big fan of both the book and of Terry Gilliam, but somehow I didn't get around to Fear and Loathing until it was on video.  No matter. In a lot of ways, Gilliam *nails* this.  Depp's performance is absolutely amazing, and del Toro is pretty good.  Gilliam's manic direction and artistic style is both apparent and totally appropriate to the story.  Also, Gilliam's work is just getting technically cleaner as he goes on, which is impressive.  Visually, the film is a marvel. The only problem is that even in comparison to the book, the film seems a bit nihilistic.  Sure, Fear and Loathing is about staggering around Vegas souped up on enough ""heinous chemicals"" to kill several oxen, but there was also always a sense that Thompson was saying something more: the story was really about a reaction to his horror, the ""fear and loathing"" that american culture had inspired in him. Here, that spirit seems to be slightly lost -- reduced to two points when Depp taps at his typewriter and philosophizes about the 60s.  It's not *bad*, but it seems weak, and it makes the rest of the film look that much more like gratuitous hedonism (which perhaps it is, but in theory there's a point to it all). In particular, Gilliam slightly mishandles a scene at a convention of district attorneys, where Duke and Gonzo sit and watch a presentation from a stuffed shirt detective describing marijuana users.  The scene comes out a bit flat, which is surprising since from everything else Gilliam's ever done, I thought he'd jump all over the scene. I've gone on long enough.  You love it or hate it.

Though Terry Gilliam is hardly conventional this was a project that could not be succeeded.  The result is a movie lacking a clear point and message with a direction that is often unclear.Though let's not ignore it's qualities such as the impressive performance of both Johnny Depp and benicio del toro, and some of the visuals and camera work are highly impressive.  if these can keep you going though for 2 hours which in most cases does not, then I recommend that you go elsewhere for Friday night entertainment.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

472,ash-91,Best of 98. True to the Novel,10,25 April 1999,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was released theatrically in 1998. It didn't receive the recognition that it deserved. Johnny Depp gives an amazing performance as the infamous Raoule Duke (Hunter S. Thompson). He gives a stunning performance mimicking Hunter's movements perfectly and stays true to the clothing and style used in the book. Gilliam should be commended for his use of direction. The constantly moving camera makes you feel as though you are living the novel. Benetio Del Toro gives a performance of Dr. Gonzo that is down to the last detail. The movie is a rare accomplishment it stays loyal to the novel and is told in a narrative style that goes beyond anything that could have been anticipated. Depp's performance is his best to date and far surpasses Bill Murray's portrayal of Hunter from ""Where the Buffalo Roam"". Also the cameos where amazing using people that can easily be recognized from previous Gilliam efforts and using Christina Ricci as Lucy was brilliant. Word of advice read the book first.

Gilliam's view of Thompson's novel confirms his place as one of today's most insightful and innovative directors.The Polyester Kingdom and the pink flamingos, the spooky eerieness about the hitchiking teenager, the terror in the elevator... these insane, acutely staged elements make ""Fear and Loathing"" what it is: a masterfully crafted film and an enormous commentary on the drug generation and its lost dreams, 30 years after the summer of love.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

478,Travis J,In Search for the American Dream,8,7 July 1999,"About 20 years ago a movie came out by the name of ""Where the Buffalo Roam"", starring Bill Murray. It was based off the weird legend of Hunter S. Thompson. As a 20th Anniversary, Universal Studios (the company that made ""Buffalo""), and Terry Gilliam (""Brazil"", ""Time Bandits"", ""12 Monkeys"", ""Jabberwacky"") teamed up with some of the cast in the first movie and made the second take on a movie based off of Thompson. Only this one is based off of his own book, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", one of our finest books in the history of America. Although we can't say the same about the film, that doesn't mean it isn't good. This film, which stars one of our greatest actors, Johnny Depp, is actually quite good. Although it was dogged by critics everywhere, and most people hate it becuase they don't quite get what it's about, in my opinion it is one of the best films to come around in a long time. Set in Las Vegas in 1972 (Where ""Buffalo"" left off), this film will give you a headache because it's so real. It takes you on the journey that Roul Duke and Dr. Gonzo took, and it does a splendid job of doing so. While the story isn't great, it doesn't have to be. The directing and cinematagrophy is excellent, and the acting is good, Depp giving a great performance of the drug addict Duke.

484,Benwayzine,Drug-addled terrors in tiny town,8,4 September 2001,"A couple, three years ago, I decided to take in a film at the new 12 screen cineplex here in town.  I more or less decided on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for a lack of anything else.  So, I went to the theatre, got my overpriced ticket along with my overpriced popcorn, softdrinks and whatnot, then settled into my seat to take the crazed rollercoaster ride thru the drug-addled mind of one Dr. Raoul Duke, circa 1971.Director Terry Gilliam, star Johnny Depp and everyone connected with the film brilliantly captured all the visceral energy and hallucinogenic vibrancy of Hunter S. Thompson's classic take on America's roll at the craps tables of history in an era when everything was on the line.From just about everything I'd heard or read, Gilliam always had a penchant for making movies that cost the studios a lot of bucks that they never recouped at the box office.  Yet, Hollywood keeps going back to him, hoping he'll turn out that one hit that'll make it all worthwhile.  But no matter how vividly he brought the primal essence of Thompson's words to the screen, I seriously doubt that Fear was the film the beancounters were banking on. Fact is, it was just too weird for Joe Sixpack.  It just wasn't the more mainstream shtick the summer crowd usually expects.  But no matter, I felt then and I feel now that the film will eventually have its own legion of fans.Every actor in Fear turned in unforgettable performances.  But the man of the hour was definitely Johnny Depp.  He played Thompson with perfect pitch. He had every maniacal nuance down in a amazingly accurate characterisation of the famed writer.  He tweaked every tic and mannerism from the man and recreated him for the larger than life unreality of the movie screen.And the film was incredibly honest in its depiction of the time and place. Gilliam and company could've taken the phony ""higher ground"" and offered a finger wagging revisionist 90s-style version of this tale of decadent excess, but chose instead to tell it unapologetically, merely chronicling the journey into debauched lunacy, letting you make up your own mind about it in the end.And it fairly captured the essence of the hyperbolic, hyperventilated prose of Thompson's source book.Of course, it couldn't fit in everything that appeared on the pages of the original missive.  For instance, of his first hegira out of Las Vegas - when he was on the lam from hotel officials - Thompson related, ""Rum will be absolutely necessary to get through this night - to polish these notes, this shameful diary ... keep the tape machine screaming all night long at top volume: 'Allow me to introduce myself ... I'm a man of wealth and taste.'""Sympathy?""Not for me.  No mercy for a criminal freak in Las Vegas.  This place is like the Army: the shark ethic prevails - eat the wounded.  In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught.  In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.""But the real point of the film - and the book - was made during the flashback sequence of a scene at the old Fillmore Ballroom where these lines were extracted from the book and read verbatim into the movie's narrative: ""Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas.  Five years later? Six?  It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era - the kind of peak that never comes again.  San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.  Maybe it meant something.  Maybe not, in the long run ... but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.  Whatever it meant ...""So now ... five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.""Even tho I hadn't laughed so hard at a film in years, in the final analysis, it wasn't really a ha-ha funny movie.  It was actually a very sad one.  It wasn't about the debacle of the 60s/early 70s so much as it was about what's happened to us since.  Some of us became casualties of the madness, to be sure.  But somehow, most of us made it thru to the other side.  The boomers of the 60s are now the people who are calling all the shots.  Who knows what kind of long-term effects all those drugs had on the psyche of the nation?We've put on a few pounds to make up for all the brain cells we lost, and we've drifted uneasily into middle-age with many goals still unwon.But the point is still this: for all the lunacy of our younger days, we came thru on the other side.  We donned the uniforms of convention and went back to work, seeking the affects of bourgeois gentility.  And Las Vegas still sits out there in the desert in all its neon and formica fake opulence with its tacky space-age accoutrements of ostentatious luxury, untouched by the passage of time.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
485,Redwood-George,An astounding feat to capture the essence of Hunter S.

('Neuromancer' is the other)  Over the past twenty years I've probably given away six or eight copies of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', always asking the recipient to pass it along to someone else when finished. It's a watershed book that invents new rules after breaking all the old ones.  HST is a unique individual and nobody else writes like he does.As far as I'm concerned, Terry Gilliam and Johnny Depp were not only the logical choices for this movie but they may have been the -only- people that could have pulled it off.  Depp's uncanny ear perfectly captures Thompson's sound and yet he manages to inhabit the character, not just perform a cheap imitation.  Gilliam's dreamlike visual style is perfectly suited for the (well drugged) first person perspective of Raoul Duke.  While Terry's loose storytelling may feel like he's lost the reins of the narrative, instead he manages to perfectly capture the out-of-control joyride that is Thompson's trademark writing style.That said - go buy and read the book.

Sure, the book may tackle the false promises of the American dream, but the movie tackles a subject more universal. That theme being life itself. So many scenes in the movie show the random events that go immediately from one to the next, just as life is a mixture of unpredictable and random events. Not to go off on a tangent, but the driving in the desert that is so often used, shows how we as a race just go from point A to point B. That's why this movie is so brilliant.

It's very accurate, as far as the trips/side effects go, and it's absolutely hilarious.If you still don't get it, try reading the novel from which the movie spawned.  Given, the movie couldn't portray a work this deeply involved inside the human, drug-induced mind, but it is still an accurate portrayal of two guys doing what they want to do: rebel.  Lots of people get into other movies about rebellion and anti-culture.  If this were the 60's, it'd probably be well received.  So it doesn't have a well defined plot.  Try dropping acid and find a well defined plot that night.  It was an intentional element to the movie, in my opinion.  What else would you expect from such a talented director?!

490,jmy13-1,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,10,1 May 2006,"The movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an amazing work that was based on events from the great author Hunter Thompson. People may not like it the first time they see it because it is confusing, but the second time, many more things are noticed, and every time I watch it, I see something new. Being in the driver seat and seeing the hallucinations of a drug user in first person is a thrill, even if you do not ever want to try drugs. It can explain to you why people are so clueless when on drugs, but the fact that they can develop theories that would never have been thought of is interesting.

I found some of it very amusing but also found it confusing. It was difficult to make out dialogue and scenes and I was left with a 'what happened there' feeling afterwards.However, a friend was reading the book on holiday last year and told me that it was worth trying as it was a blast. I got a copy a few days later and I was hooked. I ended up reading it several times within a month as it just seemed to work so well. It wasn't long before I purchased a copy on DVD and enjoyed the film so much more. I certainly thought that both Depp and Del Toro carried off the roles perfectly and both added their own little sparkle to each of their characters.I recommend anyone thinking of watching this again or for the first time to get hold of the book first.

502,Blue_fire_fairy,worthy of worship and respect,10,4 January 2007,"I agree with author: merijn128 (Heemstede, Netherlands) in that this film is often misunderstood by most people.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is as much 'logical' as it is comprehensible: when i watched it I was (in true cliché style) absolutely wasted at a party in winter 2000. Even then i found it a simple enough story to grasp - a writing assignment on a motorcycle marathon race that leads to journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and Dr Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) in Las Vegas, but the discourse ultimately is the voice of attack upon the oppressive manifestation of greed and materialism embedded in society's take on The American Dream. This was less eminent at the time, but nevertheless prominent.Part of its complexity derives from the fact that Hunter S Thompson's book is an archetypal example of gonzo-journalism, a style of writing through which fiction takes artistic precedence over fact and actuality of content. The journalist and lawyer (fueled by drugs) find themselves exposed, and with a desire to uncover the American Dream, an extremity the film comes to criticize within the analogous microcosm of Las Vegas.. Consequently, the political and even apolitical issues are, in context quite ingeniously put across (Terry Gilliam's representation of drugs and alcohol in the film are also a spoof on the enlightenment of the 60s and the resulting excesses of the 70s). Reminding us occasionally of events outside of Las Vegas, the echoes of contemporary political unrest are given visual voice, such as the images of the atrocities in Vietnam and the random violence for change that occurred in the cities. The opening titles convey historical eeriness as footage from the Vietnam war is followed by blood spattered titles in Ralph Steadmanesque font, furthermore made all the more sinister by the 'raindrops and roses' background music.Threads of story are unwoven through narration, monologue and dialogue, visual deployment and flashbacks, even by the soundtrack itself. Gilliam masterfully deploys rampant drug use exposed in the film as a vehicle through which the viewer can see how equally bizarre and intoxicated the sober world is. In the scene where Duke and Dr Gonzo are booking into their first Las Vegas hotel, they come to find that the entire hotel bar reception becomes (where once their were people) a cataclysm of reptiles. Indicating that affluent society is as shameful and as immoral as the behaviour of Duke and Gonzo in their ingestion of booze and alcohol.We can see that Duke has Duke has a firm conception of the American Dream, but what the audience are left to ponder is why he exasperates so much apprehension, love and fear of it.Dukes awareness of the discrepancy between American ideals and the actuality of America's brutal manifest destiny, is the national fate of delusion and greed exemplified in the Circus-Circus casino. Our narrators mad visions make him now one with the frantic ""believers"" of Las Vegas, what sets him apart is his uncompromising drive to locate an authentic understanding of just what has gone wrong, both within himself and with his country.Whether Duke and Dr Gonzo find the American Dream is left for the viewer to dictate, since the Dream itself is subject to the whims and visions of the individual. It can be clear at any rate though that it is not an hallucination, and it is not unlikely ever to be realized. With this in mind, Fear and Loathing is a landmark film brought about by a maverick director.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
503,julienlannert,Critics will stay ignorant,10,30 August 2020,"I have read many reviews like ""repetitive and pointless"", ""hallucination to hallucination with no destination"". They are missing the big point. I think the movie beautifully described it all, during the 60's, the acid wave had a destination but afterwards like Raoul says, that was over, now ppl are merely living. In addition, the movie illustrates how it's rarely about the destination, which is also probably a greater analogy on life. So to assume you need to confine to standard movie story arch's and film type is outrageous when creating a movie on the counter culture. The negative reviews just come from people to ignorant to realize the beauty in all of it, especially acid culture",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Its a psychedelic approach to understand whats cooking in Thompson's mind. It's an amazingly wild adventure to watch it sober or tripping. Laughable man. There is no need for a plot here because Thompson's work of art astonishes you in every scene of the movie. Duke and Gonzo couldn't be portrayed by anyone else rather than Depp and Del Toro. They unravel the mystery of the acid-rock days of Thompson's adventures and give the watcher a mind-blowing performance in the film.

Brief appearances from Cameron Diaz and Christina Ricci were what I had looked forward to, but they were short lived and meaningless to the plot of the movie. Then again there really wasn't a plot to it period. IF this movie was based on a book, then I can't imagine taking even that much more time to read about an endless string of drugged up, non-humorous jumble.

For maximum enjoyment just lean back and let the two biggest druggies in motion picture history entertain, amaze, disgust and surprise you! This is, in my opinion, Depp's best role. He does play eccentric characters very well and Raoul Duke is about as eccentric as they come. Del Toro plays Duke's ""legal adviser"" (more like partner in crime, really) with great skill and the two have a rare sort of love/hate friendship rarely seen in film.Some people I've spoken are critical about how the movie portraits drugs. I am not of this opinion at all. Sure, some of the trips we are shown look pretty awesome, but all in all the usage of drugs in the film just depicts a couple of real losers, bums. Their existence is nothing short of pathetic and this point is proved, not by dramatic sequences such as in f.e ""Requiem for a dream"" but with humor. As a viewer, one is not so much horrified by all the narcotics and their effects as disgusted in a funny way.For me, the movie was just on the edge of being vulgar and ""too much"" but it managed the balancing of that very important edge in a skillful manner. 8 / 10!",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
510,merijn128,My bible,10,8 February 2003,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was never really understand by many people. Most didn't saw that the movie wasn't about some guys using ALOT of drugs and doing weird things. It's about a man who would have wanted to stay in the 60's for ever. This didn't happen and he wounded up in the 70's. A time he couldn't identify himself with. He travel's to Las Vegas with his lawyer and a huge amount of drugs to cover a motor race. The movie is based on the non fictional book from Hunter S Thompson. Thompson was Raoul Duke. Most things really happened. Thompson was a gonzo journalist.I even saw this movie on the Christian Church list of forbidden movie's. Why ?? Because it could provoke people to use drugs ?? Then just look at the movie again. Thompson himself said: You can get much higher without drugs than with them. I didn't understand it either for that matter"".Drugs was his way to run from it. Run from what you might ask. Run from the American Dream. A subject not totally covered within the movie but is central in the book. The American Dream represented in Las Vegas was going there with a few hundred dollars and leave rich. The dream that everyone could get to the top. The top of what? This world turns on one word: Respect. Everyone wants it but only some deserve it. The American Dream was to get Respect without giving respect to others. The way of winning in a stale Las Vegas casino and going home rich and respected. After the 60's this world went to hell. You can see it everywhere. Socialists are almost extinct. Thompson understood that and he couldn't cope with it. He used drugs to deal with it but at the same time he got into the main nerve. A merry go around in the Bazooka Circus, what he earlier described as the Sixt Reich. He wanted the worst first making it easier to cope with the rest.I myself as a 1985 born never knew what the 60's really was about. I saw the Woodstock '69 movie, I listen to Jefferson Airplain, Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd, but this book and movie made me realize what it was about.People fighting for believes they had, not in a military way. Their energy would prevail. They had set up a new religion. A one of peace, inspired by musicians and drugs. Though the new religion wave didn't made it and rolled back, resulting in this movie.K, enough for the philosophic talk, I could go on with that for hours. Let's talk about the movie. The movie is a very good adaptation from the book. Every word said in the movie is taken literally from the book. However not in the same order. This makes the movie a different story, les philosophical but still with some great points in it. It's the way Thompson would have wanted to do the trip. That would be his ideal book instead of the book he wrote which was the way it actually happened.Johny Depp puts on the strongest role in his career. The way he walks, talks, smokes, acts. It just makes you believe this is a real drug frenzy. Along next to him is Benicio del Toro the fat lawyer, coming in a good second place for best actor. Both where connected with each other. Together they where one. The drug related images where perfectly done. No one had ever before made such a real representation of a drug trip.Together along this movie is something different. A film which I can see every week just to enjoy the acting of Depp and the beautiful quote's from Hunter S Thompson.Check it out, but remember to look past it's outer shape and into the real meaning of the movie.

'cause anyone damaged as severely as that does not deserve to live. and what the hell is wrong with such a large amount of people? i mean, the movie isn't even in top 250!!!! really, come on. i allude to anyone who is not registered on IMDb, reads this and likes the movie, please, do register and vote 10. we own hunter that much. depp's performance alone earns that vote. and if you don't like it, trust the judgment of some of us with a sense for style and quality and go criticize something else. for a guy of my lifestyle, this is by far the best movie ever made. also, from purely objective point of view, it should be in personal top 10 of anyone who thinks they know anything about movie culture altogether. as you've probably noticed by now i'm not writing anything about the movie itself, because it just doesn't deserve to be spoiled in any way.

Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon"".Sheer brilliant mayhem ensues, the Depp/Del Torro duo deliver comedic excellence, whilst Depp in particular, having spent weeks learning Hunters impulsive mannerisms packs the film full of endlessly quotable Hunter-esquire commentary.A few days into the trip, with a growing list of offences in their debris-strewn wake, the two lead characters barely know who they are, let alone who won the race, but that's no reason to go home.An unrestrained portrayal of the semi-autobiographical book, with no content compromise for anyone the story is told as intended, with numerous canny nods toward Hunter S Thompson all adding to the quality of the final product (check out the IMDb Trivia page).PERFECT",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Despite Depp's acting being good, it was certainly below his usually high standards.
The movie itself was quite bad. I haven't read the book so I didn't get the point at all! Cinematography was bad too. I don't like movies about junkies, but ""Trainspotting"" (1996) was a good example of such movie. The main difference between ""Trainspotting"" and this flick is ideas.

The paranoid journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and intensely interesting Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) head out to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400. But they are not alone, along with them they probably bring over 20 types of drugs, and a head full of bats! This is an excellent adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's book, Terry Gilliam's dizzying directing style really fits well in this post-hippie era, and Johnny Depp's performance is THE best I've seen in a while. The only weak point of this movie, is most likely the third act, but the unforgettable ending sequence takes care of that. And this is pretty well made, considering they were trying to adapt the book on a budget of $18,500,000. A must see for all potheads, fans of the book, and fans of Terry and Johnny, and other people who can't get over how the charismatic style of the 60's changed so dramatically.***1/2 / ****",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I think that is because the humor is above Cheech and Chong. It is very entertaining and very literate, the way that Raoul Duke phrases things.Johnny Depp does a wonderful job as one of his zaniest characters to date, and based on a real person no less. One of the most entertaining films I've seen this year, one of the best from a top-notch filmmaker. The directing, acting, and screenplay are all top notch. Definitely bizarre and unusual, this film is not for everyone, but if you want a literate Cheech and Chong this might work for you.

The film follows the book perfectly and is the funniest thing i have ever read or seen. Every word said can make you grin, every scene you watch can make you laugh. The total mind bending trip which Acosta and Thompson go on in this book is so drastically mad it has to be true, no one could possibly make any of it up.

This movie is definately a keeper. It is one of the best drug movies I have seen in a long time (why do the best drug films have Johnny Depp and/or Benicio Del Toro? ie. Traffic, Blow, and now... Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Based on the original book by Hunter S. Thompson it truly lives up to it. This movie screams cult classic. The movie's plot (Which is ridiculously hard to follow at times) revolves around the glammorish yet trashy streets of Las Vegas in 1971. Writer Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo(Benicio Del Toro)have to travel to Las Vegas to cover a story about a motorcycle race. Thats when they decide to take advantage of the situation and live out their own version of the ""American Dream"". Armed with a convertible and a briefcase full of every drug imaginable they go on a binge on the rollercoaster that is Las Vegas. The drug scenes is this movie are increadible, it almost makes you feel as if you yourself are tripping out with them. They throw a barrage of wierd noises, hallucinations, and camera effects and it creates a teeth gritting expirience. If this movie has any weakness is that sometimes it seems too unbelievable when it looks like they have almost no consequences for their actions. The movie is also one of those where you either love it or hate it. But besides that its a grim look into America's drug culture that seems to have a dark sense of humor. This movie is a must see... It stands proudly in my collection.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

527,j-wieleman,A savage journey to the heart of the American Dream,10,2 June 2010,"Review of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 'A savage journey to the heart of the American Dream' is how Hunter S. Thompson describes his book. Not many have accomplished to do this in only a single sentence. This story of a journalist and his loyal attorney on a trip to Las Vegas has caused many people to try and find the message behind it all. This is all brought in perspective brilliantly in the filmed version of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas, thanks to Terry Gilliam. A very important feature in the story is the characters' states of mind. Thompson's initiate goal was to transfer the emotions felt by the characters to the reader, which is of course very difficult in books. His writing together with Ralph Steadman's illustrations indeed accomplished this, but Terry Gilliam topped it by far. Gilliam made perfect use of all the possibilities a movie brings, especially focusing on use of light and color. The movie sucks you into the screen and makes you part of the whole situation, causing you to experience the same state of mind as the characters. Most of the time this is confusion or at 'loss of basic motor skills', quoting the main character during a heavy ether trip. So how did Terry Gilliam make this effect on the viewers work? There are several techniques that are spotlessly used throughout the movie. The most important being the use of several colors, which are constantly used for explaining moods and emotions. You are able to distinguish three main colors: orange, white and blue. The color orange is constantly used when the characters are completely out of their minds. Blue is used to show a calm state of mind and white is used in the morning after a heavy night. I have to admit that I did not notice this the first time I watched the movie, but that might be the brilliant thing about it. Since you might have to watch this movie several times before you come to fully appreciate it and understand all aspects of it. I also like to explain Gilliam's choice of colors with Leonardo da Vinci's theory of light. In his theory he stated that every color has several international meanings. This is what he said about orange, blue and white. Orange stands for party, cosiness and joy. Blue shows truth, sanity and a clear mind. White stands for light, purity or emptiness. Another technique which was used to set the mood of the characters clearly was the way in which the light effects are used by Terry Gilliam. He uses the bright flashing lights of Las Vegas and the chaotic flashes of light occurring throughout this movie to set the mood of the characters in this movie very well. These effects create a setting in which the confused and chaotic states of mind, in which the characters are almost constantly, really stand out. The flawless acting from Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Torro in this movie expressed the states of minds of the two main characters Duke and Gonzo in this movie extraordinarily well. Their brilliant performance in this movie will really enhance the impression that this movie will leave on its viewers, as it makes the movie extremely convincing when the main characters and their drug-(ab)use are concerned. When seeing this movie from the beginning until the end, the humor and the psychedelic feeling stand out in a profound way. Looking back at the film, the uniqueness of the film will stand out even more than during the movie. There is a good reason why this film has many fan sites; it is a masterpiece in its kind. Throughout the internet famous quotes can be found (""We can't stop here, this is bat country!). These quotes are all written by Hunter S. Thompson, and selected from the book by Terry Gilliam. Most of the film critics have, over the years, come to agree that this movie is the father of all films about drugs. The scenes in which the main characters are completely out of their mind, are (with exceptions) a bit more difficult to fully remember because of the state of mind the viewer is in. It can be argued that the film has a relaxing effect, which makes it very easy and pleasant to watch and think about the movie. The scene which includes cruising through the desert in their car on a beautiful day is a perfect example of this. This would underline the themes and atmosphere in the story and would also mean that these associations can be made by a viewer when thinking back of the film. A film like this can be watched without the viewer thinking about the deeper motivations and theme's of this story and can then be enjoyed. But in order to ""fully"" enjoy the film, one must have a look at the entire movie as if it were any piece of art. In a poem for example, recurring sentences or structures create style figures. In this film, a similar thing is done using the lighting and color. This movie is a truly unique masterpiece, as there are very few movies like it and there probably won't be any in the (near) future either. So I can truly recommend Fear and loathing in Las Vegas to anyone who is in for an entertaining movie. It's a real must see!",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
528,mr-baked,Something about the movie... I guess.,9,9 August 2010,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wonderful movie. Some people find this movie meaningless, and I was one of these people. The first time I watched this movie I was bored, even being a person who love almost everything kind of drug-related. I watched the movie until the end, and thought ""Uh... it wasn't that bad."" ; I was just expecting something else, maybe something more serious, more sad, something more Requiem For a Dream-y. My point is : this movie isn't a drama ""despicting different forms of addiction, leading to the characters' imprisonment in a dream world of delusion and reckless desperation that is subsequently overtaken and devastated by reality"". This movie won't make you feel guilty, or feel bad after watching it, disgusted by the situation of the protagonists. If you're expecting some sad stories about drug use you can move to another movie (e.g. Trainspotting, or again, Requiem For a Dream). Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is fun. And I'd add something related to a personal experience : the movie in itself could seem a little boring, meaningless, maybe you will (at first, and like I did) be annoyed by the special FX (hallucinations, among other things). If you are in that case, watch the movie being high ; it's just so different! I hope you enjoyed reading my review (uh, I think you didn't), I'm not used to write review about things and whatever, my English isn't even good, but it's okay as long as I can share things with people.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
529,hqm14,Drug Humor at it's finest...,10,4 May 2003,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is by far one of, if not the best, drug humor movies I have seen.  However, you will have to enjoy drug humor in order to fully enjoy this movie.  So don't get angry at the movie if YOU don't know what mescaline is, or why they are acting this or that way.  If you don't understand drugs, don't bother seeing this movie.  It will make no sense to you and be only mildly humorous.  HOWEVER, if you have some familiarity with psychedelic drugs, this movie will be much better.  You will understand considerably more than someone who has no clue as to what, for example, acid is like.  I think that's what I like about this movie the most.  It's really a massive inside joke played upon all the straight, drug free, conservative drones who came to see this movie, didn't understand the humor, and thought it made no sense.  Maybe that's why I absolutely love it.

530,wharghoul,Never enough respect given!,10,9 June 2003,"I would like to make it heard loud and clear that Fear and Loathing never recieves the credit it deserves. Del Toro and Depp are simply phenomenal in their portrayals of two wonderfully twisted characters. I don't think it is possible to underestimate the difficulty of acting under the influence of certain substances that the two (hopefully) have never consumed in real life. Furthermore, for those of viewers who are prone to discredit the movie based on its heavy drug influences/referrences, I advise you to pay close attention to moments like Depp's monologue from the hotel room regarding the flower generation. There is MUCH more going on in this film than simplistic drug humor. I feel sorry that some people seem incapable of realizing the wonderful social commentary contained within. I would also add that this movie has achieved cult classic status in many social spheres and should not be breezed past. I highly recommend this film for anyone, excepting small children and the elderly, of course.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

532,garciacb,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,8,24 January 2011,"Of all the movies that I've seen, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is honestly the most tripy movie I've seen. The way the movie is told goes well with the main character's (Raoul Duke played by Johnny Depp) thought process throughout the 3 days where he and his lawyer are supposed to go and cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. The movie is set up to make the audience feel like they're experiencing an acid trip as well. The viewers can see what Duke sees when he's on acid. Duke and his lawyer (Benicio del Toro) take a trip down to Las Vegas and have what I can only call a drug spree. They go to hotels in Vegas and destroy the hotel rooms, terrorize the help and total the rented cars all while consuming various types of drugs which include: acid, adernochrome (a drug derived from the adrenal gland), marijuana, ether, cocaine, and mescaline. The viewer can see how the character's react to the drugs and with each other while intoxicated making this film a chaotic mess.""Near the ending, it's set up as a parts of a flashback which is an interesting technique to use because it ties into how Duke's memory recalls events occurring while on drugs. This was a good movie for the average drug addict, or the wannabe drug addict; for the average person it's just a tripy movie. I'd compare this movie to something between Dude, Where's My Car meets any other movie that has drugs and protagonists reeking chaos all across the town.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

The two men indulge in their mind altering drugs and have quite the experience roaming through the city of sin. Dr. Gonzo played by Raoul Duke and Benicio del Toro played by Johnny Depp are assigned by a magazine with no name to cover a motorcycle race out in the desert. The story of this drugged up duo have become a cult classic with its insane drug use, and remains a favorite of many. Personally Fear and Loathing is one of my favorite movies of all time. The Depp's character is extremely entertaining, and I still to this day find myself quoting ""Jesus, God!"". While I do enjoy it, many of the people that I have viewed the film with complained that they had no idea what was happening and couldn't follow it. But that is the basis of the movie, for I feel that the characters in the film don't really know what is happening either. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is by far a stand alone movie. In all of the films that I have viewed I have never seen another one like it.

Gilliam takes care of business like no other film he's ever done. Gary Busey is the man that has one of the funniest scenes in the movie when he tries to persuade Depp to meet him at a rest spot for some hot love. I've never seen more cameo's ranging from Christina Ricci,Tobey McGuire,and even Hunter Thompson himself. If you understand even only a fraction of the world of Hunter S.

Fear and Loathing takes the viewer along for the ride as Depp and Benicio Del Torro travel to Las Vegas in search of the American dream.  To aid them in their quest they have a collection of multicoloured narcotics, a fast car with no top, some acapulco shirts and a level of mental depravity seldom seen. The plot is almost identical to that of Thompsons novel, clearing up his drug induced ramblings and almost managing to construct a linear storyline from the carnage.  Depp plays Duke perfectly, his dialogue superbly delivered in a clipped, serious voice which works well with his overly dramatic facial expressions and caricature like walk.  Del Torro mumbles his way through the majority of the film, only clearing up occasionally to offer Duke some ""legal advice"".  The imagery on display here is hugely over the top and humourous, this is not a movie to be taken seriously, it wants you to laugh at it.  It would be rude to refuse.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
543,hasdff,We cant stop here this is bat country.,10,1 November 2011,"This is one of my favourite movies of all time, by far. Every time I watch it I understand it more and more, and I'm saddened by the fact that the people who dislike or misrepresent the film are missing out on the truths permeating the subtext of this film. There is subtly underlying the drug induced madness that captures the essential essence of a long drawn out acid trip. It manages to portray the drug culture for what it is, nothing less nothing more. Exposing some fundamental truths that many seekers seem to miss or just ignore. ""The desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel. "" is what Johnny Depp's character says, and it ties together the madness quite well. There is no truth to be found, there is no great secret, there is no force tending the light at the end of the tunnel, there is no point. Self proclaimed psychonauts will disagree with me. They fundamentally believe that there is something to be learnt from these drugs. As a drug ""hobbyist"" myself I firmly believe that there is nothing to be gained from these narcotics apart from heavy stimulation and hedonistic madness. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas takes this point and exposes it in an amusing surrealist way that can really only truly be appreciated if you yourself have cowered in sheer horror and wonder at the world around you while your mind is whispering quadruple entendre and exposing you to things through a very confusing lysergide shaded lens. It conveys the lost and failed ideals of the 60s and ties it to the failure to the drug culture. Depp and Del Torro stumble around Las Vegas in a drug induced haze ruining everything they come into contact with, it's humorous to watch. It doesn't hammer you over the head with the point that drugs destroy. Other films like Requiem for a Dream or Spun beat you senseless with the negatives. Fear and Loathing does this in a way that's fun to watch, but still gets to the point or lack thereof. Peace and love in shape of a blot of acid is a lie and a fallacy. But in this same light the film also manages to show the other side. The capitalistic insanity of the modern world and how convoluted things have gotten in our current world. It asks the viewer if reality is so much better than the alternative in the same breath that it chastises drug users and their antics. Is our society any better than the chaos propelled by drug use and it's users? It paints both sides with black humour and it's fantastic to watch and take in. Simply put, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a story about the drug culture and it's failings, but it's also social commentary on our actual culture and it's failings. I don't pretend to have a solution to the problems posed by both sides and neither does the film. And that's what makes it so good, it points things out but doesn't tell you the answer (much like the LSD).Regardless it's a fantastic watch and I think anyone who is delving into psychological drug use should watch it as well as anyone interested in cinema.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

I still liked the movie (mostly).If you're looking for a normal comedy movie, don't watch this. Terry Gilliam is the Producer, yes, but think ""12 Monkeys"", not ""Monty Python"". Just look at the title, it's ""fear and loathing"", not ""silly walks"".There are different ideas about what this movie is about. Some say a drug experience, some say the ""American Dream"", some say the failure of the ideals of the sixties. I think it's all of this. Terry Gilliam isn't one to stick with just one interpretation. Some say you have to read the book to ""get it"", and maybe you do, I haven't. But the movie stands on it's own.Let's rewind to the Monty Python days. Terry made all these incredibly funny animations, including the famous foot. But why were they funny? What did they mean? I can imagine how the other Pythons must have looked, when Terry told them about his ideas. ""Yeah, then I'll draw a typical normal man, nice haircut. Then he smiles broadly, and he has white teeth, like a toothpaste commercial. But then, get this, his teeth starts moving up and down, like a piano, with a nice little tune in the background!"". In Monty Python, the aim was comedy, but it was not simple straightforward comedy, and that's what made it great. ""Fear and loathing"" is not straight comedy either, if it is comedy at all. But I think it works anyway. I felt entertained all the way through, I don't know why. Sometimes it would make me think about different ideas. Sometimes I was just curious to see what the pair would do next, and if they would actually get away with it. And that's enough for me.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
546,slowcat420,A savage & hilarious journey to the heart of the American Dream.,10,20 October 2004,"Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas is based on a book by the same name by the infamous King of Gonzo Journalism, Hunter S. Thompson. The story follows the drug-riddled escapades of journalist Raoul Duke (HST's alter-ego) and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo (the alias of Chicano rights activist & lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta) as they search for the American Dream in the heart of Sin City itself, Las Vegas. The movie holds very true to the story line of the book, and director Terry Gilliam has done a fantastic job of conveying the effects of the drugs & the chaos of the story itself - all on a very limited budget. Johnny Depp (portraying Duke) and Benicio del Toro (Dr. Gonzo) put on the most underrated performance of their careers as they portray the Good Doctor & Acosta - Johnny lived in Hunter's basement, ""The Dungeon"" for 3 months, studying the Doc's every move & borrowing extensively from his wardrobe, and, eventually, the Red Shark (a 1971ish Chevy Impala convertible). Benicio packed on the pounds, read everything he could get his hands on by Acosta as well as thoroughly consulting Hunter on his friend's habits & mannerisms to gain insight on his role. The trip was originally to cover the once famous Las Vegas motorcycle race, the Mint 400, but immediately descends into a downward spiral of violence (just a little bit of gun & knife waving), a full menu of drugs and scaring naiive tourists. It's a hilarious romp, involving hitchhikers, an anti-drug police convention with Duke & Gonzo smack-dab in the middle, and an unfortunate Barbara Streisand portrait-painter, but there is a brief moment of lucidity, an eloquent speech written by Hunter Thompson, that encompasses just what the trip was all about. Look for cameos by Flea, Lyle Lovett, Ellen Barkin & Penn Jillette, as well as the Doc himself.It's definitely not a mainstream movie, with climaxes & action heroes, that everyone will enjoy, but to those familiar with Dr. Thompson's work and those that can maintain an open mind - ENJOY.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
547,comicsnut,Just a quick point...,9,12 September 2012,"I believe it to be one of the largest travesties that Benicio Del Toro received such harsh criticism in this film. He is absolutely brilliant, IMO. Picture him from this movie, then picture him in Crash and then in Usual Suspects. If you didn't know, you would believe it to be three completely different actors, three different people.De Niro, Hollywood's darling that can do no wrong, received such high praise and many awards were bestowed upon him in for what he did to his body in order to star in, what I believe to be an average movie: Raging Bull. Raging Bull has it's good moments, but it is poorly edited (as are most of Scorsese films), poorly acted and melodramatic. I think Del Toro received poor marks on this film because most reviewers couldn't get past the drug use and simply pigeonholed the film as a ""drug movie"". I don't use drugs yet I find this movie wildly entertaining. While drugs play a role, it's to illustrate their uselessness and the uselessness of the hippie culture as a whole. Thompson even says as much when he criticizes Timothy Leary as being the sole destructive force to the ideals he tried to create.The most basic outline of the plot: ""Journalist goes to cover a race, does nothing but abuse drugs and gets nothing accomplished"" - reflects the opinion of drugs, the hippie movement and government that I think Thompson wanted to relate to people.Basically, I just wanted to give Del Toro - one of the most underrated actors around now - his proper due, and the respect he deserves for this movie. There isn't a moment he's on film that I'm unable to unlock my eyes from him. Reminds me of Steve McQueen from Magnificent Seven and how he did all these little things to stand out from Yul Brenner. Del Toro takes this to the Nth degree. Del Toro manages to do this with subtlety AND while being in your face.It is a brilliant performance.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

This film comes from the glorious days of Johnny Depp taking obscure roles in films and totally immersing himself in the character. Benecio Del Toro's performance was second to none, and I cannot for the life of me comprehend why someone would think this to be the ""worst movie ever"". God save us that we actually have to think a little when we sit in those awful theatre seats. Heaven forbid we're required to use our imagination a little bit and not have it handed to us in the form of Hollywood mindless pap. The film, del toro, Depp, and of course, Gilliam are all brilliant.

I never like to watch movies more than once typically but this film is so incredibly shot and acted that I get something new every time I see it. It is hysterically funny and the acting of Depp and Del Toro is the best I've ever seen from both of them. The universe Gilliam creates with the art direction and cinematography is flawless. It's poetic, tragic, and seamless pure magic. It's hard to say if there was a script or if much of the film was ad-libbed because it's so spontaneously acted. You have to watch it again and again to catch all the dialogue. In the spirit of Sling Blade it has this incredible taut tension throughout as if something terrible is going to happen, but ironically that is what eventually provides the biggest laughs; the ""seriousness"" of the trip.....",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Jhonny Depp did a great job portraying Raul Duke, he was just as i pictured him when i read the book. Benicio Del Torro played a great role as Dr. Gonzo, although i thought that Gonzo would be a little bit shadier. i would recommend this film to anyone who isn't close minded, and anyone who likes to have a good time.

I think that this is a great characterbased movie, in which the point for including all those weird acidhallucinations, dizzy camera movements, confusing speeches andstrange silly adventures are a way to show how sick and rotten isthe world in which the characters are trapped. It works mostly forthe main character's monologues. When he talks about theAmerican dream and how society spoiled it, it's easier tounderstand the meaning: It's implied that American dream is nolonger a reachable goal but a bunch of forgotten ideas that nobodybelieves anymore, and when this character realized it, he had noother way to escape than self-destruction. It's a metaphoric,reflective movie rather than a plot movie. It is not a tale about twocharacters reaching a goal, it's made to think about what isexposed. It can be either a masterpiece or a piece of crap. It's just a matter of perspective.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
552,sherms31,Great Movie,9,21 November 2012,"An extravagantly subjective, linguistically rich, and outrageously bad-behaved, Fear and Loathing is a slapstick comedy that is both funny and poignant as it is worldly. Director Terry Gillian gleefully portrays Thompson's panicky experiences through quick flips in and out of his drastically expanded consciousness. Short Shorts, a receding hairline, a sporty bonnie hat, orange aviators, and a jaunty cigarette holder, Depp accurately impersonates Hunter with both his appearance and attitude. Depp proves himself a master of movements as though someone had just pulled out his power source (much like his role in Pirates of the Caribbean), but the movie's edge is provided by Del Toro, who gained 40 pounds for the role, and honed a paranoid glare sharper than the hunting knife that he regularly brandishes. This film brings vulgarity and comedy together to produce a radically honest portrayal of a truly tough period in American history (Vietnam).",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
553,soul_assassin_45,One Big Trip,8,17 November 2004,"Terry Gillam's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a quite powerful movie. Especially in entering the surreal visions of the mind of the drug abuser. They, I think, are pretty close to the real thing - so far from reality... And the movie actually is like on big trip. And this compensates for the lack of the real storyline or a thoroughly thought through plot. There is no plot in a trip. And in this (in what many might see a downside), in my opinion, this movie succeeds. The amount and tight sequence of the hallucinations, visions, fears and paranoias of Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo might seem even too chaotic and anarchistic - but isn't that the point?Journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) are on their way to Vegas to cover a big motor-cycle race. They're following the American dream, as Raoul tells us. They're going to get the best of Vegas and get high, so high where even god can't see. And their trippin' - non-stop. If the race stops, Raoul doesn't even know who won. And the trip goes on like this. Until the end. Doesn't it get boring? No. Under Gilliam's golden hand ""Fear and Loathing"" takes forms so surreal and deep dives into an abusers mind that it will never get boring. And the script? - Who cares about the script, when you get a trip of your life?Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke reminds me a little of Tim Roth in ""Four Rooms"", but where Roth over-acts, Depp is totally in his element as the totally screwballed journalist. Beautiful performance. Benicio Del Toro as the weird Gonzo seems a little like the lizards which Raoul sees on one of his trips. Nice acting, comes pretty close to Depp. ""Too weirs to live, but too rare to die,"" as Raoul describes Gonzo - works for Del Toro, too. His performance in his movie is manic, and here, it is apt. Both leads go so far out here as never before, and as they never will again probably. Lovin' it.""As your attorney"" I advise you to suppress all your prejudices that you have for weak story-lines and brace yourself for the trip of your life. Instead of drugs, take a hit of ""Fear and Loathing""8/10",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro were brilliant. There is so much you pick up every time you watch it. One of my personal favorites already.

Then it just becomes a drug binge right from the road to sin city.

558,surbhirihal-705-257985,Review Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas,7,6 June 2013,"At the start of the film we immediately know what kind of film this is going to be. A film that not everyone will enjoy. A film which will have reviews rating from very negative to very positive. Never in the middle. A film about 2 retards that can't control their drug problem. In this film we follow a journalist named Duke and his lawyer who we hear is called Dr Gonzo. They go to Las Vegas to write a report about this desert race, but everything is more difficult doing when you are under the influence of psychedelic drugs, riding trucks in a desert during a heavy sandstorm which ruins your beer being no exception. The rest of the film features drugs, passing out at casino's, drugs, room fights, drugs, buying orang-utangs, alcohol and more drugs. 'not a very sophisticated plot' you're thinking. Well, that is what the majority of the people thought watching the film at first. But that is, until you understand the story. The scenes in which you saw the Vietnam War and people protesting against it and the hippie festival were there for a reason; they showed a new type of ethics people had in this time. For people who didn't follow history class; it takes place in the 60's, when hedonism became an important word. Pleasure was increasing in importance and that is why people are protesting against the war and having festivals which last for days where pleasure is the one thing that matters. For a lot of people this idea held and still holds true. Hunter S. Thompson is not one of those people. He believes hedonism is weird sick and twisted. The exact words we could use to describe Duke and Gonzo. Especially Gonzo. His sickness is brought out very well in the scene where he brings this girl he met on the plane to the hotel room. In the plane he put some drugs in her drink and then took her with him. Pretty sick and desperate. Of course Thomson does not only want to show how sick Gonzo is, we already knew that, but he intends to put the viewer against hedonism. No sane person would still want to be as hedonistic as Gonzo after watching this scene. His portrayal of hedonists is of people that generally fail in society Another scene portraying this idea of Thompson is the one in which we see Duke and a random hippie licking some LSD from Duke's hand in the bathroom. Whilst they're doing this a casual man in a suit walks in, obviously someone who has a good job and a lot of us want to be like. Watching these two hedonists he immediately flees the bathroom. Duke does not feel ashamed though, he convinces himself that this man is jealous of him because he will never know the joy of being 'free' as hedonists see themselves. The best scene probably is the one where Gonzo lays half-dead in the bathtub, intoxicated with every drug known to man-kind after a wild night out. Next to him lays a broken radio, a broken mirror, there is foam everywhere in the bathroom and the room looks like the Vietnam War changed its setting. Obviously this is want Thompson is trying to tell us; enjoy life too much without thinking about the causes and this happens to you. The actors were chosen with care for this movie, and they succeeded well indeed. Johnny Depp is always wearing his dirty flower shirt and his hat on his bald head, and never goes anywhere without the cigarette holder in his mouth, making him hard to understand. The effect of this all is that Depp, who plays Duke clearly comes off as the mad freak he is. Del Toro playing Gonzo did his role great too, portraying the beer- bellied, lumpy loser he is. The use of light and color in this movie is important. It sets the mood and gives you a good impression of what is must feel like to be under influence of drugs. The light is focused on the most important character in that particular shot. This has the effect that you get into the movie quite easily, at least, it is what they're trying to do. There's also a lot of darkness. Rooms which are made darker than they are in real life. This is to express the fact that they are imprisoned by their own thoughts and feelings and they can't get out of the mood that drugs brings them in. The way the drug effects were portrayed in the film were really convincing to make the audience experience the situations as if they were involved themselves. This is most probably the main factor what made us like the movie.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
559,mirton,A Savage Journey.. Yet Again..,10,24 September 2005,"I rate this movie 10 for two reasons... The original, flamboyant, gonzo writing style of Hunter S. Thompson combined with the twisted, enigmatic, ""magnifying glass"" film-making of Terry Gilliam. All of this resulting in an incredible combination for a classic masterpiece.Some people automatically reject or dislike this movie because it's about drugs. You can look at it anyway you want, but drugs have become a part of the human culture, poisoning it and at the same time evolving it. If you watch this movie without paying attention only to the heavy consumption of dangerous illegal drugs (and the effects they create), you might see what this movie is really about, at least what I think that it is about... A freak kingdom called THE U.S. of A.Merica and the very heart of it's dream... Las Vegas.Anyway, the acting is magnificent. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are perfect. Not to mention the brief performances of some other famous and talented actors... If you watched Brazil, then you're gonna love this, and if you haven't, then watch it anyway. A savage journey through the eyes of Terry Gilliam and the words of Hunter S.

When did it even start?"" But unlike other movies that I don't like, I couldn't get this one out of my mind. I knew the movie was trying to tell the viewer something, but what..? Then, while I was making myself dinner, it hit me, and it hit me hard. The more I thought about the movie, the more sense it made, it wasn't the storyline you were suppose to follow, it's not even the narrator you were suppose to make sense of, you need good understanding of the movie to view it like it should be viewed, and after you understand the concept of the movie, it'll be like watching a completely new movie; imagine you and your friend watching the same motion picture, but you're watching different movies...I'm serious.I don't know whether I should be proud of this or not, but out of the past 7 days of owning this movie, I've actually watched it 4 times, and I'm not even close to being bored of it :)",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

The cast is fantastic, Johnny Depp's role as Hunter S Thompson and Benecio Del Toro as Hunter's alter ego ""Gonzo"" was truly an inspired casting. I have seen the real Hunter S Thompson in interviews and Depp (as usual) nailed it. In fact I will state that about half the movies Johnny Depp has made could not have been made without him in them. And Benecio Del Toro is long overdue for ""superstar status"". His performance is almost to good. This film is for the curious, those who (wisely) chose sobriety,work,family and decency over self-indulgence,self-gratification and ultimately, of course self-destruction, for them it is voyeuristic journey into madness that may have been only a couple of bad decisions away from a possible future.

You will meet many who will tell you otherwise- here is why. The majority of films you will see in your life have very little displacement from creator to audience- for instance, something like American Beauty. An American film, about American life, by an American director, made for Americans. You don't get lost in it, you can't. This is why your average joe won't be a fan of Bergman or Fellini- he has to, not just think, but know about the culture and mindset it was intended to be shown to. Fear and Loathing just might be the furthest displacement I have ever seen in film. It is a intended to a modern American audience, made by a Brit, about a book that was written towards Americans based upon loose 70s events that were intended to be taken metaphorically (no wonder they didn't like it at Cannes- now your showing it to French people). And just to make things more fun, it is borderline free form with development similar to Dante's Inferno (which is German). To be on the ""correct"" level of viewing for this film is nearly impossible. You have to ""work"" to comprehend this movie, something most people don't like to do.

566,BasilTheRat,One Hell Of A Trip (Sorry!),10,22 April 2005,"Undoubtedly one of the best films ever made, my hat comes off to Terry Gilligan. He's made an almost perfect adaptation of the insanely funny (and sometimes disturbing) drug-fuelled novel by Hunter.S.Thompson. I not sure how Johnny Depp didn't win an Oscar for his performance as Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke as it was absolutely perfect. If you've ever read the book I think you would agree with me. In my opinion it was some of the best acting I've ever seen and only Depp could of pulled it off thanks to his, shall we say, experience in the field of chemicals. Slightly over-shadowed but still a staggering performance was given by Benecio Del Toros as the disgustedly vile and twisted Dr.Gonzo (a clever little mention of the anarchic form of journalism Thompson created}. Del Toro is almost unrecognisable but pulls of one the performances of his career. Also there cameo appearances for Toby Maguire, Camaroon Diaz, Flea, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci and funny enough, Thompson himself. See if you can pick him out. The story follows journalist Duke who has been assigned by his editor to write an article about some obscure dirt bike race somewhere in the desert on the outskirts of Las Vagas. He is joined by his Lawyer Dr.Gonzo and a dangerous amount of mind altering substances as they terrorise various casino's and establishments around Vegas (I found the whole hotel room/bathroom sequence amazing as it manages to make you laugh out loud and cringe desperately at the same time. What it all adds up to though is the craziest, zaniest, damn right most twisted adventure I've ever had the pleasure to watch. But Thompson also has a serious message to tell people in his story. Thompson is deeply concerned about the disintegration of his country's soul and culture and Las Vegas (in Thompsons mind) is a living piece of evidence of this. His character Duke constantly reminds you of this point (while under the influence of an assortment of drugs) with his inspired observations. I think if you haven't seen this film then you really don't know what you're missing out on. I advise you as your attorney to rent this film, sorry, buy this film as soon as possible and watch it. After you've read the book of course. Let's hope the next Thompson novel adaptation 'The Rum Diary' is as faithful and brilliant.

567,pupsx0r,Anti-flick,9,4 June 2005,"This is really an anti-movie, in that it has virtually no plot, no beginning, middle, or end ... and it is mostly anarchy on the screen. Not to say it is an experimental film, because it certainly isn't that. It is essentially an inside view of an acid trip, using LOTS of acid (and coke, and weed, and lord knows what else).This movie contains my favorite performance by Gary Busey. Although it is a brief appearance, it is exquisite. Benicio Del Toro is barely recognizable but utterly amazing and of course Johhny Depp is at his off-the-hook and over-the-top peak. His Hunter Thomson character makes his Pirates of the Caribean performance look muted. Somehow, however, Depp manages to keep an element of believability in even his most flamboyant performances.From the opening lines (""No point in mentioning these bats, I thought. Poor bastard will see them soon enough."") to the final frame, this movie is purely character-driven, and with Del Toro and Depp, it works. I can certainly see that one who has not experienced the Psychedelic Sixties might hate this movie. You need a rather subversive and twisted sense of humor and an appreciation of utter anarchy along with that understanding of 60's drug culture, as well.

574,leonygommers,All time classic!,10,1 January 2019,"This is one of those movies in line with lock stock and 2 smoking barrels, snatch, pulp fiction, the big lebowski, etc... Most people love easy, simple minded, cash grab, super hero movies, fear and loathing is not for them. It is absolutely brilliant, funny and smart at the same time. I wish movies like this were made today, unfortunately this very rarely happens. When can we go back to actual movie making instead of using the same stories and jokes over and over again. Luckily this film stays brilliant and original even after having seen it over 25 times. Another great thing about an all time classic movie like this is.. It's not in 3D!!",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

576,philipm-4,"Amazing, challenging, and ridiculous movie with great acting.",8,10 August 2009,"When I first heard of this movie I did not know what to expect. Having been unfamiliar with Hunter S. Thompson or his work, and having no experience with any of the drugs in the movie except alcohol and pot, I thought it looked over-the-top, but I had heard great things about it. I knew it was directed by Terry Gilliam, (of Monty Python) and starred Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, so I was inclined to give it a shot. What an experience I was in for! This movie is 2 hours of drug-induced craziness. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, or you are offended by any amount (and I do mean ANY amount) of drug use, then don't watch this movie. It's not for you. The rest of us, however, are in for a treat. The movie takes place in 1972, and follows journalist Raoul Duke and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo as they head to Vegas to cover the Mint 400. They soon forget about the story, however, and focus on the drugs in their suitcase. (acid, mescaline, cocaine, hard liquor, beer, pot, ether, and many, many pills.) Johnny Depp captures Raoul Duke's craziness perfectly, and within the first 25 minutes you already know he is going to be an iconic character. A cigarette always hangs from his mouth, (literally, there is not one scene he is without it) and he has a very distinct voice you won't soon forget. Johnny Depp spent 4 months with the real Hunter S. Thompson, learning his mannerisms, and it shows. As he partakes of every drug in his suitcase, you see the good, the bad, and the hilarious. Johnny Depp truly looks intoxicated throughout most of the movie. I don't know how he did it. Benicio Del Toro is also great, playing Raoul Duke's lawyer Dr. Gonzo perfectly. He is a slightly darker and more violent character, and Benicio Del Toro captures this very well. He is at times funny, and at other times truly scary. He is even more irresponsible than Duke, and does things you truly won't believe. He also captures the madness of being extremely intoxicated on a variety of drugs, just as well as Depp. The two actors also have great chemistry, and they really come across as two long-time buddies who really, really like to get messed up. Director Terry Gilliam also proves to be more than up to the task, and he provides the final piece of the puzzle in creating a movie about two guys drugged out of their minds. The script, which he helped write, is great, as is the camera-work that changes and distorts as the duo take different drugs. He takes the great acting and turns it into a great film. This was a very difficult book to commit to film, as it is so over-the-top that it seems cartoonish at times. Gilliam both grounds the movie enough that it feels real, while still embracing the aspects that make it seem unreal. I do not believe there were many, if any, directors who could have matched his final result. The movie does have a few downsides, however. It probably could have been 10 minutes shorter, and the ending feels abrupt. If they spent more time on it, and a little less on other parts of the movie, it probably would have made this movie a true classic. The movie is also simply too crazy, drug-induced, and challenging for a mainstream audience. While that is good at times, it also means the great acting and directing won't be appreciated by as wide of an audience as it should be. The cameos, while good, distract more that they add to the movie. This is Depp, Del Toro, and Gilliam's movie, and it shows.Overall, I would recommend this movie to those who can handle it. It is truly unique, and one of the few films about which you can say that there are no other movies like it. It took me two viewings to fully appreciate. While there are parts where you feel like the sober guy at a party with a bunch of drunk people, the movie overall conveys the drug use very well. If your on the fence about watching it, or have seen it once and didn't quite get it, I recommend watching it. As the tagline implies, you are truly in for a trip.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

Well I've taken the ride more than a few times and it is true u either hate it or love it :) It still fascinates me how this film was created, it's just a piece of art for me due to the way its been filmed and how it gives a pretty accurate view of how it feels to be under the influence of psychedelics. This movie is one of the few that i can watch over and over and still notice that I've missed some details i haven't seen the other times i viewed it. Also this film was dedicated to the late hunter s. Thompson who invented a new type of journalism, its called gonzo journalism. This movie is based on true events and it has made me curious about alternate lifestyles and especially the style of the 60's hippie. I found this one so special that i actually bought the book and i can say they are both equally as good, people that love movies that aren't as predictable as the common blockbuster this really is a must have seen film. I hope u will enjoy it as much as i did cause it really is one of a kind, Johnny Depp has done a wonderful acting job as well as his fellow actors ;) peace and love fellow earthlings",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
580,voltaab,"No sympathy for the devil. Buy the ticket, take the ride.",10,9 September 2005,"Years back I found myself hanging in the dark and dreary basement of my best friend's house. His family looked like they had came out of a time capsule from the mid 60s to early 70s. He was always my source for interesting movies and on one fateful day he said, ""Wanna watch 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'?"" I interrogated him for several minutes about the plot. All he could say was ""Its a good movie. You'll like it."" I trusted him with everything, and this was no exception. It opened with that song everyone knows and loves and then ""We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the dessert when the drugs began to take hold."" Now, me being 12 at the time of seeing this I thought ""Drugs?! My friend is showing me a movie about drugs?"" but it had been too late to stop him. It had been playing for too long and I had been exposed to this warped twisted vision of Hunter S. Thompson that could only be portrayed by the vision of Terry Gilliam.Flash forward to a month ago. I find myself in the local blockbuster and I saw it. The visions came pouring back into my head. I snatched it off the shelf and darted to the cashier with my blockbuster card in hand. Minutes later I found myself in my grandmother's car and she was asking me what I had rented. ""Just a movie,"" was my only reply. I took it home and that instant I popped it into my PS2 and my childhood had begun again. I watched it over and over, again and again. Then I called up some other friends and decided to show it to them. We were hooked.A week later I found myself in the local Borders. 8 am in the morning. I had just finished my coffee and found myself walking to the back of the store, towards the 'Journalism' section. It was staring at me. The big warped shades of Johnny Depp were staring at me! I picked it up but this time I casually walked to the cashier. I bought the book. I was hooked once again to that twisted world of HST but this time being portrayed by Ralph Steadman (sp?).I suggest EVERYONE to watch this movie. Its a great story of the dead American Dream that Gilliam brought to life and Johnny Depp did a GREAT performance of HST, not to mention Benecio Del Toro. He cracked me up. ""I think I have the fear."" R.I.P. HST.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
581,hosengrabber,really wanted to love this movie,6,29 August 2005,"I am a big fan of Hunter S. Thompson's writing, and I was really looking forward to this movie. I thought Gilliam's screenplay was very faithful to the book. The two main leads did a great job, and it was fun playing ""spot the celebrity cameo"".My only problem was with Depp being perhaps too realistic. I've seen interviews with him, saying he studied Thompson's mannerisms etc. He just didn't come across how I had always imagined Thompson to be; eg, I had never imagined the silly walk (ranging from very silly when HST was semi-straight to over-the-top silly when bent).And the only way I knew what Depp was mumbling through the teeth-clenched-around-cigarette-holder was because I have read the book so many times that the dialogue is etched into my brain.If you haven't read the book, you probably won't be able to understand what's being said or what's going on.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
582,ronald-carter,Outstanding,10,28 September 2005,"This is one of my all time favorites. I have never seen a movie that made me want to become a drug addict before!!! I have seen many movies that have strong drug content and have always wondered why one who turn to drugs. This movie explains it all. Depp and Del Toro are at their best in this wild movie. I've watched it 100's of times and every time, I see something I didn't notice before. The effects are incredible. The life this man led would make most lives seem dull in comparison. It is truly a work of art. Of all the scenes, the bat scene was without a doubt the funniest thing I have seen in years. This is somewhat of an oldie, but in my mind it is an instant classic. While it may not be for everyone, it is certainly liked by those who enjoy flicks like Gummo or Kids. Enjoy it, I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever tried drugs, although I'm not condoning drug use.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

While in the back of their convertible with Toby McGuire, just after Benicio del Toro takes his heart medication, Johnny Depp breaks open a small plastic container filled with some white powder. He says, ""Now for the upper,"" but I don't think hes snorting cocaine because they were keeping that in a salt shaker. Is it some amphetamine, speed, or a different, specific stimulant?

But that being said, Depp's morphing into this character that Hunter Thompson created, was one of the better i've seen in a long time. Excellent supporting role by Bencicio Del Toro as well. I think that the average straightedge person who hasn't touched a sip of beer or hit of a joint will probably find this movie absurd. Lucky for me that doesn't apply :) You will be hard pressed to find a movie like this anywhere, it doesn't have to rely on sex or violence to captivate the audience.I also recommend reading the book by Hunter Thompson, before you see the movie.

592,smbrown-33079,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Strangely Captivating,8,18 September 2018,"Fear and Loathing in las Vegas is one of my all time favorite movies, but not for the same reason that pulp fiction or the godfather are some of my all time favorites. The reason I love Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas so much is because it is different. It has no apparent plot or character development, yet it is still an interesting and fun to watch movie. It is such a raw movie. Hunter S Thompson, Author of the book, believed that objectivity in journalism wasn't real. His style of writing was known as ""gonzo."" This style of writing focuses on ""telling it like it is."" I find it interesting how easy it is to ee this style of writing by watching the movie. He even pays homage to this style by naming one of the characters ""Dr. Gonzo."" 
 One reason why I always recommend this movie to friends is because I think everyone can relate with the two main characters. It might seem difficult to think about how anybody could relate to Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo. They are on a journalism trip to cover a motorcycle race. Gonzo is Duke's Attorney. They are both heavily into drugs and seem delusional throughout most of the movie. But if you look deeper they are more than that. The journey tells a story of the pursuit of hopes and dreams as a method of escaping the realities of everyday life. The trip to vegas provides an escape from their mundane lifestyles and mistakes they've made. Raoul Duke and his Attorney Dr. Gonzo find the true american dream on the way to vegas",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
