0,MartinHafer,Probably the greatest WWII naval movie,10,12 July 2006,"This is an amazing achievement, and it's obvious because it is one of the only German language films to receive widespread distribution in American theaters since the silent era. It was just that good! When it came to America, the movie was cut down a little from it's original HUGE length and it was released in both dubbed and subtitled versions.The film is about a single WWII German U-boat and it follows it through a very hazardous mission until it eventually makes it back to port. While this may not sound very interesting, it certainly is, as the movie is less a traditional movie but an experience meant to instill in the audience the daily life and horror of serving on one of these submarines. For example, when the sub is being pursued, you find yourself tense, on edge and feeling the claustrophobia of the crewmen. Viscerally, it is an amazing film and remains a true and faithful film--the crew is extraordinary but they are hardly romanticized--they are just men doing their best to stay alive! To top all this off, when the movie concludes, there is the most fitting and inspired ending I have seen in a war film. Like anything you've seen from Hollywood? No way--this is like real life in all its starkness and terror.",Das Boot
1,SnoopyStyle,Superior submarine movie,9,21 December 2014,"It's the Autumn of 1941. The German U-boat fleet is starting to suffer heavy losses. The Captain (Jürgen Prochnow) shows Naval war correspondent Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer) around as his men party while on leave. The Captain is a pragmatic veteran. Some are on the verge of a mental breakdown, others are concerned but all respect their captain. They leave port for the dangerous North Atlantic. After a tough tour, they are redirected to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar and go to Italy.This is one of the first movie to show submarine warfare with gritty realism. The setting is claustrophobic. The characters are compelling and specific. Each of the main actors bring life to their characters. The action scenes are exciting. They hit the audience in the gut. This movie doesn't take a stance on the war other than being as real as possible. There is nothing about the holocaust. There is a general sense of war weariness which is the central message. It shows the futility of war in the best submarine movie up to that point. It can be argued that it has yet to be surpassed.",Das Boot
2,Hitchcoc,Life in a Sardine Can,9,30 March 2006,"In this superb drama, we get into the lives of the crew of a German submarine. It is a small submarine, and their individual lives are melded into the claustrophobic constricted world in which they live. Every action has a reaction. Everything is done with the knowledge that a single slip up will lead to their destruction. They face a series of death defying maneuvers and escapes, losing a little of themselves whenever they survive. The war is the enemy, and these men would have meant nothing to those in power. As with most wars, we redefine the value of human life and put others ahead of the common man. The terror of each moment, each challenge, is magnified. They probably don't know what it is for except someone has told them it is important.I will not spoil the conclusion, but I will say that it is apt and arbitrary, just as their lives have been. This is a really effective film because it doesn't allow the audience to relax for even a moment. When it's over, we want out as much as the guys on the boat.",Das Boot
3,Horst_In_Translation,Gets appreciated a lot... until you watch it,4,14 May 2015,"This 1981 movie is one of these films which everybody loves, but I have to say I do not. It is really a pain to sit through. There are several versions out there and I watched the 3.5-hour director's cut. It scored 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Writing for Petersen. But it did not get the foreign language film submission from Germany as they were going with German Film Award Best Picture winner: von Trotta's ""Die bleierne Zeit"". Petersen (who adapted a Buchheim novel for this one) made a very successful career out of this movie and worked with the likes of Clooney, Pitt, Wahlberg, Eastwood, Malkovich, Hoffman, Freeman, Ford, Oldman, Spacey and Close during his long career. Not many directors can say that about themselves. There are many known German actors in ""Das Boot"": Prochnow, Ochsenknecht, Grönemeyer (more known for his music actually), Wennemann (rip, looks a bit like De Niro), Hoenig, Semmelrogge and Otto Sander. Prochnow was the lead actor, but he is not really the most known anymore these days from the pack.The most known factor about this film today is the music maybe, even if it did not score an Academy Award nomination. I personally believe this film works better as a miniseries. It really drags a lot if you watch the whole thing at once and I would not even want to think about the versions longer than the 3.5 hours I watched. What stays in mind most for me is the different use of colors. Fairly memorable in my opinion. Blue for the sky outside the boat. Green for the sea and red for the action inside the boat. There were also some yellow parts occasionally. I have to say I was never amazed by anything in relation to this film and so I did not feel a whole lot when it became decisive about who would live and who would die. I personally will not watch this ever again I guess. Watching paint dry fits it nicely. Not recommended, even if people say it is the greatest U-boat movie ever made.",Das Boot
4,claudio_carvalho,German Masterpiece,10,25 November 2017,"In October 1941, the German Capt.-Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jürgen Prochnow) of the U-96 U-Boat receives the war correspondent Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer) to cover the work in the submarine during their mission in the Atlantic Ocean. They sail out of the shipyard La Rochelle and along the next weeks, Werner learns the lives, loves, fear and behavior of the young crew, the veteran Captain and his officers. The skilled captain hunts British vessels to sink and dives to depths below the limit of the boat to escape from the destroyers. Near Christmas, they plan to return to La Rochelle; but out of the blue, Captain Henrich receives an order to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to go to Italy. But the captain knows how protected the area is and plans a means to lure the British Navy. Will the U-96 succeed in crossing the Strait of Gibraltar?""Das Boot"" is a German masterpiece by Wolfgang Petersen with 2h 29 min. The ""Superbit"" director's cut on DVD with one additional hour is a supreme masterpiece of a war (or anti-war) film. It is impressive how a 3h 29 min film is never boring, keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat until the very ending. The claustrophobic and tense story increases the drama and the character development in this version, becoming one of the best movies in the cinema history. The German captain, officers and crew are not shown as one-dimension character or sad killing machine like in many war films, but as human beings with families and friends, very efficient in their works but with fear and other feelings. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Barco: Inferno no Mar"" (""The Boat: Hell in the Sea"")",Das Boot
5,classicsoncall,"""Now it all turns psychological, gentlemen.""",10,26 November 2006,"The more films I view, the harder it is to dole out a rating of '10', and I've never been liberal about it anyway. With ""Das Boot"", I have no such reservations. Here's a film that takes all your preconceived notions about Nazi villains and stands them on their head, by portraying a World War II submarine crew as human beings, facing life and death daily in the cramped confines of an underwater prison. Not only does one come to understand their plight, but sympathize with them as well, to the point of hoping that they make it through their Atlantic ordeal. The only problem being that once they do, a cruel fate intervenes to usurp the lives of innocents in a way that their harrowing underwater ordeal could not.Perhaps part of the reason that one identifies with the German cast has to do with the treatment of Adolph Hitler in the story. Not once was he identified as a Nazi hero or figure of respect. Early in the film, the Captain (Jurgen Prochnow) himself establishes his posture as less than a fan of the Fuhrer. The much later scene of the celebration in Vigo painted an even more resolute snub of Hitler by the officer crew of U-96, along with their elite German hosts. It is possibly the only time I've witnessed anything less than outright undying loyalty to the Nazi leader by members of the Party.Told from the German point of view by director Wolfgang Peterson, the story opens with the staggering statistic that only twenty five percent of Germany's forty thousand submarine sailors ever made it home alive. By Autumn 1941, the battle for the control of the Atlantic Ocean was turning against them, ominously conveyed by the Captain himself - ""Those Brits don't make mistakes anymore"". It's stated not in anger or defiance, but as a statement of fact, one which further emphasizes the plight of this enemy sub. Men crack under the pressure of battle, as personified by Johann 'the ghost' (Erwin Leder), who has a nervous breakdown before he can be of use to his Captain one last time. So fascinating is Peterson's direction, that the entire time the sub lies doomed on the ocean floor, this viewer finds himself saying a prayer along with the crew for that one unbelievable miracle that might pull them through.Through it all, I maintained such an alert focus that I managed to catch a continuity error. When Lt. Werner (Herbert Gronemeyer) returns the packet of letters to Ullman (Martin May) that he volunteered to forward to Ullman's pregnant girlfriend, it was only half the size of the original bundle.Prior to seeing this movie, it would have been hard to imagine a war film to be as compelling that hadn't been produced by Hollywood. However by any account, ""Das Boot"" ranks up there with not only the best war stories ever told, but one of the best movies ever committed to film. It deserves a strong recommendation.",Das Boot
6,gavin6942,A View From the Other Side,8,7 May 2010,"What makes ""Das Boot"" such a fine film, beyond the artistic merits, is its portrayal of Nazi soldiers as real people. Most, if not all, American films tend to have Nazis as inhuman monsters who want nothing more than to kill everyone and take over the world. I think the reality is a bit less dramatic.Here, some of the men doubt Hitler's greatness and are merely doing a job they had to do. Weeks, months under the sea eating questionable food in tight quarters. In many ways, they are no different from American (or any other) military men. Their propaganda films move them to new levels not much differently than our films did and do.Beyond that, again, there are technical and artistic merits to be had. The claustrophobic nature of the film was masterfully shot, and we could not have fully sympathized with these men without the aid of the lighting, camera and sound. Truly a modern masterpiece.",Das Boot
7,lee_eisenberg,Hunters or hunted?,10,14 March 2006,"Probably the main reason that ""Das Boot"" is so great is because it shows that the men in the submarine aren't really Nazis: they were just drafted. But once the submarine dives, then the suspense sets in. Capt. Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jurgen Prochnow) leads his men on a voyage of adventure and terror alike. As the viewer, you feel like you're in the submarine, getting attacked from all sides. Rarely do you see the kind of intensity that you see in this movie. Overall, it makes us question the idea of who's good and who's bad in wartime. It's widely agreed that the Axis Powers were the bad guys in WWII, but the men here don't hold Nazi ideology; we sympathize with them every step of the way. A great movie.",Das Boot
8,jboothmillard,Das Boot (The Boat),6,4 May 2009,"I have not seen many Second World War films seen from the point of view of the German Nazis, and this is a particular film doing exactly that, from Oscar nominated director Wolfgang Petersen (The NeverEnding Story, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One). Set in 1942, the film sees a German submarine fleet engaged in the ""Battle of the Atlantic"" to destroy English shipping. German U-Boats have taken heavy losses, and the particular boat is seen trying to accomplish impossible and questionable missions. Towards the end, after being badly hit, there is desperation to reach the surface and get back home, which they do manage, but the film ends with our ""heroes"" being bombed at port. Starring Jürgen Prochnow as Capt. Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, Herbert Grönemeyer as Lt. Werner / Correspondent Herbert Grönemeyer, Klaus Wennemann as Chief Engineer Fritz Grade, Hubertus Bengsch as 1st Lieutenant / Number One, Martin Semmelrogge as 2nd Lieutenant, Bernd Tauber as Chief Quartermaster-Navigator Kriechbaum, Erwin Leder as Johann, Martin May as Ullman, Heinz Höenig as Hinrich, Uwe Ochsenknecht as Chief Bosun and Claude-Oliver Rudolph as Ario. The fact that you are almost rooting for Germans to survive is quite interesting, the claustrophobia is quite effective, and the moments with explosions, especially the ending, are good viewing. The West German language film is available in the original two and half hour version, the three and half hour director's cut, and there's even the four hours and fifty-three minute uncut version. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. It was number 17 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Good!",Das Boot
9,ccthemovieman-1,Longer Director''s Cut The Version To See & Hear,8,6 May 2006,"This 1985 effort was re-issued with a longer VHS version in 1997 with surround sound and 60 minutes added to the original video, then put on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. All these improvements made a good movie even better.Considering most of this 209 minute film is done inside a U-boat, a submarine, it's very nicely filmed. Jurgen Prochnow, who plays the lead character - the captain of the boat - is a manly, rough-looking but compassionate human being who's always attention-getting. Just as interesting as him are the sounds as the noises from the boat echo through all the surround speakers.There are several tense, long drawn-out scenes, sometimes drawn out too long. In that respect, this movie might have been better had it been shorter and tighter. The language is ""crude"" in here in spots, so beware of that.I would recommend going with the German language track with English subtitles. The dubbed version has English spoken with a German accent and isn't easy to understand, anyway.....so stick with the way it was made and go with the subtitles if you don't understand German.In summary: a little long but generally moves at a decent pace and features a good ending to all of it. Recommended.",Das Boot
10,rmax304823,The Lawrence of Arabia of Submarine Movies.,9,5 August 2007,"I saw this in San Jose when it was first released and dozed off for a few minutes in the theater. Then I watched it on TV and nodded out again half-way through. Tonight I fell asleep twice while watching it. Not that it's in any way dull. It's packed with action and suspense and even a bit of character development. (Eg., the pro-Nazi Junge who insists on being clean shaven and dapper eventually becomes integrated into the crew and turns into a bearded slob too.) It's soporific because it's so LOOOONG. Three and a half hours of being cooped up in a sardine can with a couple of dozen sweating smart fellers.It's based on a journal kept by Lothar-Gunther Buchheim, which is also long, chiefly because it contains more expository material. Ever wonder how, when the KaEl shouts ""Dive!"", they make the boat dive? Read the book. You'll be able to take out a U-boat for a solo sail.The film has the usual incidents of submarine life, some of them clichés by now. The popping bolts, the Tiefenmesser inching below 200 meters, the depth charges, the sea water squiring in, the men gasping for air until the boat finally surfaces and the hatch thrown open. But, and this is a big but, that's not all it has. All the incidents shown are real, and there are others thrown in that turn the story choppy, the way real life is usually disjointed. And, plot aside, I can't think of another film that has so effectively captured what life aboard a World War II submarine was like. OUR submarine crews are always so tidy, so beardless, so freshly uniformed. These guys are so ragged and greasy that you can almost smell them. Hams, giant wursts, loaves of French bread, and crates of fruit are stuffed into unused corners or swing from overhead beams. There is only one toilet for some 45 men so it's always busy. (There's another head but it's jammed full of food.) The grandiloquently named ""Officer's Mess"" is about the size of your closet. When the meat turns green with mold, the men joke about mold being nothing more than another kind of vegetable, rather like lettuce.The performances are fine, and a few are outstanding. Jurgen Prochnow as the Captain exudes authority and sometimes an understated irony. He has a perfect face for the role -- not particularly handsome, stern, and with sensitive blue eyes. And when the boat is in immediate danger he doesn't look angry, like Cary Grant. He looks scared to death just like everyone else.The film deals with the crew of a German U-boat but that makes no difference. The men are instantly recognizable in every way. And the movie was not the big hit in Germany that it was internationally because Germans do not like movies about the Nazi era that shine a humanistic light on members of the Armed Forces of the period.It's a finely crafted film. If you never see any other submarine movie, see this one.",Das Boot
11,ma-cortes,Nail-biter masterpiece about the hard conditions of forty three sailors on a dangerous mission during WWII,8,23 June 2015,"This is an excellent 15 million dollars German movie chronicling the strong conditions of forty three men assigned to a U-Boot in 1941 . This exciting film contains nail-biting action , drama , suspense in a claustrophobic atmosphere . During WWII forty thousand young German served aboard Nazi subs , only ten thousand survived . This is the story of 43 raw recruits caught up in a war they didn't understand, and the Captain who must lead them in their struggle to survive .The claustrophobic as well as realistic world of a WWII German U-boat was meticulously mounted ; retelling boredom , filth , and sheer terror . It recreates faithfully the tension , hardship and claustrophobic conditions of the young seamen . The bulk of the film's $15 million budget was spent on constructing U-boats , the plans were taken to the original builder of the subs, who was commissioned to build a full-sized , sea-going replica , their first such assignment since the war ended ; second full-sized model was built for interior filming . A miniature submarine was used for scenes in which we see the submarine from outside , the model was steered from the inside by a diver . While shooting scale models in the Northern Sea, filming was disturbed by doves landing on the submarine . The submarine models built for Das Boot were also the ones used in Raiders of the lost ark (1981). In addition , it arranges to embrace an anti-war message concerning thought-provoking and brooding issues . Originally a five hour German TV miniseries , later released in a 217 minutes filmmaker's cut . Interesting screenplay by the same filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen based on Lothar G. Buchheim's autobiographical novel . Perfectly played by Jurgen Prochnow as commander and a solid support cast as Herbert Grönemeyer , Jan Fedder , Otto Sander and Uwe Ochsenknecht . To help his actors convey the claustrophobic conditions found on a real U-boat, director Wolfgang Petersen insisted on filming within the actual confines of the ship , scarcely wider than a man's outstretched arms , rather than removing the model's outer Wall . Thrilling and enjoyable musical score by Klaus Doldinger . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Jost Vacano . In order to get the fast tracking shots through the U-boat without a shaky image , director of photography created a system of heavy gyroscopes that kept the camera steady as he ran through the hallways . The motion picture was lavishly produced by Mark Damon , John Hyde , Edward R. Pressman , being compellingly directed by the great filmmaker/writer Wolfgang Petersen . The film was nominated for six Academy Awards which was at the time the highest number of Oscar nominations ever received by a foreign language film . The movie provides a realistic detailing of life aboard and a portrait about the crews subjected to stressful and psychological tensions . In fact the sailors had sleep in shifts . For months they were lodged in close quarters because every inch the space was needed for machinery , supplies and torpedoes . The air was heavy with odors from bilges,diesel oil and unwashed bodies . The men faced sudden death from depth charges ,aerial bombing attacks or the sharp bow of a swift destroyer as happen in this film . The picture is based on historic deeds , thus the construction of new U-boats continued at a record -breaking during WWII . In 1942-43 Hitler raised enormously his U-boat strength , the German submarines sank numerous ships, in early 1943 the called ¨Wolf packs¨ sank 90 ships in 20 days.Then,suddenly , between March and June 1943 , an exceptional change took place . The Allies began to win the war against Hitler's underwater in the Battle of the Atlantic . By this time the technique of submarines warfare had advanced far beyond that used in the beginning the war . The Allies pitted thousands of boats , seamen , destroyers , cruisers ,subs , cannons and billion of dollars against the undersea craft . As early as December 1943 Karl Doeniz , the architect and designer of U-boat campaign, admitted the grave turn in events . The cost was great on both sides . In the six years of war , the Germans , by their own statistics , destroyed more than 2000 British , Allied ships in the sea . Hitler had built 1162 subs , of which 783 were lost . Of the 41000 men recruited into the underwater service , between 28000 and 32000 lost their lives and 500 were taken prisoners .",Das Boot
12,blanche-2,Masterpiece about war that's actually anti-war,10,4 July 2009,"Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"" from 1981 is one of the greatest films ever made.Claustrophobic, sweaty, wet, rocky, tense, frightening - Das Boot shows young Germans during World War II in a submarine, headed up by an old man, played by handsome Jurgen Prochnow, whom I believe was supposed to be 30 - actually the actor was older, but the point is that this crew is a bunch of kids. And as the war went along, they got younger and younger. At the end, Hitler was sending in the 14-year-olds. He had absolutely no regard for the German people. He took their pots and pans, they had no food, he took their sons. When it was obvious Germany was going to lose, he blamed the German people. On the sub, there was only one fan of Hitler's; this is actually pretty accurate.I saw the Director's Cut in German, and I highly recommend it. The brilliance of the film lies in its capture of submarine life, the futility of the war, and the connection we who were on the other side of the fight as we watch this film are able to make with what was our enemy. It reminded me, in that respect, of a film called ""A Foreign Field"" with Alec Guinness, Edward Hermann, Jeanne Moreau, and Lauren Bacall. The enemy may be the government, but there's nothing terribly different about the people.The only criticism men who actually were on submarines make is that the crew was too loud during the patrols. It's considered much more accurate in its depiction than anything put out by Hollywood, including Saving Private Ryan.Fantastic acting, led by the brilliant and charismatic Prochnow, Das Boot is an incredibly intense experience - exciting, suspenseful, and heartbreaking. A triumph for Petersen.",Das Boot
13,Quinoa1984,Peterson's best; a very good film that becomes great by its ending,10,12 April 2000,"For lack of a better comparison, and I hope it doesn't come off as hacky, but in a way Das Boot basically did for the war film - and that small sub-genre of WW2 submarine pictures - what Alien did for science fiction space movies: it looks and feels dirty in this environment, and the people who work on these vessels are hard-bitten and look filthy and are more like blue-collar workers than what one would normally picture them being in. In Das Boot (or, you guessed it, 'The Boat'), Wolfgang Peterson adapts Bucheim's journalistic novel about a U-boat in late 1941 who are tasked to go into the North Atlantic and take on the enemy, primarily British convoys and other boats of the like. It's a grim, relentless, sometimes depressing but often invigorating story.One might also be thwarted, as I was for some years, about the idea of 'Huh, the Germans as the heroes of this story, get outta here.' But it's more complex than that, or rather it's not as simple as 'They're Nazis' in that way. Actually most of these officers and naval-men on this U-Boat, run by Jurgen Prochnow's character, have no real firm affiliation, and when they meet other officers when they pull for a brief stop in Spain, they don't even 'Sieg Heil' the other officers. Why this works for an international audience, why it didn't just stay a German-based sort of entity with minimal interest for outsiders who might still have grudges, is that Peterson and company a) don't have any real interest in the politics of anything, it's ALL about the sub and what the missions are, and b) the depth given to the characters (certainly in the director's cut, if not the even longer version) makes these people stand out as people first and foremost.Are they all super complex? Maybe not. Some come close to being clichés and stereotypes, though other times, wisely, before s*** hits the fan, there are some scenes given to showing the men just talking like men, about sex stuff, goofing on each other in that Tough sort of manner. Probably my favorite supporting character, aside from the Correspondent Lt. Werner, the sort of audience surrogate (rather, the guy who other people can explain stuff to so we know), is Johann. He has not a ton of scenes, but he has enough to have a clear, interesting arc where he works in the engine room, and during the big centerpiece of the film where the U-Boat is under attack from the Convoy and they're losing ground, he abandons his post and loses his mind for a few minutes. He apologizes, but can he really redeem himself? Certainly among this cast he has one of the most expressive faces and eyes.This was a fascinating watch for me in a number of ways - the fact that the filmmakers were able to hold attention for long stretches where, frankly, not a lot is ""happening"" action-wise, and we're made to just sit with these people and see what happens when they don't have enemies to attach or problems to solve, was one thing. And Pruchnow is a good actor who, frankly, is most effective in scenes involving eye contact (he has good, steely-blue type of leading man eyes), and when there's danger and he has to raise his voice. Otherwise, he has to be the Rock for these men, and does a good job. Other performances range from very good to just decent, but no one is bad at all here.But most of all, what made this raise from being a very good cinematic experience to a great one, was the ending. I wouldn't dare reveal what happens even with a 'Spoiler' warning, but suffice to say it's one of those moments where I practically had to laugh in astonishment. For a film this unrelentingly harrowing and bleak, the ending throws the kind of ""twist"" that is far from something unbelievable or out of this world. On the contrary, it's so logical and spot-on as a dramatic moment that it made everything else coming before it matter more - or at least have an ironic light to it. Das Boot is one of those very long ""guy"" movies that goes past how we usually view war films; the action happens and is any-number-of-ways-to-say-intense, but the time spent with the characters, observing them, seeing how long they're in this environment before things start to happen, gives the experience the texture of a long novel.",Das Boot

One of the best submarine movies ever made.,5,12 August 2011,"Wolfgang Peterson writes and directs this gritty war drama concerning the trials and tribulations of a German U-boat during World War II. One of the most authentic and gripping war movies ever made. Staunch and fearless U-boat captain Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock(Jurgen Prochnow)takes a green-around-the-gills crew to sea as they patrol the Atlantic and Mediterranean to seek out and destroy Allied vessels. The inexperienced crew will carry out their laborious and mundane duties in cramped quarters as they await to go into action for their Fuhrer. The sub becomes the prey as it dives to extreme depths to silently await their possible death via bombarding depth charges. The U-boat fleet has already begun to take heavy loses.

15,sunwarrior13,Wolfgang Petersen Excels In Das Boot,10,3 March 2012,"Das Boot is a German epic war film written and directed by Wolfgang Petersen, produced by Günter Rohrbach, and starring Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, and Klaus Wennemann. It has been exhibited both as a theatrical release and as a TV miniseries, and in several different home video versions of various running times.Das Boot is an adaption of the German novel of the same name by Lothar- Günther Buchheim. Set during World War II, the film tells the fictional story of U-96 and its crew. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard U- boats as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country. The screenplay used an amalgamation of exploits from the real U-96, a Type VIIC-class U-boat commanded by Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, one of Germany's top U-boat ""tonnage aces"" during the war.Das Boot is one of the most gripping and authentic war movies ever made. Based on an autobiographical novel by German World War II photographer Lothar-Guenther Buchheim, the film follows the lives of a fearless U- Boat captain and his inexperienced crew as they patrol the Atlantic and Mediterranean in search of Allied vessels, taking turns as hunter and prey. There's very little plot, so the movie's power comes from both its riveting, epic battle scenes and its details of the boring hours spent waiting for orders or signs of the enemy. With the exception of one staunch Hitler Youth lieutenant, none of the crew is particularly loyal to the Nazis, and some are openly hostile toward their Fuhrer; this allows viewer sympathy with the men as they perform their laborious, monotonous duties in cramped, filthy quarters, or await death as depth charges explode all around the sub. Prochnow is excellent as the nerves- of-steel commander, and many of the supporting actors -- all German -- are solid as well, although the characterizations border on war movie clichés (the young crewman who has left behind his pregnant girlfriend, the Chief Engineer whose wife is seriously ill). The real star, however, is cinematographer Jost Vacano, who makes the sub's grimy, claustrophobic interior come to vivid life, as his camera follows the crew through hatches, up ladders, into bunks, and under pipes, creating a palpable sense of claustrophobia while injecting it with movement. Wolfgang Petersen's direction is an exercise in pure craftsmanship.Also,Petersen's shooting style displays a breathtaking, if impersonal and faintly academic, virtuosity comparable to that of Lean or Coppola.Aside from that,takes all of the drama and suspense inherent in a submarine-based story and delivers it in a near- perfect package, establishing it as not just a terrific adrenaline rush, but one of the best movies ever made.In summary,it is one of the best war films ever.",Das Boot

17,Theo Robertson,Review Of The Director's Cut,9,18 August 2004,"I've decided not to review the 1981 dubbed cinematic release of DAS BOOT . Instead I've decided to review Wolfgang Petersen's director's cut which is far closer to the miniseries version which most readers will be familiar with When someone makes an anti war statement it's important that they differentiate between being "" anti war "" and "" anti military "" . The Brits don't seem to know the difference and seem keen to make anti- military / anti - soldier self loathing war movies with Paul Greengrass's RESURRECTED a good example . Having suffered the tragedy of Vietnam the Americans finally made anti- war movies that were a million miles removed from the old John Wayne and Errol Flynn star vehicles where a man wipes out 30 enemy soldiers single handed without suffering a scratch . But when it comes to making anti - war movies that shows the horrors of war and the courage of men in battle the Germans are top of the league , heads and shoulders above everyone else . This is because present day Germans realize that the enemy isn't the other side - it's war itself that's the enemy and DAS BOOT is a great example of this thinking The story starts slowly by introducing us to the crew via the war correspondent who are celebrating a last night ashore before they sail on their mission to sink British convoys sailing from America to Britain carrying vital supplies for the war effort against Nazi Germany . This is where DAS BOOT is superb , I really felt empathy for these crew man . Okay I didn't want them sinking British ships but I didn't want them to die either an opinion that shouldn't be taken lightly since my paternal grandfather was a merchant seaman during the war while my maternal grandfather was a crewman on a destroyer . The fact the crew of U-96 are presented as being utterly human and for this Brit hoping they make it home in one piece is a great achievement DAS BOOT was nominated for several Oscars and it's not difficult to see why. Watch it on widescreen television with stereo surround and you'll be amazed with the very clear sound effects and sound editing . Perhaps the best technical aspect is the cinematography where during moments of crisis the camera shoots along the length of the U- boat as it follows crewmen rushing about . When a foreign language movie is nominated for several Oscars you just know it's good!!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!This is a superb movie but it's not perfect . Being a German movie Nazis feature at one point but none of them are crew members , the only Nazis featured are the crew of a supply ship who have who have never seen a days fighting in their lives . It's understandable for German film makers to play down the courage of Nazi party members of the Second World War but it should also be remembered that the Waffan SS were exclusively composed of party members and they were the most feared fighting force of the conflict . CROSS OF IRON ( My favourite movie featuring WW 2 ) does make the valid point that because someone isn't a fan of the Nazis it doesn't necessarily make them a good person either . The screenplay also drags due to the fact that there's two subplots of U-96 being damaged and stuck on the Atlantic seabed when one subplot of sinking and then resurrecting the vessel would have sufficedBut the pros far outweigh the cons and I recommend this movie to people who have never seen a foreign language film in their life . It's placing in the IMDb top 250 is well earned . You may be shocked to know that director Wolgang Petersen later went onto to make Hollywood crap like OUTBREAK and A PERFECT STORM",Das Boot

19,Boba_Fett1138,Amazing movie!,10,3 June 2003,"This is easily the best submarine movie ever made! And even better, it's the best European movie of all time and maybe even one of the best war films.This is one of the only movies that shows the story from the ""other side"". You can actually feel along with the Germans and you have sympathy for them. This is because it shows the characters as individual soldiers fighting for their own cost instead as cruel heartless Nazi's. There are even lot's of anti-Nazi feeling expressed by the characters throughout the movie. After 5 minutes you've even forgotten that you're watching a German spoken movie.The characters are all very likable and realistic but the main character of the movie is the submarine itself!The movie is probably the most claustrophobic one ever made. The claustrophobic feeling is created by the excellent camera work that makes you feel that you're really aboard the submarine and you're one of it's crew members. Further more the atmosphere is very gritty and depressing which does good to the movie.The film is actually really tense and can bring you to the edge of your seat. This is mainly because the story avoids every possible cliché and the ending is one of the most surprising endings of all time. The long scene's were nothing really happens are never boring and are a great addition to the movie because it shows the emotions and the feeling of the crew members really well.Truly amazing!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Das Boot
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Immersive and unforgettable masterpiece,10,16 September 2009,"I haven't read the novel, so I base this upon the Director's Cut, which is the only release I have watched. Yes, it's three hours and fifteen minutes long. And let me tell you, it is completely worth it. The development of character and build-up of atmosphere and mood are among the best ever seen in this medium. You care about the entire crew, and they have varied personalities and every last one of them is credible. Including a reporter lets them occasionally explain something the audience needs to understand without it standing out, and apart from that, he is also someone you feel for. There are no good or bad guys in this, there are only *people*. Human beings. And you experience the terror that actual submarine crews did, as well as the filth and the claustrophobia. All without any of it getting excessive. This is intense and extremely well-paced. It manages to not overwhelm the audience to the point of over-stimulation. You don't merely witness how little room they have to move around, how two men cannot pass each other at certain parts lest they both squeeze up against the wall and move sideways, you *experience* it. If you are not OK with closed spaces, you may not want to take your chances with a viewing of this. It's exceptionally well-shot, from start to finish. The authenticity is astonishing. I understand that this really happened, and is a combination of two true stories. Exposition is delivered smoothly, and this is well-told all the way. There is occasional humor, to lighten the tension slightly. I don't want to risk giving too much plot away, so this is all I will reveal: This follows a group of young men, inexperienced rookies, on their first mission on a sub, under a veteran captain. This is well-made all the way, and it was the perfect decision to do it almost completely in sequence. The sound design is amazing, in a class of its own. Every acting performance is flawless, and it's no wonder that Prochnow got several American roles after this came out. The DVD offers a dub in English(by the same cast, I understand), though I chose to hear the original German. It also contains a trailer, a six minute featurette of sorts, about the DC edition, and a subtitled, highly informational and also fun commentary track with Wolfgang, Jürgen and Ortwin Freyermuth who produced this version of the film. This has relatively infrequent strong language and is disturbing, sometimes violent and bloody, and most definitely not for the faint of heart. I recommend this to anyone who likes anti-war movies. Unquestionably Petersen's greatest achievement. 10/10",Das Boot
21,view_and_review,This is All so Strange,7,17 December 2019,"I'm a firm believer that no movie should be over three hours. Once you reach the three hour mark you need to be a mini-series. Das Boot is no exception, but with the wonders of modern technology it wasn't too hard to watch it in phases.This movie is a strange concept. It's a sympathetic view of a German U-Boat crew during WWII. The beating hearts in all of us saw a crew of men dealing with the claustrophobic and coffin-like conditions of a submarine constantly bombarded with ""enemy"" fire. Then our brain said, ""You know this is the enemy right? We should be rooting for their demise."" And it's true--we should be rooting for their failure because their success was a win for Hitler.This is the first movie I've ever seen about the Nazis in which they weren't these well-dressed, ice cold machines. This is the most human I've ever seen them portrayed. I suppose it's easier to hate a people that lack human qualities, hence the inhuman portrayal (and for good reason). As I was watching Das Boot I found myself not thoroughly hating them even though I knew they had to lose. Whether their losing meant dying or not was something I was leaving to the film creators, but losing was a must.",Das Boot

A three-and-a-half hour film in German set almost completely on a submarine would not seem to have the makings of a gripping film, but gripping this film certainly is.Wolfgang Petersen and his cameraman make tremendous use of their limited space, and this film is more visually dynamic than many films that have much more room to play with. The claustrophobia is intense, and the small details about life on a submarine endlessly fascinating. And it's a tremendously humanist film as well; by the end, we don't really care that these men are fighting for the Nazi cause, we simply care about them as men.Grade: A",Das Boot

The men experience the challenging claustrophobic life of serving on a U-boat with its highs and lows. Who will make it back alive?""Das Boot"" (1981) is a well done accounting of what it was like to live on a U-boat in WW2 - the claustrophobic living conditions, boredom, filth, sheer terror and... no women. One great scene is when the submarine surfaces after torpedoing a couple ships in a British convoy; it's like hell came to Earth.The flick focuses on the Germans in the restricted spaces of the U-boat and it's amazing that a compelling film can be made from that limited dramatic angle. While this is a war picture, it doesn't glorify war. It's ""anti-war"" simply by showing the way it was for sub-mariners.The film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes, and was shot in North Sea near Heligoland; the Atlantic Ocean; La Rochelle, France; and Bavaria, Germany.GRADE: B",Das Boot

I would have preferred subtitles and listened to the original German language being spoken. This film is completely German made with German actors. Of course, the story is not lost in translation. These men have to fight for their country regardless of whether they support their government. It's really about young men who could be any one of us in their position. You have to ask yourself what are you to do if you have no choice. I was a little disturbed when one of them stated that he was molested by six of the other guys like a ritual hazing ceremony to another officer. It was as if an unofficial initiation ceremony and disturbing as well. In war, you could see young men killing and dying and you wonder what it was all for anyway. It's still Germany's best film to date.",Das Boot
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Das Boot: The Director's Cut (1981),10,31 October 2005,"This is touted as one of the best WWII submarine films of all time, and it's not difficult to understand why. From the story to the cast, from the cinematography to the sound, everything's top notch on this German film directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who's now helming more Hollywood flicks). I'd rate it above U-571, K19: The Widowmaker, Crimson Tide, and The Hunt for Red October.We follow the exploits of the crew of German U-boat U-96, as it gets sent on its mission to destroy Allied convoys. We learn of the frustrations of inaction, having no targets, and living the lonely life aboard a submarine. We experience the claustrophobic environment, one which is shared amongst crew, where maintaining hygiene and tolerable living conditions is of the utmost importance of staying well. We pick up on the fear of the Captain about his inexperienced crew, most of whom were in their early twenties, and haven't seen much action in the high seas.What's gripping in this film is when things start to pick up. Technology those days aren't as advanced, and we see that U-boats are more likely to be sitting ducks when Allied destroyers hover above them on the water's surface, dropping multiple depth charges to rattle and hopefully destroy their underwater prey. The U-boat is the hunter, but once it has hunted, it becomes the prey.And such is the marvellous depiction of Fear in the crew's eyes, as they huddle in silence each time the enemy lurks above. The suspense literally keeps you at the edge of your seat, the silence, deafening. Many set action pieces bring out the different scenarios and challenges that the crew face in their voyage on the seas, and all these capped by the beautiful soundtrack which accompanies each scene. My favourite was the charge through Gilbratar.Although this movie takes on an Axis power's point of view, one can discard the political aspect of this film, and understand that lives on both ends are similar - each are fathers, brothers, husbands, and are thrown into a senseless political war. It doesn't go preachy on who's right and wrong, but touches on more human and basic issues of survival. Boys become men, and it is this transformation that is most obvious throughout the story.If you've got the chance, you must see the Director's Cut, running at about 209 minutes, just as Wolfgang Petersen envisioned it to be. Excellent stuff!",Das Boot
27,siderite,Very realistic war movie. A bit too long for my taste.,8,18 January 2006,"The movie had 3 hours and 20 minutes! That's long by any standard. Especially when three quarters of it is about grown men stuck in a sardine can. That's the feeling you get, while you watch disillusioned people going to sea in a sub, their only hope being the satisfaction of a sunk boat. Not for the Fuhrer, not for the Fatherland, but for their own honor. And you start to feel for them.I've always liked Jurgen Prochnow, but usually I've seen him as a secondary (mainly a villain) in Hollywood productions. I was astounded to see him playing such a good lead role, though, and even more so when I noticed his 97 movies made so far. He is fatherly to his men, harsh, mischievous and very serious, sad and happy, insane and calm, he goes through all emotions in this movie and he does give it class.Back to the movie. The end is so dry and sudden that you don't believe it. It has that Donnie Brasco type of ending, when you wonder when it is going to end and then it is over. I do think that 3 hours of movie is too long, but the ending almost makes it worth.Conclusion: good movie, especially for sub fanatics, very realistic, but you need to have the mood to see it. That is, be well rested (or you might fall asleep), watch it alone or with a few buddies (no women) and have a few beers around (not many and not hard liquor or wine).",Das Boot
28,sddavis63,Realistic Depiction Of Life On A German U-Boat,7,3 July 2017,"Years ago I knew a man who had served in the German Navy during World War II. He wasn't on a U-boat, mind you, but he shared a few stories with me about what being a sailor or soldier in the German Forces of the time was like, and I was struck by how ""normal"" he made it sound. They weren't fanatical Nazis, these men. Just those who were called upon to fight in a war that most of them didn't want to fight. Interestingly enough my acquaintance emigrated to Canada after the war, joined the Canadian Army and ended up being stationed with NATO forces in Germany. It's a strange world we live in.One reaction I had to ""Das Boot"" was similar - just how normal these submariners were. They weren't fanatical Nazis either. Just sailors who found themselves in a war and had to find a way to survive. There's not many Nazi salutes in this and I don't remember any ""Heil Hitlers"" - although there were a few references to the Fuhrer. But it's surprising just how easy it was to relate to these men. The movie is in German with English subtitles - making it abundantly clear that they were on the ""other side"" (from a historical perspective.) But it didn't matter. I found myself drawn in with them; even rooting for them at times.Reflecting quite well what I understand life on a submarine is like, the movie does have relatively long stretches that aren't all that interesting and when nothing much of great importance happens. But the film is structured around two main bursts of energy - the first being a battle with a British convoy that the U-boat encounters, the second being an attempt to get to a German base in the Mediterranean, which meant having to elude the British Navy, based in huge numbers at Gibraltar. The latter was the most suspenseful part of the movie, as you wondered whether the crew was going to survive. In truth, though, both of those encounters went on perhaps a little bit too long. And the last scenes of the movie (coming after the U-boat has managed somehow to refloat itself from the bottom after being sunk and get past Gibraltar into port) seems to make a powerful point about the meaninglessness of war.The performances are good in this. Subtitles aside, Jurgen Prochnow as the U-boat's captain was excellent - a relatively young man who's been at this for a while and has become hardened to what this life is. There's some good reflections on both the physical and especially mental toll this kind of life had on the sailors. We don't usually see much of the German side in war movies. This was a good look at things from that perspective and was a very good depiction of life on a U- boat at war. (7/10)",Das Boot
29,ElMaruecan82,"A gripping, realistic, and forever haunting depiction of War's hellish nature ...",10,9 May 2011,"If you asked me why I expressed so much contempt toward pseudo 'great war' movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Inglourious Basterds"", the answer is quite simple. Because there is still a certain breed of films that managed to perfectly capture the essence of War, among them, the masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now"", closely followed by the one I will review now: ""Das Boot"".""Das Boot"", the boat, what a title! Very restrained, yet extremely meaningful, for two reasons : first, it sets the film, the U-Boat commanded by the experienced and respected Captain Lieutenant Lehmann-Willenbrock, the boat as a Goddess-like character in the film, who has the power to kill or spare her infants. Secondly, the language: German. The protagonists are German and if you look at them at Nazis, you miss the point. The film doesn't invite us to cheer for guys who belong to the bad side, but to reconsider our own approach to War. Spielberg makes glorious War movies with simplistic 'good vs. bad guys' formulas, when he should have taken some lessons of realism from Wolfgang Petersen who made a movie about  men. They are only men who happen to wear one military suit, and we can't blame them for wearing 'the bad one'.Indeed, there is a lot to root for in the beginning, as they are not the cruel and stereotypical Germans, cinema used to portray, we're not in ""Stalag 17"" anymore, and the United States doesn't have the monopoly of War movies. A German director makes a movie about German soldiers for a change, and without any bias. He even, detached the main characters from any Nazi etiquette. At the drunken party in La Rochelle, the two veteran officers express very cynical ideas about Hitler : nice touch from Petersen not to portray the leads as zealous fanatics. The rest of the crew follows the orders, and during the first sequence, they just drink, dance, shout and vomit. The realism again works on a double level, it helps us to feel empathy for these young rosy-cheeked boys and pity at the same time; because this party could be their last. The fun is so extreme it almost looks like a last burst of youth and amusement before the serious adult stuff happens.And when it starts, you just have to hold your breath and prepare yourself for one of the most nightmarish and hellish journeys ever, making ""Apocalypse Now""'s mission look like a cruise. It's a modern odyssey conducted by one of the most haunting cinematic scores ever, and a beautiful cinematography. And the central character of this odyssey is Lieutenant Werner, the Correspondent. We discover the boat through his eyes, and share his discomfort among the regulars. He represents the audience, the coming-of-age element of the story, and inspires through his clumsiness some very interesting statements from the Captain, like in the beginning, when he asks him to wait till the soldiers have grown beards before taking pictures of them. They still look too shamefully young, but as the movie goes on, their facial features become mature and likelier to make us accept a tragic fate. Facing other clean-shaved and well-dressed officers later, we notice the difference; they didn't act like Nazis; at the end, they don't even look like soldiers. ""Das Boot"" creates indeed a quite alienating environment, like living a War in microcosm.There's a growing feeling of claustrophobia invading our hearts, as we're embarked with these men making the empathy work on a physical level. When they listen to the ultrasonic detector with that scary repetitive sound, you know the shock is imminent. The question is: when? The thrills are so intolerable that the shock comes almost as a relief. But the worst has yet to come when they're hit by a flight attack that cause their sinking. It goes down, deeper and deeper, even below the pressure limit the previous false alarm taught us. It's a suffocating experience, and an extraordinary thrilling moment ... For my part, I literally held my breath, couldn't even gulp, didn't know what I was waiting for. Since there were Germans, and we know they won't win the War, they could really die in the boat, but that would have been too predictable I guess. And from the way they handled the crisis, becoming just men, crying, going mad, praying, struggling, while driven by their self-conservation instinct, we understand, that they're only victims of the alienating effect War applies on human minds, and when they think their fate sealed, they realize that all the military pride is just bullshit.But the ending is probably what saddened me the most, not to mention the shock. After all they went through, they died anyway, on the harbor, at their arrival. The point? I guess if the Germans were not the good guys of WWII, when it came to the individual battles, it was just a side against another one, they were still fathers, brothers, sons, lovers, dying there. We feel uncomfortable in the scene where they refuse to help the poor Allies soldiers drowning after the bombing of their destroyer, but in a way, it's another sign of maturity from the German director: now they are the 'poor' soldiers, every death is tragic  And we feel sad because we rooted for them. The second point, is to show that after having understood the very pointlessness of War when they were in the bottom, they simply lowered their guard again, drunken by the appetite of victory, which transformed their joy into hysterical screams of disbelief during the bombings. As if you must lose in order to understand the meaning of War.Which might explain why the best War movies are still about wars that were lost, after all ...",Das Boot
30,paul2001sw-1,Waitin' 'round to die,8,29 May 2003,"Most war films are made from the perspective of the victor, or at least tell an inspirational tale.  Few depict only futile effort and inevitable defeat. But only one quarter of German U-boat crew members during World War Two ever made it home.  ""Das Boot"" informs us of this, not as a final observation, but by way of introduction.  Armed with this information, one only only view the boat in question as a tomb waiting to happen.In some ways this is a very uncinematic venture.  All the action takes place within a small metal tube; even when it surfaces, the sub is visually unimpressive; enemy ships are but spray on the horizon; torpedos are fired unseen, their lethal impact heard but unwitnessed. Additionally, some of the dialogue, at least in translation, is slightly clunky.But ""Das Boot"" has great strengths.  In sharp contrast to ""The Perfect Storm"", the same director's later return to the sea, nothing is played for melodramatic effect.  And by the conclusion of this epic story, the claustrophobic boat seems as much one's own home as that of the crew, whose understated characters one has come to appreciate through simple observation as they go about their everyday tasks.  Especially good is Jurgen Prochnow as the captain, on whose shoulders lies full responsibility for the lives of his men. His plays a true hero, but one without any halo or gloss.For those of us fortunate enough not to have lived through the war, this is a rare film that presents a plausible picture of that terrible time. By implication, the truth about today's wars is in here too, more so than in anything you'll find on CNN.  Watching it makes you realise how most other supposedly ""great"" war films aren't great at all, just the slick product of an entertainment industry. ""Das Boot"" is the real thing.",Das Boot
31,ThomasDrufke,Real-Time War,8,13 September 2015,"(Directors Cut Review)There are few war films that can say they captured the spirit and atmosphere of what the actual events were like. Das Boot is one of them. This is one of the true epic-war films. The word epic is thrown around a lot, but perhaps none more relevant than describing this film. At approximately 3 and a half hours long, Das Boot comes across as just one long trip with a German U-Boat crew. At surface level, it is. But it's Wolfgang Peterson's direction that really cements this as one of the all-time great World War II films.One of the first thing's I noticed, was that Peterson was not going to bang us over the heads with the fact that this is a group of German's. More importantly, I think he pretty easily got the audience to care about the crew, no matter where your from. It's hard not to root for this group after all they go through. Considering near a hundred attendees spend weeks, and even months, in one boat together without showering or really any time alone, yeah I would say they deserve some sympathy. Peterson does a great job of capturing they claustrophobic-ness of the boat and the genuinely disgusting nature of the entire trip. Ultimately, this film isn't about the action or the naval battles, it's a character drama about how these guys attempt to live together and the many, and I mean many, unfortunate circumstances they are forced to undergo together. Speaking of the action, I felt like several of the battle sequences became tedious after awhile. Not because they weren't realist at all, but because it seemed like the exact same consequences with the exact same explosion shots over and over again. It was made in the early 80's without the technology we have now, so it's forgivable, but that was my one major complaint.One of the most impressive things about Das Boot is the realistic nature of the boat. But also the dynamics and relationships that the crew members have with one another. I don't know that I can pinpoint any of the names of the characters, but I remember their faces (led by a German looking Denis Leary). I think that's the more important thing. The film is really long, and although sometimes you don't get the context of where they are or why they are doing it, but you feel the impact of it, especially in the last 30 minutes or so. That is much to the credit of Peterson and the bittersweet score played throughout.

32,g-bodyl,Gripping War Film!,9,8 March 2015,"When it comes to ranking submarine movies, I think Das Boot would rank up near the very top. This film does not sacrifice realism for the sake of entertainment. The film tells the story how it is and that is what I truly respect about this film. The story itself is gripping and terrifying. There are many good action scenes and I found this film unique because this film is told from the perspective of the Axis forces, and that is very rare to find in any non-propaganda cinema.Wolfgang Petersen's film is about life on a U-Boat as German soldiers embark on a secret mission during the Battle of the Atlantic as they target English trade ships. The occupants suffer from boredom, fear, and the sense of comradeship as they wrestle thoughts on the ideology in which they are fighting for.Now I'm not familiar with many of the actors in the film, mostly because this film is a foreign film. However, I am familiar with Jurgen Prochnow and he did a great job as the U-Boat's captain. The rest of the cast certainly did a good job.Overall, Das Boot was a very good war film and one of the better submarine movies I have seen. Not only there is a gripping story to be had, the film shows a great deal of technical prowess. The cinematography as well as the battle visuals are major standouts for me. The film is unique due to the perspective of the Nazis, so that was interesting to watch. The film also had a great ending. It is kind of sad, but it made the movie even more powerful.My Grade: A",Das Boot
33,secondtake,"Believable, above all, and a WWII submarine movie, all the rest is just intensity",8,19 December 2010,"Das Boot (1981)Widely considered the most impressive submarine movie ever made, I'll go so far as to say it's easily the most accurate that I've seen. The action scenes, the sense of doom, the eerie quiet and then explosive depth charges, the grime and the crowded conditions, all of this is palpable. But more impressive, I think, is how the movie works as a German movie about Germans in a war where the Germans were painted as evil. American movies to this day still glorify and make heroic their roles in WWII (unlike the willingness, at times, to show the problems of Americans involved in Viet Nam, say), especially in the European side. But in movie after movie, the German film industry has confronted the real problem of being aggressors, and of being under the Nazi sway. ""Das Boot"" is typical, and key. The captain goes so far as to openly make fun of the German propaganda coming in on their radio. It isn't just that war is bad, but that the Nazis are bad.Nevertheless, there they are, and they have a job to do, and they're going to do it well. So a small group of men in a small underwater tin can try to survive the boredom as much as the British, who come very close to getting them several times. It's a great movie, one of the best at capturing the feeling of being there.What is less impressive, at times, is the more ordinary character development that seems inevitable in a movie this long--2 ½ to 4 hours depending on the version you have, I saw the long one, the director's cut. I think the acting is superb, and so it's easy to go along with the conversations and interactions, but they aren't always compelling in themselves, more just creating some space before the next conflict arises. Maybe, in some honest sense, this is exactly how it would have been. Life for most people is pretty ordinary.But this movie is not. Or it makes what is ordinary in war--the nostalgic to the profound and deadly--believable, and not simply big and dramatic, which it also is. For full German effect, I suggest seeing it with the original German language track on and subtitles if you need them, though I tested the dubbed version in English and it's really well done. I also suggest, if you have doubts about such an involved war movie, trying to find the older, shorter release. The visuals are not enhanced, but some of the character development sections are left out and I don't think you'll miss them.

35,sol-,Run Deep,7,29 September 2017,"A young reporter finds himself in over his head when he joins the crew of a Nazi U-boat to document their experiences in this World War II thriller from Wolfgang Petersen. With the vast majority of action confined to the submarine, 'Das Boot' has many intense moments with the claustrophobic nature of the surroundings heavily emphasised. There are several marvelous tracking shots that run up and down the submarine interiors and the constant sharp sounds of the watercraft provide an eerie reminder of just how far removed the crew are from land. Clocking in at over three hours long though, there are invariably lulls in the action and overall, the film feels like more of an episodic collection of melodramatic underwater events than an airtight narrative. Jürgen Prochnow's captain is also the only character we come to really know in any depth. What the film does very well though is paint its young Nazi characters as very human with all the love anxieties, fears and worries that young people have. Especially interesting is the way they are able to quickly switch from partying in their time off to being at attention during emergencies. The film is also topped off with a surefire memorable ending. 'Das Boot' might not offer the strongest narrative or characters out there, but it provides an experience like few other motion pictures with its graphic portrait of submarine life.",Das Boot
36,briancham1994,Terminally tedious,6,19 August 2021,"I watched the three hour version of this film but it felt like six hours. The tedium is part of the realistic portrayal of the U-Boat life but this was taken too far. To be sure, this stylistic choice was the right way to go, eschewing the overt excitement and action of other similar films. There are several things this film should be commended for: 1) the realistic submarine lifestyle portrayal, 2) the acting behind the distinct characters, 3) the claustrophobic tension and 4) the special effects. These all tie into each other to create a very immersive film that really shows what it was like to be in such an old submarine during World War II. All waiting, no glory. However, this style only paid off during some key scenes. Outside this, it was just an exercise in tedium.",Das Boot

It's a movie that in some moments maybe it is slow but this is the meaning, in a submarine time passes very slowly and it was still something that this film wanted to show us and make us feel it.I recommend it and I want to tell you that this movie it is not a simple movie with a submarine and its ""journey"" (war), it is more than that.

38,filipemanuelneto,The most realistic of submarine movies.,7,24 September 2016,"This interesting war film shows us a little of what was the daily life of a submarine crew during World War II. As the film is German, not surprisingly, is a German submarine. And tastes good to hear the dialogues in the original tongue, giving more authenticity tho the movie than the English, which most of films used indiscriminately, because of commercial interests.This film is, of all submarine movies, the best I've ever seen. The more realistic and closer to reality, without dramatic contrivances, without the flying imagination of those who have never seen a submarine but has to make a film about it. Its based on a book by Lothar G. Buchheim which, I believe, describes real events. The script reflected this effort, this search for reality. I do not know any of the actors, I am no expert in cinema, but I enjoyed the interpretation of Jürgen Prochnow, the captain, and Klaus Wennemann, who played chief engineer submarine. I will not be very surprised if someone says to me that some footage was shot in a real submarine... whole scenario was thought to detail and it shows how submarines are claustrophobic.Far from the American sensationalism, this European film makes a very interesting picture of a reality that most movies rather fantasize the extreme.

41,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Classic German Submarine Film shines even Brighter in extended Director's Cut.,8,25 May 2020,"Das Boot (1981) :
Brief Review -A Classic German Submarine Film shines even Brighter in extended Director's Cut. I have not seen any german film till date and neither i have seen any submarine film except one ordinary attempt in Bollywood (The Ghazi Attack), but if German films are like this then i want to see more and more. Das Boot has just generated the respect for German Cinema in my heart. The storyline is nothing less than an inspirating tale as it travels from extreme worst death situations to the sunshine of life. This emerging writing makes Das Boot an unforgettable adventure as well as an inspiration for lifetime. Besides, it is a great cinematic achievement for German Cinema and to be more precise even bigger than Hollywood at the time of it's release. The narrative completely choked me in it from the beginning and i started feeling being the one from the crew members of the Boat. Apparently, that made me gasp, shiver and rack my nerves for that filth and scare. I watched the 209 minutes version, that Director's cut of the film just to see if it bores me but it didn't. Holding the narrative for 209 minutes is a tough job you know and the entire crew of Das Boot deserves kudos for it. I always say a War film has to be atmospheric and Wolfgang Petersen knew it before me saying it i guess. The tension is built because of atmosphere around or else it would have never given me any chills. Thank you Mr. Petersen for this shivering and gasping adventure and drama. I should be giving it a repeat watch again and again for sure.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Das Boot

43,imseeg,Impressive epic portrait of a german submarine crew during the downfall of the German empire. Terrific acting by unknown actors. Splendid true to life submarine atmosphere.,10,17 November 2018,"Beware: dont choose the 2018 version! And dont choose the tv series from 1985 either.The original classic ""Das Boot"" stems from the year 1981 and this movie has become the mold for all submarine movies. I have seen ALL the war movies during the last decades and this one truly stands out as one of the best. Not suited though for those who dont have patience. Why? Because the director's cut of this movie lasts 3 and a half hour! The theatrical version lasts one hour less. And although it aint never boring, this movie sure takes it's time to learn to know this german submarine crew. It's slowburning start might give some reason to think this might be a longwinding boring movie, but dont be mistaken.If you have watched the opening half hour and enjoyed the acting performances you will be in for a ride later on, because this story has got one heck of crescendo in suspense and action, meaning that it starts out slowly and calm, but it will end with shattering suspenseful action packed plot turns. If you are really of the impatient kind, skip the first hour and you will fall smack in the middle of the first action sequences. Because of it's length it is advisable to watch it with a pause in the middle.What's so great about ""Das Boot""? The acting performances are truly terrific. Only germans will recognise these actors, because internationally they are unknown. But that doesnt spoil the fun, because these perrformances are up there with the very best internationally. Highly recommended to watch in original german language with subtitles.""Das Boot"" made the mold for ALL submarine movies and it is truly a classic war movie, because like no other war movie it portrays in psychological detail the destruction of individuals during war fare. And it's setting is confined to just 1 claustrophobic submarine. That's all the movie audience gets to see for 3 and a half hour long! To be able to impress audiences with such a suspenseful story inside such a small space is truly astonishing. Classic war movie!",Das Boot
44,Vartiainen,Well-made WW2 film,6,29 October 2018,"A German war film about a particular U-boat and its crew on yet another patrol mission as the Battle for Atlantic rages on. The movie has been praised for its historical accuracy, especially in building and designing the actual submarine. Thousands of photos and a couple actual U-boat captains were used to make the filming set as realistic as possible, down to the very last nut and bolt.And it shows. The inside shots within the boat are amazingly claustrophobic, especially the initial establishing scenes. The narrow hallways only allow a single man to move at a time, most of the bunk beds are shared, one of the bathrooms is filled to the ceiling with supplies, there's foodstuff hanging from every available hook and protrusion simply because there's no other room left to store it and so on.And this claustrophobia and tension extends to the rest of the movie as well. I was only able to lay my hands on the original theatrical cut, and that has some really slow and tension-filled scenes as well as the submarine creaks and groans under bombardment, but I believe that the proper way to enjoy this movie to its fullest is to find the TV mini series or the director's cut, which are both much longer and take their time with the atmosphere, the silence and the tension.The theatrical cut isn't bad either, if that's all you can find, but you can kind of see that it is not the full story and the plot is very bare bones.",Das Boot
45,thinker1691,The Other side of War,9,24 May 2007,"Wolfgang Peterson, wrote and directed this superb film of submarine life during World War II. When first seen by an American audience, reactions were mixed. Halfway into the film, the German crew begins to exhibit some universal traits which touch the heart of anyone fighting for a cause. Gone is the reason why the seamen are fighting often-times an unseen enemy. The reasons are replaced by a plethora of dangerous and certainly dramatic events which allow an audience to see the life and death struggle of all veterans. The visual heart of this unusual movie, is that of an experienced German Captain (Jürgen Prochnow) who sails the Atlantic, meeting both friend and foe alike. With him are his aids, Lt. Henrich (Lehmann-Willenbrock), Herbert Grönemeyer as Lt. Werner and Klaus Wennemann who is superior as Chief Engineer. When they realize the war is nearly over, they head for home. Unfortunately they are spotted, targeted and attacked by the English navy. Now comes some heart-pounding action as most of the crew expect to die before reaching home. Seen from the perspective of an American audience, one expects the inevitable. Yet, from the audience point of view, one can not help but sympathize for the Captain and his valiant crew. A Great film indeed. ****",Das Boot
46,Polaris_DiB,Total immersion into confined space,8,11 October 2009,"Pretty much Wolfgang Peterson's magnum opus, as far as the majority of the world is concerned. He's a talented director, but nothing else he's done adds up quite to the level of intensity all three some hours of this movie relentlessly piles on top of you--with few breaths of fresh air to cut into the tension. Not a movie for the claustrophobic, Das Boot almost literally goes deeper and deeper into the ocean, letting the tension in the air build to near bursting point.The camera work in this movie is worth paying attention to simply because it's an exercise in limited space. Somehow Peterson keeps the camera dynamic and moving despite the fact that there's very little to move to, the angles are fresh and aren't repetitive and yet it's not as if he had much choice in how to block a lot of these scenes. Hitchcock's Lifeboat is pretty sweet, but this is the real thing. And as the characters have to contend with limited space, they also deal with limited resources, oxygen, energy, and sanity--bringing the audience into most of it as well.Also refreshing is the lack of political persuasion in this movie. Heck, even the ending isn't really a ""War is hell"" message, much more a cynical survivalist point. These characters have very little interest in the war, they're just trying to survive their separate battles, and in the one scene in which they are able to interact with the political side, everything from the dress to the formalities to the lighting of the scene does not fit with their day to day reality; and in the one scene where they're confronted with the morality of it all, they nevertheless have to choose survival and adaptability over any humanistic concerns.By the way, I would not recommend the English dub of this movie. The voices and accents are downright cartoonish, and would fit better in an animated anti-German propaganda film than in this more seriously considered survivalist tale.--PolarisDiB",Das Boot

50,ShootingShark,Incredibly Intense WWII Submarine Action Drama,8,2 May 2005,"In 1941, Britain and Germany are battling for control of crucial Atlantic supply routes. German submarine U-96 leaves the French port of La Rochelle; its mission, to inflict as much damage as possible on cargo-ship convoys.This is a unique movie and for my money one of the best war pictures ever made. Whilst maintaining a very high level of drama and suspense for a long film, it also seems so real and credible, and the filmmakers went to great lengths to convey this authenticity. It is based on an autobiographical novel by Lothar-Günther Buchheim who was a real-life war correspondent. The stunning submarine set by Rolf Zehetbauer was built with incredible attention to period detail and as an enclosed space, restricting the camera-work but adding tremendously to the crucial atmosphere of confinement. The great cast gave everything to the picture (for example, they were not allowed out in the sun during the shooting) and their transformation as it progresses into haggard, bearded, weary ghosts is startling and unsettling. Prochnow is stunning as the unnamed Captain; a man who has the respect of his crew yet is essentially alone, but the entire ensemble are brilliant - I especially like Wennemann (the chief engineer), Tauber (the navigator) and Hoenig (the radio-operator) all of whom give quiet, thoughtful, understated performances, very atypical in an epic movie filled with action. The eerily effective use of sound adds to the movie's tension, and there is brilliant claustrophobic camera-work by Jost Vacano. The depiction of the crew's struggles - alternating intolerable boredom with sheer terror when the alarm is raised, evading depth charges and destroyers, running dangerously deep to avoid detection, repairing the ship (literally everything breaks at some point), following suicidal orders - is the heart of the film. U-Boat crews had a one in four chance of surviving, and the movie's heartbreaking conclusion is deeply profound and moving, regardless of your views on World War II. This is a film about people, not politics, which is why it's such a great war movie. Shot as both a 145-minute feature released first, and as a six-hour TV miniseries screened later; this review is of an even better 200-minute version recut by Petersen and re-released in 1996.",Das Boot
51,truemythmedia,The Best Submarine Movie Ever,10,26 June 2019,"Simply stated: ""Das Boot"" is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of submarine war movies. Other films like ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" barely hold a candle to the nail-biting, claustrophobic world of Petersen's ""Das Boot"". Where other submarine war movies try to excite you with action and excitement, this film tries to instill in you the fear of war that these men would've faced, tries to give you a glimpse of the boredom they would've felt before their missions, and it helps you to understand the way of life on a submarine during wartime. There are scenes that make the viewer feel like we're right there in the darkened passages of that German U-boat with the men, waiting on baited breath to see if the submarine will ever surface again. It's intense, invigorating, and exhausting, but it's also and unforgettable journey, one that I will be happy to revisit again and again.

After Titanic Das Boot would be the most perilous thrilling Disaster movie at sea (or under it), unfortunately Titanic's Victory over this is not a small one, but a rather large one. Das Boot, is definitely a white-knuckle and should be watched on as big a screen as possible with the volume up. you'll find more potency in this picture than anything Hollywood throws these days, Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay are no Match for Das Boot. Unfortunately the film needs more. Das Boot is a conundrum. The protagonists are Nazis, meaning you have to ask yourself whether it is best to root for or against them. Das Boot tries to direct your empathy toward its handful of German sailors by presenting human qualities about them, but in the end you don't really care enough. Like Titanic, Das Boot turns into a tragedy, but this is not a movie that will leave you tear stricken. I will say this for Das Boot, it represents the biggest German production that I have seen to this day, and also the longest. Some scenes contain feeble uninteresting dialogue but you forget about them the moment, Das Boot shows its teeth.A combination of skilled editing, camera-work, directing, and clever use of sound effects, make das Boot a sensational thriller. A good part of it has to do with the claustrophobia on board. The movie wouldn't have worked if it were any shorter than three hours, which is why the director's cut is the way to go. As so many films do, Das Boot carries the following message ""war is not glorious"". Young men board a U-boat with expectations of glory and heroism to come, and when they return they are bruised, shaken, confused and disturbed. I've seen the message delivered more potently in other war films like All Quiet on the Western Front, but few War films give you a punch to the gut like Das Boot.

54,Seraphion,Great depiction of the gloomy underwater war machine,7,25 September 2014,"The story opens up interestingly, with one of the dialog line stating the obvious about the soldiers doing such things due to fears of having have to face death again on their next mission. The story builds really well showing the Captain as always being the wise man and the calm strategist. It sure also has all those risk takings any great military leaders have to endure. Watching the director's cut version, I see this movie completes itself by also depicting all the contrasting experiences such as the 'collision games' and the supply vessel. The acting feels just enough. Here I see how Juergen Prochnw establishes his acting prowess. One thing about the acting is that most of the actors have quite the same expressions in almost all kinds of situation.",Das Boot

There has always been a deep interest (even by British Historians) with the German Kreigsmarine and my own fascination stems directly from this incredible movie. For once it's not about the Americans, the British or even about the Germans, but possibly the only war film (ever) to deal with real people and their struggle (in a tense cat and mouse game) for survival. Although there has been highly brave sub-mariners from many nations, they have largely been forgotten: as the chief focus has always been on the most-feared 'Wolf Packs'. Us British were top masters in espionage, as well as inventions such as Radar and Sonar. Active sonar could detect a pen dropping on a desk (within a U-Boat) and once located with passive sonar, it was almost game over! 3 out of 4 Boats never came back home. Nominated for six academy awards, it shamefully won nothing; losing out to 'tootsie'. Go figure that stupidity. 'Das Boot' is quite simply a life changing, true masterpiece of a movie.",Das Boot

It is at best an above-average film.As an anti-war film, this one pales in comparison to The Thin Red Line.I am a great admirer of Wolfgang Petersen, the director. His previous German films ""Black and White like Days and Night"" and ""the Consequence"" are far superior both in content and treatment to this film, especially the former on a chessplayer. Petersen has never been able to surpass his achievements in these early German films. In the domain of acting, was this Jurgen Prochnow's best film? Certainly not, if you compare it to his work in Hauff's ""Brutalization of Franz Blum"" and Petersen's ""The consequence.""What else is so exceptional about this film? The realism? Most East European movies had portrayed better realism than ""Das Boot"" in the Seventies and Eighties. Of course, it stands tall when you compare its realism with most Hollywood war movies of the Eighties and Seventies...I do not for a moment infer that the effort of the filmmakers was not laudable. It was. But the product is definitely not a masterpiece.",Das Boot
57,screenman,Exhausting,8,13 June 2009,"This is certainly the most authentic representation of life on a WW2 submarine. In this case, it's a German U-boat; but conditions were unlikely to have been much better on allied subs.Made in the 1980's the movie offers a warts-and-all insight into the grubby, smelly, dank, confined and intimate world of submariners. It's a grim and rather myth-puncturing portrayal, compared to those made during or soon after the war, in which well-groomed and smartly-dressed seamen wandered about in large, clean, hygienic over-sized vessels.Jurgen Prochnow plays the skipper to perfection. His crew is a mixture of familiars and new-hands played by German character actors who seem to know their parts very well. A journalist is also sailing with them.The movie conveys all of the issues confronting the submariner. As well as the perennial moisture and the smell, the bad food, the terrors of depth-charging, the inadequate sanitation and so on; there is boredom. Long, long waits for orders and the hunting of allied ships.If anything, the movie overstates the case, and there are times when I find in drags a little. The crew don't seem sufficiently differentiated to provide interesting contrasts, and the script - however authentic - is banal to the point of soap-opera. This, I think, may be more to do with the English dubbing. I would also have liked a greater infil on personal background and their motivation for volunteering to take a job that I wouldn't have done at gun-point. The most we get is a rather coarse, over-the-top pre-sail party.All of the usual time-honoured underwater issues are addressed, including beyond-test-depth diving, and the crew-member who goes berserk. But - as I say - it's all performed within an authentic environment and with great fidelity, even to the point of bananas hanging amongst torpedoes and crew members overcome by bowel-movements during attack. The rough-sea sailing sequences are absolutely tremendous.Title and incidental music is well chosen to express both the peaceful interludes as well as tension and high drama. Sound and other technical issues are all on the money. My DVD is a 280 minute epic which I have so far failed to manage at one sitting. It could be edited to half that length. If anything its powerful impact would be heightened in a shorter format, because at that length; even the most dedicated viewer's attention begins to wilt. The trouble is; I've seen a shorter version and many of the bits I enjoy are edited out!As a movie about life below the ocean-wave during WW2, it's a must-see. The definitive presentation of the genre. But brace yourself for the twist at the end.",Das Boot
58,Sergeant_Tibbs,One of the greatest films of all-time.,10,17 October 2007,"Calling Das Boot a masterpiece is an understatement. Words cannot express my sheer love for this film. With an extraordinary length, its a non-stop excitement rush. (Like only La Haine and Magnolia before); it goes above and beyond perfection. Not sure of any subtle depth it may or may not have, but on film-making terms it tops the list. A rewarding adventure and an unforgettable experience. Recommended to anyone and everyone who likes a great film.It begins by stating a simple fact of the war (40,000 soldiers went to war but only 10,000 came back) in an effort to gain some pre-sympathy for the men we are about to watch; which I think is highly effective for the end result. From start to finish our eyes never leave either the captain of the boat or the journalist writing an article from a soldier of a submarine's point of view. This means the film never strays from the point and becomes extremely easy to follow; also shown by the fact they're only off the boat for about half an hour in the entire running time. Its dark yet vibrant colour keeps your attention; that of course is not the only aspect keeping attention. To sum up the film entirely I would say its about how much pressure the submarine can take which relies on how much pressure the men can take.A brilliant direction and extremely detailed from Petersen, giving the perfect claustrophobic atmosphere by filming it inside the boat instead of from a side view (so little space there wasn't enough room to shoot it with sound – making that aspect even more outstanding). Several long takes throughout gives us a better feel for the atmosphere; almost feels like its point of view from someone, therefore making it a more personal experience. Dangerous realism ensues, with close encounters to water, fire and other explosions, so much so that I wasn't sure whether it was genuine fear or not. All of these aspects and their intensity make the tension almost unbearable. It keeps the tension by simply waiting for a reaction from something or anything. Even though the films simple structure means you know they aren't going to die now. It's triumphant score is underused yet doesn't need to be overdone. He offers subplots to avoid the film from being empty.All the actors were completely immersed in their roles, its hard to believe they ever really did leave the boat. Their emotions of fear, happiness, uncertainty and sadness transfers straight from the screen to the viewer. The endless conflict is understandable and entertaining. Perfect deliveries throughout, which the subtitles do no justice to, unfortunately. Strong characters, especially the captain, who's ever contemplating with always something interesting to say. Powerful and explosive. Quiet and subtle. The huge range. The film gets its length from the extraordinary amount of detail it puts it. Yet it never gets boring. They all become ""heroes"" just for being there whether they deserved it or not. Propaganda of the sort, in an effort of encouragement I guess. But the experience does thrash all the emotion out of them, leaving them only with fear.The film shows the only symbol of man being a beard, with all the men, bar one man who acts like a child under the pressure. They are left with only simple pleasures, like music. The boat could be more of an escape from the war than heading towards it, as no casualties happen until the final 10 minutes once they are off the submarine. Even though some of the men were looking forward to getting into battle. It does not ignore the fact the soldiers would be suffering from such things as homesickness, sexual frustration, claustrophobia and of course nits (particularly in the pubic area); taking time to present them all. There is not a moment in the film that is not perfect. It would get a bit tiring after a while if it ever took its time for the next important sequence.Das Boot fits perfectly and equally into all its genres (war, drama and thriller) making one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had.

Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer), who has been assigned as a war correspondent on the German submarine U-96 in October 1941. He meets its captain (Jürgen Prochnow), chief engineer (Klaus Wennemann), and the crew in a raucous French bordello. Thomsen (Otto Sander), another captain, gives a crude drunken speech to celebrate his Ritterkreuz award, in which he openly mocks not only Winston Churchill but implicitly Adolf Hitler as well.The next morning, they sail out of the harbour of La Rochelle to a cheering crowd and playing band. Werner is given a tour of the boat. As time passes, he observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is embittered and cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are often mocked by the rest of the crew, who share a tight bond. After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boat's spotting of an enemy convoy, but they soon locate a British destroyer, and are bombarded with depth charges. They narrowly escape with only light damage.The next three weeks are spent enduring a relentless storm. Morale drops after a series of misfortunes, but the crew is cheered temporarily by a chance encounter with Thomsen's boat. Shortly after the storm ends, the boat encounters a British convoy and quickly launches four torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below the submarine's rated limit. During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief mechanic, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage, but is eventually able to safely surface in darkness. An enemy tanker remains afloat and on fire, so they torpedo the ship, only to realize that there are still sailors aboard; they watch in horror as the sailors, some on fire, leap overboard and swim towards them. Following orders not to take prisoners, the captain gives the command to back the ship away.",Das Boot
61,DeeNine-2,A strong candidate for the best war movie ever,10,22 May 2001,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Das Boot is a taut, realistic drama, exemplified by a careful plot that maintains and releases tension incrementally so that we are riveted to the screen, and the two and a half hours the film runs seems like half an hour. Director Wolfgang Petersen (lately the director of The Perfect Storm (2000)) persuades us to identify with the German sailors crammed into their Unterseeboot as the depth charges blast all around them. Strange, take away the spoken German and this could be an American submarine dodging those depth charges. In fact there is no German insignia on the U-boat, and you have to look hard to find a swastika anywhere in the movie. Clearly Petersen wanted to disassociate himself and his movie from the Nazis, who had ruined Germany, and seek a universal identification for his crew. The somewhat eerie effect on the American viewer is not only to make us see the human waste of war, but to lead us to realize that yes, it was horrible for the Germans.Great movies surprise you. Something creative happens and your eyes widen and your attention is arrested. Here it begins when the U-boat's captain, played with superb subtlety and characteristic charm by Jürgen Prochnow, talks against ""our masters in Berlin"" as his men steal nervous glances at one another. You know they're thinking, ""The captain is talking treason."" But suddenly we, the audience, realize that he knows he's going to die (probably going to die, I should say, since we are told in a blurb following the opening credits that of 40,000 Germans sailors sent out in U-boats, 30,000 did not return); and so he feels free to speak his mind. And then to put an exclamation point on it, he tells the young journalist on board to write it up for the propaganda minister and then, as an ironic stab at the ""Hitler Youth"" officer, he orders ""It's a long way to Tipperary"" to be played on the Victrola, while they all sing along in glorious English!One of the amazing things about this movie is how the U-boat and the destroyers seem to take on emotionally-charged characteristics. When the destroyer appears in the periscope out of the fog and the spray, it seem like a monster about to descend. And the way the depth charges are flung at the U-boat made me feel how much the Allies hated them and wanted to destroy them like vermin. I felt sorry for the German sailors cowering in their little boat, being hated so much, because Petersen made us see that those men were no different than you and I.This is not only one of the greatest war movies ever made, it compares favorably with the classic anti-war drama (also seen from a German POV), Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) directed by Lewis Milestone. I suspect that Petersen was influenced by that movie and by some American films about World War II, in particular Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), Robert Wise's excellent submarine drama set in the Pacific starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.",Das Boot
62,dunmore_ego,The Reich Stuff.,9,20 July 2010,"Never has nothing happening been such compelling viewing.No debate, no discussion, no contenders - DAS BOOT is THE submarine movie for the ages.In autumn 1941, World War II U-Boat 96, crewed by young rowdy Germans, puts to sea with its veteran captain, wildly Teutonic Jürgen Prochnow, his eyes the color of eagle and high cheekbones set on stun.The battle for control of the Atlantic is turning against the Germans, yet Hitler orders more and more U-boats with ever younger crews into battle against the British freighters and their destroyer escorts. This opening pitch and the antsiness of Jürgen's young hooligan crew seems to presage a roaring Hitlercoaster of war war war Amerikan style - but director/co-writer Wolfgang Petersen and writers Lothar G. Buchheim and Dean Riesner swerve to port with a counter intuitive yet singularly entertaining and tension-filled, character-driven non-action action movie. These young punks discover that being at war is much like the waiting room in any doctor's office.DAS BOOT is filled with periods of waiting in fear, waiting in boredom, waiting in terror, waiting in anxiety - and sudden action that rips throats and bends steel with its bare hands.DAS BOOT does something which most commercial war films are too gutless to do - humanizes Germans: they carry photos of their girls, they write home, there are heroes and cowards, there are hard men and those that crack under the strain; they catch crabs and rib each other about it; at one point, a sailor stops a celebration with the announcement of bad news on the radio - into the silence, he declares that back home, their team has lost! These men doubt much of the war propaganda they are fed. Even though German tacticians convey Churchill as a ""paralyzed guzzler"" the officers on U-96 respect the British fleet (""Those aren't amateurs up there""). Yet they do not fear the British simply because that is the default position of Germans in Westernized film, but because the British had better equipment. These Germans are not one-dimensional haters, not committed blindly to the Führer, not simple villain props as in countless Brit and U.S. movies. They are the heroes. And our hearts are with theirs in their throats every watery step of the way.Even in its shortest version, DAS BOOT is 2 hours, 29 minutes. The Director's Cut is 209 minutes, the uncut version is 293 minutes (4 hrs, 53 mins). It's the most fun you'll have growing a five o'clock shadow.DAS BOOT attains such a high level of drama, we forgive Wolfgang Petersen for the subpar exteriors, with those model subs and little dolls on the tower being foamed in slow motion to emulate a sizable u-boat.When most movies are ending - at the 1:33 mark - this movie sees its first action. Yet even the action is not what one expects: after U-96 fires torpedoes at a British convoy, they submerge and wait in silence, listening for the muffled far-off explosions and counting the British ships sinking by the groans of steel they hear through the depths. And they know they're in for repercussions - depth charges. The waiting begins anew - the interminable, unbearable waiting for death to claim you or not - as they ""run silent,"" all lights out, submerging further, engines at minimum. The sound of sonar pings their only warning that something is closing on them from above. The Captain says into the silence, ""Here it comes. The revenge."" And all they can do is hang on through the bucking explosions and bolts bursting on pressurized pipes.After the terror subsides, Prochnow simply declares, ""That's the end of that."" Not heroes. Not cowards. Just doing their job.When U-96 surfaces to survey their kills, they are outraged to find that one of the flaming ships they torpedoed still has men onboard, jumping off, screaming, aflame. And the focus of the Captain's outrage will surprise you: ""Why weren't they rescued after all these hours?"" One of his officers begins to weep for the dying. It's a wondrous portrayal of war empathy, of humanity. It makes us question war yet again, and question the supposed intelligence of the species that can create the marvel of submarines and battleships only to use them in such unproductive, moronic fashion against each other.Imagine the frustration of knowing that on a submarine, humans are the least important cargo - literally stacks of torpedoes, spare parts, tools for repairs (it's like being in space - there is nowhere you can turn if you need a certain part), food, fuel, ballast, the mechanics of the sub itself, and at the very bottom of the list - as evidenced by the way sleeping bunks are haphazardly squeezed into crawlspaces - people.Director Petersen instructed the whole crew not to go out into the sun during filming, so they would retain that bloodless pallor. He effectively suffocates us in the ghastly, claustrophobic passageways and ""living spaces"" of a submarine; he sends his cameras barreling through crawlspaces full tilt, pursuing running men who trip and glide through hatches; we almost feel the cracking of our skulls on jutting iron overhangs; sea water thunders in every time the top hatch is opened, drenching the plastic-coated charts and everyone nearby; everything is wet and damp, dark and cold...DAS BOOT is a gritty study in patience, tactics, anxiety, tolerance, futility, and brings a whole new meaning to wetting the bed.",Das Boot
63,Spuzzlightyear,Das Boot,8,24 January 2013,"Very long (I watched the 3 1/2 hour version of this) with some boring batches, some exciting patches, and some very intense patches (just like submarine life I suppose) Das Boot woke everyone up to the filmmaking skills of Wolfgang Petersen. I had known about this film for years, but never did get around to seeing it. But I finally did. It took about a week or so to watch it mind you, a little bit here, a little bit there. It definitely got better as we went along. I would recommend though, the shorter version first if you haven't seen this, and even if you just DID see the shorter version, unless you've GOT to see this, I think you'll be fine.",Das Boot

65,PartialMovieViewer,Tense - More Tense - Intense,10,29 May 2012,"I would like to start off by criticizing this movie – alas - I could not find anything bad to say about it. Conversely I could mention the good things in this movie, but that would be a put-down. This flick was awesome in all respects. The filming was so remarkableI got so involved. I felt so claustrophobic even in my living room. I could almost sense the pressure closing in on me when the boat went below crush-depth - at one point I went out to my garage to make sure I had plenty of wood for shoring. And then when the boat started rocking and rolling in seas-state-oh-my-God, I broke out my puke-bag in order to join the crew in their vomit-orchestra. I sat glued to this movie for over 2 hours and ended up wanting two more hours – and then two more on top of them. The filming was excellent, or as they would say, 'amazing in Germany' – ahhhh - oh yeah - 'amazing in Germany'. I have been on US subs a number of times and these U-boats were tiny compared to the boats now-a-days. If you need an idea as to how small these guys are, check out the U-505 in Chicago. I don't like to do this too much because it does take away from another's work, but comparing the perceived size of the sub in U-571 and this u-boat – U-571 would be a tractor-trailer and this boat would be a 'Smart Car'. Anyways, the cast was superb. I do not speak German, but with this kind of acting – well I knew. I mean I really, really knew when it was time to dive, and I knew when we – oops – I mean they were in serious doo-doo (trouble), and mostly, I knew that the bread would really suck if someone didn't shave off the mold. You see - I knew. And that was due to the superb acting. OH, and I did get a little translation help form the English dubbed version I own. No-no-no I would have still known. I wish I had written this when I first saw this flick in a cinema – but I waited and forgot about it until I popper it in the DVD player last night. I do hope to see more like this.",Das Boot
66,Angry_Arguer,The Sound of Silence,7,18 August 2003,"Few movies are as nerve-shattering as Das Boot and, for once, I can recommend the Director's Cut of a movie.  Unlike such foolhardy examples as Terminator 2, the special edition of this movie adds to its overall value. I strongly recommend a minimum of one viewing of it.Sound in Das Boot is a strong factor, the Academy was totally stupid to ignore the level of detail here for E.T.  In submarines, sound is the basis of life and death, no other movie has captured the essence of being stuck in a tin can 500 feet beneath the surface of the ocean.  Realism is the second strong point of Das Boot, from the boredom of the hunt (thrill is the exact opposite word to use) to the terror of being hunted.  I found the way the camera is thrust through the bulkheads and hatches, following the crew, to be a strong saving grace in the cinematography department.  Kudos.  The crew is presented not in a stereotypical fashion, but as sailors without patriotism and not in the mood for dying or heroism.  There is no glory in war, everything is futile...that's the message of Das Boot.Overall, a superior war movie to others.  Too bad Wolfgang Petersen has fallen into a ""money pit"" with such garbage as In the Line of Fire and Air Force One.  See this instead of U-571.  4 out of 5 stars.",Das Boot

68,FilmOtaku,A film that gives us a view of WWII from another perspective,8,8 June 2004,"Recently, I watched another (semi) war film, `The Deer Hunter', and in my review I complained of pacing problems that led me to not like the film as much as I would have, had there been a little more fluidity.  What solidified this position and what I have used as a comparison since seeing the film, was `Das Boot'.  In theory, I should have been bored.  Here we have a film about a German U-Boat that almost solely takes place on this boat (save book ending scenes ashore) and yet there was not one moment when I could conjure up any sort of criticism regarding the pacing.  There were multiple scenes where the camera pretty much panned the faces of the crewmembers, and still, it was compelling due to the masterful direction of Wolfgang Peterson, a director whose filmography (in my opinion) is spotty at best.`Das Boot' is intense, real and enthralling.  Very quickly I felt slightly claustrophobic because the film has an incredible ability to draw you into any given scene.  `Das Boot' was intriguing to me because it is rare that we see war films from any perspectives other than our own, especially from the perspective of the enemy; and showed that these men were doing their `job' in the war, exactly like the American soldiers were.  `Das Boot', while not one of my `favorite' war films, is indeed an excellent film that requires a certain time commitment, but that time will not be arduous or wasted.--Shelly",Das Boot

71,Ben_Cheshire,Epic character study about emptiness of war.,5,22 May 2004,"(major spoilers - for this, A Perfect Storm and John Grisham's The Chamber)I don't know what made Wolfgang Peterson think life was so pointless, because he insists on taking us on these epic journeys of character and at the end of it all slaughtering the entire cast! He did it in The Perfect Storm also. It is a common misconception among art-house directors that a pessimistic/unhappy ending equals a good film. Not necessarily so. In fact, it is a common conception among moviegoers that the way Peterson chooses to develop his films is marvellously pointless. The public sees no point in spending two hours getting to know a bunch of people, then watching them all die before their eyes. Many people found Grisham's The Chamber ridiculous, because you read a nine hundred page book about whether this guy should or will get executed or not, and then at the end he just does. It feels like the rest of the book didn't really matter.I sometimes agree with the common sentiment about this kind of ending - I got bored halfway through Grisham's painful Chamber, and I did feel Perfect Storm was quite pointless - but I felt differently after Das Boot.Das Boot perhaps goes way too long in the new directors' cut. That's the silly thing about some directors' cuts. Often the way the films were released was much better! For instance, Coppola's extra forty minutes onto the already overblown Apocalypse Now, the pointless (and just plain bad) extra song Morning Report patched into The Lion King. It would have been much more palatable less an hour.But its not what you'd imagine here. It was initially made to be a mini-series in Germany, so it has that kind of feel of an epic of character. We need to stand the distance with these guys, we need to feel like we've spent time with them, we need that time to get to know them. Because this makes what happens at the end all the more devastating. Peterson is saying something about the pointlessness of war, echoed in the captain's speeches throughout the screenplay. There were men who lived on the ships and in the trenches of these great and terrible wars, real living people with dreams and aspirations, and for no good reason at all, they are killed like pigs.There are scenes of action every now and then, but quite frankly this is more a brilliant and absorbing character study than an action picture or war picture. A single line establishes our connection with the captain early on: he reads aloud from the captain's log to the crew about how little they have done so far in the war. From that moment on, we feel every blow against the ship as a blow against the captain's character. Peterson takes us into this ship, with marvellous close-ups, the long silences and passages of no-action, incredible tracking shots racing up and down the ship at drill time, and the soundtrack of the radar. Entire scenes and events are played out with the crew listening to the sound of the radar, which portends whether they are about to be attacked or not.The entire movie plays out on the faces of the captain (who has a marvellous face indeed) and a young, gargoyle-esque journalist - this is the gold of cinema. Bergman invented it: the human face.",Das Boot
72,tonypeacock-1,"Definitive, realistic submarine genre film. No dodgy hybrid accents!",10,21 July 2020,"Interesting 'submarine' film showing a German U-boat, U-96 in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean disrupting Arctic convoys from the U.S. to Britain.The German language adds to the authenticity of the film. There is no hybrid Scottish-Russian accents here. An excellent World War II film showing the conflict from the German perspective, Churchill is bad-mouthed for example.The 1981 film is as good as more 'modern' submarine films such as The Hunt For Red October (1990) and Crimson Tide (1995).The film has a German cast and crew. I watched the subtitled version rather than any dodgy voice dubbing version that exists.The special effects are 1981 level but the sets show the claustrophobic nature of a World War II diesel powered U-boat rather than a state of the art nuclear powered modern variant.The German cast is lead by Jürgen Prochnow as the ice cool submarine captain who doesn't wear fancy navy uniform like his contemporaries in the German Navy.Herbert Grönemeyer stars as Lt. Werner a character who is a War Correspondent based on Lothar-Gunther Buchheim whose memoirs published in the 1970s helped form the Das Boot script.I am glad the film doesn't have any Hollywood input in the casting. The German actors are so much more realistic for it.Director Wolfgang Petersen actually reached Hollywood notoriety in the 1990s with films such as In The Line Of Fire (1993) and Air Force One (1997).The film is a triumph and is the definitive submarine genre film.",Das Boot

But I had heard many people praise this movie for it's realism without glorification of war. As the movie is based on true events I finally crossed the line.I got hold of the Director's Cut, the restoration copy, which runs for almost 3½ hours. Indeed it is a very dramatic movie and I am pleased to have seen it. But the extra hour made it too long and the events are stretched out, perhaps to give the viewer a personal apprehension and fear of being trapped whenever the boat was in dire straits. Life was constantly hanging by a thread and you experience this feeling too.The acting was superb, but in this longer version the movie only qualifies for a 7.

75,FlickJunkie-2,Brilliant in every respect,10,15 April 2000,"I don't think there are enough superlatives in the English language to adequately describe this film.   It succeeds in every possible way.  This is not only one of the best war movies ever, but among the very best films period.  The story is based on a true story of a German Submarine and its crew during WWII.  The plot is simple.  A bunch of ordinary young guys are crammed into a little tin can and go out and do their duty while trying to avoid getting killed.  This slice of life film gives a chillingly detailed look at the rigors of war in a U-boat.We are treated to the stark reality of submarine warfare; the hours of boredom; the camaraderie and simultaneous aggravation that comes with living in such close quarters, the exultation of victory when a torpedo hits, the stark terror of the sound of a destroyer's propeller just above or the insane fear of the boat being crushed by the water pressure as you go too deep.  This film is unique in that it is done from the German perspective.  Most films about WWII are from the Allied perspective since they were produced in Hollywood or England.  What is striking about this film is how it depicts war as a human event rather than a nationalistic conflict.  It makes us realize that for the foot soldier and sailor on the battle lines, no matter what side, war is the same.  It is more a matter of survival than glory.Director Wolfgang Peterson did a brilliant job on this film.  The set and props were authentic in minute detail and the work in tight quarters was truly remarkable.  You get a real sense of the cramped quarters and how nimble the men had to be scrambling from compartment to compartment. Peterson spares us none of the unpleasantness of submarine life.  The stark reality of it is startling.By far Peterson's greatest accomplishment is the spine tingling suspense. The effect is so terrifying you feel like you are part of the crew.  His use of angles, lighting, actor's reactions and most especially sound makes this film far more frightening and suspenseful than anything the horror genre has ever produced.   I viewed this on DVD (Director's Cut) and the sound was probably the best I've ever experienced.  You hear water dripping behind you, bolts explode and go screaming diagonally across the room to clank on the other side, the sound of the destroyer's propeller escalates from a fly buzz to a roar as the ping from the sonar gets ever louder.  You find every muscle in your body tensing as you hear them drop the depth charges.The ending is superb.  It is triumphant, poignant and ironic; unexpected and yet not surprising.  It is neither what the viewer is apt to want nor expect, and yet it is not disappointing.I can't think of any negative criticism I would give this film.  It was nominated for six Academy Awards and won none.  That speaks volumes about the dubious nature of the Academy.  Even if you don't normally enjoy war movies, you should see this film.  It is ultra excellent drama, entertainment and filmmaking.  A perfect 10.",Das Boot

I really enjoy the camera work and cinematography by Jost Vacano. It is some of the best camera work you will ever see in a submarine. The way they move the camera through this small set is amazing and from what I understand this is a relatively low budget film and it is amazing what Wolfgang Petersen does with what he has to work with. Do yourself a favor and check this one out, it has great atmosphere. Great performance by Jurgen Prochnow by the way.",Das Boot
77,dr_foreman,Intense.,9,24 May 2007,"""Das Boot"" is an excellent drama...and it's also more terrifying than virtually every horror film I've ever seen. The dark, dirty, claustrophobic environment of the submarine is something out of a nightmare. Even the sound effects are scary - the boom of the depth charges, the groaning of the hull under pressure, the ""ping!"" of bursting bolts, etc. etc. The images, the sounds, and the charged performances of the actors work together beautifully to create the illusion that fifty men are fighting for their lives in an amazing but fragile piece of machinery.But the film is more than just an intense sensory experience - it's also an unusually well-written, antiwar character piece. While some of the sub's crew members are inevitably underdeveloped (in the director's cut version, anyway), most of them are interesting and memorable. Actor Jurgen Prochnow is fantastic as the cynical captain, who still fights hard even though he's clearly lost his faith in the Nazi regime. Herbert Grönemeyer is pretty good as the war correspondent, who starts as an outsider but gradually blends in with the veteran crew. The other standout character, for me, is Johann (Erwin Leder), who has one of the most gaunt and frightening faces in movie history.Speaking of the crew, some critics have complained that the film is far too sympathetic to them, since the Germans were the universally recognized bad guys of World War II. But, while I believe that Nazi Germany was the most despicable state in human history, I don't necessarily feel that every German who served in its armed forces was despicable. In other words, I simply have no problem sympathizing with the German characters in this movie. They're common fighters, not policy-makers; you can't blame them for Hitler's doings any more than you can blame the average contemporary American for George W. Bush's Middle East policies.The other common criticism of the film is that it's a little too long, too slow, too repetitive, whatever. I can understand why some people might be bored by ""Das Boot,"" but of course director Peterson actively tried to make parts of the film slow in order to simulate the tedium of daily life on a submarine. (Similarly, ""The French Connection"" depicts surveillance as a tedious and time-consuming business, and risks becoming tedious itself). Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, if you're mentally prepared for a long and tough viewing experience, then these aspects of ""Das Boot"" should not annoy you. If you want an action submarine movie, then by all means rent something cute and inoffensive like ""Crimson Tide""! Perhaps the one real weakness of ""Das Boot"" is that it utilizes dated model effects. The models draw you out of the realism a bit - you may find yourself wondering who turned off ""Das Boot"" and put on ""Godzilla"" instead - but, for the time, they look fine (I could point to several equivalently lame model shots in ""Star Wars,"" for instance, but that would be blasphemy.) Anyway, the effects are certainly respectable enough to earn our (slight) indulgence.There are really no problems with this movie, then - it's one of those ""just about perfect"" films. It's not pleasant to watch, and in fact I put off seeing it for years because I knew it would be really intense. But, if you're in the mood, ""Das Boot"" is a rare visceral and intellectual treat. War movies really don't get any better.",Das Boot
78,Antagonisten,The only submarine-movie you will ever need,8,9 March 2005,"I hate movies about submarines. Seriously it has to be one of the most overrated genres ever. Why? Simply because usually there is not plot enough to fill half a sub and there is almost NO variation to the themes presented. But there is always exceptions, and most of the time it's these exceptions that highlight just how awful the genre in general is. This is that exception.The story here is nothing revolutionary. It's just the tale of a German submarine during WW2. Their operations, the life on board and the ever-present fear of being stuck inside a bubble of air in a broken submarine at the bottom of the sea. And i must say that this is the only submarine-movie to truly capture the fear, the claustrophobic intensity of the situation. And that makes this movie fantastic.This is not first and foremost a war-film. Although the theme is World War 2 and the men portrayed are soldiers, this is more a psychological journey telling the tale of people on the edge. The acting is in most parts excellent, with Jürgen Prochnow excelling as the tightly-wound captain. What astounds me here is also the way that the film-makers do so much with so little. There is not many special effects needed, nor any of the CGI that is standard today, to create a suspense that far supersedes most of what is released today.This is the only submarine-movie you will ever need. See it for the suspense, as well as for the lesson in the futility of war. I rate this 8/10.",Das Boot
79,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: overrated & showing its age,3,31 March 2002,"I'm an action movie guy. I'm not into drama, so I rented Das Boot for the joy ride. I believe that a movie should be rated for its current impact, and I think many reviewers are reaching into their memories of the past. I've seen it recently. It was disappointing.Was ""Das Boot"" the original submarine action flick? Well, since 1981 action movie standards have grown a lot. What once may have been original (submarine goes up, down, dodging missiles, fixing leaks) has now been overshadowed by ""Crimson Tide"", ""The Hunt for Red October"", and others. It reminded me of ""The Poseidon Adventure"", which is also now too old to enjoy.As a straight action movie, I would have given it a ""6"". But there's more.Drama lovers and arty types have the refinement and film school talent of separating the film into its component parts. They can, for example, love the choreography and costuming even if the story is awful and the characters loathsome. I don't have that fine an appreciation.For a regular guy like me, I just can't root for the Nazis. The film is about the German military in World War II and while the film portrays them as ""regular guys, decent and fighting against the ocean depths"", I just cannot separate that from a sense of right and wrong that these folks (however trapped) are fighting for ideals which (even though some characters in the film say it's all baloney) ultimately they support.So I'm forced to give this film a 3 out of 10. Try watching this right after ""Schindler's List"" and see if you disagree.Who should see this film:-- Arty / drama types who can get around my unsophisticated viewpoint-- Action movie lovers with nothing better to do on a rainy day, who can get around my unsophisticated viewpoint. There are two ways to do it -- by being overly highbrow or overly lowbrow! :)",Das Boot
80,DareDevilKid,Great Storyline But Badly Executed Movie,5,13 February 2011,"I'm not trying to be intelligent, I just try to speak from my heart & my claims are certainly not spurious.Firstly, I know that many film academies & critics might have this film on their top 10 list. While film academies are only a minor testimonial, we all know that critics are mostly smug, obnoxious wannabe filmmakers with high-handed viewpoints.Secondly,I personally agree that its director 'Mr. Wolfgang Pieterson' is supremely talented. Two of his movies: 'Air Force One' & 'In The Line Of Fire' are among my all time favourites.But sadly in this movie, his direction is not up to the mark. If I view a movie and then proceed to dedicate multiple viewings to it, then that movie has great direction. If I'll view it only once or twice more, then it has good direction. If I'll view it only once albeit satisfactorily, then the direction is okay. If I'll stop viewing it midway, then its a bad movie with bad direction. But if I view it to its finale with the anticipation of a good climax owing to a good storyline & not due to the relentless entrapment of my mind by its well crafted scenes, dialogues & background score, then that , to me is a definitive: ""LACK OF DIRECTION AND TEDIOUS PACING WITH BELOW PAR EDITING(PRIME EG:- 'DAS BOOT')."" Among other contemporary directors, perhaps, 'Martin Scorsese', 'Quentin Tarantino', 'Joel Coen', or 'Anurag Kashyap' might have done a better job at directing this great story.And finally, with all due respect, I being an avid film buff & part-time short filmmaker myself, needn't be reminded of the many awards this film won & other Oscar nominations along with many more prestigious nominations which it garnered. But awards alone can never be a testimonial to a film's greatness. And this is not just what I say, but one of cinema'a all time greatest directors, 'Mr. Quentin Tarantino' himself said this & I quote: ""I don't care how many awards a film has won, even the Oscars. If I want to watch a movie again & again, then that to me is a truly great movie."" Can anybody please tell me how many people have watched 'Das Boot' more than once. And I'm just talking about true fans of cinema & not film academies, film students, or even critics for that matter. And when I say 'true fans of cinema', I most certainly don't mean teenyboppers looking for overblown CGI FX or beleaguered office goers & spoilt, rich, neglected housewives looking for some popcorn entertainment & eye-candy.I'm just talking about people like you & me. We might delve into all the technical aspects of filmmaking & view them academically, but ultimately, we are also just 'true fans of cinema'. That's the reason we began pursuing movies more deeply & I implore you to never forget that.I've been in forums where there were Navy submariners present. According to them, it's almost universally accepted that Das Boot is the most realistic, best submarine movie ever made."" Now come on, if we make a movie about the medicinal ideologies irrespective of how boring it is, the medical fraternity is always going to root for it, but will other fans share the same enthusiasm. But this just further reasserts my analysis that ""this movie had a great storyline but was badly executed"".And as for a prime example, here goes. Ever heard of the movie 'The Good The Bad And The Ugly'. It never won any Oscars & was lambasted by most critics upon its release. But today after 45 yrs. (forget 30 yrs.), its loved by one & all, including fans, film academics & students, or even regular multiplex goers. Unlike 'Das Boot' which is only known among the major cities of Europe & America, this movie is a global phenomenon & popular even in the most remotest villages of even third world nations. Even in my Motherland, where foreign movies are not very popular (I mean non Hollywood movies), this film was re-released two years ago, & even ran to 60 to 70% filled houses for about two weeks, which is more than many new releases can boast of. And compared to this film, 'Das Boot' had a superlative story. 'Good BAd & Ugly' had hardly any story. It was basically a collage of one top-notch scene after another interwoven with great dialogues, music & camera angles by the master, legendary director, 'Mr. Sergio Leone' (once again, one of cinema's greatest directors).Even today, there are several fan-clubs organizing special screenings & discussions of this film along with other classics like 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', 'Psycho', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Seven Samurai', 'Indiana Jones', 'Dirty Harry', 'Yojimbo', 'Alien', 'The Bicycle Thief' & others. Everybody, young, middle aged & old alike will stop & watch at least a few scenes of these movies while surfing through channels. I myself never get weary of viewing these films. I always end up learning something from them again, while being entertained once again. Hence, to me, these movies among others are the true classics of cinema.",Das Boot

84,JakeBrinkman,Gritty and realistic,6,10 November 2019,"Note: I have only watched the theatrical cut, and my rating is based on that version, but I recommend you watch the director's cut instead.This movie was slightly contradictory with the gritty life on a sub presented so incredibly well, but still awkwardly cutting scenes that had any emotion other than dread. Life on a submarine must have been in a constant state of either boredom or fear, and the film presents that in a way to make the audience feel like they are experiencing those emotions right along with the crew. In dire times, each crew member desperately and doggedly performs their own task, never getting the full picture of what is happening to the sub, hanging on to a thread of hope that somehow their task will keep the sub afloat. The captain gets full knowledge of the sub's condition, but that same knowledge the crew members are desperate for is actually a curse as the captain must make some extremely difficult decisions.The sub's dire moments were nearly the entirety of the screentime, which was both enlightening and frustrating. I wanted a deeper connection with the crew members to give at least a few of them more than one dimension of emotional depth. However, the lengthy runtime didn't allow that deeper emotional level for a theater screen. From what I've read, it sounds like the director's cut contains many more scenes of daily life on the sub that do give deeper connections between the crew members. After reading that, I truly regret watching the theatrical version instead of the DC, and I am very confident the DC deserves a higher rating than the theatrical version.",Das Boot

But soon after the critical and commercial success(it made almost 85 million dollars and nominated for 6 Oscars) everyone release what a amazing film it really is.

92,OttoVonB,War and Peace,10,16 March 2002,"We're not used to see the German perspective in WWII films, because of all conflicts that one seems to have developed the strongest sense of moral polarization of all. Clearly, there was a bad side, and portraying it in any favorable way runs the risks of betraying History. The Germans would be the last to challenge this, so heavily has the weight of that human catastrophe burdened their conscience. Conversely, you might think, who better to make an anti-war film than a German filmmaker? Das Boot is the answer.Wolfgang Petersen must have had an artistic death-wish when he decided to throw all his weight at this project, a 6-hour long miniseries almost exclusively staged inside a cramped WWII German submarine. This, a 3.5 hour feature film edit, is one of the results, and its nowhere near the ordeal you'd imagine, at least not in that sense. Few films, especially war films, can even aspire to the level of character development or depth featured here: we live with these characters and watch them slowly devolve over time. The story, adapted from a book, is less about a mission or even the tour of duty and more about the absurdity of locking dozens of young men in a tin can for months and end while explosive charges are dumped on them from above, to nail-biting effect.It is a testament to the care that was taken with this project that, for all his charisma, the magnificent Jurgen Prochnow - as a very human captain - doesn't completely dominate the picture at the expense of other characters. It also shows admirable discipline in withholding glimpses of the world beyond the submarine, save a few fleeting, memorable sights. Doing previously unthinkable things with his compact cameras, Petersen makes wonders with his set, making it feel at times like a cluttered village teeming with life and activity, and minutes later like an inescapable, suffocating coffin. The sense of danger is in no way diminished by the enemy's facelessness: each beep of an incoming depth charge will cover you in goosebumps.With all its layers, you could say Das Boot is as much a war film as the Shawshank Redemption is a prison film. Such statements and classifications fail to appreciate the nuance and quality of either masterpiece. It is a great film beyond the confines of its genre, a thrilling ride that has a lot to say and ask about the human condition, and its sense of detail means its staying power and replay value are equally considerable.But don't take my word for it, see it for yourself!",Das Boot

94,jackasstrange,The Horror...,8,3 January 2014,"'Das Boot' is the ultimate war film. It's not the conventional drama, thriller or whatever. It's the real deal. It's about the real horror. But this is just possible to realize after the end. Why? You need to see for yourself.It don't has that much of a character development, an aspect that I think important, and the dialogs says nothing overly important for our perception about the characters, but everything which happens in the submarine is so intense and sincere, that the viewer don't need much more to be involved in the story. The acting is outstanding in my opinion, and so were the terrific FX(given the year, 1981) and the excellent direction and cinematography. And after all, it's a cruel and unfortunately truth about the world in war. The horror, the fear and tension the confined men suffers for a long period , things that can drive even the bravest man to a mental collapse. Though is not flawless. Some things aren't explained and others are way too confuse, and the soundtrack don't has an important presence. And again, I didn't feel connected with any character in the submarine. I was a viewer that sometimes was 'into' the story, but sometimes 'out' of it. It couldn't live up only by the thriller and the tension, both the fuel of the film. When it tried to show a little more, it was mostly uninteresting. But yet, it's effective and excellent in it's depiction of war. 8.3/ 10",Das Boot
95,zeekwunlau,"The submarine scene is real, but a bit lengthy",8,26 April 2020,"The plot is compact and ups and downs. Every time a deep-water bomb came over, the submarine shattered like a rock, and I was always thinking: I'm going to die after I finish it, but when I look at the video progress bar, it's not one-third. The director can't let them die so quickly. Read on, one deep water bomb after another, each time shocked with seven or eight elements, and each time escaped to death.The person who admires the most is the captain. Every time he makes a decision, his blue eyes emit an unusually firm light, and the instructions issued are simple and simple, making people feel very reliable. The director has been giving him such close-ups of expressions, well, he successfully convinced me.However, the outcome was unpredictable, and they were bombed when they returned to their home port to prepare for the celebration. The submarine sank, and the captain died after witnessing the submarine sinking. Simply looking at them from a human perspective, it can be said that this is a group of brave and intrepid submarine warriors.But every time when this idea emerged, I suddenly remembered that they were German soldiers, that is, fascists, the enemies of the people of the world. Suddenly feeling proud of them is very shameful. If they were n't German, how good they would be, I would be proud of them.Maybe not contradictory. What makes me proud of them is their charisma as a pure person and a pure army in this world.The director cannot prevent them from dying because he also needs to draw clear lines and stand on the right. If the ending is not like this, I am afraid that it will be overwhelmed by the saliva of the world.Perhaps the cruelty of war is cruel. You must draw a line with the enemy. You must be clearly enemy and foe. You must not have a little human kindness, otherwise you may die.I really like the ending of the film. It is easy to get home, the dock was bombed, and the warship was destroyed. This contrast is a bit unexpected, but not unexpected.The process and scenes of sinking the US-British warships were taken in one stroke. Are you afraid of offending Anglo-American?The propaganda officer, after entering the submarine, did not have a prominent part of the scene and did not know what to put in.The comparison of the environment between the submarine and the warship is a bit excessive. The description inside the submarine is too dull. I don't quite understand why every shot, almost all the soldiers come together.",Das Boot
96,bluesman-20,The Cold Deep sea and fear.,10,8 July 2009,Das Boot is one of those rare war movies that actually makes you feel like you are in that sub serving with the crew. The Story deals with a Veteran Captain with a mostly green crew in the last days of the Atlantic war. It is 1943 and the war has turned against Germany of all the U-Boats setting out they sail with a green crew and a experienced Captain who knows the Undersea battles are not as Glorious as the propaganda machine makes it out to be. it is one of fear and tight spaces and horrid sounds that the sub makes as it dives. It is of the uncertain that you may never see the light again or go home. He knows That Hitler and Goering and Gobbels are madmen but still this is his country and it has asked him to go to war and he does so but in time he loses the patriotic luster and he is actually angry that these young men are being sent to die. The film is full of cat and mouse scenes with destroyers going against the sub and almost destroying them. You feel the fear and terror as the sub creaks and the depth charges explode. The Film was adapted from the novel DAS BOOT written by a navel war reporter who served aboard a sub. The Script is a faithful adaption of that thrilling yet grim novel and the screenplay captures the mood perfectly it is relentless. The Directer's Execution of the screenplay is almost flawless. In The Genre of War movies there are only a few war movies that stand out just because they are so realistic Saving private Ryan and Band of Brothers come to mind and now Das Boot joins that rank of unforgettable war films.,Das Boot

Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (Jürgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea. Das Boot puts you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match.

99,asifahsankhan,Das Boot knows how to deliver the knock-out punches and really hammer its message about the futility of fighting.,9,28 July 2019,"German directors have a big problem when it comes to portraying a crucial part of their history. Unlike Americans, Brits, or Russians any German celebration of their accomplishments during World War II would be deemed as glorifying villains. As a result other films about World War II come out on a yearly basis while German films on the subject could probably be counted on your hands. But some directors have managed to figure out ways to present the themes of the time or the subjects in a way that fails to offend. Lars Von Trier's The White Ribbon addressed the mindset that led to the Nazi state while Downfall showed Hitler as the insecure child he truly was (and gave us an internet meme for the ages). Turns out there's one more direction to go and Wolfgang Petersen found it in Das Boot.Das Boot documents the life on a German U-Boat tasked with taking out supply lines towards the end of the war. While the crew earned many victories early, newer battleships with anti-submarine measures mean every enemy encounter could lead to the drowning of the entire crew. Though the crew initial fights boredom an malaize they're quickly thrust into the crucible of battle that appears more and more pointless as the days and losses continue to mount.So before I get into this movie as a piece of cinema you're probably wondering how we don't hate this entire U-Boat crew. Well this done in a number of clever and probably accurate ways. First and foremost, they're not a bunch of goosestepping Nazis. In the sailors first scene a captain insults Hitler and once they get on the boat the crew ridicules the young ""true believer"" for his love of the Nazi ideal. This is their job and they're average guys doing it. Hitler being in charge is incidental and they couldn't care less about him. They only care about their own survival and their mission.There's also a couple other smart script choices. The men are visibly disturbed when they see a ship they've sunk still has has crewman aboard, they handle bureaucracy that screws them over, and they spent most of the movie on the run.With all of this distance between the crew and the stereotypical German soldier, the audience can enjoy Das Boot as a reflection on the pointlessness of war and a tale of survival. Though the film may lack the quickdodge excitment of The Hunt For Red October this movie does a phenomenal job of putting you in the mindset of the men and gives you a realistic portrayal of the action. The cramped quarters, the panic that comes from every depth charge, it's all there in impressive glory. It's also a major credit to Wolfgang Petersen that the geography of the sub is so clear despite a number of chaotic battle scenes.Aside from the sub scenes this movie also plays out like a spiritual predecessor to flicks like Jarhead where the crew try to fight boredom and depression as they look for an enemy because it gives them something to do. Even seeing another German U-Boat is cause for a massive celebration because hey they're not alone! The extended cut in particular really drags this section out (I mean it's over three hours) but if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of sub life this isn't bad.The most notable weakness is the one note nature of all the characters. Considering the amount of time we spend with the crew you'd think we'd get more than the Captain is moral and stoic, the first mate has a tragic backstory but he's reliable, and the audience avatar spends most of his time going ""this is awful!""That's the point though. Director/writer Wolfgang Petersen isn't trying to glorify battle or make it all about heroic sacrifices. People are just trying to survive often against incredible odds and even then it may not matter. Though it's a slow burn, Das Boot knows how to deliver the knock-out punches and really hammer its message about the futility of fighting.",Das Boot

101,antagonist117,"""Das Boot"" has the elements that make all submarine movies compelling, but with some twists and shortcomings of its own",7,12 April 2014,"Three and a half hours, the approximate length of the director's cut of ""Das Boot,"" is longer than I'd want to spend in a real submarine, but I am glad to watch the right submarine movie for as long as it lasts. I love submarine movies and their cousins, spaceship movies. A group of people in an totally self-contained metal world surrounded by an uninhabitable void is a recipe for all kinds of excitement. In the case of submarines there is always the anxiety of fighting invisible enemies and the horror of hearing bulkheads bend and collapse. There are often eerie vistas of the kind seen in ""Ice Station Zebra""'s (1968) footage of the underside of an ice pack. In many cases, the isolation of the submarine becomes an opportunity to hone in on the characters and their incredibly small windows on the conflicts that surround and dwarf them.""Das Boot"" uses its isolation wisely enough, but less to create memorable and quirky characters in the vein of ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990) than to free its characters from their historical setting. Because our heroes are Germans, their isolation underwater provides an excuse to imagine them separately from the ideological toxicity of the Nazi regime. Nary a swastika is to be seen, and hardly even a uniform. They are a surprisingly cosmopolitan bunch as WWII-movie Germans go: one is a born expatriate from Mexico, another has a French fiancée, and they all enjoy English and French songs. There is one true believer on board (he happens to be the person from Mexico, perhaps to underscore the hypocrisy and nonsense of his loyalty to the Fuhrer's vision of Germany), but he is made a figure of mockery. Even the food is international: in an unusual decision that creates an ironic contrast, some of the most intense battle sequences occur against a backdrop of bananas, oranges, and pineapples that stuff the submarine's storage spaces and dangle from its pipes. These tropical offerings also offset the standard naval rations depicted earlier in the movie, such as hairy, undercooked pork and mold-encrusted bread.The focus of the film is the captain of the U-Boat. He carries out his job ruthlessly and takes little joy in his successes. When he and his bedraggled crew meet a polished and well-fed superior aboard a posh supply boat, he pointedly does not offer the salute or exchange pleasantries. Instead, he speaks the unpleasant reality of his experiences, stressing that the U-boat tour has been one near-death experience after the other, against an enemy that seems better-equipped and in the service of orders from on high that are virtually suicidal. This is certainly an anti-Nazi movie, then, but one that has its cake and eats it too: it creates idyllic, ultimately rather shallow characters and isolates them from their political context, allowing us to feel their ups and downs with them without the guilt of sympathizing with racists and national chauvinists. The action might have compensated for the relative weakness of the characters, but too much of it is of too little consequence, and several potentially-interesting plot points are abandoned, such as a second U-boat and its charismatic captain seen only at the beginning.Given these shortcomings, ""Das Boot"" takes too long to get where it is going. The right submarine movie can easily fill three and a half hours, and the ever-escalating pace of ""Das Boot"" prevents it from feeling longer than it is, but its length is certainly felt. It is difficult to imagine sitting through the nearly five-hour uncut version, but I don't rule it out entirely: the weak points of this installment notwithstanding, the strengths of the submarine genre are substantial enough to make another, longer viewing tempting.",Das Boot
102,Mitch-38,Superior Drama of War,9,10 February 2001,"Wolfgang Petersen's hallmark movie about the terror of submarine warfare in the Atlantic, during the Second World War. With expressive  nuance and subtext, the script (co-written by Petersen and Lothar G. Buchheim, from the latters novel) is first rate, in its stark portrayal of life and war aboard the submarine. The screenplay, melded together with superb acting has created an exceptional film. The atmosphere is at times choking, in its close quarters perception. The action is immense and terrifying. We become drawn into the world of these men, due to the realism employed. We, as the audience, are allowed to draw our own conclusions, without being beaten over the head or emotionally manipulated.

Here we have an ordinary man who has some limited tactical skills but he is realistic enough to know that sooner or later his fate will take him.Further, the captain is not a hero, more the opposite. He makes decisions which sometimes turn out to be bad mistakes; he is scared & cynical, especially of the Hitler Youth types and Party members who wouldn't know a sub from a hole in the ground.There is not one weak link in the film apart from the rather predictable ending - just a little overdone for my liking.Imagine spending 80 days in a cramped, smelly submarine, sleeping in other people's sweaty bedsheets, sharing only one toilet, not being allowed to see the sky or breath fresh air AND then having to worry about the enemy!!!
Forget U571 and to some extents Hunt For Red October, The Boat, will be a ride you will never forget.

106,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: The Boat of Hope!!,8,30 December 2013,"Das Boot. The claustrophobic world of a WWII German U-boat; boredom, filth, and sheer terror. It is not an easy movie to watch because it needs your patience and attention throughout its long duration but if you are ready to endure, it is quite an engaging, emotionally moving, technically perfect and equipped with amazing performances. Half an hour into the movie and you will be right in the middle of the life of people of the boat and living every moment be it joy, sorrow, boredom or fear. Actually Das Boot is one of those movies where you feel that you are running short of right words to describe what did you feel while watching this epic battle of those soldiers. The climax scene might leave you empty, devastated but most of the running time it is the story of hope even when there is no hope. All I can say, if you feel movies are great medium to understand the lives of others then you gotta see this one.",Das Boot
107,faraaj-1,Lost men in a lost war,10,7 September 2006,"Das Boot (The Boat) is film-making at its finest. Not only is this the greatest naval film, it is one of the finest statements on war ever filmed.Jurgen Prochnow is the excellent lead as the Captain of a U-Boat faced with impossible odds. A compassionate man, he is a veteran at the age of 30. His performance really ties the film together and gives it a strong human touch.The tension in this film reminded me of Clouzot's Wages of Fear (especially the last 45 minutes). This is a deeply impacting film because the audience really feels the claustrophobia, the filth, the tension and all the other emotions that the 42 crew members of the U-Boat go through.The sentiments of Das Boot are decidedly anti-war. By showing that it consists of bureaucratic senselessness, German officers living in a fantasy world, the despair of the fighting men - it makes for a touching tale.The director's cut is the version to be seen although it is long. Each scene of the movie is a classic and will show you the realities of war.",Das Boot
108,hemant_balz,Absolutely Stunning!!!,10,15 August 2010,"Well it left me speechless after just watching this stunning movie.Its over 3 hours but the make up of it till the end is stunning.What is so stunning about the film is one moment you see the terror and the next moment you see the hope.The boredom,the dreams,the emotions,the strength,you just see all coming on this fantastic voyage of submarine experience.The direction is just superb and so is the acting.No doubt it deserves such high rating.From start to finish it is grand.Some scenes like the captain thinking why are they in the battle and doubting his capability as he thinks he has led them to death are fabulous.The ending is a surprise and is fascinating.Finally U-96 boat that survived everything from depths of water to numerous destroyers falls in the end after arriving at its destination.The look on the captain in the end says it all.The soundtrack too is very fitting.The return of heroes of Germany is welcomed with death.Such fascinating cinematic scenes are now rare to see.This is the best war movie you will ever see.Best submarine drama ever.Still i feel the ending and the soundtrack in the end.This is just stunning.Absolutely stunning!!!",Das Boot
109,sandnair87,Dive into This One!,10,19 March 2015,"Director Wolfgang Petersen's claustrophobic masterpiece Das Boot is the ultimate submarine adventure that will leave you with no more fingernails to chew.In Das Boot, we follow the exploits of the crew of a 10 feet by 150 feet German submarine U-96, as it gets sent on its mission to destroy Allied convoys. It begins with the obligatory drunken-revelry scene chronicling the crew's last night ashore, then quickly proceeds onto the submarine, where the quarters are confined and claustrophobia sets in. We see the story through the eyes of a German war correspondent (Herbert Gronemeyer) who is on board the boat for a single tour. The men are presented as he views them - a cadre of competent sailors united by bonds stronger than family or blood. The Captain Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (a remarkably stoic and charismatic Jurgen Prochnow), an officer of great intelligence, is well respected by the men under his command. The crew is comprised of a diverse group of individuals, including a party member, a chief engineer on the verge of a breakdown, and a young man who longs for a reunion with his French fiancée. Over the next two and a half hours, we see the predicament the German crew goes through, as the filmmaker masterfully conveys the humanity behind the German war effort.Wolfgang Petersen's direction is an exercise in pure craftsmanship. Shot with absorbing veracity, the film combines claustrophobia (rarely has boredom been portrayed so spellbindingly) with sequences of nerve-wracking tension. By making it a German boat, the filmmaker neatly removes the patriotic element (if any) and increases the suspense. We identify not with the mission, but with the job. The sweaty claustrophobia of dim lights, reverberating sounds and confined faces is conveyed spectacularly through some incredible direction and amazing performances. And such is the marvelous depiction of fear in the crew's eyes, as they huddle in silence each time the enemy lurks above! The suspense literally keeps you at the edge of your seat - the silence, deafening. The movie is put together with such fantastic detail, it brings us into the very belly of U-96, almost smelling the moldy air, feeling the sickening lurches of the depth charges and yearning for fresh air.Das Boot is yet another moving testament to the profligacy of war. Brilliant, stirring filmmaking like this deserves a place on your shelf.",Das Boot

I don't know, but last week i picked it up in my local supermarket for a measly £5!. It was a wonderful, heartbreaking film. I never thought I'd be rooting for the Germans in a WWII film but I certainly was here, actually I was either on the edge of my seat or biting my nails through the whole 3hrs 20 minutes running time of my directors cut version . It was dubbed, but it was very well done. I hope there is or will be a special DVD version released with the original German speaking version with subtitles. I must also add the acting in this film was of the highest quality. I just found a film to add to my all time favourite movie list, its called DAS BOOT. 10/10",Das Boot
111,michaelhirakida,One Of The Greatest Films About War.,9,15 November 2013,"Wolfgang Peterson wanted to make a film of ""What War Really Was."" Das Boot (Or Da boot as I like to call it) is a emotional, powerful, thrilling and honest film about war. What it was like to be on a German U-Boat and the fears and chaos that happened on one. We get a amazing group of colorful characters who are easy to recognize. The script is a fantastic achievement. The scenes are frightening showing the pressure of the U-Boat break as water flies into it. I was scared, I was laughing. This movie knows when its right to add humor and when it is right to add chaos. I did watch the directors cut as I couldn't find the original cut of the film. But whatever version you watch, Das Boot is a special movie. One of the greatest films about war. Peterson does a excellent job of showing a claustrophobic environment, the acting is convincing, on a technical level its outstanding and I think it will be remembered forever.98/100 A",Das Boot
112,extravaluejotter,Rivet Popping,9,1 September 2006,"It's an impressive feat to get anyone to care about the U-Boat crews of WWII. The wolf-packs of the North Atlantic sunk hundreds of thousands of tons of non-combatant shipping, killing many unarmed and defenceless crew members and passengers. The Atlantic U-boat campaign was merciless and savage, very much a product of the Nazi regime that ordered it.When the film is set is important. In late 1941, the ""Glückliche Zeit"" (Happy Time), when U-boat crews could sink shipping at little risk to themselves, is over. Now the men of the Kreigsmarine's U-boat arm are being hunted by a technically advanced enemy and the odds against them are getting higher. Not only are they fighting the Royal Navy but also their own disillusionment, as they realise that their Fuhrer is neither a strategic genius nor an unstoppable Aryan superman. The film alternates between contemplating the characters in periods of inactivity and making them sweat when the boat goes into combat. Despite their repellent duties, I found myself warming to the Captain, Chief Engineer, claustrophobic engine minder Johann and naive propaganda-monger Lt Werner amongst others.Thanks to the use of a confined set and close-up photography, all the scenes set within the U-boat hull are filled with emotion and tension. It's impossible not to get drawn into the personal lives of the crew, even when presented with the grim results of their convoy stalking. The final scenes are a telling metaphor for the end of Hitler's Third Reich and the fate of the people who supported him.A highly recommended war film shot from a uniquely German perspective.",Das Boot

116,Sankari_Suomi,"Unsurpassed; indeed, unsurpassable",10,22 June 2017,"In the entire history of cinema, there have only been two perfect war movies: Apocalypse Now, and Das Boot. I watched Apocalypse Now /Redux several years ago, and yesterday I finished the 3.5-hour Director's Cut of Das Boot.The submarine subgenre goes all the way back to 1915's The Secret of the Submarine, and has not improved much since then.Sweden gave it the old college try in 1952 with Ubåt 39, but nobody's quite sure if this is a good submarine movie or not because it has only ever been seen by the Swedes, who refuse to discuss it.1958 brought us Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster in Run Silent, Run Deep, which Americans thought was fantastic, and pretty much everyone else thought was 'meh' because it deviated so wildly from the plot of the book.The big ones that most people remember are The Hunt for Red October (1990) by Tom 'I-Never-Met-An-Offensive-Stereotype-I-Didn't-Like' Clancy, and Crimson Tide (1995) by Richard 'P' Henrick. These formulaic Cold War paranoia flicks were acceptable for the time, but their clunky plots and simmering racial tensions have not aged well.Enter Das Boot.Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 WWII classic has gone down in history as the greatest submarine film ever made, and is unlikely to be surpassed.Starring Jürgen Prochnow as Kapitänleutnant Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, Herbert Grönemeyer as Leutnant Werner, and Klaus Wennemann as Leitender Ingenieur Fritz Grade, this exceptional film is in a league of its own.Filmed entirely with practical special effects using an advanced custom made hand-held Arriflex camera with proto-Steadicam technology, Das Boot took two years to make, and was finally cut from over 330,000 metres of exposed film.With a budget of 32 million Deutsche Marks, it was the second most expensive German film the world had ever seen (beaten only by Metropolis) and remains one of the most expensive today.The genius of Das Boot is its timelessness. Even today there is almost nothing in the film that looks dated, though the colour saturation is a little weak by current standards. The cinematography is astonishingly good, particularly considering the conditions under which Das Boot was shot.The performances are superlative. Prochnow is the standout, but Grönemeyer and Wennemann are not far behind. Erwin Leder deserves a special mention as Obermaschinist Johann, whose steadily deteriorating mental state is a masterclass of method acting.Above all, it is the gritty realism of Das Boot that captivates audiences and keeps the movie fresh. The crew grow beards over time; their faces become drawn and haggard; their eyes become sunken and bloodshot; their clothes become dirty, and remain so.The longer you watch, the more it draws you in. After the first 30 minutes you can feel the damp heat, smell the stink of diesel, and sense the flexing of metal plates as the U-boat approaches crush depth.There is not a single wasted minute in this film, which (like all the best war movies) is stridently anti-war.I rate Das Boot at 33.3 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an unbeatable 10/10 on IMDb.",Das Boot

The best submarine movie, or documentary if it comes to that, ever put onto film. Possibly the best war movie of all time. Despite having little interest in submarines, I was totally captivated, thanks to the stunning direction, photography and acting.
As to the director's cut dvd, I enjoyed it with English dubbing rather than subtitles and was un-nerved by the default setting of English dubbing AND subtitles! As someone else mentioned, they bear little relationship to each other.

119,SinjinSB,"40,000 German sailors served on U-Boats during World War II. 30,000 never returned",9,29 September 2002,"A very good and really emotional film set on a German U-Boat in WWII. I watched the Director's Cut DVD which has the 3 1/2+ hour version of the movie and though it took more than one sitting, I was never bored...even when feeling the boredom of the men on the submarine. When the movie starts, it gives a little one page of history and then flashes to a second screen with a statistic that puts it all in perspective right from the start, ""40,000 German sailors served on U-Boats during World War II. 30,000 never returned"". I am guessing this movie is a very authentic portrayal of life on a U-Boat, both technically and emotionally. As I was watching it, I didn't really think of the fact that these were German's, our enemies during the war, but just as men who had to deal with their situation. I think that's a credit to the director, Wolfgang Peterson. This is definitely the movie the best movie I've seen that shows what life on the submarine back then was like. Even seeing all the movies made since this one, didn't detract from the feeling of this movie. I think the sound was really well done in this movie. From the simple tinging of the sonar of the destroyer getting further away, then closer...to the creaking of the metal as it's pushed to the limits as the sub goes deeper and deeper. The parts where all played well, by actors that I'd never seen before. There's a USA version, ""The Boat"", that runs over an hour shorter. I'd guess that would just leave too much out. If you're going to see it, invest the time in the Director's Cut.

121,frankwhat,Oh man,7,6 October 2004,"This was the best submarine movie I have ever seen. To get to know how I felt about other ones...I did like ""K-19"", the ""Hunt for Red October"" was alright, and I thought ""U-571"" and ""Crimson Tide"" were almost garbage. In most of these movies it makes living on a submarine seem close to paradise except for the battles when ""Das Boot"" shows you that it's a lot like being in jail in one retrospect. The smells are horrible, the food is worse, and there's no privacy whatsoever let alone places to move around to and fro. It shows you how hardy some of these enlisted men are that get stuck into this needed duty and how they can be heroic for putting up with these untidy conditions. I also couldn't believe this movie was made in 1981, it didn't seem outdated at all like a lot of movies from that time period are and I surely would've said the early 90's if I had to guess without any prior knowledge. If you watch the director's cut it can be strenuous at times to sit through since it is well over 3 hours and some parts are rather slow...but by all means it is still worth it to stay through the end. The acting is sensational and the pure raw energy that is exerted through some of the actors' facial expressions is enough to leave anyone speechless. I can absolutely see why this put Wolfgang Petersen on the map!Final Appraisal:Movies: Yes, but the director's cut would be very taxing to sit through without any breaks.DVD Purchase: No, but it is tempting, believe me.Rental: Can't go wrong!",Das Boot
122,kyle_c,**** out of ****,10,2 September 2002,"Wolfgang Petersen's landmark submarine film is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The ability to to create tension and suspense equals or surpasses a great deal of Hitchock's work, and the drama at the level of the individual is handled as well as any war film has ever done so.  The story is simple - it follows the story of a German U-Boat on patrol for British convoys, focusing on the Captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and a war correspondent (Herbert Gronemeyer), who has come along to report on the war.  We view the film from a view that is as close to being on a real submarine as you can get, and we identify with these men.  Realizing that these individuals who we sympathize with are the enemy is what makes such a powerful anti-war message, much in the way that ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" did.  I would go so far as to say that this is the single most effective anti-war film ever made, and one that every film viewer must experience.",Das Boot
123,rdukeesq,so good I rooted for the Nazis,9,26 June 2011,"So I watched 1981's Oscar nominated ""Das boot"", directed by Wolfgang Peterson. This is Peterson's masterpiece and his most lauded film. So is it a classic, well let me just say Heil, Hitler. Wait what was that, yes this movie had me rooting for the Nazis, something I never thought I would do, and something that probably just killed my parents. This movie starts a little slow, but once the men are on the u-boat (submarine), it becomes one of the most fascinating and realistic films I have ever seen. This movie was filmed over the course of a year, and allowed the men to naturally grow thin, pale, grow beards, and even really get injured. Even the injuries which really occurred as the actors were thrown around the set, were included in this film. ""Das Boot"" is emotional, gripping, well written, and wonderfully directed, what else can I say. ""Das boot"" is considered to be one of the best films ever made and I would concur with that notion. This film should have broad appeal ranging from women to men, and every cross section within the primary sexes. It is German, with subtitles, but like many movies is dubbed, though I have never liked a dubbed version of anything I have ever seen outside of cartoons. To discuss the plot like many films I review, is to do this film an injustice, the audience is always better off when a good story isn't spelled out for them before they see it.

125,jcanettis,"Claustrophobic, Intense, and Excellent!",10,20 April 2009,"There are some films that have defined a new genre in cinematography. Wolfgang Petersen's epic ""Das Boot"" is one of them, as it has introduced the ""submarine war film"", a genre that later included hits such as ""The Hunt for the Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"", etc. However, although several fascinating films located in submarines have been produced to date, none can be compared to Petersen's masterpiece. ""Das Boot"", although nearly four hours long and set in basically the same location throughout its duration, is a breath-taking experience during which you are hooked to it from the first moment until the last.""Das Boot"" is the story of U-Boot captain Kapitanleutnant Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Prochnow) a.k.a. ""Der Alte"", and his crew, while they carry out a mission in the Atlantic. The story is viewed through the eyes of war correspondent Lt. Werner (Gronemeyer), who is accompanying the crew in this mission; Werner is standing out as a total stranger in the beginning, but throughout the ordeal he eventually blends completely with the team and becomes an inseparable part of the whole. There are also other theoretically major characters in the film, such as Leitende Fritz Grade, the 1st and 2nd WO, etc., but in the end it boils down that in fact there is NO major character: The major character of the film is actually the U-Boot itself, and all the people inside it are simply parts of this ""character"".Petersen delivers an amazingly claustrophobic atmosphere inside the U-Boot which looks like a human trap. (An example of the unbelievably cramped space is that when the officers are dining, the occasional sailor who needs to pass through asks for ""permission to pass"", and someone has to stand up to make room for him!). More importantly, he is studying exquisitely the personalities inside the U-Boot and their interactions. Several minor sub-plots develop throughout the film, but they simply serve to enhance the major plot, which is none other than the story of the submarine's mission, portrayed from beginning to end.The movie graphically portrays the agony and terror of the crew as they go through their ordeal, as well as their gradual transformation from frightened kids to battle-hardened comrades-in-arms. You cannot escape from empathizing with them: When they almost asphyxiate due to insufficient oxygen, the viewer himself feels that he also needs to gasp for air...When ""Das Boot"" came out in 1981, it became a big hit, and understandably so. But its biggest success has been that it has managed to establish itself as an iconic film, and after nearly 30 years it still the best of the genre it itself has created. 10/10.",Das Boot
126,SimonD1900,Amazing!,8,12 April 2020,"The thrilling suspense of this movie is unbelievable. It's more tense then almost any horror movie. If you ever wonder what it would be like to work in a battle submarine during ww2? This movie is as close you ever gonna come. And that it's shot in an actually submarine and not on a set, gives it such much more realism, you almost feel like one in the crew. The acting is also absolutely outstanding. It is a bit long though and you are pretty much trapped with the crew inside the boat during the entire duration of the film, until the film almost gives you claustrophobia (that's not really a negative since it serves the entire purpose of the movie). This is with out a doubt one of the best and most realistic war movies ever made. It's also always refreshing in some way to see a ww2 movie from the greman side.

I began watching it with English sound and English captions. But it was hard to follow because the words on the screen often differed drastically from the words being spoken.  Whoever did the English captions probably didn't use the English version of the movie. My guess is that the captions were translated directly from the German soundtrack.I ended up watching the movie with German sound and  English captions.Secondly, the ""Making of Das Boot"" item in the Special Features menu leaves much to be desired. Compared to the ""Making of"" features on the DVD versions of ""American Graffiti"" and ""1941"" it's woefully lacking.I was hoping for a shot of a bird landing on the U-boat miniature, or at least a modicum of detail on the genesis, casting and production of the movie.",Das Boot

It follows the crew of 43 young men who sets sail in fall, 1941. A war correspondent is among them. He is to go with them and write a newspaper article about the life on a sub. A life he soon discover, along with the rest of the crew, is nothing like portrayed by Nazi propaganda.This film tells a good, strong and emotional story. It does not tell the tale oft a sub, but it tells the tale of the people aboard that sub. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. It is a strong and well written story and it makes a strong film.The acting is good. I watched the English version so I got the German accent, but that didn't bother me. Not as long as the acting in it self is as good as it is.The film-makers have done a great job when it comes to creating a mood in this film. Excellent lightning, great sound-editing and good production design should be given credit for that. The narrow, claustrophobic set along with the lightning creates a really tense and dramatic setting. The use of sound and score reinforce this. They know when to use music and when to use silence. The active use of the ""biping"" noise is excellent.In other words great cinematography and sound work. The score is also very nice. It has a couple of themes. The music in it self is good and they make good use of them.To me Das Boot is a must see classic. It's definitely one of the best war movies. It has humanity, sympathy and realism all over it.

131,Chrimle,A 3½ hour long disappointment,4,26 January 2019,"I believe it has a good feel of authenticity due to all dialogues being in German and realistically portrayed what one would experience on a German submarine (as far as I could imagine).That's all the good aspects I found worth mentioning.Characters or ""The Drama"":
Something that has been praised in the reviews before deciding to watch the movie - is pretty much non-existent. The characters lacked any introduction - except the usual hectic one in the beginning where you are bombarded with all of the characters' names . I could only name ONE member of the submarine by the end of the movie - in other words, ONE of all the characters. None of the characters has any personality except the usual team of; The emotional one, the posh one, the mentally questionable one, the missing home/relatives one and the decision-maker. The acting was both good and bad, it isn't short of intense death stares.Objective or ""The Adventure"":
Where are they going, what's the objective or mission? Lacking the concept of where they are, which might be reflecting the sense of the crew and shifting more focus on the submarine, after all - they do have a navigator. This lack of a mission led to - unsurprisingly - that the action came to them. Later on, when they do set up destinations it's either; briefly mentioned and reached right away or it's described in detail and - of course - becomes difficult.Sound & Music:
""We can hear more down here, than we can see up there."" Keeping the music to a minimum for specific moments only or reflecting the crew's emotions is a good aspect. But the movie could be more reliant on or more telling with sound than words. To explain that the approaching ""humming"" is a ship - after establishing that a ship is approaching isn't that.Story:
This is apparently based on a novel... A fictitious narrative. Rushes through the last act like crossing it off the checklist, thus failing to make an impactful ending.My expected ending:
The ship they thought was abandoned and once again shot at, was one of the most impactful scenes - of the few. Therefore, I expected them to take their roles later on in some way. And so comes the situation where they are stuck at the bottom and manages to resurface. At this time, I expected the engines to not work, receive fire and they would be left to surrender...Would they be treated like they treated the crew of the ship before - left to die?",Das Boot

This is especially true considering that Das Boot is a German film about a German U-Boat crew set in World War 2. The German sailors aren't portrayed as villains nor are their actions glorified. Rather they are hard- working men who fought out of love for their country. They were united by their loyalty to each other and to their country. Das Boot did a brilliant job at portraying the relationships that these men shared.Stylistically, the film was also brilliant. It conveyed the claustrophobic feel of the submarine, which was emphasised by the dim lighting.This is a fantastic film about how war can affect men of all races and nationalities. Watch it.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/dYtLl6",Das Boot
134,jillbeckinheim7,Peterson is a genius,8,27 October 2021,"The movie does have relatively long stretches that aren't all that interesting and when nothing much of great importance happens.But the film is structured around two main bursts of energy - the first being a battle with a British convoy that the U-boat encounters, the second being an attempt to get to a German base in the Mediterranean, which meant having to elude the British Navy, based in huge numbers at Gibraltar. The latter was the most suspenseful part of the movie, as you wondered whether the crew was going to survive. In truth, though, both of those encounters went on perhaps a little bit too long. And the last scenes of the movie (coming after the U-boat has managed somehow to refloat itself from the bottom after being sunk and get past Gibraltar into port) seems to make a powerful point about the meaninglessness of war.The performances are good in this. Subtitles aside, Jurgen Prochnow as the U-boat's captain was excellent - a relatively young man who's been at this for a while and has become hardened to what this life is.",Das Boot
135,varundelpiero,A fine tribute to German cinema...,9,8 December 2008,"DAS BOOT's strength lies in its involving story, compelling atmosphere, and believable characters. My only regret here was that I was only able to see the dubbed version, and not the preferred subtitled one, and as such, my review of the acting will not be complete as I would have been unable to judge the voiced expressions of the actors. While the dubbed voices were not great, I admittedly have heard much worse. Nevertheless, DAS BOOT happens to be one of the best (naval) war movies of all time, and arguably the best submarine movie to this day. The story is an engrossing and compelling one, and viewers will find themselves totally immersed in it for most of the running time. Wolfgang Petersen does a fine job of telling this story, and deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Director (1981).8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). See the subtitled version, not the dubbed one. Will enter my Top 200 at #166 or so. Highly recommended.",Das Boot
136,the-fearless-america,"Hell yeah !! This is a classic thrill movie, one of the most thrilling i ever watch !!",9,18 October 2016,"Das boot, a movie, which its shape mostly about thrill. Its main focus was to thrill the audiences implicitly. There is something classy about Das Boot, yeah, its thrilling concept. It thrills the audience in a unique way, not by scary scores or back-sound or surprising music, nor by cool action schemes supported by cool CGI, nor scary art-direction make-up or set decoration. Das boots thrill is about emotion and tension. Emotions about hopeless, the powerless crews who got stuck by the tension of sea war and trapped in their only self-saver tool, a submarine. The only option about dying or surviving is the main uplifting aspect to the thrills. Every new rising action or climax scenes begin, they always fall for those 2 option, whether they saves the day or sinking to death. One more good aspect is, Das Boot play and brings its thrill really slow. Sometimes they cut from the outside to the inside as the thrills begin to grow the thrill into audiences slowly. Cameras set piece to shot the tension and emotion of crew really precise. The editing seems incredibly accurate. We also can't forget the realistic impact sounds which erupt scenes, nice work by sound-effect team.When i first watch Das Boot, i realize that i never feel so much thrill before and this movie set my new standard to thrill genre. They play in one set place only (submarine) most of its duration, but the layer of its thrill is so deep which that was hard things to do as a director. Das Boot is at top tier of thrill genre movies.",Das Boot

As the director said about this movie, they wanted the viewers to see the soldiers as PEOPLE...not as Germans, or Nazis.  And you wind up caring deeply about them.  The cinematography was also amazing.  I can't believe it was really filmed on a submarine!  Also, if you haven't seen this movie, get the director's cut.  It's long, but worth it.

It wasn't any block-buster but so much better than most of them. Back in 1981 one could still see rare and independent quality film also in small town cinemas. I was 14 and absolutely not prepared for this kind of experience. Back then the age limits were normally 7 or 13, and 18 if there was any particular sex or violence. ""Das Boot"" completely lacks sex but the claustrophobic intensity actually feels kind of violent. I wonder if the limit on ""Das Boot"" wasn't 18, and perhaps for a good reason. I am glad I went and got in anyway, but I'm even more glad I never was a German U-boat crew in WW2. Leaving the cinema I felt absolutely stunned, shocked and still not quite aware of what had hit me.This unique film is so fantastic one forget it's fact based fiction.

143,Charles-31,Best at full(?) length,10,12 July 2002,"There is no doubt that this is a brilliant war film and probably the best submarine movie ever made (I also like Hunt for Red October, but they are not really comparable films).  I saw this in the theatre with subtitles, then later in video, dubbed.  However, recently, I got the chance to see a 4 hour 32 minute version on Starz Action.  They are, in fact, currently running three versions of lengths 1:59, 2:36, and 4:32.  The long version must be close to the original 6 hour mini-series.  If it had commercials, it would probably be about 4.5 hours actual footage.  If you have seen shorter versions of this film, try to see the long version. Virtually all of the first half of the film is not in the shorter versions. We get to see much more of the Atlantic campaign and the sub doing what it is supposed to do, stalking and sinking the enemy.  We also get a better feel for the long stretches of time, the sea as an enemy, and the frustration of not seeming to participate in the war.  Overall, the longer version really changes the feel of the movie from an adventure to a mission.This movie puts you in a submarine, warts and all.  We see the filth, the horror, the beards, and everything.  And, the cast pulls off the roles brilliantly.  This is a great film and deserves repeated viewings.  I'm particularly impressed with the level of detail.  There are some minor nits in the film.  The long version has a very abrupt transition at one point which makes me think a portion of the film is missing.  I also have my doubts about a submarine surviving some of what they did in this movie.  Generally, once a sub was spotted it was dead. This is part of the reason for the 75% losses in the war.  But, some license is due if you are going to create a really powerful movie that lets us see what the submariners saw.I was particularly impressed that this is the war from the German side with no effort to sugarcoat it, other than some anti-Hitler sentiments among the crew.",Das Boot

147,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: 'Das Boot',8,22 February 2015,"""Hail and victory and sink 'em all!"" Director Wolfgang Petersen takes us on an epic, once-in-a-lifetime maritime adventure, set in the autumn some years before World War II came to a close and U-boats were still sailing(mostly below) the cold seas. An adaption of the eponymous 1973 novel by German author and painter Lothar-Günther Buchheim, the film was released in 1981, but is filmed in a time four decades its prior. 'Das Boot', or known in the U.S. as 'The Boat', which originally aired as a six-hour German mini-series and was shot in complete silence due to complications of getting sound equipment into the actual submarine, thus having the actors to lip-synch their dialogue in later, was the most expensive German film at the time. But does it's length outweigh it's story? Let's take a look. Told from the viewpoint of the naive but honest Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer), of whom has been assigned a war correspondent to gather photographs aboard the German sub U-96 and only to bring them back for Nazi propaganda purposes, sails out from the harbor of La Rochelle, France to do battle above and beneath the cold, foamy waters. Captaining the war vessel is rock-solid Captain-Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jürgen Prochnow), and also called ""Der Alte"" or ""The Old Man"" by his crew, a grizzled thirty-year-old-battle-hardened war veteran, who complains to Wener that most of his men on board are boys, on whom the latter would solely depend upon later. Chief Engineer Fritz Grade - Der Leitende- Der LI (Klaus Wenneman), the second oldest crew member besides the captain and also the second most important crewman, is a quiet and well-respected man, tormented by the uncertain fate of his wife, especially after hearing of an Allied air raid in Cologne. Sooner than not, though mocked for his lack of experience, Lt. Werner, as well as the rest of the crew, soon discover the true horrors of working and living aboard a U-boat amidst the unknown fate of a life-threatening attack beneath the green-tinted waves of a vast, empty world below. With brilliant and breathtaking cinematography shot and captured by Jost Vacano, we too sense and feel what the crew is emanating towards us as as he hurtles the camera through tight spaces and cramped passageways. Time passes and seems to stand still for those aboard, as we wait for some action as they do in turn, boredom beginning to slowly take over in waiting of a possible, imminent attack. Their boredom is somewhat of an unbeknown relief to its audience, because when the attack scenes do actually commence, Petersen is relentless in letting up, water bursting in through cracks from torpedo hits, lights flashing, flames emerging and alarms blaring as hysteria befalls the crew beneath the dark and unforgiving sea, entrapped in what may be their narrow, pitiful. grave. The iron womb that is their comfort and protection is penetrated and punctured with underwater missiles as the men race around through the ships tight, steamy labyrinthine passageways piled on with perfectly claustrophobic dread, doing all they know and have trained for possible for the sub not to become their permanent coffin in a race against time. Our only glimpse and fresh breathers of air from the world above is the captain and a handful of crew peering through binoculars for enemy ships when the top is opened or when sighting targets through a periscope in some POV shots. When the radar does not respond when locating another sub later on in the film, the U-96 sinks to a depth of two-hundred-eighty meters, stuck on a sand shelf for sixteen hours as the men on board are succumbed to nothing but cramped, humid darkness and muster up all the sanity and mental will they can and know to survive amidst hunger pains and near paranoia as they too are being hunted by Nazi boats while in wait of the silent unknown, scraping into their subconsciousness for a glimmer of hope as the oxygen quickly dwindles as they all wonder as to what may surely become of them in the end.Taut and gripping, its authenticity is as pungent as it is horrific, as we sail with the crew confined and contained below the biting spray of the rough Atlantic waters. Featuring little dialogue, the film's anti-Nazi sentiments ring through loud and clear to make up for it. 'Das Boot' is truly the ultimate submarine movie: a harrowing voyage that carries with it lingering trepidations of what may come to be beneath the murky green depths with each eerie sonar pinging reverberating from their precious vessel off the U-boat's hull. Lengthy but unsurpassed with its intense tension and unabashed realism, with meticulously crafted and constructed long-takes and closeups all with fate hanging in the balance, 'Das Boot' is rightly regarded internationally, if not already, as the pre-eminent among all submarine films. Going beyond the sub-par into an acutely distressing exercise in pure craftsmanship and articulate detail, this WWII film went on to be nominated for six Academy Awards deservedly, including one for Best Director, Best Cinematography and Film Editing. With a budget of 32 million DM ($12 million), the film never sinks but rose above the surface with $84 million plus at the box office, showing us a story that war, as depicted in all of its gritty truthfulness and horror, is indeed hell.",Das Boot

People would be wrecks mentally as well as physically after some time and having veterans like Clark Gable or Curd Jürgens on board was simply not possible. And the subs in other movies, like the 2 before mentioned were so relatively clean and nice as they never were.

153,tripper0,just ordinary people.......,10,30 July 2001,"Das Boot looks at war from the point of your average day person.  There are no heroes, just people that have a certain job to do.  This movie is excellent for many reasons.  For a movie its length, first and foremost, it is extremely entertaining and engaging.  It was a surprisingly quick three and a half hours.    What I really liked most was the time the director, Peterson, took creating suspense, and giving scenes of depth.  Nothing is rushed here, and it all pays off.  What we end up getting is more of a psychological movie, and less of an action picture.  We get characters that have souls and personalities.  We see them change drastically from their cocky beginnings, really as children, to seasoned men.  It is not an easy change, but Peterson takes us with them, through all thier ups and all of their downs.  What seems like a small accomplishment and brings them joy, can quickly swing the other way and create a huge amount of drama in their lives.  Not only do we see them change with reactions to what is happening to them by outside forces, but what its like to have to live in a confining space, to have nothing to do. The claustrophobic atmosphere is a huge part of the movie. This movie is also about the human condition, and innocence lost.  We see how naive the characters can be, thinking they can be heroes, and how they grow.  We watch them lose the innocence.      I really could say a lot of things to praise this film.  I loved it.  It was also different to see war from a more German point of view, which, in this day in age, seems to be the same as everyone elses view on war.  There is no glorification of war here, and thats refreshing.  It is an honest movie with people someone can relate to.  Very satisfying in the end.  10 out of 10.",Das Boot

I cannot imagine it being cut, much less dubbed. I can only say that I found it compelling drama, though everyone I know who has seen it has been male, and it may be that this film has particular meaning to those who have at least to consider the possibility that they may one day be required to fight in a war. The British have always been able to distinguish between honourable and dishonourable German fighting units, but the acting in Petersen's film is of such a quality that you really care what happens to these people (and I speak as someone whose father fought against them). The feeling of being part of a U-boat crew that is one moment the hunter and the next moment the hunted, the elation and the fear of combat, the heightened sense of self-awareness, the questioning of one's role, and, above all, the ultimate futility of war are all powerfully brought home. The extraordinary German sense of discipline is evident throughout (helping to explain why it required the combined efforts of The British Empire, The Soviet Union and the United States to defeat Hitler's forces) but it is a discipline infused with respect and intelligence. This is a wonderful piece of filmmaking which I would recommend to anyone. Just make sure you see it in the original German.",Das Boot
160,dbogosian-1,"Best war movie, ever.",9,10 January 2008,"I've seen a fair number of war movies, but none can come close to ""Das Boot."" I saw it first in theaters when it was first released, in German with subtitles (great); saw it again in theaters, dubbed in English (awful); and then just saw it on the DVD director's cut with subtitles (excellent). The last was definitely the best.No war movie has ever captured the reality of the soldier's experience like this one. It's a submarine movie, so of course you're going to get the stock scenes of destroyers on the surface, tense men listening to the sonar ping, depth charges, diving deeper and deeper, etc. But it is so much more convincing in this movie than in any other in its genre (""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""The Enemy Below"" come to mind).But don't expect non-stop wall-to-wall action; the realism of the movie comes through in depicting the long periods of time when there was nothing to do: cruising through stormy seas, wandering about with no particular task or mission, the frustrations of the crew after weeks of inaction, etc. As a movie, this presents a problem because the viewer is taken through all that time in somewhat realistic fashion, which in turn makes the film long and not quite as gripping.The real punch of the movie, though, are the characters, their life on board, their hopes for a successful cruise and a return to normalcy. The actors do a fantastic job, all of them, but the captain and the chief engineer are probably the best, along with the journalist on board. The best scene, one which I remembered clearly ever since I first saw it in 1981, was the one where the sub crew goes on board the supply ship at Christmas time; the stark contrast between these rough, slimy, smelly crewmen and the polished, uniform-clad, hair combed and slicked officers on the supply ship, was just phenomenal. To think that some men went through the war in hell like the submariners, while others basically lived like kings, is just too painful to really comprehend.The ending is very creative, very surprising, and emotionally devastating. After seeing Das Boot, I can't ever bring myself to watch any other submarine movie.I give it 9.5/10 stars; just barely on the edge of a perfect 10, but not quite.",Das Boot

162,filmbuff-05706,One Of The Finest War Movies Ever Made.,10,6 July 2021,"I owe my deepest thanks to my 3 main favorite film critics for bringing Das Boot to my attention. That goes to Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel, and especially James Berardinelli, who has this film in his top 100 favorite movies. (As I do now, even higher, in fact.)Das Boot(German for ""The Boat"") is the story of German U-boat soldiers and their struggles of fighting WWII inside of a cramped submarine. Before the war starts, the men see their duty as exciting, but then they get a true glimpse of the real hell of war, partcularly inside of a submarine.Simply put, Das Boot is one of the finest war movies ever made, and one of the best movies I have ever seen in any genre. Director Wolfgang Peterson, who would later direct such movies as Air Force One and Troy, truly showed his gift as a director very early in his career.One bit of realism put in Das Boot is the language. Instead of being in English, the entire movie is spoken in German, except for maybe a line or two. While the subtitles occasionally run too fast(not anyone's fault of course), they help put us into this world, reminding us that Germans would in fact speak...German, not English, as often portrayed in war movies.The camerawork is something to be praised about the film. Peterson directs the camera in such a way that it appears that we too are in the submarine with these Germans. We become part of their claustrophobic world- feeling tight in their limited space.In shots where the camera tours the submarine, it appears like we are walking behind, but unfortunately when they are in danger we are forced to do nothing but watch. Even so, when they lose air, it seems that we lose air, and when they get wet, we can imagine the feeling.We learn early into their mission that the 50 men have to share a toilet, which is just a hole, not a physical toilet, making us dread for them the stench that they must endure. Set aside the fact that the soldiers also unrinate in bottles and appear to go weeks without bathing.Characterization is another strength of Das Boot. The WWII film does focus on Germans, some of which are Nazi supporters, but we are forced to sympathize with them. As many great movies do, we are reminded that even though these were enemies in this time period, they are still human and worthy of sympathy.We see one character who writes to his non-German fiancee, who is pregnant. He knows that they must confess their love eventually, but he fears the reaction of their families.In another scene, Johann, one of the soldiers, has a nervous breakdown and leaves his post, shaking before the Captain. He orders him to return to his post, and he delays in obeying the command. Johann later apologizes to the Captain, pleading forgiveness and promising to never do that again. The Captain accepts and agrees to not court martial him. I found this to be the best and most powerful scene.I viewed the Director's Cut of the film, which runs for 3.5 hours, about an hour longer than the original cut. I have not seen the shorter cut, but even so, I highly recommend seeking the Director's Cut. The runtime is why I put off seeing it(that and the film being in German on top of that), but I started it at 9pm last night and, with breaks, I managed to complete it at nearly 1:30 this morning.That's because, despite being so long, the movie moved at a steady pace, and while it is long, it feels quicker than 210 minutes. Therefore, while I warn you against the run time, it should also be noted that for me it was hardly an issue.Das Boot is a masterpiece of a war movie. There are few movies, war or otherwise, that I can recommend higher. It is more than a movie, it is an engaging experience. It truly is one of the finest war movies ever made.",Das Boot
163,yellowtail_tuna,The crew's struggle against the reality of war,10,23 October 2020,"The title card tells us the historical background, in which ""40,000 German sailors served on U-boats during World War II. 30,000 never returned."" At this point, we don't know whether this movie is about a U-boat that returned or a U-boat that did not.After a frenzied party scene where the main characters are introduced, they launched in their U-96. After that most of the film is set inside the submarine. It is very cramped and quite filthy. The dozens of crew members are packed in it and share their lives. For each, the only private space is a tiny bunk. Most of them are young, cheerful but inexperienced.I don't know much about the mechanisms of submarines, but they are interesting. They whisper when an enemy ship is close. I couldn't believe that the voice inside a sub could be heard by the other ship through the water, but from my quick search, some say it can happen. When the sub is bombed, the lightbulbs blast, which is another thing I wonder why (maybe just a dramatic effect). The depth is an important thriller element. They hold their breath while staring at the depth gauge because if it dives too deep, it will be crushed by the water pressure.The campaign does not go well. They miss opportunities to get their enemies. The Captain is resentful of the headquarters' poor operation but keeps being responsible for the sub and the crew. The scenes they are attacked are tumultuous and very fearful because they have nowhere to escape. An impressive scene is where an engineer called Johann becomes unhinged because of the fear, which is very close to a horror film acting. A sub is a very long distant place from our ordinary life.""Das Boot"" is about the bond of the crew who share the same fate, and about the harsh reality of war that overwhelms them. The direction is convincing. The ending is shocking but I'll never forget. It is no doubt one of the best war films ever made.(I watched the 208 minutes Director's Cut version.)",Das Boot

I'm particularly reminded of THE ENEMY BELOW (1957), a superb drama on some of the same subject matter.

168,spamobile,Just the best movie ever,10,11 July 2011,"Just the best movie ever. Not because it is well made from start to finish but because of the characters in it. Even if you don't like war movies this is just in a league of it's own and a must see. As a youngster I read the book before it was a movie. It was something like 600+ pages of boredom, day to day life on board of a U-boot, and only like 50 pages of sh.... in your pants action. So why is so much boredom so good? Simple, I believe it reflects real life on board. It's not about Nazi saluting hero's chasing and torpedoing boats left right and center, no, it's about ordinary people trying to do a job, a nasty job, and being scared sh...less at times doing so. It's based on a true story, a story about life on the line. The movie is absolutely fabulous. The characters are very strong and extremely well played by the on international level relative unknown actors. The journalist, you see the fright on his face if it get's tough. The Captain, strong character, determined, calculated, trying to be strong in the face of danger, but ultimately if you read his face between the lines, he's just as scared as all of them. There is one character, one of the officers, that is the coolest of them all, but, also he come to near breaking point. They all show you life, real life, girlfriends at home, wives at home, loners, career man, victims who would like nothing else as tend to their garden at home, so, real people out there having to do an awful job. The movie is so well made that it's nearly ""smell TV""! You can ""smell"" the fear, the stench of lack of ventilation, the stores, the salty sea air. You should ideally see this in German. I am lucky to understand some German so can follow it mostly without the subtitles but even if you have to read the subtitles, the characters just need to be German, it's a part of the atmosphere. I've seen a dubbed version as well and characters get lost in translation (also the subtitles are not the best representation of what is actually said). Compare this movie with U-571, 5x as high budgets, don't get me wrong, a good movie, but they've stolen parts of Das Boot and is really fake as a movie with weak characters. Das Boot, when you see it in bad weather, OK, CGI is not the strongest point of the movie, Das Boot is actually pretty fake, but don't forget it's not the best funded movie, but it does not detract of what this movie is worth, a 10+++.",Das Boot

Very harrowing, tough, uncompromising war film, not Hollywood-like at all.  It doesn't feel like there's any guarantee that anyone will survive.  I don't think the film would work at all remade as a slick CGI-fest, like Petersen makes these days.  Despite the near four hour length of the director's cut, the film never drags, and sets up a relentless pace and a very uncomfortable, queasy feeling right from the start.  I thought the camerawork by frequent Paul Verhoeven DP Jost Vacano was good, as were all of the performances, and the score by Klaus Doldinger.

173,ewarn-1,Easily Best Sub Movie,10,29 May 2007,"Submarine films are usually good, even if they're bad, and this is the best, and it's not bad at all. Few films have such great art direction that you can feel the temperature actually depicted in the scene, and smell the setting as well. Here you can smell diesel fuel, fifty men and hot metal. The sound effects are fantastic, no other film has ever shown depth charges like this one, and has captured the terror of what it must have been like to ride one out.Another example of perfect casting, the faces of the crewmen are unforgettable, so you don't get them all mixed up, which is a problem in war films depicting a lot of men in one place. This is very different from today's movies where everyone has that 24 year old bland overfed and overexercised southern California look. The guys in the sub here look pale and exhausted, stressed out and sick after weeks at sea. Still, they come across as very likable, which helps to identify with them as they face such danger from the enemy and the elements.I saw this film in 1982, but I think it was a shorter version, it was released at a time when there was very little interest in warfare so it was rare to see something so compelling. I saw the 200 minute version recently and was amazed at the length, to me I thought I had just watched maybe a 90 minute movie. That's a sign of how intense the story is. I also preferred the German language version.",Das Boot
174,b-a-h TNT-6,One of the best movie experiences I've ever had,9,21 January 2002,"I had heard many good things about Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot before I finally got to watch it in its longest -- and widely acknowledged as the better -- form, the 216-minutes directors cut. I had understandably high expectations but, as somebody who is seldom impressed by the so-called 'classic' status of films (providing Das Boot is by now acknowledged as a true classic by most critics and movie fans) I had considered the possibility of a disappointment. Well, it was not a disappointment. In fact, Das Boot really is an amazing film experience.The film avoids delving into philosophical considerations about war for most of the screen length (but in the ending there will a powerful and spellbinding anti-war message), focusing instead on the life, the emotions, and the struggles for life of an army of German soldiers during a submarine mission in WWII. All the emotions are rendered perfectly and with amazing intensity thanks to the wonderful directing and especially the fantastic acting by the two main leads, Jürgen Prochnow as the Captain and Herbert Grönemeyer as Lieutenant Werner. Claustrophobia, fear, sadness, hope, regrets, memories, are all incredibly real onscreen.The action sequences (the term ""action"" is used loosely here -- simply put, this is not your usual summer blockbuster) manage to create real, visceral suspense and never come off as unbelievable or cheap. The characters in Das Boot are 'true' and three-dimensional, unlike the usual ""heroes vs. villains"" so common in today's entertainment; even if you start watching the movie feeling a sense of detachment from German WWII soldiers, the movie will pull you in and show that these are people, not monsters and not heroes.A whole lot could be said about the absolutely spellbinding and sad ending, which comes across as an incredibly strong anti-war message. But I won't go into that: you have to experience the movie to really understand what makes it so powerful. Don't be put off by the 216-minutes length: Das Boot really is one of the best war movies of all time.9/10",Das Boot
175,Shilo_R_A,"8.3/10 - A Unique, Claustophobic War Film",8,18 August 2021,"*a review of the director's cut *Wow, this film is claustrophobic as hell. Yeah, every person who watched it have already said it, but whatever. I fully agree.So, Das Boot is a 1981 German war film about a submarine of the German military during WWII, basically. I'd say that the film is told from the pov of Werner, a soldier who was sent with the submarine to document the life on it, the conditions and so on.This film has one problem, so I'll get it out of the way now - it's really, really, really long. At almost 3.5 hours, this film is far from being an easy watch. Not necessarily because of the slow pacing, tho it's partially that, but the length in itself makes it quite difficult to sit through. I don't think that it has nothing to offer or that this length is totally unnecessary, but just like 2001: SPACE ODDYSSEY's slow pacing, it affects the overall experience as well.Now, let's move on to the things that I like about this movie, cause there are plenty of those. Firstly, I really like the way that this film was shot - the cinematography has so much character to it, and every scene is shot in a really good way. Plus, everything being inside a submarine makes me appreciate the camera handeling even more - it must have been really difficult to pull off.The acting is truly great too, and I don't think that there's a single character that stood out to me for being acted badly. From the Captain to Johann, each character has a decent amount of personallity and is acted well.The score is quite fitting, and it's not mind blowing or anything but I still liked it.I think that the insane length of the film is the way it is so we can get to know each character, and being more emotionally connected with them, and though I do find the length (and the pacing too, at point) to be problematic, I think that this film does a pretty good job at that.I mean, it made me cry a little, so, that's something :)Also, one last thing that I think that is really great about this film - the final act. Oh, the final act. It's so good. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you think that a war film inside a submarine can't be interesting, the final act will DEFINITELY make you change your mind about that.So, to sum it up, Das Boot is a unique war film, with a lot of personality in it. It is a difficult watch, since it's so damn long, but I still think that it's a really good film with a lot of great aspects to it. I'm feeling an 8.3/10 on this one.8.3/10 - A Unique, Claustrophobic War Film.",Das Boot
176,hmpulham,Too long,4,18 January 2005,"""Das Boot"" or ""Das Boat"" is a gritty saga about a German submarine during World War II. The director strives to show the claustrophobic conditions that the crew had to endure -- crammed as they were, into what one feels is basically a floating coffin. There is no doubt that care went into to the making of this film. The weakest part, however, is the script. One never feels that the writing rises to much more than going through the motions. This is certainly not a bad film, but I didn't like the directors ""fetish for footage"" (the shooting length) while the constant repetition of similar scenes begins to ware thin over time. Another criticism I would make, isthe film's finality is pretty well telegraphed -- you kind of know how it will end. On a positive note, one is left with no illusions that war is glamorous. I would say a superior i.e, more entertaining war film about a German U-boat is ""The Enemy Below."" Check that out!",Das Boot
177,RandomTask-AP,A Masterful War Tale,9,11 December 2003,"Wolfgang Petersen carved an enviable name for himself in the world of film, but `Das Boot' illustrates the human elements that make a war film into masterpiece.        On a German submarine in World War 2, men encounter the many questions of war. Women are completely absent during the time at sea, and when one sailor does share his feelings about the woman he loves, it becomes a point of jest and vulnerability. The men confide in each other their hopes and fears. While they trust their captain without question, that trust is tested when the crew must take their ship past the Rock of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea, a trip that is almost their last. All the ideals of war do not necessarily hold up in the group either. Even after Johaan loses self control in a crucial moment of battle, abandons his station, and admits his guilt, The Captain does not prepare a court martial for him as the rules demand, but instead, gives Johaan a second chance. The victories for the crew are most felt when they survive a battle or overcome a difficulty. There is no great and sweeping glory for the sub crew in Das Boot. Even after a successful assault on an allied convoy, the joy of victory is lost as they discover dozens of men from the sunken ships crying for help and must leave them in the sea to die. All the glory and polish of the young Nazi officer is a waste as he proves useless for anything but reinforcing protocols and cowering in tense situations. In the end, the men have experienced little to make them feel patriotic or satisfied with their efforts toward the war.           In order to help convey the settings and moods of the film, lighting was used to create a stronger impact. The lighting of `Das Boot' is distinctly painted across the screen to enhance the audience's impression that they are on a submarine. Blues dominate much of the film, and this helps to increase the shadows and a sense of claustrophobia. It is used most effectively when the crew is waiting for something to happen. When depth charges are expected to hit, the crew anticipates the impact in the silence of a blue light. The blue light seemed to enhance the feeling of being underwater. Once a depth charge hit, the crew is cast into a red light, which develops the mood of panic and desperate claustrophobia, and the sudden change of light is explained with warning lights that light after an impact.          Whether from the perspective of a character or of the director, the camera aptly sets the stage and brings emotional impact to the audience. Two scenes in which a character's perspective is used are the party scenes. At the opening of the film, a sailor washes his face and proceeds to leave the bathroom. As he opens the door, he holds it for the camera as though it were another person; the camera passes him, and looks about the room setting the stage for the raucous farewell party for the submarine crew. A similar use of the camera is brought into play when the sub officers enter a banquet when they are invited to stop in Spain. Placing the audience in the crew's perspective creates an impression of how extravagant the setting is for the men who've been living on rations in a floating tin can for three months. In the director's point of view, the camera is used to set the stage. When the sub has surfaced and the men are watching from the bridge, the camera does not only stay in close to watch the characters interact but also pulls back so the entire sub riding the waves or navigating through debris can be seen. The closer shots keep the audience involved and connected with the characters while the wider perspectives make the setting more believable so that anyone watching is convinced that the sub is in the open sea. Another shot from the director's view are the long follow shots that bring the camera through several different rooms and hatches. This helps to convince the audience of the set and gives them an increased feeling of the submarine.          Using a variety of techniques, the film, Das Boot, brings the audience into the lives of the crew and its sub. Dramatic lighting heightens the experience, and skilled camerawork makes the situations realistic while bringing out the characters and emotions of the crew sent on their mission. The script and actors create very real characters. There is a great deal of tension and action while the question of what war is all about is emotionally raised. By the end of the film, there is no sort of thin answer offered, but the harsh impact upon people's lives is indisputable.",Das Boot

Of course, it's painful to watch it in a row, I won't incite you to do it, you always have the later release with less 2 hours but I don't know if the quality remains. Anyway, the movie contains all the incidents of a trip taken by the crew of a German U-boat during the WW2, firstly in the Atlantic Ocean, with very few incidents, filling the whole crew with boredom and disease, except for a couple of encounters, that eventually don't end up as wanted. Finally, when returning home, a message from Berlin orders them to go to Italy. Obviously, going to Italy forced them to attempt to pass the straight of Gibraltar, and that's when things get real. The end is brutal. I'm not giving any information to avoid spoilers but I guarantee you that the end alone makes this movie recomendable, despite it's runtime. The acting s actually good, unlike what I was expecting, as happened with the image, including very interesting shots of the submarine at the surface, underwater, and also in battle.

Having just seen the cheap imitation ""U-571"", I have to say that it does not at all compare to the original German subtitled version of ""Das Boot"".  I never found ""Das Boot"" at all tedious despite its considerable length; on the contrary, every moment seemed to submerge the viewer's mind deeper into the horrific reality of the film, and into the subconscious of the captain and his crew as they faced the grim reality of the odds against their survival.  (I agree with whoever it was that called it ""claustrophobic"", but that was also one of the horrors which afflicted the senses prevalent in this film.)  Kudos to Jurgen Prochnow, a remarkable actor in a difficult and emotionally demanding, psychologically draining role.  I enjoyed reading through the insightful user comments of this film; so rarely does one find so much elucidation on the crucial elements which make a film work or not work.

This is one of those films that isn't hard to make a commitment to.The German film (yes, spoken in German) ""Das Boot"" tells the story of a submarine captain and his crew in the claustrophobic and truly gritty submarine in the middle of intense battle that masterfully builds suspense. Nearly the whole film is shot in this claustrophobic environment (roughly three small rooms), and yet catches your attention better than most epic films in wide landscapes.But the true feat here is that a five hour movie in a small submarine can hold your attention without letting go. The acting is superb, the direction perfect, and the intensity nearly unbearable. This isn't your average film. It doesn't go to the happy Hollywood formula, but rather a realistic (and, in a sense, surreal) formula that is so very welcomed in the clutter of repetition.Though, not for everyones taste for sure.Rating: ***1/2 (of 4) Entertainment: **** (of 5)",Das Boot

188,AllNewSux,The Best War Movie Yes...The Best Movie Ever Possibly,10,8 June 2015,"First of all let me say watch the 209 minute ""Director's Cut"" and watch it in German with subtitles or it won't have the same impact. This film will challenge how much tension you can take. You will endlessly think ""when will the depth charges stop"", ""when will they stop sinking"", ""when will the boat stop leaking"". I swear that the claustrophobic nature of the film will make you feel like you are actually in the submarine. You can smell the stink of unwashed men and rotting fruit. You will feel the sweat and the salt water all over. This film is so amazing that it is interactive. You don't just watch the film, you become part of it. All of the exciting parts seem endless and Wolfgang Petersen uses the slower parts so you can get to know the characters. You see their fear, their excitement, their pride and their insanity. He does this so you actually side with the enemy. You realize these boys have no ideologies driving them to war. They don't have any love for Adolf Hitler. They are just doing what they are told to do because they are good soldiers who love their homeland. The ending is unsatisfying no matter who you side with. The reason this is done is because Petersen wants to show us that in war there are no winners...only losers.",Das Boot
189,Roman-Nies,The human likeness,10,8 May 2007,"I was reading the other comments and got confirmed that many movie fans still are astonished to find out that Hollywood movies are often too patriotic, that they lack realism and objectivity. In this case DAS BOOT impressed them in a way that meant the opposite of this all. Sometimes, it seems, one knows what is true, just take a look on it! What a discovery as well: Germans are humans as we are! A discovery for victims of propaganda? The result of the consumption of hundreds of simple knitted movies? One commentator wrote it is typical for the Germans to be critical and realistic in the approach of the own achievements. That could be one of the favourable results of history. But the danger is, that the wish to make it everybody right, serves to make it wrong or at least to exaggerate the facts. May be the Allies have a lot to work off too? One German WWII Submariner commented, that such a wild orgy/party as in the opening scene of the film, was not possible. He never experienced such an absence of discipline in his service time. But he doubted only this part of the film and he was not everywhere during wartime. Some compared the film with Private Ryan. That one has also realistic scenes, but also unrealistic and very patriotic ones. I always wonder why writers or producers do not understand that a tool to make war movies come over more realistic is to show that the greatness of the victory comes from the greatness of the threat. If there is a strong opponent whom you have to overwhelm your challenge can be respected much more than in a duel with a weak idiot. Or maybe this is understood, but the audience would not like to take it as that. In Hollywood movies the heroes usually fight against stupid fools who are without exception barbaric and evil to the bone. Such movies were produced in Germany during the Nazi-regime. Psychologists say that this serves to make a small one bigger if he superelevates his feat and himself. The Nazis knew that they needed propaganda to tarnish their lies and evil plans. And Hollywood? Is the answer money and entertainment more important than sympathy for more accuracy and depth? And if suddenly there is an exception to that movie-policy, all people are enthusiastic and they feel ""we want more like this!"" But the award goes to....",Das Boot
190,idontknowiknowthatidontknow,can this movie be any more boring?,1,10 September 2010,"I had to watch this film along with U-571 for a world history class report back in 2001. I checked out this film at my local library. It was three VHS tapes. I don't remember much about the film. I do remember it was very boring and trite. I remember it went into detail about the submariners' lives during the war and many dark shots of the submarine during the night. Other than that, I don't remember anything else. I didn't just rate this film a low score because it was meticulous and long. Many films of the kind can be good if they provide an interesting plot, story or something that makes the picture stand out in one's mind other than tedious boredom. For example I thought the movie Heat was boring for the most part, but there was a major scene in the movie that saved it completely: the bank robbery scene. That scene was probably one of the most intense and expertly executed action sequences I have ever seen. Another example is The American. It was another pretty boring movie except for a scene in the middle and its devastating ending. Those two scenes, and especially the ending, not only salvaged the movie, but took it to a completely new height. However this movie in my memory had just a documentary type bore throughout. I have to say I'm not sure if I paid attention throughout the whole movie, and I probably have to watch it again just to make sure about my opinion. Anyways, I remember watching U-571, another submarine movie, and it was a lot better. Not just because of the action sequences but because it was actually a thrilling ride. I felt as if I was one of the crew members on board. I don't understand why so many people have such a high opinion of this movie, but I will be sure to review the movie again just to make sure.0/5",Das Boot

The introduction tells all one needs to know about the history of the German U-Boat crews. 3 out of every 4 ended up dead.  Yes, the Nazis were a force that needed to be defeated in order for civilization to survive. That fact understood, this film reminds the audience of the ultimate inhumanity and immorality of war. The fact that I, as an American audience member, found myself sympathizing not with the crew's (they, the ""other"" side) cause, but with their humanity is a testament to the power of film.  I just saw the director's cut of this fine film today and it reinforced and enhanced what I already had experienced the first time I became immersed in this film's narrative.  Gritty, well acted and written, claustrophobic, agonizing, tragic and utterly believable, Das Boot is simply one of the finest war films ever made.

194,addicott,One of the best films of ANY genre!,10,8 March 2008,"When movies are at their best, they can take the viewer completely into a different world. Watching this movie again, I felt very much transported.It seems unfair to call this a submarine movie because it is so much better rendered than any other offering from that genre. Das Boot transcends all the necessary clichés and tells an amazing story in an incredibly convincing way. In this rare instance, the writers understand that the truth is plenty fascinating, with no need for exaggerated action or melodrama.Technically, this film is a marvel. The camera work is astounding, most of it done hand-held in a real submarine environment where it's hard enough to move, let alone shoot a movie. What special effects there are blend in so seamlessly, it's hard to imagine how they could have made this picture without putting the cast in harm's way.It's a delight to see the director's cut which feels very natural in its pacing. There are long, slow sections which are not boring to watch, but they effectively illustrate what the crew has to endure as they wait weeks on end for some real action. When the action finally comes, the buildup is tremendous. Few movies match Das Boot's dynamic range.All the technical and dramatic devices are in perfect harmony with the human element. One quickly forgets how this crew is fighting for Hitler's Third Reich. They're really just a bunch of kids, lead by a jaded captain. Their ordeal becomes so severe, it's impossible not to have sympathy for them. Because of this, Das Boot should be ranked among the very best of all war films.",Das Boot
195,bjoernidler,Superb!!,10,11 February 2019,"I've recently been to the Bavaria Filmstudios in Munich and entered the real 'Boot' that Petersen shot this film in. When you're inside for more than five minutes you forget that you're not inside a real sub. It's that kind of detail that allows Petersen's camera to float freely through the ship. There simply isn't a bad angle in there.
The atmosphere inside also enhanced the performance of the actors. A lot of them deliver their career highlight in Das Boot.Other reviewers mentioned all the great things about this film. I agree with them. It is one of the anti-war-films with the most impact I know. It's not important for the viewer whether the soldiers are Germans, Americans or Japanese. War is the same for everybody. We can relate and feel with the mariners. Few films are that intense, suspenseful and claustrophobic.There's just one thing I'd like to add:
The climax of the film shows the whole futility of war better than any other I can remember. I'm not going to spoil anything (If you've already seen it you will remember). When I saw it first I couldn't help but feel cheated. But then I thought about it and now I think that this ending just adds to the realism of the film. It is a punch in the face that shows that in war there are no heroes and emphasizes the complete senselessness of it all.If you haven't seen this already, stop reading now and watch it. For the more patient viewer I also recommend the 4.5 hour long tv mini series.",Das Boot
196,Bob_647,Grind breakingly realistic war drama.,9,14 June 2020,"The film is like a documentary in its impact. Although we become familiar with several of the characters, it is not their story, really, but the story of a single U-boat mission, from beginning to end. There is a brief opening sequence in which the boat puts out to sea from a French base, and a refueling sequence near the end, but all the other scenes are shot inside the cramped sub, or on the bridge.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction. So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over acting, and over blown images. Too much. These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level. Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen. Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"". It is reality, not a grand concept. The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.And it's not shot in tidy setups, either; the cinematographer, Jost Vacano, hurtles his camera through the boat from one end to the other, plunging through cramped openings, hurdling obstacles on the deck, ducking under hammocks and swinging light fixtures. There are long sequences here--especially when the boat is sinking out of control--when we feel trapped in the same time and space as the desperate crew.And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it's a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters. Particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war. It is both haunting and beautiful.Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I'm interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.I can go on for a long while: over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film's lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impact in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I'll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie.",Das Boot

My paltry words simply cannot do it justice. Claustrophobia, tension and terror pervade throughout (except in the IMO slightly unnecessary opening sequence which is mercifully brief.) For me it was a story about the captain, a stunning performance by Jurgen Prochnow who plays an experienced, U-boat captain who is not without flaws. His crew comprise a few old comrades plus a group of raw recruits and a journalist. These men are German but not Nazis (with one exception) and though they spoil for a fight with the British convoys one cannot help but be drawn to them. The captain is a complex character, he shows disdain for his own 'high command' and respect for his 'enemy' yet he does not shy away from sinking convoy ships. He makes mistakes and has victories but treats them all with a fatalistic dark humour. A very good film changes gear into an astonishing masterpiece when the crew of U-96 arrive in Vigo, Spain. The sickening opulence contrasts starkly to the conditions aboard U-96, then the orders to go on what could prove to be a suicide mission. The peril of the crew is intensified, their heroic work to survive and ""go home"" is followed by what is an excruciating final twist that will leave you reeling.",Das Boot
200,JonathanDP81,It's not fair!,10,15 March 2001,"That's what I silently scream each time that I see the ending to this film. It's not fair that this crew, which had gone through unspeakable horrors for their country, couldn't enjoy a moments respite from the terrors of war. No, they get bombed, their ship sunk, with many of them injured and the officers dead.  It's not fair that Captain Hans-Jürgen Hellriegel's last sight on this Earth was his 'amazing boat' sinking.Many out there probably thought the same thing.  But history tells us that those were American planes destroying that submarine base, so it was a good thing, right?  Right?Das Boot has got to be the ultimate anti-war movie.  It doesn't preach, doesn't wail about men in power sending boys off to die, it simply strips the illusions away from war.  War is not glamorous, it's an act in kill or be killed survival.  The boys in the U-96 were each a disposable cog in a much larger machine, all doing they're best to stay alive.This is more than movie; it's a hard look at ourselves.

Wonderfully shot, eerie compelling drama, very real human emotions, (even given the nature of the whole Nazi/Master race subject matter here) and then...that ""Commando Comics"" ending. For any non-Brits reading this, ""Commando"" was a series of WWII comic books for young boys that always made sure the 'nasty baddies' got their comeuppance in the end, usually in some typically gung-ho moment of literary redemption. What a shame it had to end like that. All that effort, all that time (3.5 hours), spent empathising with the crew and especially with U-96, feeling their fear and their worries and then a random US fighter plane comes out of nowhere, kills them all and sinks the sub when it's home and dry.

204,maryolalov,Best war movie,9,6 February 2019,I can without doubt call Das Boot the best war movie I have seen. The thing that makes it so good is that it doesn't only focus on the war but also on the lives of the people who are obliged to take part in this war. The other thing that makes Das Boot superior to other war movies is that it doesn't serve as some sort of propaganda which is something I have never seen in another WW2 movie.The acting and the cinematography are great. The movie really makes you experience the misery of every single character. The setting is also unique and makes you feel some sort of claustrophobia which contributes to the overall experience.The plot is simple but intriguing and really keeps the audience entertained till the very end even though the movie is extremely long.Das Boot is truly an awesome and unique movie that despite its long duration manages to keep the audience on the edge of their seats during the whole time.,Das Boot
205,Member,It came close...,8,21 April 2000,"In very much the same way the world came close to total devastation during ww2 this film comes close to being the definite war spectacle. Films like Saving private Ryan don't compare well to the ambience and tension of this film, although the story does not achieve very high marks. The film should have delved deeper into the characters, now only the captain of the submarine is the only real character. There would have been many real life stories that could have given at least as much exitement as this story did. I'm not too pedantic but some things about the story did not seem to be quite truthfull.

It can be said that the hero of the film is the whole crew, although some are more important – lieutenant from military press office, captain of the submarine. This film shows how tough, dangerous and claustrophobic life in submarine can be. Many scenes are so tight and claustrophobic that they make viewer feel uncomfortable. Also I quickly felt for the crew despite them fighting for the wrong side. Acting is overall great most notably J. Prochnow. Music is also very good. Only glitch in this over three hour long film (there is also TV series which is longer) is a little cliché the most outstanding heroes of the film are not Nazis, captain is anti Nazi. I understand that it was made to make them more sympathetic, because I would hardly root for Nazi. But if they made heroes more morally ambivalent it would be more interesting. But apart form that, it is a great film.",Das Boot
208,timcon1964,Extremely Realistic View of U-boat Warfare,10,18 December 2013,"As a young German officer, Lothar-Gűnther Buchheim was assigned to join a U-boat patrol in the Atlantic and write a morale-boosting account of its mission. This experience provided the basis for his 1973 novel, Das Boot, which inspired this film.In its day, Das Boot was one of the most expensive films ever produced. Most of the money went into the sets. Especially noteworthy is the set for the U-boat's interior, which was carefully constructed to replicate all the equipment of a real submarine, and mounted on a gimbal that could impart movements to simulate waves, dives, and depth charges. The set was engineered so that water could rush in and fire could break out in its confines. The camera man was forced to work in very restricted spaces and dash through the set filming the actors with his special gyro-stabilized camera. As portrayed in Das Boot, sailors were a diverse lot, but in crises they set their varying personalities and political philosophies aside and assume their assigned roles. They take some satisfaction from sinking ships, but this is tempered by discomfort or remorse over the merchant seamen they killed. U-boat existence was dispiriting, with long periods of boredom alternating with sheer terror as crewmen fought against an unseen enemy for their very lives. Casting is excellent, especially compelling is Jurgen Prochnow as the steely-eyed captain. Herbert Grönemeyer as the young correspondent Werner (i.e., Buchheim), and Klaus Wennermann as the Chief Engineer give strong performances. Hubertus Bengsch and Martin Semmelrogge give credibility to the First and Second Watch Officers, respectively—two very different characters. The sound effects, enhanced in the most recent versions, make you feel you are actually on the boat.Several versions of Das Boot have been released. The 150-minute theater version (1981), the 209-minute Director's Cut version (1997), and the 293-minute version (2004) from which a six-episode television series was derived. The 293-minute version provides more information about individual crew members and everyday life on the ship. The 209-minute version gives insights into the officers' personalities (but neglects the other crewmen). The 150-minute theater version concentrates on action scenes. The nature of your interests may determine which version you prefer.In one of the peripherals (The Making of Das Boot), star Jurgen Prochnow asserts, ""The whole thing happened. That's a true story—exactly like it was."" That is not exactly true. The U-96 actually sailed from St. Nazaire, not La Rochelle. If the U-96's crew were optimistic in setting out at the beginning of the film (October 1941), it was not due to their inexperience, but because the U-96 had already survived six patrols. A patrol was not yet the semi-suicidal venture it was later to become. British anti-submarine measures had become much more effective by late 1941, but the U-boats responded by moving their operations away from the most heavily patrolled seas. Sinkings by U-boats peaked in November 1942. The decisive turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic actually came in May 1943, when over 40 U-boats were lost (compared with 4 lost in November 1941). In real life, U-96's periscope would have been raised to a level at which the captain's view was not obscured by waves; and almost every encounter with British anti-submarine vessels would have featured the pinging of the asdic apparatus they used to locate submerged U-boats. In the film, messages are decoded with a four-rotor Enigma machine; but the German navy actually continued using three-rotor machines until February 1942.But all this is small-minded nitpicking. Das Boot is not intended to be a reenactment of a particular patrol; it is, rather, a microcosm of the whole U-boat war. Yet, in many ways, the film closely follows the U-96's seventh patrol (Oct. 27, 1941-Dec. 6, 1941). The U-96 was an actual ship; and it really had for its emblem the laughing sawfish that appears on the conning tower of the movie vessel. The harbor scenes were shot in World War II era German submarine bunkers. Bread and fresh produce customarily were tucked into every available space when a U-boat was provisioned. Bucheim really did take thousands of photographs while on board. The unscheduled encounter with another U-boat actually did take place—Buchheim's photo of the event is reproduced on the cover of Time-Life's The Battle of the Atlantic (1977). And many U-boats were ordered to the Mediterranean (by Hitler himself) to protect ships carrying supplies to German forces in Africa.As far as we can tell, the film's principal characters were closely based on their real-life equivalents. ""Leutnant Werner"" represents Buchheim himself, a young man who found U-boat life much more harrowing than he imagined. The captain is based on Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, one of the top U-boat ""aces,"" who had joined the navy in the pre-Nazi years and may have been among the navy officers who were not imbued with Nazism. The First Watch Officer was clearly patterned on Gerhard Groth, who was born in Mexico. The film portrays the Second Watch Officer, who evidently represents Werner Hermann, as a rather irreverent and mischievous person—and Hermann's cadet class was remembered for its pranks. Bengsch (cast as Groth) and Semmelrogge (cast as Hermann) may have been selected for their physical resemblance to the characters they portrayed. The Chief Engineer was probably based on Friedrich-Wilhelm Grade. In real life, all of these men survived the war.From a German perspective, only 10 U-boats were more successful than the U-96. After 11 patrols, it became a training vessel, and it survived until it was destroyed by American bombs in March 1945. In the course of the war, not a single crew member died in combat on the U-96. In real life, U-96 was a lucky boat.",Das Boot

212,Autonome,Epic modern tragedy. Battle death noir.,9,20 June 2002,"Such a tale of woe on the high seas is only rarely portrayed on film. To me, the film goes beyond the actors and the film making. It seems to have taken on an inexplicable life of it's own- straight to some mechanized Nazi oblivion at the bottom of the north sea. The tragedy builds to a mythical, nightmarish scale. The film seems to inadvertently portray some accursed modern archetype of war. Perhaps the sea and the boat itself are the true, silent commanders of the crew, who are merely the pathetic pawns of fate. The kapitan, who's life at sea depended entirely on the boat- you could almost see his soul fall away as he watched it finally go down. This film seems to cut right to the seductive myth and horrible reality of war.The film is long. Relentlessly long. Torpedoes travel in real time. The sets are dark and gritty probably beyond the reality of the day. It's over three hours long. I cannot explain why I had to watch it twice. In the second viewing, you may start to see glimpses of your own face among the crew.

Get the directors cut.,9,7 January 2002,"For those of us ( majority ) who have never set foot on a modern submarine let alone a World War 2  SUBMERSIBLE it is not possible to comprehend the living hell these U-Boat crews endured - ( U-Boats had to surface frequently to replenish air, and use diesel engines to surface patrol and recharge batteries, therefore were not true submarines such as a modern nuclear sub today ).  This film comes closest of all offerings lately to show what it was really like. Horrific depth charging, poor food and air, were a U-Boats mans lot during the closing stages of the war in the Atlantic. The ""Happy Time"" was definitely over for U-Boats as Allied warships employed ASDIC underwater sonar and new depth charge techniques to inflict terrible losses on the U-Boat forces. Director Wolfgang Peterson went to great lengths to ensure as accurate as possible portrayal of the lives these men lived and it was a demanding if ultimately rewarding shoot for the cast. All the cast members do a fine job. If you thought U-571 was good (and it's not too bad )stack it up next to Das Boot and see just how good Das Boot really is. See the extended Directors Cut with re-mastered audio , and preferably on DVD. If you like this film genre you will not be disappointed.",Das Boot

I started to watch the movie. Then, i had the feeling that its one of those comrade movie where you have bunch of guys from different background, with different dreams, and different difficulties in life. I watch till one hour and I got bored. May be because at this time I have watched too many movies that force me to make an assumptions about the plot and storytelling of this movie, which I am afraid to say that it was a right assumption. May be it is one of the great movie of that time period where this type of movie had utter significance in the society and the cultures. But, i was kind of disappointed. Any way i appreciate the effort people put on this movie.",Das Boot
215,olethrosdc,A journey,10,2 August 2004,"If you are prepared to sit through three hours of film and are not feeling uncomfortable with world war two-era Germans being portrayed as 'heroes', then you should watch this movie. The story is simple. A german submarine crew undertakes a routine patrol mission at a time that the tide of war is turning against the Germans. You will have plenty of time to empathise with the men, get to know them, be bored with them - scared with them - rejoice with them - feel guilt with them. The movie portrays quite simple and yet, tragic, events. This is a movie that does not need to show blood and cut limbs in order to provoke sympathy and passion. All the casts act superbly well and the claustrophobic camera angles and beautiful sound add to the atmosphere. What is life in a submarine all about? Long stretches of silence, broken by intense sequences of stressful anxiety. Thinking about the war, about loved ones. Unlike other movies (Cold Mountain comes to mind), you really do feel there is a chemistry between the wretched sailors in the U-boat and their unseen sweethearts, even if no looks or words are exchanged between them.Das Boot is tragic in many levels more than 'simple' love. The ambivalence of feelings towards one's country and the enemy is examined.The simultaneous desire to defeat the enemy, the joy of winning - juxtaposed to the fear - the guilt - the pain - the distrust.. and the feeling that you and everybody around you are becoming crazy. All characters in this movie have a distinct personality and distinct moral values. They are all so uncommonly seen in recent movies, yet they are no caricatures of human nature. (Their depth is amazing. I can't believe that the director of this film also directed 'Troy', but then again, Troy depicted events hapenning over an extended time period and represented a harder endeavour. In the isolated sub environment, time has no meaning. It might as well not pass at all.)
Furthermore, do yourself a favour and do not watch the movie dubbed, as the US dubbers made a really bad job out of this movie. There are not many lines for you to read anyhow.",Das Boot

The movie strongly resembles ""Black Hawk Down"": the soldiers do not talk about politics, they do not care if they are doing the right thing or the wrong one. They are the professionals, they have to follow their orders.

What makes this movie in my sense brilliant, is that it shows what was going on on a U-Boat. Boredom, fear and anxiety of getting sunk, thats what those men felt most of the time, if not that they were making the small and close spaced sub more smellier than it was. That all was just part of life, they were looked as heroes, thats what they were, but no one probaly thought what kind of heroes.If you truly wish to get part of this anxiety driven movie, which is full of surprises then do yourself a favour, stop reading this and start watching the movie!",Das Boot

221,rickhavoc1,The most influential war movie of the last quarter of the 20th Century.,10,22 September 2007,"This epic masterpiece has influenced nearly all the war movies, many action and suspense movies, and all submarine movies since it's first release in 1981. Especially in the area of realism. If you look for it, you can see it's influence in such different movies as Aliens, Die Hard, Apollo 13, The Alamo, The Right Stuff, The Hunt for Red October, Tears of the Sun, Crimson Tide, Top Gun, K19 the Widowmaker, and many more. I really think Bruce Willis studied Jürgen Prochnow's portrayal of the Captain, among others like Clint Eastwood, to learn how to express emotions with just his eyes and minimal facial expressions.The movie starts with the grim statistic that of the 40,000 men who served in U-Boats in WWII, 30,000 didn't survive. No other branch of any military service that fought in WWII had 3/4 of the men who served in it KIA. Military historians have noted that if the commander of the German submarine forces, Admiral Karl Donitz, had been provided with most of the 300 U-Boats he asked for to start the war with, (he had 57, only 20 of them suitable for ocean-going operations), he could have effectively cut Great Britain's supply lines, and probably forced them to capitulate. One of the oldest military maxims states: ""Amatuers study tactics, professionals study logistics"". Thank God Hitler was an amateur!The cinematography, lighting, sound design, mock-ups, props, and production design set new standards for the industry. Cinematographer Jost Vacano designed a special Arriflex camera to film most of the interior sequences to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It is a miniaturized version of a Steadicam that has 2 gyroscopes for stability. Vacano wore full-body padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mock-up was rocked and shaken. Wolfgang Petersen insisted that every gage, control, hatch, torpedo tube, piece of equipment, and fitting in the hydraulically mounted interior mock-up had to exactly match that of a Type VIIC-class U-boat, down to the smallest screw. This attention to detail extended to virtually every aspect of the production. Here's an interesting sidelight. All of the main actors speak fluent English as well as German; when the film was dubbed into English, each actor recorded his own part. The German version is actually dubbed as well; the film itself was shot ""silent"", since in any case the dialog spoken on-set would have been drowned out by the gyroscopes in the special camera developed for filming. I saw the subtitled version when it was first released in the US, and own the Director's cut on DVD. I prefer to watch it with the English language soundtrack, and I swear that it's so well synchronized with the actor's lip movements that I can't tell that it's dubbed!The strong ensemble cast, many of whom went on to successful careers in the German and American entertainment industry, is an integral part of the movie's success. Since they are listed on the main movie page, I'm not going to duplicate it here. Most of the filming was done in one year; to make the appearance of the actors as realistic as possible, scenes were filmed in sequence over the course of the year. This ensured natural growth of beards and hair, increasing skin pallor, and signs of strain on the actors, who had, just like real U-boat men, spent many months in a cramped, unhealthy atmosphere. Throughout the filming, the actors were forbidden to go out into the sunlight, to create the pallor of men who seldom saw the sun during their missions. The actors went through intensive training to learn how to move quickly through the narrow confines of the vessel. Movies like this, The Great Escape, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy form the basis of a strong argument that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needs to add an award category for best ensemble cast. Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, the captain of the real U-96, survived the war and was one of the consultants for this movie.To me, the saddest thought that occurs to me every time I see it is that they wasted all that incredible courage on the biggest A$$HOLE in human history, Adolph Hitler. Boo! Hiss! Pbththt! (The last is a Bronx cheer!) These sentiments are for AH, not the movie. To learn more about it, see the article on Wikipedia. This is one of those movies EVERYONE should watch at least once in their life.",Das Boot
222,Lestyr,Astounding,9,3 June 1999,"This film is so incredibly realistic, it brings to mind the not-yet-made ""Saving Private Ryan"" for simple, harsh ability to shock.  Also, the scenes with the depth charges are quite scary, simply because it's really nothing anyone's ever seen before (and therefore no way of making hackneyed cliches), and they never hit when you expect them to.  Extremely good movie - watch it when you can.",Das Boot
223,Mike_Wiggins,The best submarine film ever made.,10,25 March 2005,"While it has been a very long time since I have seen this movie, it is one of the very few that I own. Wolfgang Petersen's magnificent accomplishment in ""Das Boot"" is reiterating the dictum that ""war is hell"", no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located.*** Minor spoilers ***The plot has been well described by other viewers so I won't rehash it again. But my personal observations, as an ex-submarine sailor, are that Petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately. I say ""probably"" because todays subs are hotels compared with the German U-boats and American submarines. The commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a ""sewer pipe"" for weeks at a time. More importantly, you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions (American WW2 subs used to be called ""pig boats""), deals with an unfortunately believable political officer, deals with drills, actual torpedo firings, actual ships casualties, and deals, most frighteningly, with retribution from the ""enemy"". My own experience watching the depth charging of the U-boat was such that I was thinking ""stop it, Stop It, STOP IT, STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT...!!!!!"" That's how real it felt to me. For the rest of you, I feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a WW2 U-boat.This movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew (and ultimately the sub) together. Petersen's direction for Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock was masterful because it didn't portray the captain as a god. It showed him as a man who knows how to lead, knows his submarine as if he were married to it (and in many ways he is) but isn't perfect at the job. It also shows that even with great leadership qualities, Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock can not do the job alone: he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs, but to also advise the captain. Petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookie-cutter personalities that Hollywood feels is needed.I could go on and on. So I will close by saying that with the plot, direction, cinematography, acting, sound, music, editing all being top notch, this is one of the few movies that I can truly rate a 10 out of 10. I also preferred the German version with subtitles.------------------------------------ I believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use Steadicam technology. It was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine, specifically through the open watertight doors, without a break in the filming. Up until I heard what Steadicam was, I was always wondering how Petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung from.(It turns out I was wrong: ""Bound For Glory"" was the first.)EDIT (12 OCT, 2006): I have been corrected by an observant viewer. Wikipedia has the following comment on what I thought was Steadicam usage:""Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacano's design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had a gyroscope to provide stability, a reinvention of the Steadicam on a smaller scale, so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up. Vacano wore full-body padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mock-up was rocked and shaken."" So, literally, a Steadicam was NOT used in the filming of ""Das Boot"". However, a camera that resembled Steadicam in function (in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform) was used.------------------------------------ Even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors, and we have refrigerators, freezers, air conditioning, are able to take showers, etc., there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on: the smell. While the smell of the ""pig boats"" of WW2 was truly atrocious, even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere, you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created, from burned toast in the galley, from the smell of the ""sanitary gasses"" (to be kind), to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel, all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing. You, as a sailor, may get used to it, but when you get home, your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash ... immediately!",Das Boot

Great suspense sequences allows you to experience the fear and nervousness of these submariners as they are chased through the Atlantic by British destroyers.  The film gives you a whole new definition of claustraphobia with specially designed sets and hand-held cameras.

I recently rented the DVD director's cut version. It is an hour longer than the theatrical release, coming in at three and a half hours. Too long! The shorter version - itself two and a half hours long - does a superb job in creating that claustrophobic, hopeless atmosphere that infuses the movie. The longer director's cut just makes you want to shout, ""Stop, stop! I get it!"" Actually became a bit boring. If you have an option, go with the shorter theatrical release version.Also, whichever version you watch, do not turn on the English subtitles. They are simply awful! At the start, I had the English-language dubbing AND the English subtitles turned on. I quickly noticed that whoever did the subtitles did a terrible job. They were in a late-20th century vernacular that made no sense for a WW II movie. What you were hearing the actors say and what was in the printed subtitle were substantially different ""interpretations"" of the German. Terrible!

229,RedrumNeddy,Diving Deep,9,29 November 2020,"Das Boot is one of the most unique war movies ever made. I watched the Directors Cut which is 3 and a half hours long, and i enjoyed every second of it. A very gritty and realistic experience, to say the least. You spend a majority of the movie inside this wreck of a submarine along with the crew, and you observe their behavior and bond with them. The dialogue between the crew is great, and there are some really funny lines found throughout the movie. I enjoyed the soundtrack very much aswell. It flows naturally with the scenes, you can barely notice it sometimes.Erwin Leder stands out in his role as Johann. The entire cast is great, but Leders expressions and manic eyes are downright haunting. One of the more memorable scenes in the movie involves him and Jürgen Prochnow, in his role as The Captain.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes war movies. Its unique and most people i know never watched a movie exploring a submarine crew in such detail, while being packed with atmosphere and tension.",Das Boot
230,Niebel,problems with the story,8,30 November 2006,"It is strange that the description above describes the crew of the U-Boat as ""raw recruits."" Whoever wrote that must not have even seen the film. It is obvious that they were mostly veteran submariners.I was surprised to see in the credits that they had a technical adviser from the German Navy on this film, because the many errors (that could have been easily avoided with a little attention) detract a lot from the film. I mean things like the sound guy calling out a bearing to a target when his indicator dial is pointing in a quite different direction. Still, it is a gripping story that really makes you feel the desperation of a submarine crew struggling to keep their boat (never call one a ""ship"") and themselves alive after a severe attack.The biggest flaw is included in the film from the book. I guess the writer must have thought it would be sort of poignant to show something of how the ""brotherhood of the sea"" has to be abandoned in war when he had the boat surface at night to observe the burning tanker they torpedoed two hours before, and shoot another torpedo to ""finish her off,"" then having to back away leaving the surviving crewmen in the water to drown.One big weakness of the German U-Boats was their fairly small load of torpedoes. No competent U-Boat commander would have ever wasted a precious torpedo sinking a ship that was already doomed. But even worse was the act of surfacing at all. In a calm sea, with a brilliant tower of flames from the sinking tanker, the sub would have been easily spotted by any enemy vessel within many miles of there, while their own lookouts would have been blinded by the light of the fire. The whole scene was dramatic, but utterly absurd. In reality the sub would have had to get away from there as quickly as possible in order to surface and recharge its battery.Still, I have the DVD and enjoy watching it now and then. It is fun to play it with the English subtitles and notice how they sometimes differ from the German being spoken. Note also, for English speakers, that the title is correctly pronounced ""Das Boat.""Some posts have called this the ""greatest anti-war film ever made."" It certainly has a strong message about the futility and waste of war, but I think when it comes to the many fine anti-war films out there, one special film stands alone above all the rest. It is called ""Johnny Got His Gun."" If you can find a copy of it, see it. Then you will have a proper basis for judging anti-war films.",Das Boot
231,gbalfour,One of the best war movies made,9,23 February 2002,"There are a number of things that make Das Boot a great movie.  But perhaps the best way to explain why it is so good is to mention some of the things that you won't find in this movie.There are no unrealistic special effects; there is no secret agenda, no hidden plot, and no saboteur.  When battle damage sends them to the bottom of the sea, they talk about running out of air, but we are not told there is six hours of air and they return to the surface at 5:59:59, a second before they would all die.Also, there is no attempt to mix a war film up with a love film, nor are we confronted with giant squid.  But we do get a chance to be part of the lives of these men as they leave, young and innocent and get on each other's nerves and live in fear and deal with being at war.Another refreshing part of Das Boot is that we do not really get hung up on taking sides.  The audience is not asked to be patriotic.  The Captain is not.  He dislikes Hitler and does not always hold his tongue about his feelings.  But he does accept that he has a job to do, even if he does not enjoy doing it.  In fact, if you are view the English dubbed version of this film, you may forget that the crew is German.  You want them too survive because they are people.  And that all soldiers are `people' is the point this movie subtlety brings home.Having seen both the sub-titled version and the dubbed version, I definitely suggest going for the sub-titles.  I found the actors that did the voice-over for the dubbing tried add their own interpretations to the story with voices that did not seem to match the dialogue.",Das Boot

I imagine watching Das Boot in English is like watching Hogan's Heroes.  Whatever you do, if you have a chance to watch this movie, make sure it is the subtitled edition.The Director's Cut is long, but worth it.

234,icclyf,Great,8,23 July 2020,"Das Boot is not just a great war film: it's a great film period. Maybe it is true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films. Here is a movie that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a German u-boat.I saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my ""depressing movie festival."" (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend ""entries."") Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow's pained blue eyes. When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine. I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time. How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level. To say this film is ""powerful"" seems so weak a description.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction. So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images. Too much. These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level. Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen. Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"". It is reality, not a grand concept. The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.",Das Boot

Nevertheless the German high Command orders more and more U-boats (submarines) into battle from their ports in occupied France.40,000 German sailors served on U-boats during World War ll.30,000 never returned.DAS BOOT (THE BOAT) This Film was first broadcast back in 1981 on German television as a mini series which became so popular that it has now been viewed all over the world. This mini series was cut down by almost half, to be made into a feature film (plently long at 200mins). Das Boot, The Director's cut takes you onboard a claustrophobic submarine during the mayhem of 1941 when British destroyers (ships) were getting much more sophisticated with radar and sonar thus being able to detect deeper into the sea. The atmosphere on the U-96,one of the famed German U-boats known as The Grey Wolves is captivating and as the film proceeds you will begin to enjoy the entrancing ride of these sailors as they launch torpedos and endure heavy depth charges in retaliation (make sure you've got the volume up). All the German crew and especially the Capt-Lt Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jurgen Prochnow) give truly enthralling performances. This film really does take you on a journey with many edgy moments including an emotional trip to the sea bed when they are hit by a depth charge.THE DIRECTING The director Wolfgang Petersen does an outstanding job to keep you inches from the action inside the submarine,all the cameras are in the right places at the right time. The panning shots that follow the crew running from one end of the submarine to the other are breathtaking. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't pick up an Oscar for best director as in my books the direction is unparalleled, it however was nominated for best Director, best Cinematography.THE MUSIC The music is second to none,absolutely spot on with the help from Klaus Doldinger. when I hear the opening music to Das Boot it always gives me goose pimples (very stimulating). .To me the music from Das Boot is as absorbing, if not more, than the famous music in Jaws the film.LANGUAGES Das Boot was filmed in German and for me that's the best format (watching with subtitles) although if you're feeling lazy you can opt for dubbed English which is done very well.DAS BOOT (SUPERBIT) I had the pleasure to watch this film at my relatives,who has an HD television and a superbit DVD player.and I cannot stress how much better it is.

In one scene the captain is tracking a destroyer in heavy seas. His periscope is constantly awash in waves, obscuring his view. Instead of ordering the sub to rise a meter or two, he maintains depth. Of course, the destroyer almost rams him. Would a real seasoned captain have made this mistake? Elsewhere in the movie, the sub receives several radiograms on the activity of other subs. Yet, he almost collides with another sub far out into the Atlantic. No radio communication between the two? In the final scene, two fighters attack the port with machine guns. Multiple bomb explosions occur (too many for two one-bomb fighters) *before* the planes arrive where the explosions are occurring.

People (young men/boys) who got called up by their country, often thinking they were going to become heroes, and ended up in a living hell of terror and violence.

Although I can name only three others beside this one, so the competition is not very tight. Still, that doesn't lessen the greatness and value of 'Das Boot.' A tightly-scripted and masterfully acted atmospheric movie that deserves praises it gets. Special effects and set designs have stood the test of time. Add the precise directing and innovative cinematography by Jost Vacano, you get the timeless piece of cinema. Another layer that makes 'Das Boot' stand above many other war movies, that it is not anti- or neither pro-war (although the crew makes some mild jokes towards Nazism) - instead, it is a simple tale about men in war.And the men are trying to do their best to defeat the enemy. As a viewer, it is easy to catch wind of the crew's hunt. (Even though, they fight on the 'wrong' side) The scenes where the submarine races through the waves accompanied by Klaus Doldinger's powerful score, honestly, feel exhilarating. The tight and claustrophobic atmosphere of the submarine feels even more stifling as the enemy is kept faceless. We only get to see the glimpses of enemy ships through mist and waves. They appear as ghost ships and this adds already a tense movie subtle layer of (quality) horror mystery feel.Except for brief scenes in the beginning and the end, the whole action takes place inside the submarine. But not a single dull moment inside those 208 minutes (I watched the director's cut). Even when nothing seemingly happens, and the crew is bored and frustrated being without battle action, the smell of ominous threat is in the air as if something is about to happen any second now. And we all know, how difficult it is to make a captivating movie that takes place in a closed room.Although he directed some quite entertaining action adventures later on in his career, Wolfgang Petersen never achieved such greatness ever again.",Das Boot

258,susy-7,15 years and I'm still thinking about it,10,8 September 1999,"Das Boot is not just a great war film: it's a great film period. Maybe it is true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films.  Here is a movie that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a German u-boat.I saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my ""depressing movie festival."" (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend ""entries."")  Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow's pained blue eyes.  When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine.  I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time.  How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To say this film is ""powerful"" seems so weak a description.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction.  So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images.  Too much.  These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"".  It is reality, not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.Story is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10.

My father, a war movie buff, permitted me to watch it with him, even though I was about 8yrs old then- not exactly a suitable series for a young girl - or boy for that matter. Coming from a country which was on the Allied side in WWII, I believe this has to be the first and only film that made us not only cheer for the Germans (up to then our mortal enemies), but also portrayed the Germans as normal people and not as stupid, cardboard villains (a stupid cliche that continues to this day in most WWII films). It's true I didn't have the experience to understand or appreciate everything, but, two things stood out and I remembered them for many years to come. The intense, claustrophobic atmosphere was the first, and Jurgen Prochnow's magnetic blue eyes was the second. These blue eyes haunted me for many years, until finally in my teens, I rediscovered the film and watched it again and again, while at the same time I tried to learn as many things that I could about naval warfare in WWII, in order to have a context which would help me appreciate the story better. And what a story it is...Every soldier in every war goes through hell in various different ways, but I cannot think of a worse fate than slowly suffocating in the bottom of the ocean, inside an iron coffin, while being bombed from above. ""Das Boot"" manages to perfectly portray the terror, the angst, the despair, the triumph, the boredom- the incredible range of emotions which every submariner- most of them young boys in their teens - went through in the course of 1 mission. The foggy, smelly, cramped confines of the submarine become the canvas on which the increasingly pale, skeletal and exhausted sailors are being painted- and no matter how much we root for them (and we DO root for them), we can't help but feel the dread that is bound to follow. We cheer with the crew, we laugh and cry and despair with them, and finally for them. All the aspects of this movie are spectacular. The direction, acting, photography, sets etc. are all top notch. I would like to give special kudos to the soundtrack, which has been my second favorite OST of all times after the Blade Runner one. This movie doesn't glorify war- quite the opposite. I guarantee that after watching this movie, you will want to watch it again and again because it reaches in a deep place inside the human psyche and never lets go. For me, it is one of the very few life-changing movies I have had the privilege to watch. If I could give it more than 10/10, I would.",Das Boot

269,charlie_bucket,superlative!,10,8 July 2003,"Yep, seems like almost universal praise here, and there's little else to say, but Das Boot (director's cut) really is that good. Just some of the reasons:1. Jürgen Prochnow put forth an acting performance that qualifies as one of the best ever in any movie, and more than half of it could be found in his facial expressions and quietude alone. Of course, when he lets his emotions loose at certain pivotal moments in the film, the audience is spellbound, and Prochnow commands the scenes of the movie as surely as his character commands the ship and its crew. This character is intricate in the extreme, but almost never overtly so.2. The movie snowballs into one of the most intense and addicting film experiences I've ever come across. At three and 1/2+ hours, it manages to become more and more engaging. There are moments (especially towards the end) where the tempo of the movie is so fine-tuned that one is impelled to stare at the screen and become emotionally fused, as it were, with the plight of the characters.3. Related to #1, the casting for the film was such that personalities came forth in faces alone at times. Secondary characters with few lines are given the benefit of personality and even character development through their actions and faces, combined with the little scrapings of dialogue each of them gets. We almost empirically know what these people are like. Dialogue is very important in this movie, but the physical characteristics of the actors match ALL of the characters' personalities so well here that one suspects that these people aren't acting. And really, that's what it's all about, right? That we should not realize that this is just make-believe? We see funny people, serious people, tired people, uptight people...it all works perfectly well. Great, natural acting by all.4. The steady-cam claustrophobia betrays genuine craft in the direction of this movie. One gets the feeling of a cramped space throughout the film. Likewise, within this small space, there is still room for direction, and the composition of the shots are all superb. Another thing: the film quality is very clean for a movie that was made in 1983, and stands up to today's work well - this movie doesn't really date itself visually, which is a rare thing.5. The story line and dialogue were original and completely realistic. There are few words uttered and few moments in the movie that I wouldn't have believed. It steers clear of some of the gross exaggerations of certain Hollywood-style war films, both in heroic dialogue and also during person-to-person banter while characters are just hanging around off-duty.
6. The representation of boredom is an interesting concept in this film, and one that Hollywood is usually uncomfortable with. Here, we see moments where the crew simply sits around doing nothing, and the film, for some of these moments, goes nowhere with them - stalling out in the middle of the ocean. Is this a bad thing? No. It's an objective construction of the boredom of NOT seeing constant action, and the director takes the time to do it right, without blatantly telling the audience, ""ok, the character is bored here. See that? Right. Next scene. Now we're going to make something interesting happen right away"". And you know what? The boredom of the crew is fascinating to behold.7. The set was a masterpiece. A near perfect recreation, and weathered and propped perfectly down to the last detail.8. The music was low-key enough that it didn't intrude on the organic drama going on in the picture. I'm not crazy about the score, but at least it wasn't hitting me over the head every twenty seconds. It is sparse, and incidental sound in general in the re-master was really impressive, and is the real sonic contributor much more so than the music.9. The subject matter is great - a very subjective thing, but aren't U-Boats and the Atlantic War just interesting? I think so. And I'm glad that U-571 isn't the only movie out there about them - because it did absolutely nothing as far as showing what LIVING was like inside of one. 'Das Boot' made this factor absolutely integral to the nature of the movie, and for that, it's unequaled by any war film save perhaps the Finnish movie 'Talvisota'.If you haven't seen it, please do. It's an important and excellent film.",Das Boot

278,chip_cristian,Fake but wonderful,9,21 February 2015,"Small tip: visit the Bavaria Film Studios in Munich. You can see there the real U-boat used in the movie and walk inside. Now, about the film let me get something straight: the Germans during WW2 were cruel, savage, with an raw unforgivingness character, mean, heartless and vengeful. I just watched a 5 hour long movie about a bunch of spiritual, loving, crying and compassionate Germans who wanted to save burning Englishmen from drowning. Now, I know there are many movies out there about how mean the Germans were and they felt the need to equal the balance but there are some historical facts that will contradict the movie: during WW2, there was something called ""doctrine"" and ""brain washing"" - something that the Germans of the 40's were very familiar with. Many of them really believed Hitler was doing the right and moral things and that they were purebred. Secondly, Germans were never captivated or even recognized the intelligence of the adversary due to their huge pride and ego (remember in the movie when the captain was amazed by the intelligence of the British); and third - it's totally science fiction to put the issue of saving your enemy from death in a TOTAL WAR. Besides the above ""minor"" issues, I loved the movie, the acting, and even if it was the longest film I ever watched (director's cut lasted 5 hours) I never got bored by this wonderful movie made before I was even born. The end, on the other hand, suggested the faith of the German war.",Das Boot

I am not a veteran of any war, and not old enough for WW2, but my dad fought against the Axis and they were his mortal enemies, but this movie shows how young boys are just the cannon fodder of wars, while the men who started it were the real enemy, the real evil. These were kids that just wanted a lady at their side and a bottle of booze with them, as were all soldiers from any army. We, America, Great Britain, France etc., fought the Nazis, not Germany, not the people, certainly not the kids. I actually was saddened by the British raid at the end of the movie, even though Britain was an ally and to this day one of my country's closest friends. A great many of the soldiers and seamen, on both sides, weren't good guys or bad guys, just brave kids who did what they were told to do. One day maybe the men who start these things will end up in a cramped, stinking U-boat, and see first hand what their actions lead to.

285,aherdofbeautifulwildponies,Going Down,10,2 February 2021,"I suspect that, prior to Das Boot (1981), I had only seen a single West German film: the magical fantasy The NeverEnding Story (1984). Very different in their nature, the two productions nevertheless have the same writer and director, Wolfgang Petersen.Das Boot is an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Lothar-Günther Buchheim, who served on a German submarine as a military correspondent in late 1941. Upon its publication in 1973, the book was a bestseller, becoming the most popular World War II account in the country. The engrossing fictionalised memoir was destined for a cinematic adaptation, but it would take two failed Hollywood attmpts until production finally began in Munich in 1979, led by Petersen.While we did not get Robert Redford or Paul Newman as the Captain of U-96 (both had been considered for the part), moving the project from America to Germany provided the authenticity that would be the film's signature trait. Das Boot can be used as a direct historical reference - such was the painstaking precision of its design. The film was shot over a course of a year, with the actors gradually growing their beards, not seeing the sun, and living in conditions much like those inhabited by their characters. The sets were faithfully constructed with the use of Buchheim's photographs, and verisimilitude was sought anywhere you could find it.Das Boot owes no small part of its reputation to the credibility of its visuals, but there is much more to it. The acting - especially by Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, and Klaus Wennemann in what is, arguably, the three main parts. The ever-mounting, unbearable tension; the bravoure of the hunter; the silence kept by the prey. The claustrophobic nature of the environment and the comraderie, both forced and genuine, play their parts. As Leutnant Werner (Wennemann) gets more used to the boat and the crew, so do we. By the end of the film, there is enough shared history that emotions are stirred regardless of which side you are on.Buchheim criticised the film adaptation of his novel for its lack of anti-war sentiment. I have not read the book, so this opinion is not born out of comparison - but you cannot reach the finale of Das Boot without feeling that war is evil, despair, and meaningless cruelty.The director's cut of Das Boot, its preferred version, is 208 minutes long; and much like with Apocalypse Now (1979), the picture's duration contributes to its emotional impact. Exhaustion on screen is felt by the audience, and there is a sense of loss when it's over.",Das Boot
286,Kaleun1,The Best Movie of the 1980s!,10,13 June 2020,"I learned German in the 1970s, and lived with a family for a semester in Cologne.
I feel pretty familiar with German culture of wartime as I became acquainted (non-judgmentally) with 2 former SS officers, a former Luftwaffe Flak overseer, a Wehrmacht captain. I tried to learn as much as I could, also with several trips to Berlin.The U-Boot Waffe (Submarine Service) always interested me, my dad worked in U.S. Naval Ordnance during the war and I studied a great deal about it. The DVD is a short version of a 6 part German TV mini-series--Peterson, now a well-known director, started out in German TV.I have seen all versions--this cut is as good as any. In the submarine ""genre"" it is by far the best and most realistic. The way this was accomplished is detailed in a companion book to the film. One thing I recall, in casting, they were looking for ""ordinary-looking Germans not stars (for comparison, Bruno Ganz, who played Adolf in ""Der Untergang"" was a well-regarded stage actor).The realism in this film is astounding. We follow the highs and lows of a U-Boot crew (U-96) through several war patrols, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean.
It is an exciting action movie--although you will probably be watching it in German with subtitles. Watch it again and pay attention to the details of the sets. This was accomplished in a tank, mostly in Bavaria Studios, with excellent screenplay from the book. I can't say much more without encountering spoilers, so I will leave it at that. I did not see many movies during the 1980s when I was a graduate student, and this one left a lasting impression, motivating me to go back to Germany several times after 2002, when I learned a great deal more.

I was so engrossed in the story and finally getting an honest look at the human beings that were reluctanly fighting as part Hitler's of war machie.

290,nodialogue,perfect illusion with some thrill of authenticity,10,21 December 2009,"Back in the day I saw this movie on the big screen which pulls you into the story for the darkness in the cinema is real. Das Boot is one of the few movies going 3hours+ that is always entertaining. The perspective is very clean, you see the action unfold through the eyes of the war correspondent on the boat. This war correspondent is a person in the real world, the story is autobiographic. As a spectator your level of knowledge is the knowledge of the people on board, this is how the suspense lasts all those three hours. Adding to the suspense even more is the use of sounds which are naturally dominant in submarine without any windows, no visual connection to the outside world when under sea. What sets this film apart is also the variety and large number of characters portrayed as their thought and feelings show by their action and faces, Maybe comparable to ""12 angry men"" . Most of the time you do not know their names, maybe their job on the submarine. Nevertheless I predict that any viewer can identify any man on board. I recommend watching this film German with subtitles for non-speakers for the military way of speaking is accurate, I assume a foreigner would get this as well, it adds to the authenticity. Clearly the film centers around the submarine which by its technology determines all activities, the action and most important the roles the people find themselves in as soldiers. These roles are their lives as soon as they leave the port. Clearly the submarine comes first, the people second, the machine is their means survival and weapon to kill others as well. As for the Nazi ideology the submarine also serves as a refuge from the nazi-society on land. Another core conflict of the men on board is they need to kill fellow seamen. The film does a good job in making the viewer understand this drama without ever resorting to some style of argumentation, it is all in the pictures. As for the story there is no obvious red line. The submarine follows military orders and reacts to enemy attacks. No single crew-member could possibly interfere with this. It is finest cinema, you are pulled into the screen, you have the illusion of darkness, even smells. The film is a perfect illusion with some thrill of authenticity. This film never attempts to tell you anything, because you are in the submarine like everyone else.",Das Boot

The viewer get a close and personal feel for what these crews went through, how they felt, and what they had to go through to serve their insane Government. Wolfgang Peterson did a fantastic job directing this movie, and the cast was top notch to carry this out the way it needed to be. Do not expect a high action movie, it has its action, but that is not what this movie is. Be ready for a movie that is long, drawn out, and sometimes tedious to watch, it is well worth every minute of it.

It is an incredibly acted film, with a simple but empathetic and touching story. The ending is brutal and apotheosic. The effects are stylish and elegant, even to this day the film looks very well done: the submarine, the exteriors, the explosions, the floods, absolutely everything looks real. The only problem for me was that the version I watched is too long: more than three and a half hours. That's too much for a movie in which not much happens, not much dialogue revolves around a plot, and it happens in nearly one location. Maybe if I had watched the two and a half hour version it would have been easier to enjoy, but even though I'm used to movies that run longer than 160 minutes, this one didn't suit the length.

294,n-bogdanovic,Here You can see what war means,10,5 May 2006,"For me the atmosphere of a film is the most important thing. Pictures go directly to the brain. They create the atmosphere. In a lucky chance it goes hand in hand with the story, the actors, technique and last not least the music that approximate this. As a child I watched Star Wars in cinema (though I wasn't allowed to, I went in there with my father) and in a blink of a second I was sure that it was the best film of the universe. I don't know if I kept my mouth shut even for a second. Today it relativized a little bit, but a film that touches me at best for most of the term is outstanding in my view. I think I can only say something to the atmosphere of this film when I made my military service. Now I got a slight idea of what those poor men went through. All they said and thought seems so realistic. Heroic behavior occurred maybe at the beginning but that was kept them out of mischief during the turn and as far the submarine sank we came to see the characters of humans in extreme situations. On the other hand there was an inhuman and megalomaniac system that was far away, though, but reached with it's cold fingers into the last corner of the boat and the soldiers had to face the music the Nazis engaged. The outer circumstances that describe the time remind me of the master work Tin Drum and I just believe that the description is well. The music is congenial. All in all it is an intense warning.

That is what makes this film as important as it is riveting. You will experience what life was like for those who served on submarines during the war, many of whom were just teenagers. It was a life lived in dim lighting for months at a time. A life lived in close, cramped quarters with no privacy whatsoever. A life where anxiety and fear were ever-present.

302,LovetheBombFilms,Near Masterpiece,9,23 December 2013,"Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 German war film, Das Boot, is the longest film I've seen in two years. I watched the director's cut which runs 209 minutes and doesn't even compare with the five hour mini-series version. Luckily for me Das Boot manages its running time perfectly and delivers one of the most suspenseful film experiences I've had in a long time. Das Boot's running time consists of drawn out suspense sequences interspersed with down-time, where the crew takes measures to deal with their boredom. Considering how entertaining these down-time sequences were I can certainly imagine Das Boot successfully running longer than it does. The suspense sequences are excellent as well. There are so many things that can go wrong on a submarine and Das Boot uses them all in fantastic intersecting patterns. The sub is trying to hide from a destroyer and drops down to the deep. So deep, it seems, that the pressure will crush the boat like a tin can. The crew strain themselves in their tortured anxiety. Boom! A depth charge rocks the sub. Das Boot is filled with moments like this. A real U-Boat interior was used in Das Boot. The camera work in this extremely limited space is profound. It dances around the men as they bustle and sweat, forming every shot perfectly. At first I was impressed with the interior motion of the set as the boat rocked back and forth. Later on the use of water gushing from every direction set a new standard for realism. Complementing the realistic set are the actors. Wonderful performances all around. The actors were able to convey an immense amount of strain in stressful situations where they were required to remain quiet. Man is a weak and fragile creature. However he is able to erect complex systems that allow him to manipulate his environment with extreme force. A submarine is one of those systems. However this is a double-edged sword because when that system fails and man is once again reduced to his weak and fragile state it can be impossible to rebuild it, especially when he's stuck on the bottom of the Strait of Gibraltar. The film's finale is the superlative representation of the stress that the U-Boat crew faces. They are running out of oxygen, there are injured men, enemies above them, their depth goes off the meter, water is flooding in, and the damn boat won't work like it's supposed to! Horrible death seems imminent. However through great resourcefulness and hours of hard work the crew are able to see the sun once more. What a glorious feeling that is, for the audience as well as the characters. Das Boot is not about a cast of characters. It is about a boat. Maybe that's why it doesn't matter so much that the men whose story we are watching fight for Hitler. Das Boot is a near masterpiece worthy of being rewatched many times despite its great length.",Das Boot
303,AdamKey,An Interesting Combination of Genres,10,11 June 2003,"As a former US Navy STS3 (third class submarine sonar tech) I remain convinced (along with the other ""bubbleheads"" who have posted here) that ""Das Boot"" is to date, far and away the best ""submarine film"" ever. Unlike this one, most films of this genre are not true ""submarine films,"" but either dramas, comedies or political thrillers where the submarine is a mere prop, a backdrop.In ""Das Boot,"" the characters are well developed and subtly varied, and the camaraderie among is not forced or self-conscious, but is simple and straightforward and flows from the shared experiences of being underway and in close quarters. The submarine itself is the main character, the entire crew ""becomes"" the sub and all action and meaning follows from that. Moreover, the differences between the captain and the ""Number 1"" (executive officer) character are quite believable, #1 almost satirically but perfectly reflected as the-insufferably-ambitious-jerk-who-is-already-planning-his-post -military-political-campaign.Juergen Prochnow's character as the captain is quite compelling. His moody and long stares, economy of words and the pensive air surrounding him him coexist well within his firm and able but low-key leadership style. The sea and its awesome power and wonder mean more to him than anything and his humility (and his humanity) seems in large part drawn from his seafaring experience which long predates the war.The air of pervasive fatalism that surrounds the U96 no matter what happens touches well upon a little recognized fact that the German Kriegsmarine (Navy) was, in contrast to the other branches of the German military in WWII, all but ignored; this disdain stemming largely from Hitler's utter lack of serious knowledge or interest in the role of sea power in warfare.Hence, the U96's enemy is not really the Royal Navy's destroyers or patrol planes, rather it is its own command in Berlin under whose orders it ostensibly operates, and, at a deeper level, the power of an unforgiving sea and each sailor's own fears. The captain's anger over not receiving any orders, his vocal ridicule of Hermann Goering and his blank, almost contemptuous stares at the small photo of Admiral Karl Doenitz are thus all quite in character. The U96 and the other boats have been, for all practical purposes, mere pesky details the Fuehrer has already written off and so the physical isolation of the U96 crew is thus compounded with a very real sense of abandonment, not even allowed the simple victory of mere survival, which makes the sailors' tragic fate that much more poignant.Although I am no film critic, I get the impression that the director (Wolfgang Petersen) had a great appreciation and knowledge of the cinematic techniques of Akira Kurosawa as well as of Russian filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky and of great familiarity with classic English war dramas like ""Sink the Bismarck."" His Kurosawa-like portrayal of the often baffling nature of human behavior in various situations, the Russian literary theme of the individual facing the colossal power of nature (in this case, the sea) and the meticulous attention to detail, continuity and realistic characterization representing the best of British cinema are all apparent here.",Das Boot
304,pagblonk,how to survive on a German submarine in WWII,9,1 April 2008,"Frightening. That was the first thing that came to my mind. A submarine had always been a floating coffin in my mind. When I saw the film for the first time, this image was confirmed. One can hardly imagine anything more frightening than being on a submarine when it is being attacked. There are at least two film versions and 2 TV series. I prefer the director's cut film, which lasts about 3.5 hours. The cast show us exactly what life on a submarine meant. The boredom at sea when they can't find enemy ships and the terrifying attacks when faced with depth charges. The film is based on true experiences on submarine U-96 and a book, written by Lothar-Günther Bluchheim. He later criticized the film for not being totally true to the book. Well, so be it. The film is what it's all about and if you're really interested in life on a sub, you will just have to see it. If you suffer from claustrophobia, this film will undoubtedly make it worse.

It is a piece of art , more than a commercial movie,and that is what makes Petersen such a good director in this film.I felt I was at that submarine together with those heroic sailors. It's true that they were fighting for the wrong side,but that was the real war.Those men were human beings trying to survive in a war they couldn't understand,but they fought for their country,families and honor. I never saw such a realistic war film.The closest was Saving Private Ryan.Also Prochnow was great and the rest of the cast,too. Congratulations to Wolfgang Petersen!!!!",Das Boot

It'll actually make you admire/feel sympathy for the German Serviceman caught up, in what was the most horrific of wars. Tense, realistic and gripping this one off has yet to be bettered in my opinion. The start doesn't really remind you of a war movie but believe me thats armed forces behaviour all right. As WW2 progressed Hitler drew on ever younger recruits and the historical accuracies are in abundance for a change. This film makes modern junk like the new Pearl harbour look limp wristed.As shocking as the statistics are (30000 out of 40000 never returned) It makes you wonder why so many young men volunteered for the Untersee boot 'Kreigsmarine'. Pride and patriotism counts for everything. Its a 10 out of 10 for me.Don't take my word for it. Watch it.",Das Boot

This is one of the Great War movies made not to glorify the means but to highlight its futility.The movie was well directed, and well acted.  The scenes make you suffer from claustrophobia and the pinging was just as agonizing. You will feel the pain of the crew in their effort to stay afloat and/or stay down 200 meters below the sea surface eluding depth charges.This is a profound movie and very real, not one of those anti-german films against war which as real as the TV series ""Combat.""

310,neilpollock,Claustrophobic,6,21 January 2001,"There have been many good films examining the useless and barbaric reality of war.  For Cannon Fodder 101 I recommend Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket, as well as The Thin Red Line, Gallipoli, the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, as well as the epic television series by Ken Burns on the American Civil War and the BBC series on The Great War.  Add Dr Strangelove for some light relief.Having just seen Das Boot in 2001 on DVD, I'm very pleased to add it to the list.  What makes this a very good film is: * The depiction of warfare as composing of long periods of boredom and anxiety followed by short bursts of terrifying action.  The Thin Red Line presented similar imagery. * Its reluctance to show people as heroes.  The U-boat crew were well disciplined professionals rather than the individualist risk takers who are so boringly strutted out by Hollywood studios (refer Saving Private Ryan). * Evocation of the claustrophobic world of the submarine which those ""up periscope"" movies of my youth never captured.  [I once started to tour a sub. in Sydney Harbour and just couldn't handle the claustrophobic conditions]. * Attention to the fact that war is a time of rapid technological change. The U-boat war was being lost because the British has developed technologies to better track and destroy them.The film worked well with senses.  I felt I could almost smell the stench of men living in such close proximity; could appreciate the slow asphyxiation of men stalled on the bottom of the sea; the cold wetness of the North Atlantic; the amplification of sound under water; and the limitation of vision from a submarine; the pressure of water on metal at untested depths.It was also good to see Germans as Germans, rather than Nazis.That said I found the ending disappointing (I saw the Director's cut). The final two events stretched credulity. However I understand the book is based on true events.  Perhaps this is a case of truth being stranger than fiction.I read somewhere that 75% of the U-boat men never returned.  This movie shows why.",Das Boot

People in certain professions don't like to watch movies about those professions (Doctors and Nurses shy away from hospital dramas, for example). Submarine sailors are different. We love to watch every submarine movie ever made, from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination: Tokyo"" to ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"". Why? Because we can always use a good laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. Except this one. After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously.

317,aaron611,An absolutely brilliant film,10,23 January 2002,"Das Boot is a truly refreshing war film in that it does not use special effects as a crutch.  Seemingly, the majority of modern films utilize phenomenal special effects to ""entertain"" (or possibly ""insult"") the viewer in an effort to hide a weak script.Das Boot is an exception.The exterior shots are held to a minimum, thus giving you a sense of actually being on board with the crew.  You see what they see.  You feel what they feel.  You truly get a sense for what it must have been like to live in such close quarters while enduring the monotony, terror, and conflicted emotions that were common among U-boat crews.At 3 1/2 hours (the Director's Cut), this film isn't for everyone.  But if you are a dedicated film fanatic, this is a must see.  I had no problem with the length since every scene had a purpose in developing the characters and building the story.  The acting and directing are superb and the newly remastered sound on the Director's Cut DVD is fantastic (remember: in a submarine, sound is everything).Be sure to switch the DVD to the original German language with English subtitles.  The English dubbing didn't look too bad but it would ruin the authenticity of the film, in my opinion.",Das Boot

It takes the fun out of seeing decent sub-movies like U-571 when you've seen the movie (Das Boot) that the director was probably studying when he made that one (U-571), like, fer sure, ya know? Bad grammar aside, the sets are incredible, the fact that the actors and scenes were filmed in the order that they occur (so the facial hair is real), the sickly pale looks of the actors, living in the sub for hours and days on end, and the gripping humanistic drama of sailors in Der Fuhrer's Navy, this rather long movie is definitely worth the time spent.

320,bassjim,A masterpiece which should be required viewing,10,23 December 2002,"I was fourteen when this film was released, and even then, I remember hearing how wonderful it was.  Watching a foreign film at that age was out of the question, though!  Now, twenty-one years and several foreign films later, I finally saw this film.  To say that it did not disappoint in the least is a grossly unfair understatement..I watched the director's cut DVD, and I can't imagine shaving anything from this version without the impact being felt, so my advice is to watch this version if possible.  Another benefit of this version is the remastered sound; while I usually wince when a movie's sound is listed as one of its chief merits (I would hope that, oh, PLOT might be more important!), sound is absolutely vital to the enormous impact this movie gives the viewer. Whether it's the thunderous explosion of enemy depth charges bombarding the sub or the nail-biting silence of the crew as they try to determine the whereabouts of their enemy, sound is of paramount importance to this story. Those of you with Dolby digital systems will not be disappointed.So, what about character development and plot?  No film is worth watching without those elements, and Wolfgang Peterson and his team fully grasped this.  There must be at least twenty minutes of film before the crew even steps aboard the sub, and during this time, we are being introduced to the captain and his crew.  The crew are predominantly men in name only.  They are, for all intents and purposes, boys, and that fact is a major theme throughout the film, as we watch their gleeful boyhood faces turn to those of terrified older men as they see what war really is.  By the end of the movie, you know and care about these people, despite the fact that they are (let's face it) our enemies from a war most of us never lived.  We never see them as Nazis, or even Germans for that matter; had Peterson delved right into the sub without giving these characters the depth (no pun intended) they deserve, we wouldn't feel the tensions that they feel during the story.and make no mistake, you will feel them.  The plot?  The less I say, the better the movie will be for you.  Suffice to say, being on a U-boat must be like the phrase I heard describing what it is like being an anesthesiologist: 99% boredom combined with 1% sheer terror.  The percentages are altered in this movie for obvious reasons, but you get to experience both.  What's amazing is that even the slow points of the film are nothing less than riveting.At three and a half hours and with its being subtitled, most people wouldn't touch this movie with a stick.  What a shame.  At the time of my writing, this is number 37 on imdb's lit of all time films.  That should be enough to convince anyone to see this.  Enjoy!",Das Boot

322,heaven-heaven,Probably The Best War Movie Ever Made!,10,18 February 2006,"(There may be some elements in this review which constitute plot-spoilers). I saw the full length ""Director's Cut"" and thank god it wasn't the dubbed version. This film has to be seen in its full length to be fully appreciated as a true masterpiece and dubbing only serves to take away some of the impact of the dialogue.The director handles matters from an entirely balanced view and shows the submariners aboard the u-boat as being both heroes and cowards as they swing from hunters to hunted. There is one scene where the captain views a convoy from a distance and almost leisurely takes aim and sinks boats with a callous and cold professionalism. One can't help feeling that the men in the u-boat are firing upon defenceless victims who have no chance of defending themselves, but moments later, the u-boat is under what seems like an immediate attack from a destroyer and suddenly the hunters become the prey. As the movie progresses it is hard not to feel sympathetic towards the crew of the u-boat and it is almost impossible not to see them as victims.The film ultimately stands as a bold and brilliantly crafted portrayal of the futility of war. There is one discussion between the captain and his second in command which I can remember quite vividly. The captain explains that the u-boat cannot be sunk by the sea which is an obvious expression of the fact that the boat is designed to dive and surface at will, but his comment from the captain also implies that although the sea cannot sink the submarine, everything that the enemy has at their disposal is designed to hunt down and destroy the u-boat.If you are a fan of submarine films and there are lots of them (Red October and Crimson Tide - to name but a few) then you should seriously consider watching Das Boot. It lacks the gloss and glamour of other films of this type and concentrates on the hardship of the crew and the almost squalid conditions in which they are forced to live.The end is one of the most powerful scenes in any war movie and points to the fact that in the end everything that men do in war is pointless and without any honour or heroism. At the end of the movie I thought ""what was the point in any of that"", and then it hit me that that was precisely the reaction the director was after.By the way, U-boat stands for: ""under sea boat"" and I don't know how true it is, but I heard that one of the full size models used in Das Boot was used again in Raiders Of The Lost Arc.",Das Boot
323,TheMark,DVD At Its Best!,10,29 December 1999,"I am an avid DVD collector, and, up to this point, I haven't found any better than the Director's Cut of DAS BOOT.  Make it one of the first DVDs you rent or (better yet) buy.  It is the  total experience, complete with tremendous sound effects that create the tension and paranoia of being in a submarine that is viciously and randomly bombed from above.  Never have I heard scarier or more realistic use of sound.  And as for the acting, it's a surprise that Jurgen Prochnow hasn't become a bigger star in the U.S.  His presence as the revered Captain of this U-Boat is something to behold. Wolfgang Petersen went on to direct action films in America, such as ""In the Line of Fire"" and ""Air Force One"", but none were as intensely realistic as this one.  Both technically and historically, ""Das Boot"" is an experience you will not forget.  Luckily, most DVDs contain the restored, re-mastered 3-hour+ Director's Cut, and, as many previous reviews have mentioned, it is never boring.  Make it the first foreign film or DVD you've seen, if you've never seen one, and make it your next if you have.",Das Boot

325,whitikau,Fresh young men are transformed by the terrors and inhumanities of war whilst on board a German WWII submarine.,10,1 May 2000,"One of the best movies I have ever seen.It tells the story, based on a factual account by a German war correspondent, of a German submarine during World War Two, where most of the sailors are fresh new recruits looking forward to making their first kill as their seasoned captain leads them in search of British ships crossing the Atlantic.This film starts with fresh eager faces, clean and well-fed yet hungry for blood, and, over the course of the film, shows their transformations to bearded crabs-infested faces furrowed with the terrors and inhumanities of war.Although this is a German movie on board a German submarine, the messages it relays to us apply to all peoples of all nationalities. The sailors are shown as losing their faith in their leaders, as being sickened and horrified by the war they are forced to fight.The suspense in this movie is second to none. Brilliantly done! Using diagresis almost exclusively lends itself to an incredible level of suspense, as we sit and wait with the crew, lying helpless on the bottom of the sea, hoping that the British destroyers above won't find us and blast us yet again with the dreaded depth charges, as the crew desperately tries to repair their boat as their air runs out. The acting is superb, the screenplay is superb, the direction is superb... the only fault I find is that three hours (I watched the Director's Cut) seemed far too short!Highly recommended - definitely in my top ten!",Das Boot
326,john.brady,An essay in suspense,9,11 December 2005,"Adapted from a mini-series, Das Boot ranks not just as one of the best war films, but one of the best suspense films of all time.Apart from some scene-setting at the start, Director Wolfgang Peterson centres all the action on the U-boat itself. The crew are cut off, with only the pings of sonar and the creaks from the hull to connect them to the outside world. They are trapped in a cramped, claustrophobic tube, a million miles from the cavernous interiors normally portrayed in submarine films. This is a submarine where people sleep 2 to a cot; where supplies litter the interior; where water sluices across the floor; where the sweat and fear is palpable.The crew are portrayed as professionals doing a job. These are not Nazi zealots, but cynical and hardened to their job. In one telling scene, the U-boat retreats from a recently torpedoed convoy, dooming its crew to certain death. Jurgen Prochnow's restrained performance shows that he has no choice, and that this choice is not a happy one. The only Nazi zealot amongst the crew (an SS intelligence officer and ex-Hitler Youth leader) is soon subdued and eventually proves his worth. (The other officers tease him by singing along to Allied crowd-pleasers like ""A long way to Tipperary"").The photography is superb, with a steadicam ranging up and down the sub in a way that conveys just how small and cramped it is.There are some standout set-pieces, where the submarine is under depth-charge attack from British destroyers. These rank as some of the most suspenseful sequences every committed to film - expertly acted, edited, and with breath-taking sound design. You will share in the crew's horror as the U-boat plummets to the bottom, with rivets popping and engines dead.The film spends a remarkable amount of time on character development. The clean-cut crew soon become haggard and tense; one key character snaps and derelicts his duty, risking court-martial; there is a sense of what each crew member has lost in the war. There is a jarring sequence where the U-boat sneaks into a neutral port to resupply from a German merchant vessel, and these gaunt and dirty ghosts are invited to a feast; their contempt for the self-satisfied merchant officers is palpable.There are few weaknesses. The visual effects don't match up to the rest of the production and are occasionally distracting. The ending is abrupt and rather shocking.Not just a must-see, but a film that bears repeated viewings.",Das Boot
327,lutefisk,Das Best,10,24 August 2000,"Quite simply the best war film ever made. Das Boot nearly got made in the United States, with Robert Redford (!) in the starring role as the submarine's captain. Thank goodness it didn't; instead it went to a German production company with the then largely unknown Wolfgang Petersen and Jurgen Prochnow directing and starring respectively.Petersen brings an obsessive level of detail to the screen, recreating the U-boat down to quite literally the last rivet and creating an extraordinary sense of claustrophobia - I've never experienced anything quite like it in the cinema. The effect is greatly enhanced by the sound, which is up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of convincing you that you're in the middle of a battle. It really has to be experienced in a cinema, although you might get away with using a really good sound system at home (get the DVD Director's Cut version for this).Even more remarkable is the cast. Prochnow is the highlight, of course, as the quietly heroic captain of the boat. But the rest of the cast - largely stage actors appearing on screen for the first time, or complete unknowns - are equally remarkable: Erwin Leder (in his first appearance on screen) is a standout as the veteran Chief Engineer, Johann, who faces a crisis of courage when the boat comes under attack. There really isn't a single performance that you can fault.So is there anything actually *wrong* with Das Boot? Some of the external shots are distinctly unconvincing, quite obviously being of model ships and projected backdrops. (Blame that on film technology circa 1981). The film does have a tendency to drag a bit in a few places - the section where the crew go ashore in Vigo is a case in point. Above all, steer well clear of the dubbed version, even though the dubbing into English is done by many of the original cast - this is a film which absolutely must be seen in the original German (with subtitles).However, these are minor quibbles when the rest of the film is so good. There are very few films that I would instantly rate a 10, but this is one of them.",Das Boot
328,tonyle,War is hell - and that's all you really need to know,10,20 October 2000,"Das Boot is by far one of the greatest war movies ever made. The thing that makes this movie so wonderful is its truthfulness - especially that it had the audacity to present WWII Germans as real human beings. In addition, rather than portraying war with the typical feel-good sugar-coated glory, bravery, honor, etc., it portrays war for all it really is: a twisted, terrifying experience that no person should ever have to face. Indeed, Das Boot is masterful at showing how the zeal and enthusiasm of young men (practically boys) slowly erode with each passing day spent in this filthy, humid sardine can they are forced to call home during their tour of duty.The Director's Cut is a fantastic piece of work. The battle scenes especially feature extended, masterfully done tension-building sequences. Often, little more than silence and facial expression heighten the drama, drawing the viewer further and further into the waiting game - Is the enemy ship gone? Is the next depth charge about to explode? Many of the greatest moments in the film occur when these men utter not a single word.In his DVD audio commentary, Wolfgang Petersen tells of how a couple of Hollywood deals fell through before his team finally decided to make a real German epic in ""the German way."" Thank heaven that Hollywood didn't get a chance to taint the story with some fluffy pro-American slant that would've defocused the whole point of this film: War is hell - and that's all you really need to know. My hat goes off to him, his crew, and his actors for their commitment in producing one of finest examples of quality filmmaking in existence.",Das Boot

I was astonished, shocked and left with a bitter taste of what the War really was. A waste of souls and lives of too many young people. These people had dreams, ambitions, hopes that are gloriously reflected in this film. All those virtues are shattered under the burden of the job they do. It does not matter that the story is narrated from the side of Germany. The same is true for the troops of every side. Everything, direction, acting, sound effects and editing, musicis perfect and in tune in this movie. There are no loose ends here. The viewer immediately gets in the shoes of the Captain. The most enigmatic and dramatic figure of the film greatly acted by Jurgen Prochnow. He is a soldier and always knows what his job is, but inside him he also knows that this job is, at times, a dirty, risky and non-righteous one. All in all, the best (anti) War movie ever.

330,whendeicidelives,Masterpiece,10,10 January 2007,"This film will grab you from the opening shot and suck you into its grim, realistic portrayal of life aboard a German U-Boat. If your looking for 'gung-ho' action then i'm pleased to say you'll be grandly disappointed. W.P (the director) and the actors have captured pure tension, absolute horror and genuine fear with alarming accuracy. It feels like your watching the 'real thing', not a movie. (And if, like me, you have to watch the subtitled version, this feels even more so! Note: Avoid the dubbed version, it ruins any suspense as the 'acting' is abysmal!)Characterisation is wonderful in this film, the change in each man as their voyage becomes ever more doomed is gripping. Because of the films length, you can really experience why characters act as they do, their motivations and changing mental states are utterly believable and adds to the films substance. Every time a depth charge drops, you can smell the sweat coming off the foreheads of the actors, and thats testament just as much to the cinematography as the acting. You feel like your on board the boat. Just watching the men on board move around gives the viewer a sense of just how cramped conditions were, and this heightens the overall sense of isolation they must have felt. (For the most part) they have no contact with the outside world, just the guts of the boat and what their instruments and sounds tell them.All in all, a far superior war film to say, the likes of Saving Private Ryan, which although employing skilled techniques and creative cinematography, forgot to motivate and 'humanise' its characters. D.B illustrates how effective good acting, directing and intelligent writing can combine (without the need for 'Hollywood' production values) to produce a moving, powerful masterpiece of a film that will live long in the memory.",Das Boot
331,ArgonautV4,Far and away the best submarine movie in history,10,10 June 2001,"Sound effects. Acting. Visuals. Action. REALISM. ""Das Boot"" has 'em all, and it has 'em all in spades. This is Wolfgang Petersen and Jurgen Prochnow at their best--they haven't done anything since then that can hold a candle to this. Right below ""Das Boot"" on my top-submarine-movies list are ""U-571"" and ""The Enemy Below"", but nothing surpasses the drama, the tension, or the message of ""Das Boot."" Oh, and the music ain't too shabby, either.I've enjoyed almost every submarine movie I've ever seen. Run Silent, Run Deep was great, but its battle scenes have nothing on Das Boot. Crimson Tide and Red October were tense and suspenseful to be sure, but not quite as riveting. I still can't get up during The Enemy Below, but it's not half as realistic. For all the three and a half hours that the director's cut of Das Boot runs, there's something in every scene that I just can't miss. I'm also impressed by the equipment that was used, the amount of trouble the producers went to for a better production. Any director, American or German, would be hard pressed to make a better movie about submarines or war.Small spoiler here: What I found intriguing was the date. The blurb at the beginning states that the movie begins in November, 1941. During all the talk about Christmas near the end, it suggests that the movie ends in late December. You might think that during that time, there would be word of the United States entering the war, but no no no; the crew is that isolated from the rest of the world. The movie is that realistic.So there it is, folks, the pinnacle of big-screen submarining and war drama. Make yourself comfortable!",Das Boot

The speech of each character is curt and to the point, and although the director's cut is long, every scene advances the story in some way. And the story is incredible. From the first minute of blackout drunkenness to the sinking, and the recovery, you will be on your seat. And ultimately, Peterson forces you to rue the forces that have led to the institution of war. It is an epic of its class, a more modernized Moby Dick, with the white whale of survival ever elusive.

334,h-breckmann,"Das Boot, a movie how wars are without the heroes",10,23 March 2009,"I think Das Boot is a realistic movie about the crew of a German U-Boot (Unterseeboot = under sea boat) without heroism. The crew: not clean men with beards, of course are afraid to be killed by destroyers and planes. HQ is so demanding which causes them to become cynics. They are doing their job, being soldiers, but do not really trust the chaotic orders they get.German U-boats like Germans panzer's (PzKw-Tiger) were feared by the allies, and had to be destroyed, but this movie shows there are two sides of a war. A war also can become bizarre: suddenly these dirty men are invited for an expensive dinner and appear well dressed and clean, probably still smelling to diesel.European movies not always have happy ends and/of love stories in them as real life often has not either: Ladri di Biciclette, The Wicker Man (1973).

335,mynameismud,one of the most important war films ever!,9,29 January 2003,"For those who haven't had the privalege of viewing this movie,simply need to.Its a different and truly compelling look at World War II through the eyes (and ears) of crewmen aboard a German U-boat.Typically,big budget WWII epics in American cinema are almost always shown through the eyes of American soldiers,but this is a look at war from the German point of view (the film is also entirely in german and was made by a German Production team)and gives the viewer a new understanding of life in a submarine,and life in the midst of a great war.The film is not focused on Allies vs. Axis Powers or Americans vs. Nazis,its about all the basic conflicts in story-telling.Man vs. Man, Man vs. Nature, and Man vs. Himself.It's not just a bunch of Germans in a boat,its men fighting for survival and their country and trying to achieve personal glory and pride as war heroes.Their hopes are quickly shatterd as they suffer through extreme physical and psychological hardship in the claustrophobic containment of thier submarine.You begin to find yourself completely engulfed in the suspense as you view this film especially with the newly remixed soundtrack for the Director's cut which is also about a full hour longer.With A running time of about 3 hours and 48 min. i loved every second of it.Every performance is top notch especially that of the new Lt.Werner who I really enjoyed watching.He doesn't say a large amount,but his intense silences and facial features speak for him.The part of the hard,war worn Captain is masterfully portraid by Jurgen Prochnow and is also a true highlight of the film.This is also an extremely large achievement for director Wolfgang Peterson who's vision has created a true war classic and essential for any moviegoer.War movie fan or not,it is a must-see.Its look at people in a time of extreme pressure and fear puts you on the edge of your seat not wanting to turn away.I highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to read subtitles for almost four hours and experience the truly magnificent cinematic achievement that is ""Das Boot.""",Das Boot

(The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend ""entries."") Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow's pained blue eyes. When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine. I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time. How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level. To say this film is ""powerful"" seems so weak a description.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction. So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images. Too much. These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level. Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen. Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"". It is reality, not a grand concept. The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.Story is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10. One of the all-time greatest films.",Das Boot

It shows the dreadful and terrifying conditions of your standard German U-Boat. They are 150 feet long and 10 feet wide. Soldiers or Sailers have to request permission to pass by in which the officers would stand up and let them pass. However, the horrors of battle make the walls of the tight walls seem a bit tighter every minute. To the point of bolts exploding and the ship sinking.

Unlike so many war films it does not make heros of one side and villains of the other instead it focuses on the the emotions of the crew and how each one goes from being exhilarated in one moment to terrified in the next. The acting is absolutely first class the characters totally believable and although u do not get to completely identify each of them you really do start to imagine what life on board a WWII u-boat in the latter part of the war must have been like. The sense of fear and anxiety is their for u 2 see in the eyes of these sailors whose faces are covered with a mix of sweat and oil The absolute horror on their faces when they test the sub to depths beyond that of the original trials: just gripping! For me at least this is definitely one of the most realistic war-films ever and also probably the best.,Das Boot
340,fareedwattoo,(Misery and sufferings of humans in War),9,17 September 2019,"No external factor has caused more harm to humans than they themselves. Since the very beginning war has considered been the must existing and cardinal part of human lives. Humans never stopped spilling blood, sometime for religion, sometime for land, sometime for prestige and sometime for nationalism. All of us chose exchange of blood for petty issues, lovers of God in the form of Crusades, the kings for pieces of lands to rule, some to maintain colonies to engulf natural resources of other fellow-beings and some in the modern world for the sake of nationalism. In all the forms, each time under different banners humans subdued humans.
In this movie, Wolfgang Peterson (director) tried to depict the miseries, sorrows, sufferings and agonies of those who suffered perniciously in the World War. The sordid war affected all the people without any difference on the both sides.
This movie revolves around a group of navy soldiers who were to live in a sub-marine for a specific time to destroy the opposite's vessels. Sufferings and suffocations of the crew and the viewer begins as the sub-marine dive into the water for the very first time. The stingy metal walls of the sub-marine where one can hardly move, the bunker where they sleep, the dining table where one hardly fits and all other places cause irremovable imprint on one's.
Many people have to suffer for the monstrous dream of a few bigots and warmongers. They live their lives in opulent palaces, having fresh beers, soft fresh breads, sleep in nicely woven clothes and served by uncountable servants. While in the pursuit of their dreams common-people live in dungeons, eat stale rancid food, take bath in sweat and sleep in blood with dirt surrounded by the piles of half damaged stinking bodies of their mates.
Morality, customs and norms of civilized society vanish from the instinct of veteran's minds. In the whole movie, no polite word of thanks, welcome or greeting has used. The rule of kill or get killed prevails in the battleground. Humans turn into friend and foes recognised on the base of uniform and flags instead of their morality and goodwill. Fires of bullets may stop on winning or losing the war but its effects haunt both the victorious and the losers until their last breath.
Therefore, we can conclude that this movie has successfully portrayed the impeccable picture of doleful and destitute people who suffered through war. Unbiased picture of war in this movie depicts the grim situation of the war torn people. Narrow walls of sub-marine, sultry atmosphere, high waves of sea and unfavourable weather has helped to portray the exact tormented situation. Either party of the war can win or lose it but humanity always loses.

The style and sets put you inside a real German U-boat. It is amazing. And the 5.1 soundtrack on the DVD helps to make the viewer feel like he/she is in the middle of the action.

350,sonofcohen,Action sans Action,10,9 August 2001,"U-571 opens with a scene copped directly from Das Boot.  Imitation is the highest form of flattery.  U-571 pales by comparison.User review after user review comments on how this is one of the best war/anti-war films of all time.  It is.  Review after review comments on the chilling scene where the Germans have no choice but to watch their enemies choose between burning and drowning to death.  It's a scene which will stay with me forever.  Review after review comments on the end.  The combined travailles and ultimate fate of the main characters makes this one of the most depressing films ever.  It's worth it.What seems to be missed is the mastery of the scene that Jonathan Mostow borrowed from Wolfgang Petersen - and what he missed.
The German U-boat at the height of victory - after sinking an Allied supply boat - is suddenly put upon by an Allied destroyer.  They dive.  The Allies drop charges on them.  They run silent and dive further... and further beyond their safe depth limit... WAY beyond it.  The boat creaks horrifically.  More charges.  More depth.Petersen puts the audience in the same place as the German navy men.  He deprives us of any sound save the exploding charges (and really they don't go off that often) creaking of the submarine and the whispers of the sailors (and few of them.)  The men don't move.  They sit in place.  Where are they going to go?  It's a submarine!  We never see the destroyer after the U-boat dives.  We know it's there....  It keeps dropping depth charges on us - I mean them.It goes on forever.  The entire sequence must be 20 minutes long or longer. And, in a sense, nothing happens.  It's brilliant.  The tension is amazing. It's one of the most gripping action sequences in cinema and nothing happens.  There is NO action - only sound and the lack of it.  The fact that it seems to go on forever only makes the suspense more intense.By contrast, Mostow shows us too much.  We see outside the boat, the charges going off.  It loses something in the translation (so to speak.)Speaking of translation... I'd like to add that while the subtitled version makes a firmer impact, this is a film (and there are few) that has a very well realised dubbed version available.  Little is lost by seeing the english version.",Das Boot

352,jajambojajambo,(spoiler?) Excellent movie any way you look at it...,10,23 July 2001,"A good story which tells us that there are nothing to gain from a war. Everybody loses, especially the ones who actually fought and perished. Although the original 6-hr series would probably show better characters development, the 3.5-hr director's cut does a fine job.  We get to know many of the characters and feel for them. The Kapitän is a rock!  Talk about a tough dude!  Yet he is compassionate and he handles crisises very well.  He does not always agree with the propaganda spread by the Nazi, and he's not afraid to show contempt. However, he knows his role as a captain, and he must follow orders given from above -- even if it meant certain death. The best scene is when he felt sorry the drowning British sailors.  I guess the Germans in general are a bit apologetic about WWII, and it is shown through the captain's emotion. We can also notice the changes in the sailors throughout the journey.  From boys to men, and from solders blinded by excitement and propaganda to men realising what the war really meant. As many of us have thought that the German subs were invincible, we were shown how, in contrary, easy they were detected and attacked.  And remember this: 40.000 were to board the U-Boats, 30.000 never returned.  (pretty chilling). I give this movie a 10/10.",Das Boot

For example: You would expect this movie to be English spoken with a German accent, think again, finally someone who gets the point that German should be spoken in German.

It is impossible not to imagine that you will share in the fate of the crew, and the idea is terrifying. One can not help but wonder how men could endure such conditions knowing that they faced almost certain death.This film can not be taken lightly-- it will, and should, provoke reflection on the terrible waste that is war. At the height of the ""happy time"" the Grey Wolves were sinking more tonnage than could be produced by the United States and Canada. It wasn't until the construction of Liberty ships reached its peak that we began to break even. Do not forget the terrible toll on the brave crews of the Merchant Marine and Navy who faced dangers and terrors every bit as horrible as the ones faced by the U-Boat crew.

With an extreme level of detail, interpretation intense and dramatic set coherently built, Das Boot accurately presents the frightening reality of German fighters confined in Nazi submarines.Perhaps the most striking quality of the film is the ability to portray the Nazi soldiers with disconcerting verisimilitude.Most movies that portray World War II tend to characterize all Nazi fighters with a sharp inhumanity, a unanimous monstrosity, thereby facilitating the heroic role of Allied soldiers. Nothing more than a comfortable justification for the successive massacre of German soldiers. The dehumanization of the villains is an old strategy used in the movies, a dramatically distorted laudable but extremely fictional.Das Boot reconciles, provocatively, both the dramatic aspect as the humanity of German soldiers.

Being a U-boat, the expected outcome is destruction of the submarine by sinking. The actual outcome is different and somewhat unexpected when it happens, or it was for me. That outcome may have something to do with the controversy of a submarine full of Germans being nominally ""the good guys."" (That is, you're in the submarine with the often young or likable Germans, except maybe the Nazi code officer was a jerk, so that's who you root for, even though you know the country they were fighting for was doing evil things then.)

These unnecessary scenes seemed to give the movie a summary of, for lack of better terms, ""boat goes up, boat goes down,"" as in the surfacing and submerging of the submarine.

382,tammolotz,"Packing, genuinely, overwhelming!",10,25 January 2000,"Using the term 'authenticity' in connection with any kind of art is rather difficult and daring as well. Sometimes it looks posed or is by certain purposes manipulated. Referring to Petersen´s ""Das Boot"" however, I consider it justified to call it authentic and true. I think this statement can be strengthened mainly by the fact that Lothar Gunther Buchheim was consulted. He composed the novel this breathtaking movie bases on and he himself was employed as a war correspondent in the Second World War.The entire plot has no weak points. Starting at ""Bar Royal"" at the very night before the forces living journey of the submarine crew begins, the director fittingly manages to confront the audience with the protagonists and their way of dealing with the pounding uncertainty. Once put to sea, the character of the scenes changes abruptly. Every member of the crew and the audience as well comes into very close contact with the tightness of the action space. At this point it is necessary to underline the excellent work of the cameramen. The fast and partial hectic cuts draw an exact picture of the drama on board. Too do not forget the outstanding lighting. However besides this abundance of obvious suspense, there are also a number of moments going into in-depth psychology and thoughtfulness. To outline only a few of them: At ""Bar Royal"", when the chief engineer reflects about the uncertain fate of his family, or when the captain, with a kind of 'Weltschmerz' in his eyes, is astound and proud of the unbelievable efforts of the crew. It would probably be too laborious to refer to the decisive symbols the director uses, therefore I recommend this movie to everybody, especially those who are interested in the Second World War.It presumably sounds pretty weird, yet I suppose that mankind gladly participates on the misfortune of others, without being closely involved with it. This closing notion may account for the huge success of this movie.>",Das Boot
383,crettich,This is the best war film ever made. Period. Warning: Spoiler!,10,12 June 2001,"Warning: Spoiler!!I am watching another German war film right now, Stalingrad, and it strikes me that perhaps only losers can make good war films. Which is perhaps why the best American war films have been films about Vietnam. The bottom line is that at least since the battle of Agincourt, war has been fundamentally immoral. There is no good fight. There are arguably wars of survival like WWII was for a world threatened with the global madness of someone like Hitler. But that atrocities are committed on categorically inhuman scales on both 'sides' is not arguable.I believe it was Truffaut who said something about the impossibility of an anti-war film: the sense that the medium and its conventions make it impossible to create something that makes us truly understand the madness and total uselessness of war. I believe Das Boot to be the exception that may prove this rule.Only Das Boot drives this madness of modern war home without compromise. With absolute skill, we are drawn by Petersen and his cast to love the men our grandfathers saw as evil incarnate, only to watch them blown apart at the end. There are acts of immorality, cowardice, and madness on the part of almost every crew member. There are no great heroisms, there is not one good thing that comes of the efforts of these men; their small personal acts of courage and compassion are lost to the greater story of humanity because they are almost all killed. Why struggle for months at sea to help each other survive, to develop incredible skills of survival, only to have everything taken from you at the moment you think you are safe? War is senseless. And again, only Das Boot really captures that. Certainly no American film, always taken through the rosy lens of the winner, can ever escape its own unconscious positivism about war.I would say 'Stalingrad' is excellent and certainly vastly superior to equivalent Hollywood fare, but has two fatal flaws in a comparison with Das Boot. First, there are the Hollywood tricks used to manipulate the viewer into a sympathetic state regarding warfare, including a rousing, suspenseful soundtrack (Das Boot has this, but only so briefly in the moments when the sub is under full steam on the surface, that the intent is clearly ironic), and the vicarious rush of successful kills, such as in the scene when the Germans plant contact explosives on the unsuspecting Russian tanks. Second, because of the chaotic, expansive nature of infantry warfare it is very difficult to identify who the main characters are in many of the scenes, never mind identify *with* them.In Das Boot, the closed nature of the environment makes us intimate with every major character, we can identify them and identify with them. The acting, especially of Prochnow, is brilliant. Each character is made vibrantly alive and full of passion. Enough so that their deaths are self-evidently a total and immoral waste of human life.Two final points that add to my appreciation of this film. First, the authenticity is of the highest order. Unlike certain recent American war films (U-571!!!) these people bothered to do their homework, put incredible effort into re-creating the 'real' thing, and generally stuck to the facts, not the manipulative revisions of Hollywood. Second, the cinematography and FX are superb. The bottom line is, whatever you might think of European aesthetics regarding character, narrative and soundtracks (three areas my students typically complain about when we watch European films), as cinematographers, they kick ass. Jost Vocano's work here is almost literally perfect, catching in every frame both the intense claustrophobia of the submarine environment, and the incredible skill of the men coping with that environment in mad choreographed acrobatics. His POV shots through the periscope and binoculars (more restriction, here in vision) are also brilliant.An incredible film. If you have not seen Das Boot, you have not seen a how good, and how honest and moving, a war film can be.",Das Boot

To be in with the crew of Das Boot is as near as most of us will come to the real thing.All I can say is just watch it and be prepared for the best roller-coaster ride of your life.(Incidentally, if German isn't your mother tongue, then I would certainly recommend watching a subtitled version over a dubbed one (having seen both available English versions).

I showed this movie to an American WWII Navy Veteran, and he said that it was the most realistic portrayal of submarine warfare he had ever seen.

My grandfather commanded a sub in the Pacific during WW2, and my dad went on to do nearly 30 years as crew and finally skipper in a nuke hunter/killer. So I kinda know the history of subs 1st hand. This movie pulls no punches and is stunningly accurate. It is a work of genius from one of the greatest directors of our time.I must qualify that by saying PLEASE don't watch the dubbed English version. This film has to be seen in German with subtitles, and you absolutely have to see the director's cut. Three and a half hours of laughter, terror, claustrophobia, tenderness, and finally a sense of the futility of war. It's just brilliant.Jürgen Prochnow has made some good films in his career, but he will never better this performance. He is the epitome of a sub captain. Steely, yet sensitive to his crew. Determined and sometimes rash, but always in control, and the love of his crew for him is clear throughout. Even I would follow him until the end!!I kinda feel bad about praising Jürgen Prochnow so highly because, seriously, this is one of the few movies I've seen where EVERY member of the cast is just perfect. All credit to the casting people. You would not change anyone. Bernd Tauber as the Chief is just awesome. Erwin Leder as Johann is just so right, and Herbert Grönemeyer as the raw reporter who grows up is amazing.This film should be up there with the greatest war movies of all time. Unfortunately, I think because it's told from the German side, it will never get the recognition it truly deserves. Very sad, as it never glorifies Nazism.

392,wm-girvan,Sub of the Day: Plenty of meat and no cheese,10,21 June 2012,"A lot of war films are heavy on patriotism. This one isn't, and that's what makes it special. Set in 1941, the film follows a German U Boat Captain and his crew in their mission to seek and destroy Allied forces convoys in the Atlantic. The Captain we learn, despises his political masters but as a career sub-mariner he ruthlessly adheres to the chain of command. The captain may view the crew as cogs in his machine but we get to know them as they spend their time cooped up together. The film really focuses on how various crew members cope with the extreme pressure situations that arise out of the captains' decision making. It is this human element that gives the film a timeless quality, it never feels dated and it also enables the viewer to really connect with the emotions that the captain and his crew are experiencing. In fact, it feels so real that you can almost feel the salt spray on your face as the boat races through the waves at full speed. Watch this one, you won't forget it.",Das Boot

I was 13 at the time and was totally blown away by it. Up until then, the only war films i had seen were gung-ho movies, with GI's firing tommy guns from the hip at hoardes of evil Nazis. To see a film that showed 'the enemy' as human beings, with hopes, fears and dreams was something else to a 13 yr old kid. As i grew up i began to understand more about the second world war and was able to make up my own mind as to whether the 'evil Nazis' were all that the cinema portrayed them to be, but 'Das Boot' always stuck at the back of my mind as an outstanding example of how to show fighting men, from what ever side, in the best possible way.Lots of people rave about 'Saving Private Ryan' being the ultimate WW2 film. Although good, it isn't a patch on Das Boot. The Boat has everything; Fine actors, an excellent script (which doesn't deviate from the Novel at all) and excellent hand-held camera work, supported by brilliant lighting, and 20 years before 'Private Ryan' too!Das Boot is an excellent example of how to depict the horrors of war without resorting to a blood and gore fest and it remains a film that everyone should see it it's entirity at least once.",Das Boot

These new age war films are too busy trying to be flashy with explosions and guns going off everywhere. Not to mention the use of practical effects is a lost art. Most films are just digitizing elements in. You lose feeling and perspective. Most war films today do not take the time to show us character development, or give us a chance to relate to the people we are about to embark on a great journey with.DAS BOOT is not one of those films. Possibly one of the greatest films ever made. Make sure you watch the extended directors cut. It is a sad reflection on what some of the U boat crews had to endure out in the Atlantic ocean, fighting a war they were losing support for. A chilling film that I have watched time and time again, and I always enjoy.There should be more films like this. Sadly, it is not a commercial film and the masses of today would find it slow and boring.If your attention span is that of a 5 year old on a sugar high, skip this film, it's intelligence and brilliance will be lost on you.

One lone actor cannot take all of the credit for such an incredible force portrayed by all the men on the ship. Jurgen Prochnow played the part of the captain better than any other actor has ever played the role of a leader of men. He brought to life the drama of leading a group of young men into a possible suicide mission with utter realism and depth. I don't normally get emotional at movies anymore. I did watching this one! All the other actors deserve as much credit for the very different men they portrayed. Not one of them was bad. Wolfgang Petersen is an amazing storyteller, and this movie proved it.

Bouncing around in the Bay of Biscay with the sea too rough to be able to dive safely and get away from it. 'Goffers' pouring down the conning tower and the control room deck ankle deep in the green stuff. Going down backwards at 500ft and you know there is 10,000ft below you, with seawater pouring in through a burst cooling pipe and one main motor out of action. Existing for two weeks on kai or oxo because your stomach is rebelling against the elements. Laying in your bunk in ultra quiet routine with the sweat just dribbling down.

The film reflects the life in a German submarine in WWII without including any synthetic love stories and heroes capable of doing everything. The life in the film is as fast as it must be in a real submarine with some critical routines, lots of time to think and thrilling false alarms. The film must be watched with a high quality sound system in a dark place in order to feel the atmosphere completely. If you don't satisfy these requirements do not spend the special moments that you will live while watching the film. Wait for the most suitable time and place to watch it.As a person having interest especially in WWII films, this was more realistic than Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Das Leben Der Anderen, Hitler: The Rise of Evil, The Pianist and Der Untergang despite the technical impossibilities in filming in that time with respect to others.

This movie is the closest that I have ever seen to actually conveying the spirit, the sense of hopelessness and helplessness, that is always present in the reluctant warrior's life. The presentation of ""Number 1,"" as the dogmatic idealist, is superb, a perfect counterpoint to the real life horrors this movie so accurately portrays. Its pacifist theme so closely mirrors my own thoughts - now - on war and its meaning, that I find myself watching it over and over again. I own the theatrical version, the director's cut in widescreen dubbed, and the director's cut in the original german. I watch one of these at least 4 times a year, and always get something new from it. It is a tremendously textured film, and the layers of meaning, even allegory, that can be laid on it are onionlike.

If you've seen U-571, then Das Boot blows it out of the water.  The director was trying to give you a sense of what it was like being under the ocean blue for several months at a time.  It shows that war is not glorious but just a fault in our human nature and that we were designed to destroy and kill each other.

Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as ""Apocalypse Now"" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare.",Das Boot

I own the director's cut DVD-9 and what an upgrade compared to the VHS with all the extras. Jurgen always does a fine job as a lead actor, most of the crew on aboard the U-boat are relative unknown German actors at that time in '81, I must say they really did a fine job on making the suspense and the overall feeling really real. I mean, if you have a 5.1 surround sound stereo in your house, you feel the adrenaline, the sound of depth charges hitting the water, the stress and anxiety of the crew. In a word, awesome !

419,teenah_mansey,Not Your Typical War Movie,10,12 August 2006,"I am not a fan of war movies. I find that war movies, especially American ones, glorify war and portray those who fight as 'heroes'. The typical war movie simplifies war to a struggle between good and evil, though real war is so much more complex. Das Boot is nothing like the typical war movie. It shows World War II for how it was: horrifying, ruthless, and ill-planned. The U-boat crew are ordinary guys, with lives back home in Germany which they long to return to. They are not heroes, they are men who are afraid and are in the line of duty out of self-preservation and patriotism, not because they are psychotic Nazis. (they're not.) It is a story far more complex that good and evil, it is about human decisions and mistakes, and the complex struggle between one's loyalties and one's nature. Watching Das Boot, you forget that the crew is German, which in Western society we are taught is the 'bad team' of WWII, and see them for what they really were: ordinary men. I loved this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a film that's really about something, without the warm-fuzzies and Hollywood conventions steeped into most movies. It is gripping and consuming, and once you see Das Boot, you're not likely to forget it.",Das Boot

421,grandsophy,Moving Beyond Measure,10,19 August 2006,"One of the few movies that shows the war from a German perspective (the more recent ""Downfall"" is also unmissable) and makes for compelling viewing. You identify with the despair, the youngsters' need to ""go home"", the loves left behind, the fear of dying, the dawning enormity of their action as they recede from the survivors in the sea, the sheer fatigue of continuing when every nerve yearns to be free of the boat's confines - the pressures of war, and marvel at the courageous human will that keeps defying all odds and surviving.I found myself on edge for the entire movie, feeling as trapped inside the sub as the crew and even cheering as the boat surfaced in the end against all odds and then, mourning the futility of it all. The movie succeeds in showing the war as a very human tragedy, forcing us to not hide behind anonymous ""enemy"" tags. Among many tragic moments, especially poignant is the scene where the captain recants the incident of watching the survivors cry for help. You can almost see his eyes glistening. Almost.The cast is superb but the captain is outstanding, his eyes brilliantly essaying his emotions.Best version is the director's cut in the original German with English subtitles.What I don't understand is why Das Boot never won any Oscars. Can anyone shed light on this? Was it a political decision? (Btw, I think Saving Private Ryan is highly over-rated as an all-time great war movie).",Das Boot
422,mistersnail,a valid perspective and a gripping tale,10,15 September 2006,"I have to admit that the film was historically quite accurate as I have studied the submarine warfare and, quite obviously, have realised there must be another side to the story: i.e. that German U-boat crews were not necessarily evil and / or sarcastic and ultimately successful as usually portrayed. There must have been a human side to the crews, which went unexplored, and even the several attempts were all British/American and did not make a sufficient point. This film, on the other hand, shows people actually stuck in between 'saving' their country and common sense and the desire to live.Moreover, good and to-the-point screenplay & acting all combine to make a good film. What makes it better still is that it is, after all German made: this not only gives the chosen perspective a certain validity, but may just as well highlight a general German view of the war (of the 80s period at least), which must not be dismissed.The film shows the Battle of the Atlantic in a different light from the usual history books. Since there are few films that actually portray the scene from the 'other' perspective, and even fewer that manage to do it so well, it is definitely worth giving it a high mark.",Das Boot

He survived several similar airraids and depth charges more than once on every mission and fortunately his boat lost no crewmember.

I now feel that my simple posting was perhaps not clever or detailed enough.I now feel very silly so, to prove i can talk about das boot in a more intellectual way, please indulge my hurt pride and read on. I honestly don't enjoy das boot for the captain alone. I have loved this film for a number of years now, i have loved it for many different reasons. Give me a chance to explain them. Please keep reading even if i do not express myself very well. I mentioned how in charge the captain seems to be and how this gives him sex appeal. However it is far deeper than that. Das boot is almost unique in that it is a totally male dominated film. I love how the men talk freely to each other about anything and everything without a woman to interrupt them. I like the way they interact with each other, or not as the case may be. Outwardly das boot is cold and stark and cruel. All those people locked together, forever in each others way. Inwardly the film has a soft and gentle side. One of great emotions. Fear and loneliness. It even has a spiritual side, or at least i think so. The man who has command of a situation like this has a special appeal. I get so involved that i want to mother some of the crew, befriend some of them and be the lover of others. The whole thing would be ruined if a woman came on board. Iam a woman and its like listening and viewing out of bounds territory.

I saw it a few years ago, and the whole thing completely blew me away. The film is about a German reporter who travels on board a Nazi U-Boat to live with the German crew for a few months. (Note: The Film was filmed in German; watch it in German with subtitles. Its so much better and more realistic.) The sub is cramped, and the crew endures multiple hardships and problems as they travel through the seas during WWII. You are brought in to see the war from their point of view, you're not seeing it from the English, not from the US, you see it as a Nazi, which is quite an accomplishment for a film because the Nazis are nowadays normally frowned upon and disliked. You become attached to the crew, and you can almost feel the poor conditions of the sub as you watch. And then there's the end, which you make you run out of your living room screaming. Yes, it's that good. And I'm surprised that this film isn't as talked about as much or receives as much attention as other big films do such as Titanic. And in my opinion, it's far better.

What makes it even more special is the superb new soundtrack which sucks you inside the hull of the submarine giving you a claustrophobic time. The actors weren't allowed to see daylight during the shooting and really lived for the film so what  you see isn't only close to reality. What I like about the plot is you don't see the common ""ugly Germans"" and ""good allies"", but all soldiers are forced into their fate and nothing can help it.

I am one of the few people who think the mini-series on TV is better then the movie and it is best to watch it with the subtitles as some of the dubbing totally alters the meaning of what the character is saying. A perfect example would be the speech given by Gronemeyer when all hope of getting back to the surface is apparently lost. In the dubbed version is sounds more like an American TV speech (i.e. ""they send us out in these boats blah, de, blah, de, blah""). What he is actually saying is sooooo much different and poignant ending with the (roughly translated) ""This is reality, real and big"".

441,blaster182,Plain excellence and one anti-war movie worth watching,10,3 November 2005,"The claustrophobic life of submarine soldiers relived - and in a way, portraying the tension and misery of every soldier and everyone in such tight a situation.Having read the novel now for the second time, I'm still overawed by the suspense and fear of the situation U-boat sailors found themselves in. The novel is a very interesting read and in my opinion very well reflects the boredom and sudden tension those pitiful sailors found themselves in. The movie keeps closely to the storyline set by the novel. It is not a movie about German navy men. There is no glory but just the resentment of the way to fight a war in such a terrible situation. Still, the people were there to do the job - with terrible losses on any side. In that way, the situation reflects the life of soldier on any side of WW2 - or any conflict to that extent. Being put in such situation requires a lot of courage and belief in values - not the values set by the leadership but values of your own virtue. Still in me it just fortified the belief: Whatever you do in a war, you do the wrong thing.The movie itself is extremely well done by any means. Historically accurate as the novel which was written down some decades after the end of WW2 by a innocent war reporter, so there is no space for false glorification but just the bare facts on life on a submarine during a war tour of duty are on display. By today's standards, most of the effects are still very good. Admittely, you can see the boat is a model when you compare closely wave heights and especially water bubble sizes to the boat. The interior shots are perfect with excellent lighting and really portraying the tightness which doesn't compare to living room quarters on today movies (OK, submarines have gained in size but come on!). Nearly a quarter century has passed since shooting, still the movie loses nothing of its fascination due to the excellent editing, shooting and acting. The actors are extremely well cast and resemble the original persons of the novel very well. Most of the actors are today top actors in Germany but at the time of shooting the movie they were relatively unknown. But they already had the skills to make them credible beyond doubt. The story of course is laid out by reality but it matches any good Hollywood yarn of today, reflecting the long weeks of boredom and inactivity changing in a second to full alertness on the attack and eventually sheer terror being hunted down by increasing Allied technical and tactical superiority.Summing it up, this movie is definitely worth watching as it visualizes the terror of war, no matter which side one is on. It stands out as the prime anti-war movie in my opinion, giving the audience a lot of identification with the actors only to be put of by their final fate - and also by the atrocities they are committing - on purpose or not. 10/10 for sure.",Das Boot

By watching the film, I saw a vivid life in a German military submarine in the second world war. I was impressed that at such old time Germans could produce such fine craft already. There were a series of dangers and soldiers suffered from the contradiction of private affection and patriotism. Certainly all young boys grew up after several battles and fatal accidents. This film was shot from German view, so when we watched movies, we would be at the side of the Third Empire. But when their leader Hilter commanded their boat pass Gibraltar to reach a base in Italy, we would feel how cruel and evil the Third Empire was. The end was a tragedy. It was rather ironic. By the way, I liked the music a lot. To sum up, it is a pretty good movie. I believe that no matter if you are man or woman, you will like this military film. Supposing I have opportunity, I will like to watch Das Boot again and maybe more. P.S.So the actor who played Correspondent Herbert Grönemeyer is a well-known rock musician!

I have read the commentaries on this movie, and I agree with all of the praises for the most part.  I also agree that this is a woefully underrated movie, it should be in the top 10 at the very least.  I watched this movie a few years ago alone in my dank underground apartment and truly felt like I was on that sub.  I have never before seen a movie that where I felt that I could smell and taste the environment.What I don't understand is why this is considered an anti-war movie? To me it is one of the most powerful reminders of what war really is, horrible and un-avoidable.  Human nature throughout history has shown us that all people will never agree, and that violence is always the inevitable consequence of humanity.  As an American I am fully inundated with, and unlike most of my country-men, aware of the constant stream of heroic, glamorous, war is a game trash that comes from Hollywood.  I have no illusions of what war really is, I also know that without the help of a greater power world peace is, at best, an interesting philosophical argument.Both of my grandfathers were in WWII fighting for the US, and my father in-law was a German child in Poland during the war.  One of his brothers and his father were in the German offensive against Moscow in the winter of 1941.  His brother escaped from Siberia after the war, and his father was also a POW.  I have talked to most of these people at great length about WWII, I have talked to several other vets as well.  I don't think I could find one who has seen this movie tell me that they consider it to be anti-war.  In fact, if there is one constant I have ever found in all of the veterans I have ever met, it's that war is an unfortunate necessity of civilization.Of course all of this is my opinion and I know as well as anyone what that means, but I just thought I'd chime in.  It saddens me to see that one of my favorite movies is being used as political fodder for a pointless argument. In his preface to his edition of Sun Tzu Ts'ao says that ""The SSU-MA FA says: ""If one man slay another of set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain."" He who relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall perish.""  I prefer quotes from those who lived in times when war was a completely natural and understood part of life.  People who saw their comrades fall on the field of battle while looking their enemy in the eye.Oh well, just my $0.02.  Guess I'll go home and watch Das Boot :-)",Das Boot

455,angryman_45,Absolutely Fantastic,10,13 March 2004,"This is, perhaps, the best war film ever made. This may seem to be a little over the top, considering its opposition, but I feel that what this film lacks in special effects is more than made up for by the depth of its characters and the sheer claustrophobic suspense of the final hour. Das Boot is a very faithful adaptation of the original book (which is fantastic as well), and is best viewed in its original German, but with English subtitles (assuming you are not German!). As a proud resident of Great Britain, you can understand how easy it is to hate the members of the U-boat fleet for what they did to so many crews in our Merchant Navy. Despite this, it is easy to contemplate how terrible an experience life in a U-boat was. After having watched this masterpiece, I felt (and still do feel) that the sheer boredom and terror of U-boat life was far worse than that experienced by allied surface crews.  This is not meant to disrespect anyone, but is meant to provide an accurate comparison.Other War films about the Battle of the Atlantic (e.g. ""The Cruel Sea"", ""In Which We Serve"" & ""Sink the Bismark') are based almost entirely from the Allied perspective, and almost all Germans are portrayed as cold-blooded murderers. Das Boot is unique among movies of its genre in that it is based entirely around the Germans, but also that it does not portray any side to be morally superior. Das Boot's main theme seems to be the futility of war itself. The acting throughout is superb, and the set is highly effective at communicating the claustrophobia, cold and stench of the inside of a submarine. The soundtrack is uniquely chilling and thrilling, and simply adds to the rich feeling and accuracy of the plot. There have been far too few films made about the U-boat crews during the Second World War, but since Das Boot, it seems as though no others are necessary. This film is absolutely fantastic, and richly deserves its rating of 10 out of 10!!!",Das Boot
456,larajac,yes it was very realistic,10,19 September 2012,"I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: ""It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!"" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision.",Das Boot
457,rodrigoalves,"Excellent movie, fantastic",10,11 September 2014,"The characters of the crew are very unique and well represented, the movie is full of action despite its length. It's a story about struggle, union, work, hope and, of course, hard warfare drama.The movie is full of interesting, deep dialogs between the crew members. Conversations about the plans of the soldiers, their ambitions, the things they left in the homeland before beginning the mission, the meaning of war.Fear, doubt, compassion, togetherness are constantly present in the whole movie. Das Boot is the one movie about submarines and certainly one of the best warfare movies of all times.",Das Boot
458,dan-guest,Superb Submarine Epic!,9,23 February 2019,"Rewatching this after a very long period since my last viewing has been a real treat. This review is based on a view in god the directors cut on blu-Ray.Action and suspense in equal doses has elevated this film and allowed it to really stand up to the test of time. The story is great, it follows a U-Boat crew as they head out do their part for the German war effort. It is amazing how well the human element comes through. You feel for these men, and almost find yourself rooting for the success despite knowing that they are fighting the Nazi war effort. I'll his is testament to the director and writers for helping us understand that their problems and pleasures are the same as anyone elses.The camera work and sound are exceptional. Shots moving through each cabin of the u boat and small subtle sounds firing off in all directions pull you in and keep you there. A real joy and many modern movies could still learn a lot from this (the sound design in particular is probably right up there with my favourites).To round off the best compliment I could probably offer is that I enjoyed every moment of what is the best part of 3 and a half hours, and this will be revisited again at some point in the near future!",Das Boot
459,gabrielrangelcaldas,The struggle and fear of WW2.,9,21 February 2014,"This movie manages to completely show the anguish, boredom, stress, fear, anxiety and struggle that must be spent by the crew of a German submarine in WW2.The set of direction and acting makes the movie to be extremely realistic and leaves you stuck waiting for what will happen. Each character is super important to the course of history, no one ends up standing aside as we see in some movies and always has something interesting you note to the smallest detail.And the sound is fantastic!I'm sure you will have a great experience about this movie.",Das Boot
460,st_soulboy,"Nearly four hours long, and never a dull moment!",10,16 October 2004,"The first time I saw this film I could not take my eyes from it. I was mesmerized with the transition of a hearty young crew leaving port evolving as the sheer moments of terror (deep under water battles and personal struggles as well as the final scene) lead them all to rethink their actual cause, and their very own mortality (as well as our own in the perils of war!). I can't imagine another film actually displaying what it must have been like to be on one of Nazi Germany's U-boats - young nationalist boys being plucked from their mother's bosom and cast into the claustrophobic iron wolfs in the heat and height of the second world war, who begin to doubt the cause and victory of the fuhrer they've been taught to love and trust. Very colorful, contrasting characters and a script and plot thick with surprises and emotional drama/trauma. Top-notch direction, action, acting and sets. This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. Sorry I couldn't be more specific with the review, there is just too much to cover without spoiling anything for those yet to enjoy it, and thus I just highly recommend it to anybody, not just war movie buffs. I have seen both the regular version and the director's cut (which I own on DVD now) and I must say that the DC is superior. A masterpiece!",Das Boot

462,zingisile,Utter horrors of a different kind of war,9,21 June 2013,Brilliantly told story about boredom and the utter fear inside a German u- boat during the second world war. Wolfgang Petersen really managers to get you to feel about the soldiers and sesame inside the u-boat with shots that make it feel as if you are inside the submarine being blown to bits.The acting is top notch with Jürgen Prochnow as the hard but experienced and determined captain putting in a brilliant performance.The story holds you enthralled throughout its 3 hours as you delve deep into the characters and their terrifying experiences of war.The effects are still believable while the actual story is about the characters and their war.,Das Boot
463,rr30re05,Recommended viewing,9,15 January 2005,"War movies have been biases to one side or the other. This movie does not make hero's or enemies of the German U-boat sailors. Instead, it grips the viewer with realistic depictions of what it was like to be a U-boat sailor for the Gemans in WWII. It starts off with young (17 year old to 25 year old) who have been filled with propaganda about the war effort and glorious battle. After this young crew of immature sailors start to experience the true horrors of war, you can not only see, but experience with them the boredom, laughter, camaraderie, team work and death. In a world where you have no windows, where your ears have to be your eyes, where a cat and mouse game is played and the looser dies, these young men age 10 to 15 years It makes the viewer realize the horror of submarine warfare in WWII. The most realistic war movie I have ever seen.",Das Boot
464,cybermat47,The most shocking war film ever,10,22 November 2013,"This film is easily the most shocking war film ever. People think of war as a clean thing, a battle between good and evil, and good always triumphs. No. War is a dirty, brutal thing, that takes innocent men and women on both sides and turns them into killers. It puts images into their minds that will haunt them forever. Nowhere is this demonstrated better than Das Boot. For the new crew members, war is a glorious thing, and you will always triumph if the Führer leads you. The veterans, however, see Hitler and the war for what they really are. And the new crew members learn this too, by experiencing war first hand. And the audience also sees what war really is. I'm a big fan of submarine simulators, especially ones where I can command a U-boat in WWII. However, after watching this film, especially the ending, I was so shocked that I couldn't play for a whole day.I'd you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and watch it.",Das Boot

Appreciate a WWII-movie with actual Germans playing the parts of the Germans - When the movie was dubbed into English for USA and UK distribution, all of the principal actors actually dubbed their own voices into English.Bear in mind that German submarines had the highest rate of casualties all through the war. We all despite submariners due to their predatory stalking attacks, as well as none of us envy them their deaths below the surface when the hull breaks and the ship implodes, drowning the men in the cold dark sea ...A testimony to the very special men that served and still serves in these ships, no matter what flag they carry.",Das Boot
466,quiborum,Hell on Earth,8,20 April 2014,"I was a seven year old Dutch boy when the Nazis invaded Holland and I had to run for my life. During the three years in hiding I saw V1s and V2s take of and the sky turn red when B17's and Lancasters bombed Germany. (read my book ""Why Do You Want To Know""). I hated the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe with a passion, but admired the crews of U-boats, because I understood what it meant to roam on the North Sea during war time.After the war I read a melancholic, romantic, Lolita-like book about a love affair of a U-boat captain, who wants to get away of it all, and lives in a cabin on the shore of a lake. He meets a young girl from a nearby castle. I don't recall neither the name of the book, nor of the author.No one is more melancholic than the Germans.

467,ccody-181-941436,"In a word, outstanding!",10,9 December 2014,"As a former USN anti-submarine warfare operator, I'm always attracted to submarine movies. I can't believe it took me so long to finally see this incredible film. Most sub movies leave me wanting a lot more reality injected into the movie, but not this one. I felt like a crewman on that boat with those sailors and could not turn away for the 3 plus hours it ran. I watched the directors cut, in German with the subtitles, and was so absorbed in the story that it didn't subtract from it one bit.It wasn't political at all and I found myself pulling for these men to make it, to survive. Don't get me wrong, I am as red white and blue as they come, but this movie takes you to the most basic, deepest levels of what it must have been like to serve in the most incredible of circumstances, and I imagine that every sub of that era went through the same things. I didn't see them as Nazi's or the enemy, the film did a magnificent job of just showing them as human beings. I loved everything about this epic and can't wait to watch it with my son, who just got out of the navy after serving 5 years on a fast attack sub. Outstanding job from everyone involved, especially the actor that played the captain, brilliant!",Das Boot
468,danielcahli,Convincent,9,25 September 2016,"A successful kind of realistic war movie. In all scenes the actors are convincing, making you feel what the marines passed in that tough days, but the more than 3 hours took a little bit far. This movie shows the second war by a perspective of a group of marines that have a hard mission. Staying inside a submarine for long time, giving and taking bombs. Like all movies of war, and in my opinion not different of the reality, the missions are pathetic. The attacks don't make much sense and usually the heroes are teenagers that don't' have a clue of the propose of what they are fighting for. If you like war movies and have planty of time, certainly Worth seeing!",Das Boot

And now I find out this movie is so compelling and astounding, and I have to say IT AMAZES me so much!I only watched the director's cut version, but I think this version is just perfect. It is the first war film I've ever watched, maybe it is the last. I think if one has only one chance to watch a war film, this is the greatest choice.

Although it is quite long with over 3 hours, it is worth seeing it and by the way, one never gets bored. Instead, tension is built up throughout the entire film with outstanding acting of Jürgen Prochnow first of all and Herbert Grönemeyer and rest of the ""crew""!!! It is really a must see film. I am not only saying it because I am half German myself, but because it is a second world war movie that doesn't focus on who are the good and who the bad. Its all about the people in the submarine trying to survive, far away from political attitudes. The ending could not be better, its simply a film of my taste. Its just so disappointing that current German film industry can't manage to do such great work again, except of last year's ""Der Untergang""!!!!!",Das Boot

A sure sign of a great movie is when the viewer feels a part of it. The whole cast were believable, as were the characters they portrayed. A definite 10/10 movie. I preferred the sub titles to the dubbed voices concept,as the film is shown and heard as it was meant to be. Director Wolfgang Petersen takes us through a fantastic journey,giving us an insight into the fun, fears and general life aboard a German submarine during the second world war. The films ironic ending tops off the tragic reality of war,regardless of what side you were on.",Das Boot
