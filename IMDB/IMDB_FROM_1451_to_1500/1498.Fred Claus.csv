0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not a Christmas cracker, but not a bah humbug either",6,19 October 2010,"I watched this with low expectations, expecting it to be a mess. But I was surprised. Fred Claus is far from a Christmas classic, but there are much worse as well, for example Deck the Halls was very mean-spirited and unfunny, both of which I often see Fred Claus get criticised for.I do agree it is very predictable, and that the direction is on the slack side. And there is also some uneven pacing and moments of disjointed dialogue. That said, it does look good with lovely cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack is great and does put you in the mood for the Christmas season. Also there are moments of inspired physical comedy and while they have been better Vince Vaughan and Paul Giamatti(who was so good in Sideways) do display a good chemistry and both deliver spirited performances.So overall, this is not a bad movie. It could have been better, but it is almost certainly not a disaster. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Fred Claus
1,SnoopyStyle,Perfect role for Vince Vaughn,7,22 December 2013,"Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) is Nicholas Claus'(Paul Giamatti) bitter older brother. He is a Repo man who takes away Christmas gifts. His girlfriend Wanda (Rachel Weisz) is tired of constant disappointment. He gets locked up for fighting with a group of Santas, and calls his brother for bail money. He agrees to spend time at the North Pole for $50k which he needs to open an OTB. Meanwhile efficiency expert Clyde (Kevin Spacey) is on the war path and itching to fire Santa.Vince Vaughn is born to play the bitter older brother of Santa Claus. He has the callousness and sarcasm. Paul Giamatti is surprisingly good as Santa. I do wish that the movie allowed Wanda to have more screen time. It seems like she's abandoned after Fred goes to the North Pole. Fred really needs to work out his issues with Wanda. That's why the intervention is one of the funnier scenes. I also love the Sibling Annoynomous scene. There is a lot of originality here. It's a different kind of Christmas movie.",Fred Claus
2,Prismark10,Santa's meaner brother,4,17 December 2013,"There is a scene in Fred Clause where there is a Siblings Anonymous meeting where you have Frank Stallone, Stephen Baldwin and Roger Clinton talking about living under the shadow of a famous brother which shows great wit, originality and insight.If only other parts of the film could had reached such heights.What we get is a silly concept film. Fred is Santa's older brother. He has a cynical lifestyle working as a Repo man in modern day Chicago having commitment issues with his English girlfriend and is hustling money by pretending to raise money for charity.Fred by the way has been around since the middle ages and been 'frozen' in time. He is a man who has lived for centuries and in all that time is still hustling for money.Santa by the way looks like an old man but is actually Fred's younger brother. Santa is churning out presents for kids all around the world and brings joy to the world from the North Pole.Along comes Kevin Spacey as a time and motion man who is hell bent in closing Santa down.Where does he come from, who does he represent and who the hell he thinks he is thinking he can shut down Santa is never answered by the film.Fred is roped in to help is younger brother and try to get along with his family at the same time he suspects Spacey of being up to no good.What good intentions the film had quickly falls apart because it makes no sense. The actors are up against a nonsense script that takes a lot of goodwill from you. It does have some schmaltzy charm.",Fred Claus
3,claudio_carvalho,Every Child Deserves a Christmas Gift,7,24 December 2008,"Santa Claus' older brother Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) was raised in the shadow of his famous brother and has issues with his mother (Kathy Bates). In Chicago, near Christmas, Fred asks for money on the streets trying to raise fifty thousand dollars to open a betting shop. However, many legalized Salvation Army Santa Claus chase him and Fred is arrested and sent to jail. He calls his brother Nick Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) in the North Pole that accepts to pay his bail of five thousand dollars and proposes to lend the amount Fred needs provided he comes to the North Pole to help him in his factory. Meanwhile the mean efficiency expert Clyde Northcut (Kevin Spacey) arrives in the North Pole with the intention of finding three non-conformities in the audit of the manufacturing process and shut-down the facility. When Fred is assigned to work in the Naughty-Nice Department, the troubles of Nick begin.I do not recall the last time I have seen such entertaining Christmas movie. ""Fred Claus"" is funny and has many hilarious moments (my favorite is the siblings-anonymous, with Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton and Stephen Baldwyn among others that resemble Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and other famous people). The message that there is no naughty child and consequently every child deserves a Christmas gift is great. The cast leaded by Vince Vaughn is fantastic and I really loved this movie. I wish Merry Christmas to all IMDb movie and TV lovers and staff. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Titio Noel"" (""Uncle Claus"")",Fred Claus
4,jboothmillard,Fred Claus,3,10 December 2010,"TV was naturally going to be littered with seasonal films with Christmas fast approaching, and a few were going be terrible looking, and this certainly was one of them, from director David Dobkin (Shanghai Knights, Wedding Crashers). Basically during their childhood Nicholas was growing to become a saint with a good nature, a love for spreading joy and wanting to give presents generously, while brother Fred was ignored. Fast forward a few centuries, and not ageing much, Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) is a fast-talking loser wanting to open a betting shop, while younger brother St. Nick (Paul Giamatti) has become the famous Santa Claus. When he gets arrested, Fred calls brother Nick in the North Pole and asks for money both to bail him out, and to help start his betting shop idea, Nick agrees but only if he gets help in return. With Christmas on the way, Nick asks Fred, recently split from girlfriend Wanda (Rachel Weisz), to help at the workshop for a few days during the rush, to oversee the elves making the presents for the sleigh. But Fred's main role is to look over the thousands of files of children to determine whether they have been naughty or nice, obviously the nice ones deserve presents. Looking over Fred, but mainly Nick, is the mean efficiency expert Clyde (Kevin Spacey), who isn't happy with the way that the rush is being handled, and threatens to stop Santa delivering, which he does. Fred knows that millions of children around the world are going to be upset with no presents to open on Christmas Day, and with it being Christmas Eve it looks like there aren't going to be enough for everyone. But he and the Elves put their heads together and quickly make the easiest presents they can, a baseball bat for the boys and a hula hoop for the girls, so that everyone gets something, ignoring whether they've been naughty or nice. After some more Clyde being mean, but getting him on side, and some technical glitches, Fred and lead elf Willie (John Michael Higgins) successfully deliver one of the best Christmases in centuries. In the end, Fred and Wanda are back together, Willie and his love interest Charlene (Slither's Elizabeth Banks) are together, and Nick and Fred, with the support of Clyde, work hard for the next Christmas. Also starring Miranda Richardson as Annette Claus, Kathy Bates as Mother Claus, The Vicar of Dibley's Trevor Peacock as Papa Claus, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges as DJ Donnie, Frank Stallone (Sylvester's brother), Roger Clinton (Bill's brother) Stephen Baldwin (Alec's brother and The Losers' Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Older Man Getting Parking Ticket. Giamatti seemed a little more interesting than Vaughn, some of the supporting actors were underused, most of the jokes were stale, and the scripting was dull and predictable, there may have the Christmas warmth moment or two, but overall, Santa should stay a single child, a not very worthwhile festive comedy. Adequate!",Fred Claus
5,edwagreen,Fred Claus- It's Not All in the Family **1/2,5,18 May 2009,"There has always been sibling rivalry.The picture starts in story-book times and makes its way to modern day with Santa Claus and his brother Fred.Paul Giamatti ought to go back to playing John Adams. There he showed substance in the role. This was nothing more than a stupid idea relating to the holiday spirit.Vince Vaughn tries but he has little material to work with. This is what 2 time best actor winner Kevin Spacey resorts to? In some scenes he reminded me of his Oscar winning turn as Lester, who got his brains blown out in the end by Annette Bening. In this role as scrooge, he tries to act as a cross between Lex Luther and Lester.Kathy Bates is somewhat appealing as the mother, but again there is little material for her to work with.Delivering Christmas presents to an orthodox Jewish family? How crass can you get?",Fred Claus
6,michaelRokeefe,Did you know about Santa's big brother?,6,9 December 2008,"Hold off on calling this a holiday classic just yet. However there is more substance, albeit comedic, than those Tim Allen efforts. Very good photography and a brisk story about Nick 'Santa' Claus(Paul Giamatti)and his estranged brother Fred(Vince Vaughn), who ran away from home at an early age due to the favoritism shown Nick by mom and dad Claus(Kathy Bates and Trevor Peacock). Nick of course went on to a very successful career, while Fred just never could catch a break. He needs to once again borrow money from his little brother and there is a stipulation that Fred fly to the North Pole for Christmas. At the same time the whole Santa toy delivery thing may be going out of business due to an efficiency expert(Kevin Spacey), who is on the verge of shutting Santa down. Fred in spite of his carefree and slacker ideas gets the chance to save Christmas and bring back together the Claus family.Really did enjoy the use of the two Elvis songs ""Santa Claus Is Back In Town"" and ""Rubberneckin'""; the latter being part of my favorite scene. Also starring are: Rachel Weisz, John Michael Higgins and the beautiful Elizabeth Banks.",Fred Claus
7,studioAT,A bit of a waste,2,18 December 2019,"Everyone has their favourite festive films, and for some this is one of their 'go to's' every Christmas.For me though this is a decent premise that's clearly built around Vince Vaughn's brand of comedy, and is all the worse for it.A shame, because this has a good cast, many of whom don't normally pop up in such material.",Fred Claus
8,hitchcockthelegend,Saving Christmas and Building Bridges.,7,27 December 2014,"It does exactly what it says on the Xmas Movie Tin. Poorly received by the critics and equally unsupported by the internet hordes, Fred Claus may be guilty of sentimentality, but for those in need of a pick me up during yuletide then it delivers the requisite smiles to faces.Vince Vaughn is Fred, brother of Santa (Paul Giamatti), who has grown up resenting his elder brother. When Fred is in desperate need of cash he gets in touch with Santa to ask for a big loan, Santa will oblige if Fred comes up to the North Pole to work for it. Anger, mirth and bonding does follow as Fred causes mayhem among the elves and finds himself pitched in the middle of a nefarious plan being hatched by Clyde Archibald Northcutt (Kevin Spacey).Not all the gags work but there are some genuinely funny moments, while the romantic threads are a touch too twee. Yet this wears its Xmas movie heart firmly on its red clothed sleeve, and nothing wrong with that. 7/10",Fred Claus
9,dbborroughs,Better then you think it is (in parts if not as a whole) and worth a look,6,25 December 2007,"Odd mish mash of a movie about Santa's brother Fred. When Fred needs money his brother offers him the cash if he'll come to the North Pole and work for it. Fred arrives just as Kevin Spacey as an efficiency expert arrives to see if Santa can stay in business. An odd mix of low brow humor and clever bits that never quite comes together. There is a good movie rattling in there that occasionally shows its head, more toward the second half when the film finally finds a direction. There is much to like, in particular the depiction of sibling rivalry (the sibling anonymous meeting is hysterical) and the sense of family. A misfire to be certain, but a misfire that will be very welcome on cable, especially when you get to the good parts.(I want so much to tell you about the good jokes but I won't since I don't want to spoil them) 6 out of 10 for the bits that work.",Fred Claus
10,anaconda-40658,A New Take on the Legacy.,6,30 December 2015,"Fred Claus (2007): Dir: David Dobkin / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz, Kevin Spacey, Elizabeth Banks: Christmas comedy that places normality in the extraordinaire. Vince Vaughn plays Fred, Santa's brother whose trouble with the law lands him in the North Pole. This leads to an obvious conflict of interest as Fred's influence and slack nature causes tension. Setup works but structure is predictable with an obvious conclusion. Parents may object to images of Santa attempting to run his brother down with a plow. Director David Dobkin does well with an interesting concept despite a screenplay that doesn't work the concept effectively enough. Vaughn steals scenes as Fred whose rebellious attitude is a problem regardless where he is. Paul Giamatti is well cast as the stressed out Santa who loves his brother yet senses that this arrangement might not be for the best interest for everyone involved. Rachel Weisz is wasted as Fred's girlfriend. Her role requires her to shame him for his inability to commit. Kevin Spacey plays the villain out to sabotage the operation. There is a neat conclusion to this subplot but we get the feeling that this is far beneath Spacey's talent. Elizabeth Banks is fetching in a smaller role as an elf. Visually well made Christmas comedy with a unique idea of Santa having a brother and a message of giving even to those who are most naughty. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Fred Claus
11,FlashCallahan,Sixteen thousand bags of Cheetos.....,5,16 December 2012,"Fred Claus suffered his younger brother Nick's saintliness as a child. Jump ahead: Fred is a fast-talking, genial but self-centred guy in Chicago looking for $50,000 to open an off- track-betting shop. When one scam goes awry, he calls Nick at the North Pole for a loan: Nick will give him the money only if Fred comes up to help a few days with the Christmas rush. Santa's facing an audit from an efficiency expert, and it's not pleasant. Fred's job is to review charts and determine who's naughty and who's nice. Fred Claus is the literal naughty child of Christmas movies. It has brash humour, a real cheeky side, but all in all, it's heart is in the right place.The cast are great and Vaughn is in his prime in this movie, fast talking from start to finish.It does hint a little bit of Elf time and time again, but it's funny for all the right reasons, even if it is very predictable.It's slickly produced by Joel Silver, and although it's not the best film on first viewing , it's a grower for sure.",Fred Claus
12,mm-39,Not a bad movie,6,13 November 2007,"Not a bad Christmas movie. 'Fred Clause' was well directed and acted. The story is OK. Vince is funny at times, similar in style to a 80's Bill Murry via Stripes. Fred Clause is funny for moments and also serious with the family message. I like the part where infamous brothers talk about their famous brother counterparts. Frank Stalone, S Baldwind etc make cameo appearances for troubled brothers. I like the ended which shows a trouble Kevin Speacy, and why the villain has it in for Santa Clause. The presents do get delivered and Christmas is saved is a predictable ending, but a lovable ending. 6 out of 10. OK Christmas movie.",Fred Claus
13,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Fred Claus,6,24 November 2007,"What if Santa Claus, aka Saint Nicholas actually had a family, and a brother who hates him to the core because of a high degree of envy? The first 10 minutes spend time establishing its version of this ""What If"" scenario, even offering the notion of how immortality comes to play a part in freezing their ages so as to transplant Fred (Vince Vaughn) the older brother, to Today, while Santa is already operating his Santa's Workshop delivering presents to nice children in time for Christmas Day.To a bitter brother jealous of the attention and success of his sibling, Fred hating Christmas and Santa is an understatement. He despises everything that Santa stands for (of course the true meaning of Christmas takes a backseat here, in case you're wondering), but when run into trouble, no doubt calls the only kin he's still on talking terms with. In order to better his lot and be able to pay off a rental for his dream shop, he takes up his brother's offer to work at the Workshop for 50 grand, thinking it's a piece of cake, until of course the unexpected appearance of Kevin Spacey's Clyde Northcut, an efficiency expert brought in by a mysterious Board to access Santa's operations, and if need be, shut it down - he's already proudly claiming credit for booting the Easter Bunny and scaling down the operations of the Tooth Fairy.This is not a comedy, contrary to how it's being marketed. Sure there are funny moments, but none to warrant any genuine ho-ho-ho's from you. Instead you can see the laughs coming from a mile away, and the delivery is a little tired. You get the same old Vaughn styled verbal barrage and cynical wisecracks, only that they're more of the same and you'd wish Vaughn would either summarize or come up with something new. Paul Giamatti as Santa looks the part thanks to the excellent make up and costume, but really, he's a tad underused in his role as Father Christmas.Plenty of recognizable supporting extras get thrown into the mix, but there's a strange pattern to their not being utilized to their utmost potential. It becomes almost like Spot the Stars, with Ludicrous as DJ Donny, Kathy Bates as Mom Claus, Miranda Richardson as Mrs Santa Claus, two shy lovers in John Michael Higgins' Willie the Chief Elf and Santa's Little Helper (Elizabeth Banks), but the surprise of them all has to be Rachel Weisz - just love her Brit accent! Kevin Spacey plays a Lex Luthor type with hair, and I can't help but to groan at the forced reference to his Superman Returns stint.Other than that, the only good bits come from a truly hilarious sequence involving Frank Stallone, Stephen Baldwin and Roger Clinton in a Siblings Anonymous self-help group, and the gorgeously sounding Christmas Carols. The Silent Night heard towards the end of the movie, will be a tough one for sentimentalist out there to hold back the tears. The special effects too were well done, especially Santa's sleigh zooming into the night skies of countries around the world (I could've sworn I saw the Singapore Skyline too), in a montage sequence that allows Fred, and the audience, to just take a step back to wonder should Santa be true, then it's a heck of a tough job, especially when the success of a single day hinges on how much you can do in the night before - going around the world, breaking and entering through the chimney, leaving wishes and presents behind, and not forgetting to munch on the cookies and milk left for you.It's a Christmas movie that doesn't offer much, with the last act saving this movie and giving it some credibility to qualify as a feel-good movie for the holiday season. No doubt it starts off quite nastily with so much drumming on rivalry and the green-eyed monster, but it redeems some moments with its take on brotherly love. Definitely not Vaughn's or Giamatti's best work, and on the whole, an average movie. Don't hold your breath if you're keeping the faith that the movie somehow turns out better than what its trailers suggest.",Fred Claus
14,namashi_1,Merry Fred Claus!!!,7,5 September 2009,"Hilarious, Touching, Entertaining & Sweet sums up as 'Fred Claus'.David Dobkin deserves kudos for directing a sensitive subject like 'Fred Claus'. The well-known filmmaker is blessed with 2 good writers Dan Fogelman & Jessie Nelson, who've written this Christmas flick. A joyride! Accoding to me 'Bad Santa' was an excellent attempt, but that was crude and crass. But 'Fred Claus' is the most touching Christmas flick after the Masterpiece 'The Polar Express'. Everything a cine-fan wants to see is served in here, it's a feel-good entertainer that leaves loving your loved ones a bit more.Santa Claus is not the topic here, it's his brother Fred Claus, who makes this simple story well-told. More than anything, this movie makes you believe in Santa once again, {I was his biggest fan in my childhood}, and after watching it I wish each and every kid in the world awaits for Christmas.Acting-wise: Vince Vaughn plays Fred Claus beautifully. He's dependable as always. Paul Giamatti, as Santa, is lovable. Kevin Spacey plays the conniving-turned-likable character with ease. Miranda Richardson is first-rate. John Michael Higgins is hilarious as Willy. Kathy Bates, Trevor Peacock, Elizabeth Banks, Bobb'e J. Thompson & Rachel Weisz are effective in small roles.Final word? MERRY Christmas, Indeed!",Fred Claus
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,Good for what it was,6,20 November 2007,"When I saw the trailer to Fred Claus, I was excited, this seemed like a fun Christmas movie that would have tons of good laughs and had a great plot. Now I waited 'till the weekend after this film opened, and I heard nothing but terrible reviews about it, so I was very scared to see it. But the way I looked at it was some people have different opinions, nothing to worry about. So I saw it tonite with my boyfriend, and I have to say that honestly, for what it was, this was just a fun Christmas movie. True, it's cheesy and the jokes are a little dumb at times, but it was all in good fun. I think honestly this is one of the better Christmas movies we've had in a while. It was definitely better than Deck the Halls, you have to admit. The story was still clever I think, I mean who could live up to Santa Claus status? Fred certainly had a hard time doing it.Fred Claus is the older brother of Santa Claus, quite frankly he's getting a bit tired of all the attention Nicholas(Santa) gets. It's tough being the brother of a saint. But when he gets into a bit of trouble with the cops, he asks Nic for help and Nic gives it to him, but Fred wants more money, Nic tells him alright, if he comes up to the North Pole to help him out with the work. Fred comes up and decides to shake things up in the North Pole with the elves, but it couldn't come at a worse time when Santa is being examined for his business and could possibly be shut down.Fred Claus was a cute holiday movie, like I said, it's nothing special, but I thought it was fun. You have got to admit, to those who saw the movie, that scene where Fred goes to the anger management and finds other celebrity brothers who are in the same situation was beyond hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing at Stephen Baldwin, I wonder what Alec thought if he saw this movie, lol. Fred Claus is a good holiday film and I think people are just taking it too seriously here on IMDb, just go and have fun. That's what Christmas movies are supposed to be.6/10",Fred Claus
16,MLDinTN,a cute kid's film with some big name actors,6,11 May 2009,"Vince Vaughn is Fred Claus, St. Nick's older brother, whom is played by Paul Giamitti. Also, Kevin Spacey has the role of Clyde, a guy whom for some reason wants to shut down the North Pole. He's trying to prove that the elves are inefficient and can't keep up with the toy making demand. Also, Rachel Weisz has a bit part as Fred's girlfriend. The director must have collected on some favors to get all these actors to appear in a kid's film.Fred needs some money from Nick. In return, he agrees to go to the North Pole to help out before Christmas by stamping kids as naughty or nice. He kind of takes advantage of Nick's good will, but since this is a kid's story, we know he will see that he shouldn't be like that. Fred has to step in to save the day by flying the sleigh and dropping of the presents on Christmas. He succeeds and spoils Clyde's plan to do away with the elves.There's some mild children's humor, but this isn't really, really funny.FINAL VERDICT: It was entertaining, but I wouldn't really recommend it for adults unless you want to watch it with your kids. Adults would find Bad Santa much more amusing.",Fred Claus
17,lesleyharris30,"Just a Sweet and Innocenr Chistmas movie for the Whole Family to Enjoy,",7,26 December 2013,"Fred Claus is a good movie with an enjoyable storyline and a good cast.Its a very fun Christmas movie that really gets you in to the Christmas spirit,it's fun for the whole family because enough funny scenes for that all ages will laugh at.Vince Vaughn have an enjoyable performances as Santa Claus's brother,but the best performance had to be Paul Giamatti as Father Christmas himself,I didn't like the idea of him paying such a well known character,I just didn't think he would suit him,but he did do a great job,I was very impressed with him.Fred Claus never comes to a perfect Christmas movie,but it's a lot of fun for the whole family. When Fred (Vince Vaughn) asks him brother,who happens to be Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) for $50,000,Santa makes his brother,who he hasn't seen in years,come work at the North Pole with the elves before Christmas to deserve the money he's asking for.",Fred Claus

However, as soon as it gets into the present and Vince Vaughn starts his obnoxious ""comedic"" ramblings to the little girl, I just couldn't take anymore. Blech.

19,JoeKarlosi,Fred Claus (2007) ***,7,12 December 2007,"My wife and I took our niece to the theater for this and it was a good time. Vince Vaughn plays the lead role of Fred, the grouchy and disgruntled brother of the real Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti). When things get tough one year up at the North Pole where Santa lives, he sends for his estranged brother to visit him and help out. It seems a nasty efficiency man (Kevin Spacey) is about to shut Santa's massive toy making operation down permanently if certain standards are not maintained, and this low-life is doing everything he can to make sure things never straighten out. I usually don't like Kevin Spacey, but he was perfect for this part and I enjoyed the whole cast too, in fact. It's getting to the point where I'd go to see any movie with Paul Giamatti in it, and though you'd think he's not physically right for the role of Santa Claus, he makes it work. I found this funny and festive, with something to say about what hurt feelings and mistreatment can do to turn good people bad (ie; make nice people ""naughty""). I especially got a kick out of a scene featuring a ""Syblings Anonymous"" type of meeting for disgruntled brothers, where some famous faces made cameos. There's good music featured throughout as well, and not all of it necessarily being Christmas tunes. *** out of ****",Fred Claus

21,TOMNEL,A stupid movie relying on complete inconsistency.,2,9 November 2007,"""Fred Claus"" sounds like a really corny movie, but with a cast led by Vince Vaughn it can't be bad, right? Wrong! Vince Vaughn only added to the problem. This is a ridiculous movie that never knew quite what it was, and rarely succeeded in making me laugh.The plot of this trainwreck is quite simple. Santa's younger brother Fred needs money, so he goes to the North Pole for a few days to get $50,000 bucks. Meanwhile, Santa is going to be shut down by Kevin Spacey's character, who was actually the funniest character in the movie. There's a long list of problems with this movie, but I'll just name a few things I hated. This had cartoon sound effects during fights, which only works in cartoons, and makes live action stupid and unfunny. Vince Vaughn talked too much, and this movie felt like it was poorly ad libbed the entire time. The movie was very inconsistent in what it was. It starts off like a fairy tale, then switches to an annoying comedy. Midway, for about ten minutes it actually feels like a horror movie, before it switches to corny kid's movie. On top of all that, it just wasn't funny and the special effects were bad. With that said, this did make me laugh every once in a while, but not enough to make this worth watching.Overall this was a dumb, and unfunny movie, not worthy of Vince Vaughn and Paul Giammati's work.My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG for mild language",Fred Claus
22,aharmas,A New Classic?,9,20 November 2007,"It bothers me to see that critics sometimes jump the gun on a movie and go overboard with positive criticism over one-note jokes, and sometimes they are quick to dismiss those films that might have a more contemporary, average, feel... like ""Fred Claus"". This film will probably never win a single award, but it did win my approval, and it really made me think that Christmas is a special season.The premise is interesting, and yes, not the most exciting one, but it is fun, and when executed by this amazing cast, the film can not really fail. Where else can you find someone like Kevin Spacey to play Scrooge so well, and Paul Giamatti's casting as Santa is truly inspired. It doesn't hurt to have Miranda Richardson and Rachel Weiss in the supporting team. The casting list reads like a ""for your consideration"" ad, and having talent does pay.The film is light and at times silly, allowing the audience to just go along for the ride, and at the lead is Vince Vaughn, an actor who has shown his serious side before, but who is at his best, playing silly. He has great range, commands the screen, and somehow projects an extraordinary amount of humanity, something that never been able to pour forth from other more celebrated comedians.The film has very funny opening third, lags a bit in the middle, then it rewards its audience terrifically in the last segment, as Fred must literally save Christmas from being destroyed by mass marketing projections. It is thinly veiled attack on consumerism, and almost the hands that feeds its production team; though it never feels preachy or stops being enjoyable.A nice Hollywood offering for the holidays! Enjoy.",Fred Claus
23,Enchorde,Sweet but pretty standard holiday movie,6,19 February 2010,"Recap: It's not easy standing in the shadow of a famous brother. But when your younger brother is Santa Claus you have some serious issues to deal with. Fred Claus hasn't handled them very well, living on the fringe of the law only thinking of himself. But when his brother bails him out of jail he must come to the North Pole to help out, because Santa himself is under pressure. He is being audited by an efficiency consultant with a personal agenda that has the power to shut him down. Suddenly the only hope Christmas has is Fred Claus.Comments: A sweet but pretty standard family holiday movie dealing with what family holiday movies usually does, family values and the Christmas spirit. To help your family and friends, and to be nice, simply put. This theme has been done many times before, and have you seen them, you will recognize the usual steps in this too.Added to this is the comic style of Vince Vaughn, which gives the movie a little edge. But don't get confused and mix it up with some of his ordinary comedies, it is in only a few scenes his style and humor is allowed, can be allowed, to shine through.But as a holiday movie it does work well, mix it in the ordinary rotation of other holiday movies.Maybe the only odd thing is the appearance of Elizabeth Banks, or rather her character. She is definitely gorgeous, but her appearance is a little peculiar and not what you expect in a family movie.6/10",Fred Claus
24,TheOneThatYouWanted,Kevin Spacey is in this film.,1,5 January 2019,I had to stop watching this about 20 minutes into the film. Basically once Kevin Spacey makes an appearance. I am discussed just looking at him now.,Fred Claus
25,Kamurai25,"""Not Claus""",4,21 January 2021,"Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, but can recommend for off-brand holiday movies.While I like watching Vince Vaughn beat up Santa Claus as much as the next person, I'm not a big Vince Vaughn fan. I'd rather see what Paul Giamotti can do with the Santa role, honestly.Kevin Spacey, being very much himself, is awful, or his character is, and a story needs a good villain. Being a whiny spoiled kid in an adult body doesn't really do it for me, especially in a Santa setting.",Fred Claus
26,eric262003,The Holiday Movie To Avoid,4,14 December 2020,"I'm trying not to sound like a Scrooge, but to be honest I did not like or enjoyed ""Fred Claus"". There I got that out in the open right away as I await for my piece of coal under the tree by those who disagree with me.Though not the worst movie I've seen in my life, it does have an arc about the trials and tribulations of sibling rivalry planned nicely and simple, but the way it was executed was done poorly and incoherent, it made. I mean sure sibling rivalry is commonplace in all family structure from the traditional nuclear family to the more common dysfunctional family where one sibling gets most of the attention while other one is stuck being put on the sidelines making them a complete afterthought. Sure the idea of making that movie with a Christmas theme around looked interesting. I just wished it was performed better.The sibling rivalry account centres around Nick ""Santa"" Claus (Paul Giamatti) and his older and severely overlooked older brother Fred (Vince Vaughn). Life has been tough for the lesser known Claus sibling. While his brother has limitless fame as he's beloved all over the world, riding in his sleigh giving presents to everyone, bring tidings of great joy to everyone and everyone loves him and colourful personality and his philanthropical ways make him an icon during the holiday season. And as for Fred, well he's making a modest living in Chicago as a repo man who's also a con artist who's mindset is more on the spirit of taking rather than giving. His con acts inevitably lands Fred in jail, however his brother Nick bails him out and in return he asks him to come to the North Pole to work in his workshop to get everything ready for the before December 24th and to make honest money for once.Fred might be cranky and not entirely trustworthy, but he's not the villain in this story. Though the conflicts between he Nick can be pretty intense at times, it's not malevolent or really anything deeply personal. It's just jealousy because one is beloved by so many while the other brother can't stand being in the shadows of the other one. That initiative is given to the efficiency expert, a shrewd businessman named Clyde Archibald Northcutt (Kevin Spacey), who's data shows that the workshop stock has been declining due to the flourishing Internet demands. Therefore, his task is to make sure that unless there's any improvements or updates on the workshop, Mr. Northcott will have no problem in shutting down the operation. Northcott can be described a 21st century version of Scrooge. I guess all family films need some sort of villain to stir things up a bit. Cliched but effective!With the emphasis on St. Nick's extended family which also includes his parents (Kathy Bates and Trevor Peacock) and the Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) the idea should have focused more closer to the family dynamics and how things work out in the end. Instead the script takes too much focus on the Northcutt storyline and the plot of dethroning Santa Claus has been done a million times before and the results are always the same. Santa wins in the end and the villain gets his comeuppance. There was a cool scenes that takes place at a Sibling Rivalries Anonymous which has cameos from lesser popular brothers overshadowed by their more famous brothers played by Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton and Stephen Baldwin. At the end of the days the jokes featured here were done before with nothing new to offer.David Dobkin who directed the spine-tingling ""Wedding Crashers"" had to step out of his comfort zone by watering down all the racy jokes from ""Wedding Crashers"" for the more family-friendly so that kids won't be exposed to adult humour and parents being outraged. The even though I had said earlier that the acting was not very good wasn't very good, it wasn't the fault of the performers. Just the material that was given to them didn't do much justice for them and these are performers I usually like. Vince Vaughn who seems to eternally play the man-child gimmick can play between the lines the balances between naughty and nice can't conceal that fact that his over-the-top antics may not always be appropriate to the family oriented content featured here.Trying to compete with the hugely successful 2003 holiday themed Frat Pack film ""Elf"", it doesn't quite live up to the same comedy standards let alone special effects, direction or performances. ""Fred Claus"" is stripped from glittery special effects, and seems to plaster on absurd darkly themes features that have no place for a family themed holiday movie.When I saw ""Fred Claus"" years ago, I was expecting something that might make my holidays brighter. Instead it did the complete opposite. Though it didn't ruin my Christmas, but there was little to be cheerful about in the end even the soundtrack had few Christmas themes to it. I guess after watching this movie, I'll fill my spirits up on some Bailey's and a gingerbread man cookie.",Fred Claus
27,Christmas-Reviewer,Thin Story-Line That Can't Sustain the 2-Hour Running,6,11 September 2017,"BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 HOLIDAY FILMS & SPECIALS. I HAVE NO AGENDA.In this film Of the two Claus brothers, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the troublemaker and polar opposite of his saintly sibling, Nicholas (Paul Giamatti). When Fred's criminal ways finally land him in big trouble, Nicholas bails him out and brings him to the North Pole to work off the debt by making toys. The headaches mount for St. Nick, who not only must deal with his trouble making brother, but also an efficiency expert who has come to evaluate Santa's operation.Before they shoot this film they should have re-written the screenplay. The first 45 minutes could have been reduced by 1/2. The final hour could have also been streamlined. This film in reality has no idea who its audience is. The thing is the film doesn't try to cover all the bases. The film however does have some very great scenes and a awesome set. The flying sequences are the highlight the film which is the only thing that makes film give flight. Worth watching Once. I don't see this becoming a holiday favorite for many!",Fred Claus
28,bob-rutzel-1,Quite a lot of fun,7,27 December 2008,"Fred Claus (Vaughn) has always lived in the shadow of his brother Nick (Giamatti) and it was hard living up to that image (Santa Claus). Now, Fred needs some help and Nick is willing to help but Fred must go to the North Pole for it. Clyde (Spacey), an efficiency expert, wants to shut down the Santa Claus operation.This was actually quite a bit of fun. The village of Santa's North Pole is always a surprise to see how the movies reveal it. This one gave us a brightly lighted town with snow on the roof tops and happy Elves walking here and there, and a massive building where all the toys were made. When I was a kid, I didn't think of it that way. Maybe, I imagined a small house with snow all around and with smoke coming out of the chimney and Santa in a big easy chair before a roaring fire, looking over my letter. Mrs Claus was somewhere around the stove. The Elves were in another building making my toys. That about covered it. The best laugh I had was when Fred goes to the North Pole in the sleigh. Those reindeer took off faster than a .45 caliber bullet. Very funny. You see, we need CGI. Very helpful.I was somewhat amazed at how seamlessly 6-foot adults were made to look the size of Elves interacting with Fred, Nick, Clyde and Charlene (Banks). I kept looking at Willie (Higgins) and thought: I've seen him somewhere before, but not Elf size. Took me a while but he is Phil on the TV show Kath and Kim. And, of course, Ludicrous (he was DJ Donnie) was made to look Elf size too. Ah, movie magic. The other story is the same. A bad guy wants to shut down Christmas and the good guys prevail and, of course, Christmas isn't shut down (now, you knew that, right?).The entire cast performed well. I like Mr. Giamatti in whiskers as I think he performs better that way. Mr. Vaughn did a good job and played it straight. Otherwise you just know I'd be recommending that he sell used cars. And, Mr. Spacey, ah, Mr. Spacey -- If anyone wants to do a Jack Benny movie, Mr. Spacey is ready and with those glasses looks very much the part. I can almost hear, ""Now cut that out.""Good cameo performances by Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton, and William Baldwin who were all part of a ""I hate my successful brother Support Group."" Of course, when Fred told the group he was Santa's brother, they didn't believe him and were ready to fight him for spewing forth blasphemy. Good stuff here. Quite clever too. And, the music? Well, all Christmas songs. What else? Good family fun. Violence: No, the snowball fight between Fred and Nick doesn't count. Sex: No, hey, this is a Santa Claus story Nudity: No, hey, this is a Santa Claus story Language: No, hey, this is a Santa Claus story",Fred Claus
29,Howlin Wolf,Vince just isn't right for a Christmas movie...,5,10 April 2009,"... let alone two in a row! You need a certain sweetness in your approach to the holiday season, and he just doesn't have it. Like in the scene where he uses the snow globe and sees his girl have a 'meet cute' with a guy she's giving a ticket to, I assume you're meant to feel sorry for him, and then practically the next scene has him dancing and whooping it up with the elves?! One scene is a perfect fit for Vaughn, and the other isn't, leading to lots of ideas assembled in a way that don't merge very well into a cohesive whole.I understand that the intention was to contrast his caustic frat-boy attitude with the more pure evocation of childhood innocence that Christmas represents. The issue is, Vince is neither as misanthropic as Billy-Bob Thornton nor as carefree as personalities like Dudley Moore or Will Ferrell, so the tone of the film falls between two stools. Even worse, when the film moves away from the main character, the uneven treatment begins to affect the supporting cast as well. It becomes almost boring and bureaucratic at points, specifically in its uninspired handling of the Spacey and Giamatti characters.Everybody has to restrain their usual personality in order to fit into the basic template of what feel-good seasonal entertainment is thought to be; whether it be Saint Nick switching from paragon of virtue to snowball fighter at immediate requirement, or Clyde suddenly joining the good guys because he gets his Superman cape (since Spacey was channelling Lex Luthor again for the whole time, it wasn't hard to see that one coming... ) it all felt cloying and schmaltzy and not true to the performers own instincts. Why hire people if you expect them to subdue what they're naturally good at?! Weisz, Richardson and Banks fare no better, either. Each lady is a talented individual in their own right, but they're also given virtually nothing to do.As a result, despite a first rate cast, this is a movie that I'm afraid doesn't deliver much in the way of glad tidings or good cheer.",Fred Claus
30,KUAlum26,Really is mostly an expanded sketch idea,6,28 November 2007,"I went into seeing this movie on the assumption that this was a film with two basic objectives:a showcase for the line-riffing talents of one Vince Vaughn(check)to provide some friendly(if perhaps unconventional)holiday entertainment(check). I suppose I'd give this a higher rating if I felt like this had some great insight or emotional trigger to it,but it doesn't,so I go by the operating principle that as long as it delivers what it promises,it can't be too bad.Back in the middle ages,St.Nicholas was born to a simple family in the rurals of (i'm guessing)central Eurpose(maybe BAvaria). Of course,as it was becoming evident that he would become the great Santa Claus,he had an older brother,Frederick,who was,for all intents and purposes,pretty average,and was feeling pretty overshadowed and under-valued. Flip ahead to present day,Fred(Vaughn,applying the usual lanky,""Cool guy next door"" mojo)is trying to scratch together a living as a repo man(how apt!)and make a life for himself and his pretty,well-humored girlfriend Wanda(RAchel Weisz,not asked much of here),he finds himself at a cross-roads. He needs money,and he's getting desperate. BAiled out of jail,he is whisked off to the North Pole by little Bro Nick(Paul Giamatti,all beefy in fat-suit and sweaty white beard),who,in an effort to re-affirm and mend relations with his big bro,has Fred help out at his toyshop and factory. Of course,Fred being average and very human,he can't help but bungle his assignments,which comes under the heavy scrutiny of a cold and calculating efficiency expert(done brilliantly by Kevin Spacey),there with designs to shut SAnta's operations down.I guess I should back up at this point(Assuming you don't already know this about the film)and tell you that there are some leaps in logic--assumptions,if you will--to this story. Asumption #1(stated early in the film):once a person is made a saint,he and his entire family become immortal(And anybody versed in CAtholic canon law would probably hit a wall immediately with this for reasons too long to explain).Assumption #2: Even though immortal,Fred is still hopelessly normal and contemporary(Albeit with a very old-fashioned sense of normalcy). Assumption #3: That everyone watching this movie will know instinctively that magic is not only possible in this world,but is a complete given(!). And Assumption #4: That Christmas is an agreed upon tradition World-wide(with a winking nod and exception to people of the Jewish faith,of course). THere may be more,but I'm feeling lazy,and these are the glaring things that leapt out at me when I saw the movie.Really,this show seems to be(a critic on KAnsas City public radio made mention of this first)a SNL/Mad TV type sketch,all rounded out and expanded to fit a little under two hours of screen time. I almost described this as being a SERIES of sketches,because the expanded lines of circumstances seem like the original idea of SAnta having a jealous sibling being drawn out,but decided that maybe that could be a bit TOO mincing of rhetoric. As is,it works in that it never strays too far from what it's there to present: a funny,harmless holiday themed movie that may be more intended to misty-eyed,reflective adults than to actual kids. Vaughn,Giamatti,Elizabeth BAnks(As a comely ""SAnta's little helper) and Weisz have done better,but they don't hurt the movie at all. Spacey,KAthy Bates(as Madre Claus)and JOhn MIchael Higgins(as Willie,the dutiful,painfully shy elf)probably stand out the most. Director David Dobkin barely makes impact here,being a veteran comedic TV and film director. This isn't great cinema by a long shot,but it's good on it's own terms.Accept that fact,and you'll be just fine with this show.",Fred Claus
31,Sirus_the_Virus,"Once a comedian like Vince Vaughn starts doing PG films, it's over.",5,28 November 2009,"Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti star as a pair of different brothers in Fred Claus. This is director David Dobkin's first film since the hit Wedding crashers. Rated R. Now he returns with Fred Claus, rated PG. Now to me, something is wrong there. Vince Vaughn, the star of Wedding crashers, Old school, Made, and others, stars in this film also. No, I can't do this. Like if a sequel to a PG-13 film is rated PG, it's doomed. Fred Claus, to me, seems on that familiar territory. Trust me people this film is better than films like Christmas with the Kranks, but I think for a funny man like Vince Vaughn to be stooping to this level of humor just makes me say""Humbug"". I know that line was cheesy, but I threw it in anyways.Vaughn stars as the title role. He is Santa's brother. He lives in New York and has a girlfriend(Rachael Weiz?). For Christmas one year, he decides to give his fat brother a visit. So, Fred travels down to see his brother(Paul Giamatti) and wreaks havoc. Santa also soon learns that they are going to shut down the North pole soon.You know it's not like this is an awful film. I still believe that Vince Vaughn can make us laugh and he does a couple of times here. But it is sad to see him in PG films. Kind of like in Funny people when you see Adam Sandler's character starring in merman. It's sad. Probably not that sad but it is a shame. This film, like Evan Almighty(though better) has PG rated humor. Fred Claus ain't a disaster, but it ain't art either.",Fred Claus
32,vip_ebriega,Makes the SANTA CLAUSE movies look like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.,3,21 January 2010,"My Take: A tired formula Christmas comedy. The laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too.I love the holidays as much as the next guy (even if I often have a bad case of the holiday blues), but it seems it's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of Holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year, but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and *gulp* still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at home with Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (save the occasionally crude humor and Santa's ""Little"" Helper wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol' Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? It's a shame really. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable Christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never-aging Santa (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good ol' brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on Father Christmas, and his THIS close to being shut down. Hah! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! SI don't know if I'd praise the casting or to bash it. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they're given way too little to work with.As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could possibly come up with is Santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf. I have to admit I had a few giggles involving Fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers (where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. Worse still, the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that's supposed to make us ""feel good"" and teach us a lesson about ""what Christmas really means"". Apparently, what Christmas means to Hollywood is getting as much of our leftover Christmas shopping money as they can.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",Fred Claus
33,Rogue-32,I'm a believer,8,14 November 2007,"Christmas comes early this year if you're a fan of Vince Vaughn and/or Paul Giamatti, both of whom turn in excellent performances in the highly original and creative new film, Fred Claus.Vaughn, who plays the title character, is an actor I usually don't care for. He comes across as smarmy and one-dimensional in most of his films, but here he's totally believable as the older brother who grows up in Nicholas' shadow, constantly berated by his mother (Kathy Bates), who commits the unforgivable parental sin of repeatedly uttering those angst-ridden words of doom: ""Fred, why can't you be more like your brother?"" And what if YOUR brother were St. Nick, aka the Big Man, aka Santa Claus? What if he resided at the North Pole, where he had created a vastly elaborate and dazzling Christmas Village, replete with scores of helper elves, who turn out gazillions of toys each year, to give out on that one magical night to children all around the world? Tough act to follow, even if you WERE the first born.The movie deals with the ramifications of said brotherhood in very creative ways, cleverly combining the real life logistical elements of Being Santa with the fantastical aspects of the job. There are scenes that are played strictly for laughs, but there are also sequences that are very touching, particularly toward the end, where the film becomes genuinely inspirational. None of it would really work, though, if the person playing Santa himself was not convincing. But we have Paul Giamatti here, don't forget, an actor who once again brilliantly proves that he is capable of portraying anything, in any fashion called for, with complete credibility. His Santa is the best movie Santa I've ever seen - warm, soulful and thoroughly human, with an eating disorder no less. I may not believe in Santa Claus, but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I wholeheartedly believe in Paul Giamatti.",Fred Claus

36,the-movie-guy,Fred Claus is the new Grinch who stole Christmas,5,14 November 2007,"(My Synopsis) Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) has lived his whole life in the shadow of his younger brother Nicholas (Paul Giamatti), who is loved by everybody. Fred on the other hand is a repo-man, who is despised by everyone. Fred's crooked dealings have landed him in jail, and now he needs help from his estranged brother. Of course, Nicholas must help his brother by bailing him out. To pay his brother back, Fred must go to the North Pole and help make toys for Christmas. Fred doesn't really know anything about this toy making gig, but he will try. Fred is more of a party kind of guy, and with Christmas just around the corner, Fred, being Fred, does his usual thing by throwing a wrench into the mix. Fred may be the new Grinch who stole Christmas.(My Comment) Vince Vaughn's character was a little annoying as the brother of St. Nicholas. He had a self-esteem problem that couldn't be fixed. How would you feel if you got ridiculed all the time and your younger brother got all the praise? Vince played the part of Fred with no self-esteem to the extreme. Instead of liking Fred, you wound-up wanting to bury him in the snow and walk away. For a Christmas movie, it is OK to take the children, because it does have a happy ending. If you want to see a Christmas story in November, it is OK. (Warner Bros., Run time 1:56, Rated PG)(5/10)",Fred Claus
37,jordan2240,What were you expecting?,7,11 November 2007,"I gave this movie 10 stars to counter some of the 1-star reviews, but I think it garners a solid 7 nonetheless. I don't know what those who rated it so poorly were expecting, but for me, it was just what I expected - enough chuckles to be entertaining, pretty Christmas scenery, and a touching story. My 17 and 12-year-old sons liked it as well. I thought Vince Vaughn played his typical character, which is always good for a laugh or two, though rarely one you would choke yourself on. I don't think the movie would necessarily go over with the pre-school crowd because it's not ""The Santa Claus,"" but children who are old enough to understand the emotions being portrayed should enjoy it. There are a couple of sexual innuendos that may offend the more conservative viewers, but they likely go over the heads of the youngsters. I'm always amazed at the range of reviews movies get here at IMDb, and they truly show why we'll never all get along. I found this particular film both entertaining and moving, which is all I usually ask, particularly of a Holiday film.

38,richieandsam,I liked it... it was funnier than I expected.,6,27 December 2013,"FRED CLAUSWell, another Vince Vaughn movie where he is the same character.The movie is about Fred Claus... Santa Claus' brother. Fred hates his family and hates to be around them... he is basically just jealous. The problem is, when he wants to set up his own business and needs the money, he gets in touch with his brother and asks to borrow some money. Santa offers him a deal. If Fred goes and helps Santa at the North Pole at Christmas time, he will give him the cash. All goes well until Fred causes more trouble than anything else. Santa is in danger of being closed down for good and Fred is not helping matters.This is a festive comedy which is a nice new twist on a Santa movie. I like the idea of a movie being based on a member of Santas family and not mainly him.The comedy itself was average. There were a few moments that made me laugh, but overall I thought it was just entertaining and not really laugh out loud funny.The movie stars Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Mirander Richardson, Rachel Weisz, Kathy Bates & Kevin Spacey﻿. The cast list was very good and the acting was OK, but the only problem I have is with Vince Vaughn. I like him... I really do. I think he is very funny and I like a lot of his movies, but he always plays his characters the same. In all of the comedies I have seen him in he is the same. He has no range at all. He also talks way too fast some of the time. He was talking so fast that at some points in the film I didn't catch what he said. I wasn't sure about Paul Giamatti playing Santa either before seeing the movie, but he actually did quite a good job. There also was some relatives of famous people which was a nice little cameo. Sylvester Stallones brother Frank made an appearance, Stephen Baldwin made an appearance and Bill Clinton's half brother Roger made an appearance. That was such a funny scene. This scene was probably the best one in the movie for me.The effects were really funny. The baby at the beginning of the movie had me laughing quite a lot. And the elves were really well done. There were some dwarfs playing elves, but mainly there were normal sized people, but to be honest you could not tell the difference too much. It was all well done.It was good, but could have been better.I will give this film 6 out of 10.""I don't hate you, Nick.

Over Mrs. Claus' objections, Nicholas agrees to help his brother on one condition: that he come to the North Pole and earn the money he needs by working in Santa's workshop.

This could be consider as a family film but not precisely for little children, yes it has its funny parts but some of the themes are too complex for kids. The story about Santa's older brother who feels less appreciated than him and that his life is a total mess, is original and interesting. It has some nice effects. The music is excellent. A film with a good rhythm. The cast is wonderful, Vince Vayghn is hilarious as always, Paul Giamatti makes a very good and different Santa, not always laughing and happy, but more like a human type. Kathy Bates as Santa and Fred's mother is a joy to watch her and Kevin Spacey in the role of the evil supervisor in charge to close the North Pole is awesome, it was a very funny performance, so different of what he usually does. In conclusion, its a very entertaining and enjoyable movie with a very good message.",Fred Claus
43,squirrel_burst,More interesting to pick apart the logic than to actually watch,3,25 December 2014,"It's contrived family Christmas comedy time with Vince Vaughn. This year, he's giving us the gift of uninspired comedy known as ""Fred Claus"". Our film follows Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn), the brother of Nicholas Claus (Paul Giamatti). Ever since he was born, Nicholas was just the sweetest, nicest little kid. In fact, his first words were ""Ho, ho ho!"" (get it?!) and whenever he would receive gifts as a child, he would hand them out to less fortunate children. As the years passed by, Nicholas grew kinder and kinder, while Fred grew bitter and resentful. Nick has become Saint Nicholas and set up office in the North Pole as Santa Claus while Fred runs a repossession company in Chicago (What a shock, Vince Vaughn in Chicago) where he takes away presents from people who can't afford the payments. While stealing from the Salvation Army, Fred gets arrested and is bailed out by his brother. Nick agrees to help Fred, but only if he comes to visit for Christmas. The timing couldn't be worse though, because the people who fund the whole Santa operation are auditing Nick.What a weird setup. I can only assume that the people auditing Nick are working for God, because they've already shut down the Easter Bunny and unless things go perfectly right, it's going to be the end of Christmas as well. Kevin Spacey reprises his role from ""Superman Returns"" and plays Lex Luthor (taking on the fake alias of ""Clyde Northcut"" to avoid copyright issues I'm sure), the auditor overlooking the North Pole operations. Will Fred's distaste of Christmas cause him to be disruptive at the North Pole? You bet. Will he eventually learn to warm up to the holiday and end up saving Christmas? Answering that would be spoiling the movie.The film is filled with juvenile humor that revolves mostly around short people jumping around for the kids and Vaughn's trademark witty fast-talk for the adults. I also really resent the fact that we've got not one, but two predictable love plots present. It's not enough that Christmas might be gone, forever but we also have that whole ""Will Fred become a mature adult and get back together with his girlfriend"" thing and another love story where an elf named Willy (John Michael Higgins) is in love with Santa's Little Helper, Charlene (Elizabeth Banks). Apparently, Santa employs a single human woman at the North Pole because she's good with numbers, better than any elf could be. Alright, but does he have to dress her up in a short Christmas-themed outfit that shows off her cleavage all the time? This is a movie for kids right? What do they care about the hottie in the red skirt getting together with the elf? Maybe she was hired as a paid mistress for Santa but the deal fell through. Who knows.Why is it that so many Christmas movies seem to have no internal logic? Take the whole sainthood element for instance. Apparently, when you become a saint, you become an immortal, like in ""Highlander"", but minus the decapitation thing. Your entire family becomes immortal too as a bonus. If Christmas stops, forever, would that revoke Santa's sainthood? If it did, would he then age super rapidly and crumble into dust? Shouldn't there be tons of Saints walking around, along with their immortal loved ones? How far does the loved ones thing go on by the way? We see that the Claus parents are still alive and that Mrs. Claus is immortal too. If they got a divorce, does she stop being immortal? So if Fred marries his girlfriend, will she become immortal? What about their children? Are we supposed to believe that in the hundreds of years that Fred has been alive, he has never accidentally fathered any children or gotten married? Then again, he hates Christmas but isn't smart enough to move to a country where the season is not celebrated so maybe he's not clever enough to get together with a lady.I found my mind wandering and asking silly theoretical questions during the film because there's just not a lot going on here. We've got a lot of jokes about the elves being short. There's an extended dance sequence where all the elves dance to Elvis, thanks to Fred's ""rebellious"" attitude, and some predictable fat jokes at the expense of Santa. The movie is really desperate for some kind of plot so it inserts a villain that's got no business being in this movie and it baffles my mind because this nearly 2 hour movie is way too long. Come to think of it though, the insertion of Clyde Northcutt is one of the only genuinely entertaining elements in the film. You'll have fun replacing his lines with some of the dialog from ""Superman Returns"" and the movie wants you to do that, by placing numerous references to the DC Comics character throughout.I really resented the phony sentimental moments where Fred (I keep wanting to call him Vince because he plays the same character in every single movie) hates Christmas and loves making fun of children whose toys get taken away, but is then shown to have affection for a poor little orphaned boy. If you're going to make him into a grouch, just make him into a grouch. Don't try and trick me into thinking he's something else. There's not even any imagination when it comes to Santa's workshop, the flying sleigh or the elf village. It's a quickly thought up idea, thrown together with a couple explanations of why things work that way, churned out quickly for the holiday season and then forgotten. It's just Vince Vaughn doing his shtick while we place him next to Ludicrous as an elf (badly done by the way) and the same generic messages you've seen in countless other movies. You can do a lot better than ""Fred Claus"" this holiday season. (On DVD, December 13, 2013)",Fred Claus

This is not the next It's a Wonderful Life, this is more like Elf. It's sappy and stupid, but that makes it fun and compelling.Oh, and did you know that Santa gives coal not because kids are bad-but because he can't afford toys for all kids? He can make reindeer fly, he can go down chimneys, he can eat hundreds of plates of cookies, but he can't afford toys for ALL the little girls and boys.

46,Jay_Exiomo,Can't decide if it wants to be naughty or nice,4,28 November 2007,"""Fred Claus"" somehow avoids becoming this year's ""The Santa Clause"" by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that Tim Allen starrer, but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater.As holiday movies go, it's contrived and sentimental. But actually, that could be the least of one's concern as ""Fred Claus,"" boasting of having David Dobkin (""Shanghai Knights,"" ""The Wedding Crashers"") at the helm, contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish Vince Vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy Christmas film. In the end, it amounts to not much of both. And with a cast that comprises of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz, and Kathy Bates, all the more it leaves one disappointed.Vaughn plays Fred, Nick's (Giamatti) older and estranged brother, who once upon a time, left him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after having had enough of enduring his parents' favoritism of his younger sibling. Nick grows up to be Santa Claus (and as the voice-over tells us, time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a Yuletide-jaded repo man in Chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend Wanda's (Weisz) birthday.He runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who eerily looks at least a decade older than him) to bail him out of jail. Nick agrees but only if Fred agrees to help out on the toy-wrapping business up in the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with Santa and the elves' perpetually cheery nature, even as an efficiency expert (Spacey) is checking on the toy factory operations, only too happy to have the whole Arctic operations shut down if things fail.The film, as said, does have its moments, but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration. In between are piles of Christmas film clichés that were handled better in, say, ""Elf"" and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's fruitcake.Vaugn, as usual, brings on his coarse charm to the table, but the neutered script of Dan Fogelman keeps him from REALLY doing his thing. Giamatti, underneath the bad fat suit, brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, has to play second fiddle to Fred. Spacey brings his game face, but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid.Ultimately, ""Fred Claus"" becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve. Sure, there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema, but there are certainly far better ways.",Fred Claus
47,anxietyresister,I must have been a naughty boy this year to have to sit through this... *CONTAINS SPOILERS*,3,2 December 2007,"Come with me my friends, as I show you unspeakable horrors. The Hydra Pit. The Haunted Dungeon. The Slaughter House. Alison Hammond naked. All of these pale in comparison however, compared to the last 45 minutes of this movie. But first, let's take a chill pill, and press rewind.Yep, Sunday Afternoon. Bored. Nuffink to do. What's that? Another Christmas movie at the flicks? Sounds boring. Hang on... this might be different. It has PAUL GIAMATTI IN A BEARD! It has Vince Vaughn doing his schnik as a Lovable LOSER! It has thrills! Spills! And Elizabeth Banks in a revealing Xmas outfit. Ho ho ho indeed. So I thought what the hey, let's hang out the tinsel and put up the tree, this cats going' to the CINE-MA.The film started. Hmmm... first ten minutes not bad. Flashback to when they were kids. Baby's first words are cute. Sad that the bird flew away, but wotcha gonna do? Present day now... Hee hee, all those Santas having a fight in a department store! My God, is that supposed to be a Cockney accent from Rachel Weisz?! Pathetic! And somehow I knew Fred would be best friends with a black kid. Let's keep the PC flag flying everyone!! And so it went on, and as the movie unfurled I started to get into it. Sure, it was far from a masterpiece and the dialogue could do with a bit o' work, but it was a pretty cute plot and the set pieces were well handled. I particularly liked the crowd-surfing with the elves, and the snowball fight with Santa. ""This could actually turn out okay"" I thought as I finished my Diet Coke.WHOOPS. BANG. Hear that? That's the sound of my expectations jumping off a cliff. Me and my big mouth. I don't know exactly when it all started (probably when Fred opens that package from his bruv with a BIRD HOUSE... you see where I'm going with this? ) but the movie suddenly came to a grinding halt. Instead of funny jokes and clever scenes we got scene after scene of glutinous sentimentality. Now I've seen many a Christmas film, but never has it been laid on as thick, as nauseatingly as it is here.You can literally hear the cogs and the wheels start to turn as the screenplay leaps through hoops to give the viewer EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS THEY WANT. So we get couples reunited, Santa Claus's precious factory is saved and loads of children are happy being given nothing but baseball bats and hula hoops for Christmas (Er, no not in the 21st century grand-dad). Even the bad guy is redeemed, as he discovered *SNIFF* the true cause behind his angst... he wasn't given a Superman suit for Yule. Boo hoo. If that is supposed to be an in-joke because Kevin Spacey played the villain in Superman Returns well, I reckon that David Dodkin is the only one that is laughing.As soon as Fred's little birdy friend returned to him, I was about ready to electrocute myself with the tree lights in the bath. The film had abandoned any vestige of quality it possessed, and had contented itself with one fake Hallmark moment after another. I can appreciate good sap, but this was enough sugar to make one lose their teeth. None of it came across as being genuine or convincing, and the denouncement is impossible to sit through without making you want to throw up. If you shed a tear, it would be caused by your love of the holiday, not by any of the facile situations the movie gives us. Or perhaps you felt sorry for so many talented actors (bar Ludricous) who signed up without having read the final draft.Either way, its a disaster. Fortunately, I have enough Christmas spirit to block out the mental scars caused by this affront To All That Is Holy, and shall continue to look forward to the visit of Saint Nick. Hopefully, come December 24th 2008, when Fred Clause is out on DVD, THE REAL Father Christmas can do us a favour. After finishing his mince pies and brandy, he can scan the homeowner's DVD collection, grab hold of any copies of this (and Practical Magic if he doesn't mind) put them in a sack and take them back to the North Pole. Then, he can smash 'em to bits, and use the pieces as reindeer litter. And don't forget to pay a visit to Warner Bros headquarters to nick the original negative. You can just chuck that in the Arctic Ocean. That really WILL make is a happy new year for all parents who would otherwise be forced to sit through this saccharine dross. I'll now sign off with a warning... if you want a VERY MERRY Christmas... don't see this movie!!! C'ya!! 3/10",Fred Claus

Here's an idea: Open on Nick learning how to make toys, then on Fred learning how to run numbers; Nick giving a sick child a dolly, only for Fred to repossess the dolly, along with the family farm! After a few more such episodes, morph to present-day Fred venting his spleen at Siblings Anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy. There -- I just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy!This Santa, who is one ""ho, ho, ho, ho, ho"" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss saddled with the Queen of the Harpies, an operation out of Mega-Mall Hell, and answers to a Board (huh?) which just gave the Easter Bunny his pink egg.

52,Bravesfan17,"""Everyone deserves a present""",8,24 November 2010,"Fred Claus has become one of my favorite Christmas movies. Directed by Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin, the movie stars Vince Vaughn as title character.I like how Dobkin starts the movie out with how Santa come to be, but continues to show that movie is about Santa's older brother, Fred. The early part of the movie shows some good character development in establishing who Fred and Nick are and how they relate to each other.I liked how Dobkin transitions into the modern day as it shows that Fred has become a repo man, yet at Christmastime his brother is everywhere. Fred cannot avoid him. The story then focuses on how Fred needs money to achieve his dream of owning a casino. Fred tries to get money by ringing a bell and asking like the Salvation Army. This causes him to be chased down by dozens of guys dressed up as Santa and be put in jail. Reluctantly, he goes to his brother for help. Nick tells him that he will bail him out, but for the rest of the money Fred needs, he has to come up to the North Pole and earn it.Vaughn is just excellent and shows how great he can be working with Dobkin. At times, it does feel like that he is just being himself, but every actor does just that. Vaughn makes a great effort at making Fred a well-rounded character, who at first seems like a cold guy, but he does have a heart and proves that to everyone.Paul Giamatti is great in his supporting role as Santa. He does an excellent job at making Santa a very well-rounded emotional character, who is trying to keep his cool with Fred, his wife (Miranda Richardson), and an efficiency expert named Clyde Northcott played by Kevin Spacey. Richardson and Spacey are both great at playing their parts. Richardson makes Mrs. Claus out to be someone who thinks Fred is just up to no good and mooching off of his brother. Spacey is excellent at making Northcott a guy who hates Christmas, has a grudge against Santa, and is making it his mission to put an end to Santa.Kathy Bates does a fine job as Fred and Nick's nagging mom, who makes it obvious that she favors Nick more than Fred. John Michael Higgins does some good work as Willie, Santa's head elf. Higgins makes the role really believable as he shows that Willie is more than an elf.Two other performances I liked were from two of my favorite actresses. Rachel Weisz plays Fred's girlfriend Wanda. Wanda is a cop and she cannot always stand Fred's behavior and antics, yet she cannot stay mad at him forever. Weisz is just great as she shows she has talent as a comedy actress. The other one is Elizabeth Banks, as she fits the role of Charlene, Santa's helper who is great working with numbers. Banks is very attractive in the skirt her character wears and takes her role that could have been one dimensional and made it into something fun to watch.There are also great work from the art department and costume designer. The art department did an excellent job at making the North pole look amazing and very believable as to what Santa's workshop might look like. The costume designer does a great job with the wardrobe for all the characters, especially the diverse costumes for the elves.I think the best of it was the Dobkin never forgot that he was making a comedy. Dobkin excellently makes sure that it is a nice, feel good Christmas movie, but also includes laughs in every scene. Like Fred says, ""Everyone deserves a present."" This movie is a real treat to watch around the holidays. This is a very good movie and while it is very funny, it also has some heart to it.",Fred Claus
53,etsm92,"Here comes Freddie Claus, here comes Freddie Claus, stea-ling Santa Claus' fame",6,19 November 2007,"Fred Claus/2007/**1/2Main Stars: Fred Claus: Vince Vaughn Nick Claus: Paul Giamatti Willie: John Michael Higgins Clyde Northcutt: Kevin SpaceyWhat a way to start off a new streak of movie reviews by seeing wonderful holiday film Fred Claus. Okay, not so wonderful. It is not a good movie. But it's not a bad one either. It's one of those betweeners you get every once in a while. A slight rarity. The film's premise is actually not bad. I've never heard of Santa having a troublemaker older brother having to visit him for money before. At least the premise isn't formulaic, but what's inside is slightly clichéd, we've seen it before. It's the same stuff in a slightly different wrapping paper this time. Ha! UghFred's story actually starts off with his mother giving birth to his brother Nick. Nick Claus. So Fred here is the OLDER brother. Although in the previews or if you've seen it you see that Vince Vaughn (Fred) has black hair and Nick (Paul Giamatti) has crisp white hair. But of course, he's Santa Claus! He's not Fred Claus. So yes, the legendary saint is supposed to have white hair, so the writers of the film had to come up with a reason why he, Nick, the younger sibling has to have white hair when he grows up instead of thick black hair. They whipped up a cheesy idea that his hair grew prematurely white while Fred's stayed black and healthy. When it comes to my dad, it's hair LOSS, not white hair.Anyway, Fred sees his younger brother just born and accepts him for who he is until his mother (Kathy Bates) starts giving more attention to Nick. Fred becomes jealous of Nick and decides to resent him and his family. Finally, we catch up with him in the present world, the 21st century. The setting: Chicago, Illinois: the greatest city in the U.S.Fred is a fast-talking, bitter man who's in bad shape right now. His girlfriend (Rachel Weisz) isn't fond of him; he doesn't have a lot of money. So he finally makes a gambling deal with an acquaintance. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the cash to make the deal. But of course he doesn't tell his friend that. So he says he'll have it ready by the 23rd of December. Who does he ask for the money? His brother, of course! What does Nick do? He forces him to come to the North Pole and work at the toy factory, supervise, etc. to EARN the fifty grand that he needs.The story takes off with tons of sub-plots. But we get the drift. We sit back and watch them while the writers try too hard to make the film funny. It's true. Other scenes however are actually funny, or dramatic or touching. The movie isn't just a comedy. I just thought I'd point that out. It has some dramatic moments. Most of them actually pretty convincing. That was one of the reasons why I sort of liked this film. The film had its moments. However, it's still not good enough for it to be a must-see, and I'm not sure if there is a big reasoning behind that. It's I guess something deep within the film that just doesn't make it good enough.Fred befriends an elf, Willie, while at the North Pole. They both become friends while working at the toy store. And of course Fred also teaches Willie how to dance so Willie can impress a certain Santa Helper. He's such a great dancer. Brilliant. The scene was weird. Who messes up the fun for Fred and Nick (although it didn't seem like they were having a lot of fun)? Kevin Spacey's character Clyde Northcutt. He's a sort of businessman. He says to Nick that he will shut the whole North Pole operation down because of cost overruns. But there's a certain secret about his character. Something hidden. A hidden mad kid perhapsThe movie remains consistently watchable throughout. Nothing extremely ""edge of your seat"", funny, or dramatic. There were slight giggles here and there. I must tell you, however, that I expected the movie to be marginally entertaining. It was plus a little extra half-star there. The characters played their parts very well. The film is harmless, it makes a point, and it was pretty good.We've seen this before, writers out there. I just couldn't help but realize that when I saw either the slapstick, or the cute kiddie scenes or even hearing some of the dialogue. There was a really good scene toward the end though that featured a calm version of the song ""Silent Night"" in the background. That's all I will tell you. It is a good scene, an effective one, something I wish that was true throughout the entire world, but then again so does everyone. Happy Holidays.Movie directed by David Dobkin.",Fred Claus

The movie has been playing for 40 minutes now and my gut is not even close to being busted.5) Paul Giamatti should either play Santa as 100% Mister Nice Guy or as a hypocritical putz...not a weak mixture of both.6) Will Ferrell in Elf got more laughs in 3 minutes than all of Fred Claus is getting.7) Man, this theatre is small. I can hear the heater running. It's almost as loud as the dialogue. This isn't really a complaint, though.8) Elizabeth Banks' looooooow neckline is saving this disaster from being a total disaster.9) Kevin Spacey is one of those ""one movie a year"" guys...and as a discriminating movie-maker, he chooses to do THIS script?10) Alright,now HERE'S a funny scene---Siblings Anonymous.11) A Vince Vaughn riff without a few F bombs is basically a waste of F'ing time.12) Yeah, Miss Banks, one day your body and beauty will be put to good use by a funnier director.

56,Sunsphxsuns,ANOTHER MALIGNED BUT WONDERFUL FILM,9,21 October 2021,"To a lot of us, mid-November is the most wonderful time of the year. And I'm not merely talking about Thanksgiving or the approaching celebration of Hanukkah and Christmas. For me, mid-November is the definitive signal that my favorite perennial holiday movies are queuing up on TMC, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, REDBOX, and practically everywhere else! These wonderful films range from the incredibly beautiful black & white classics like ""Holiday Inn"" (1942) and ""Miracle On 34th Street"" (1947), to the more contemporary films such as ""The Hebrew Hammer"" (highly recommended by my Jewish friends, a 2003 comedy so sacrilegiously funny I don't dare describe it here), and finally I swing back to my trusty holiday twin comedies, ""Home Alone"" (1990) and ""Home Alone: Lost in New York"" (1992). (I can't bother with the disappointing remainder of the series. Yawn).By early December I am quite eager to screen the subject of this review, the oddly maligned and ignored, ""Fred Claus"" (2007). And my question, every year, is always the same: ""Why the heck isn't this film more loved?""""Fred Claus"" stars the absurdly improvisational humor of Vince Vaughn as Fred, the beautiful, and zany Elizabeth Banks, the highly versatile Oscar winners Kathy Bates and Rachel Weisz, and Oscar nominated Paul Giamatte as The Big Man himself, Santa Claus (and also Fred's younger brother). But this particular movie isn't really about Saint Nick. It's about his big brother, Fred.To say this movie has no charm would be incongruous with reality. To say it's not funny would be blasphemy. Indeed, there is more charm and humor in ""Fred Claus"" than one would expect in its well-paced one hour and fifty six minutes. Plus, it's beautifully filmed, and features several ingeniously clever special effects.As always, no spoilers here, but I can reveal that most of the action takes place in chilly Chicago and the even chillier North Pole. It's the Christmas season rush at the North Pole and there is much at stake, notwithstanding the future of St. Nick and his Elves. ""Fred Claus"" has it all: Drama, humor, adventure, romance, and even a handful of subtle, uplifting messages. It's not War and Peace. Its not Citizen Kane. It's ""Fred Claus.""Sure, this film didn't quite light up the box offices. And yes, it lost a lot money. But so did ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" (Both are now considered pure classics). Still, when it comes to art and entertainment, Time is often the wiser. Give ""Fred"" another chance.

The North Pole here is breathtaking. It would be a dream snow globe or miniature village.The cast is superb. I absolutely adore Paul Giamatti and Kathy Bates.

It's pretty much the same rambling, dry humor he is known for but it works this time. I hated Four Christmases and I was actually having anxiety issues watching it. Err!!!!! This time, however, it worked, especially with the young neighbor boy sent to the orphanage. Their bantering was hilarious but later in the movie I was touched by what Fred had done for him. The diatribe he expounds during a repossession was priceless.Kevin Spacey playing the villain and then to realize he was a sad little boy inside actually made you feel for him.Rachel Weisz really shined as the exasperated, put upon girlfriend.It's worth watching, a really solid movie that brings out so many good feelings.",Fred Claus

I love Vince's humor and his crazy rants and this film. The kid Sam is really cute. One of my favorite parts is when he reposes the tv from the little girl and also when he goes to the support group for the famous brothers. Ludicrous is great as the elf DJ. Over all this is an underrated Christmas film that the whole family would enjoy.,Fred Claus
63,abrown975,"It's not a masterpiece, but it's certainly not bad",7,15 August 2010,"This film is, to put it simply, a ""Seen it once and it was okay"" kind of movie. Honestly, this movie isn't bad at all. It's not great, but it isn't bad. The cast was full of stars, which was a good start. The acting was satisfying, considering that a lot of the characters didn't have a lot of inspiration to go on. The humor, which was the main thing I was worried about when I first saw the movie, was better than I expected. I will say that all of the sound effects (the cheesy ones from old Scooby-Doo cartoons) got really annoying after a while. In fact, I would have just gotten rid of them if I were in charge. But other than that, the humor wasn't bad at all. I laughed a lot, and I had the impression that since it was supposed to be a kid's movie it would be ""fart-fart here and a fart-fart there, E-I-E-I-Oh great, another fart,"" but I was pleasantly surprised. But the thing I liked most about this movie is the message it gives. It just gives off that whole ""Family at Christmastime"" message that many people need to be reminded sometimes. Now, there are a lot of corny jokes that seemed to irk me a lot, sometimes the plot can get kind of silly (and that's saying something since this is a movie about Santa Claus and his family), and like I said before, the cheesy cartoon-ish sound effects get very irritating after a while. But other than that, there honestly wasn't a time that I got bored when watching this. Over all, this isn't a bad movie. It's not great, but it's not bad. My opinion is it's a good movie to rent someday for a family movie night.",Fred Claus
64,acs_joel,The Message,7,30 November 2007,"There is seems to be a number of negative comments regarding Fred Claus. Last night, my date said, ""I hated it, it sucked."" There were only six people in the theater and two of them left early.I found myself looking more deeply into the messages of the film. It is more profound than it appears on the surface. What is so bad about it? There was not enough graphic sex? Not enough violence? No explosions? The special effects weren't spectacular enough? Bruce Willis didn't kill anyone? The characters grew. They faced their flaws and learned lessons in life. There were messages of forgiveness and unconditional love. Maybe people dislike the film because they see themselves in the characters.The film is fantasy. We all know reindeer can't fly and there is no Santa Claus at the North Pole, don't we? So, what's the problem?",Fred Claus
65,chi-cerca-trova,Cheesy? Yes Campy? Yes Fun? Yes,6,14 November 2007,"I'll put it out there: This was not an intelligent movie. One could check off the Christmas Movie Clichés easily:Little Kid that helps revive the Christmas Spirit? CheckNasty villain that is turned by Santa's goodwill? CheckLast minute, ""against all odds"", rush to save Christmas? CheckSaid plot to save Christmas based upon the base revival of the Christmas Spirit? CheckThe list goes on. So, having said that, why rate it so high? Because it is exactly what it says it is, no more, no less. One does not go into this movie expecting Citizen Kane, hell, not even Rainman. It had a juvenile charm that worked perfectly for this movie. Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti played wonderfully off of each other. And while it was not a character study in the emotional depth and familial tension of the Claus Clan, they still made them believable and humorous.Modern day references, such as health worries, down sizing, corporate outsourcing, etc. add to the campiness a bit, it is an interesting and well used departure from the norm. But, it still remains fun, and it still remains funny. So while I did not walk away changed, enlightened or anything resembling such, I had a good time. And for a movie that was about that, it performed well.Turn off your brain, be a kid again and enjoy.",Fred Claus
66,toadwriter,I look forward to Fred Claus every year,8,9 December 2020,"I don't want to blow a bunch of this movie for you, because I think you need to just watch it. What I will say is regardless of the critics here who trash this film, it really comes together well. There are many good moments, funny parts, and the ending is pretty great.Hollywood demands conflict, so enter Clyde (played by Spacey). His character is annoying, and a big reason why some may not like this movie. There's room for improvement elsewhere as well...But where Fred Claus really does well is Main Street, the elves, workshop, and the snow globe is just great. I admit this could have been better, but there is originality here. Further, I like Paul Giamatti as Santa, I like the chemistry between him and Vince, and Kathy Bates is just fine.I look forward to this movie every year and I watch it multiple times every year. It's grand, festive, colorful, I haven't gotten sick of it, and to me it's great.Every kid deserves a present at Christmas! I think Santa should trash the naughty and nice list.Oh one more thing, when they're delivering presents, the song sounds like it's sung by Elizabeth Banks.",Fred Claus
67,Jack_Acid,"Disjointed, poor script and above all....unfunny?!",4,23 November 2007,"How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.",Fred Claus
68,johnclones,funny,10,21 November 2007,"Is very funny. It is like a lot of Santa Claus movies starts out in time immortal and ends up in today. The acting is good there are some funny scenes. There are many good visual effects in the movie. No movies have ever made reference to Santa Claus have any siblings or other relatives. It does not say what country of origin that Santa Claus came from. It hints that he had come from up north. Santa Claus is a form of St.Nicholas. He is the patron saint of children and sailors. Also of Denmark, Holland and Russia. That is who Santa Claus is modled from. One movie that this reminds me of is ""Santa Claus"" from 1985 with Dudly More. I see a lot of similarities between the 2 films.",Fred Claus
69,gpaltrow2001,They blew it,4,22 November 2007,"All of the ingredients of a ""concept movie"" were there. Big production, big names, and a very clever idea: Santa's brother is a schlub, and what would happen if there were a forced reconnection? It should have worked, except that the script was obviously re-worked to the point of exhaustion, and the direction was poor. Vincent Vaughn continues his ad-lib wiseacre shtick to the point of annoyance. There were enormous holes in the plot where things happened that simply didn't make sense. The 'bad guy', played by Kevin Spacey, works for a 'board' that is never explained; how can they trump the magic of Santa?? Fred and Santa's Dad, who was warm and loving in the beginning of the film, had NO lines for the rest of it! An IMDb reviewer wrote that the self-help group was hilarious. Well, it WAS funny; it simply was in the wrong film. It was an incongruous scene. The darker parts of the story overwhelmed the sunny payoff (and the sunny payoff was predictable). There was just enough sexual innuendo to make parents escorting young children uncomfortable. The brilliant Kathy Bates was wasted as Santa and Fred's Mom. There are some bright points to earn the film the 4 stars, the main one being Paul Giamatti. He was an excellent choice to play the iconic role in a 'believable' way! The North Pole and Santa's sleigh were great fun (but why no personality given to any of the reindeer?!). Wasted talents in a mostly downer film. As my girlfriend said, ""It's no 'Elf'"".",Fred Claus
70,Yoshi6666,The pinnacle of bad movies,1,11 November 2007,"So, we have encountered countless holiday movies, all involving Santa Claus. But there are those movies that just SUCK. Well, I enjoyed Elf a good bit, so I decided I just might as well check it out to see if it sucks or not. Paul and Vince are my favorite movie actors, and well, this time, they just sucked on the screen. Now, as for the plot, they actually tried doing something new, which is add Santa Claus's brother. Now, that actually wouldn't be such a bad idea for a Christmas film, I though, but no, I was wrong.The jokes were so old, pretty drawn out. The dialouge was predictable every second. Nothing really looked fascinating. It reminded me too much of The Santa Claus 3 (shivers). I think this movie wouldn't be too bad for children, but the fact that it wouldn't be even entertaining to ME, now that's a ground breaker. I think parents wouldn't enjoy this movie as a two year old would. So, I think this movie should be canned.",Fred Claus
71,stephfarinelli-17890,"Hilarious, cute, sweet, funny, and just plain fun!",8,20 December 2019,"I watched this movie because I saw that Vince Vaughn was in it and then, to my surprise, the actor that played his brother, he was in it, and I was really pleased, because I love these two actors. Anyway, as I said, I picked this movie to watch recently, out of like ten Christmas movies to choose from, I saw Vince V's name, and of course, Fred Clause was the one I picked! There are some hilarious scenes in this movie-and they are hilarious every time I see them(I have watched it three times now!). Also, there are even tear jerker scenes but not overboard, they kept it light, just right for a Christmas movie. This movie is great for anybody to watch. It will entertain you no matter what age you are. My boyfriend isn't really into ""cute"" movies-he likes action, guns, and crime; but he loved this movie. So if you are looking for a movie to satisfy everyone in the house, this I would highly recommend. I loved it!",Fred Claus
72,cristos21,I love this movie,9,28 November 2020,"I don't understand why the bad reviews. I loved this movie. It was taken from a new approach. I love"" all kids deserve a present.

73,shahdadayoughi,Vince Vaughn is the weakest link,2,7 December 2019,"As always Vince Vaughn is the ""weakest link"" of ANY movie he is in. He is ALWAYS same with his shoulders up and tense as if he is suffering constipation Or holds tight to fight extreme diarrhea. Always talentless and always bad. I. Every role and every movie he is the exact same.
Maybe knows powerful people so he lands on some second hand role but always the ""weakest link"".
He single handedly brought this livid down from possible 7 or 8 to 2 or even 1.",Fred Claus
74,s-maniatopoulos,Paul Giammati is divine,8,25 December 2020,"It baffles me that this movie has such a low rating. It's a fun Xmas comedy, not meant to be taken seriously. The story is pretty original, the plot obviously has some staggering holes in order to tell a story, however the reason this stands out is the exceptional performance by Paul Giammati, who is nothing short of epic, and carries the whole movie.
Watch it cause it's a good-feel Xmas flick, with a few memorable lines. It also addresses the complicated relationship between brothers, something that is often overlooked by Hollywood movies.
It's fun, it has some pretty funny moments, it's got a great cast, and above all, it's got a magical Paul Giammati.
Definitely way better than the ridiculous 5,6/10 rating it's currently carrying.PS: I don't watch romantic comedies, I don't like goofy comedies, and I'm not one of those ppl who think the greatest actor ever is Adam Sandler.",Fred Claus
75,ljarsonbeck-1,very very enjoyable,8,26 November 2007,I have seen 8 films in the last 72 hours and I can tell you now this one was worth the money. When I first saw the one sheet with Vaughn and Giamatti together it made no difference to me who played Santa because it couldn't help but be a hit- then I saw the trailers- and the more I saw the trailers the less I wanted to see this film(despite being a Joel Silver Production). Pay no attention to the spoilers- this film was great!!Fred Clause is blessed with a baby brother he loves but can not measure up in the eyes of his mother- Nick though saintly has his flaws too (even his wife is concerned about his eating habits) Fred is always on the shady side of a get rich quick scheme and when one of those schemes get him in jail- with no one else to call he calls Nick much to the dismay of his sister in law. Eventually the hundreds of years of sibling rivalry come to a boil and the trouble still isn't over. If the highlights you have seen of this movie leave you thinking it is a cookie cutter story about the cool brother helping out the square- think again. There are many gems amid the films unseen scenes- and anyone with a heart or funny bone will not be disappointed- this film was great.,Fred Claus
76,thirteeninchwinch,Pointless & Forgettable,2,24 June 2012,"A pointless and forgettable plot and a rubbish villain and 'twist' waste a cast that should be able to make a good movie. If you're going to sacrifice all the warmth and joy of a typical Christmas movie in order to try and make a comedy, then you should at least make it funny. The reality of this world is poorly constructed and I can't get past the fact that this family's immortality is largely ignored. Not only should Vince's immortality completely undermine his big romance, but it should have been mined for the humour and the calamity that it would cause within his existence in the real world. It seemed like the only idea for humour that the makers of this film had was to direct Vince to ad lib and go off on an angry and disjointed aside. Just bad.",Fred Claus
77,jcs_stanley,Unfuny festive folly.,3,20 December 2011,"Fred Claus. Hmmm . Did Fred by any chance claw the comedy out of this movie? I say that because this film is perhaps the most humourless piece of dribble in the history of Christmas kind. It would cause the mince pies to go off, the Elfs at the north pole to go on strike and most of all Santa to go ""Ho, Ho, NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"" a bit like Darth Vader having watch the this lump of coal flick that stars Vince Vaughn a man who I find difficult to find funny in comedy.It's just that the film never tries to try anything funny And as a result were left sentimental moments sure but at the cost of the humour which goes to show that like Arnold Swazernegger, Vaughn here had to find about a bad Christmas film the HARD way.We also have a plot line involving an evil Inspector played by Kevin Spacey which goes into an almost insulting plot-line that Christmas is treated like a cooperation that has to do well or get shut down. What the Holy Yuletide red nosed reindeer hell!? (no offence Rudolph). We also have another plot-thread that's established but immediately forgotten and Dismissed which Involves Vaughn's Character's girlfriend getting together with someone else.The concept seems promising at first but Ultimately THIS sleigh ride comes crashing down.",Fred Claus

This movie is fun to watch at the Box-Office. Brilliantly Funny to watch. Vince Vaughn is a funny actor who ever played The Brother of Santa Claus named Fred. I hilariously laughed my tail off. It's a great Christmas movie to watch. ""FRED CLAUS"" is like Disney's SANTA CLAUS 1, 2, Miracle on 34th Street, A Christmas Story, The Santa Claus Movie.The elves were funny on this movie that they were giving Fred a hard time.

So, there's no reason to use the phrase in place of what is actually written by the author Josef Mohr. If their purpose was to take Christ's name out of the hymn and thereby out of Christmas the producers should have simply chosen some other music to accompany the closing Christmas morning montage.

He is my favorite actor since forever and i really enjoyed watching him along with other great cast members, like Paul, Kev Spacey and Ludicrous.It's a perfect holiday movie and it'll have great voting history a month from now.

81,yaadpyar,Too Many Story Lines,5,17 November 2007,"Could have been good. Predictable but touching story about the true meaning of Christmas spirit - that there are no naughty kids, but sometimes you have to look deeper for nice. Predictable can be told well and originally.BUT - there were too many distractions from the main story of the sibling rivalry between Santa & Fred. The ""efficiency expert"" was completely unnecessary and created a terrible distraction. For example, the ""Siblings Anonymous"" bit was cute, but like so much else, needed much tighter editing. What should have been a sly wink turned into a club that beat me over the head with its cleverness, inevitably resulting in a headache for me.The meaning of Christmas (love, forgiveness, family...) is always touching, but here it was in the most schmaltzy, sentimental way - too easy a cry, instead of going for the deeper, more real potential that such great actors offered. I don't know if it was the script, the editing or the direction that kept me yawning continuously, but I didn't fall asleep or walk out...",Fred Claus
82,jonnyk12,Predictable,5,27 February 2008,"First of all I don't know why this film came out way before Christmas, but that doesn't matter. I thought this film wouldn't be like most Christmas films with Santa and some unfortunate guy normally who becomes Santa for a night or forever and everybody's happy. I was wrong. Anyway the film starts with creation, I suppose, of Santa Clause (Paul Giamatti - The Illusionist, Sideways and Shoot 'Em Up) and why his brother Fred Clause (Vince Vaughn - Wedding Crashers, Dodgeball and Starsky & Hutch) hates him so much. It then jumps into the future where Fred is having money and girlfriend problems (Rachel Weisz  The Mummy films and Constantine). To get the money he needs he decides to ask his loving brother who just can't say no. so he says yes. But only if Fred helps out at his workshop at the North Pole. Fred is not the only guy having problems as Santa Clause's workshop is under inspection from the evil-ish inspector Clyde (Kevin Spacey  Superman Returns and L.A. Confidential). This carries on with Fred becoming friends with an elf called Willie (John Michael Higgins), who also has girlfriend problems, angry elves, loads of dancing and music, a brotherly fight, more girlfriend problems, a Superman cape, lots of chimneys, biscuits and milk, an disappointing part that leaves you thinking and a bit more dancing. This film has been saved by the cast, but also has kind of wasted there acting talents, mainly those of Paul Giamatti. So overall it's like most Christmas films, great for the family but you can predict the ending by the middle. It was a funny film with jokes for both adults and children. Also this film is the only true Christmas film this Christmas.",Fred Claus
83,vikezupa,Dark Comedy for the family ??,5,24 November 2007,"I took my kids to see it and they just didn't get into it. I noticed that about half-way through folks started shifting around and talking. Kids started getting restless. As for the movie: The visuals were good and a couple of scenes we're fun but, alas, it was a waste as far as 'taking the kids to the movies'. I had the feeling that none of the actors could remember their lines cause they just kept stumbling over them. It has some great actors but they, along with the story line fed into the 'not-funny, dark comedy' feel. O.k. so we have a movie that's supposed to be a Christmas-dark comedy for the family ? Impossible. I don't think it was a complete waste but I won't see it again or rent it.",Fred Claus

Up to that point, the story line was dry, it didn't flow, often times I was completely confused as to what was trying to be conveyed to the audience. Paul Giamatti was lukewarm at best as Santa and Miranda RIchardson was talent wasted as Mrs. Claus. Even Kathy Bates was not funny! Vince Vaughn's character is a clone of the disgruntled, sarcastic guy that he has played in many of his past movies, and even his comedic take on the character couldn't save this movie. Little ones may enjoy the music, the pretty lights and the distraction of the elves and such, but there was no continuity in the story line and overall this was a disappointment.",Fred Claus

The movie is good at times, really great at other times, and it drags a little in the middle, but it does deliver the holiday spirit. It is a great movie to take the family and relax. Great to enjoy with love and realize that the holidays are coming again, and this year is a great opportunity to fix any wrongs in our life.Is it the best movie holiday ever? No!, but it will make laugh at times, and you will come out of theater feeling happy because the holidays are coming.So, take a break and enjoy the movie for what it is. Don't expect a master piece, just know that it is a movie that will entertain you for couple of hours.",Fred Claus
86,TheDoctorAnd,Uninteresting & Dull,3,17 January 2013,"I wasn't looking forward to watching this film, particularly seeing as Vince Vaughn was playing the main character (having seen several of his films, the only good one I can name is Into The Wild). My pre-worries weren't wrong.Fred Claus is the older brother of Nick Claus, aka Santa. As you could imagine, it isn't very easy to keep up with a high achieving person such as Santa, so rivalry on Fred's part is to be expected, and by the 21st century, hasn't seen Nick or their parents in many years as a result. In this film, Nick tries to bring his brother closer to his family. Unfortunately, the safety inspector, who hates Santa, is attempting to get Santa's workshop out of business, and uses Fred as a reason to get it closed.Don't let this film fool you, because whilst it may be listed as a comedy, few genuine laughs are had, and nothing more than a slight smile is had at the best of jokes. However, it does get a little better (enjoyment wise, not funnier) as the film draws to a close, but not greatly.I think it had an interesting story in including a brother for Santa, but the script didn't live up to it. Some jokes needed to be done in a different way/to be reworded in order to get that comedic value that they lacked as they were, although these jokes wouldn't have been hellishly funny either way.It's disappointing to see how many big names were drawn into this production. You won't consider this to be a best work of the likes of Elizabeth Banks or Kevin Spacey. It's a little hard to believe that a man who had previously won 2 Oscars couldn't land a better film in 2007 than this.I wouldn't say ""Consider"" skipping this. I'd say DEFINITELY skip it. You can watch better things than this with 2 hours to spare.",Fred Claus

He just might become my new favorite Santa.Vince Vaughn isn't one of my favorites, but he fills the bill in this. The humorous emphasis on his six and a half stature did get a bit tiring though.And Kevin Spacey definitely comes across as the villain. I will cue you in on one scene without spoiling it...just remember that Spacey's roles include Lex Luthor and you'll appreciate one scene in particular.Everyone mentions the Siblings Anonymous scene and that is truly an outstanding scene. However, nobody has mentioned the pivotal snowball fight scene. And this was one of Giamatti's best scenes....I felt like cheering just seeing Santa lose his cool....All in all, this is a predictable film, but I think you'll enjoy the trip.

The premise of Santa Claus having a brother was a new twist though I must admit the whole save the day approach to Santa and Christmas was a little formula. Vince Vaughn was charming and funny as usual. The sibling rivalry was hilarious especially when Fred goes to a support group. Kids won't get that but adults will enjoy it. I laughed out loud numerous times as did the kids. : ) I was disappointed that they have a couple who live together instead of getting married.. especially in a movie that is supposed to be geared toward the family. I am tired of that in movies.. it is just shacking up and shows no commitment and it is not the example I want the kids to have. We talk about it and how unfortunate it is to have in the movie and that it is not a good way to live. Not good for anyone. But that was the only thing that I really found objectionable for kids. It really is pretty PG. refreshing! We felt happy and like we had fun when we left the theater. I say go see it! If you want something that is critically acclaimed but depressing like Breaking Up then don't go see it.

90,DragStrip,Generally lame Christmas comedy,4,25 December 2007,"Do you know why ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is guaranteed a to be shown every year when Christmas comes around? It's because it is probably the only Christmas comedy to produce major laughs. As James Berardinelli said, if we take it away, what do we replace it with exactly? There have been several attempts to usurp its position in recent years, and Fred Claus is one of the least successful. To keep it succinct, the comedy is generally unfunny and the sentimentality grating, aside from a couple of nice moments. Giamatti and Richardson give good performances, but Vaughn and Weisz are fairly awful. To give the film its credit there are a couple of scenes which work brilliantly; the first meeting between Spacey's bureaucrat character and the Clauses, and Fred's ""siblings anonymous"" meeting. These are fantastically inventive and witty scenes, sadly unrepresentative of the movie.To be fair, it's not that much worse than the overrated ""Elf"".",Fred Claus

Throw in some other stellar performances from Kathy Bates, Trevor Peacock, Elizabeth Banks and the always believable Kevin Spacey and you've got yourself a Christmas classic.Don't go into this movie expecting to not like it because of some of the negative reviews.",Fred Claus
92,NancyLou9,It won't win any Oscars but it was a nice holiday movie...,9,3 November 2007,"I saw a sneak preview of this today at a military installation and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, Vince Vaughn's character can get a little annoying, but I think that's kind of the point.Throughout the movie, we are shown the brother of Santa Claus who is everyone's favorite and most emphatic love, and his own brother HATES him! Okay,hate is a strong word. When asked, Fred actually says, ""No, I don't hate you. I just wish you had never been born."" Then we are presented with a mother who's sole reason for being is to adore her son Nicholas while working overtime to make Fred feel like dirt on her shoes. This is very much a guy with self-esteem and family issues. His life is in the toilet and he has no real ambition beyond ""get rich quick"".It is through a series in interactions not just with his brother (though he is a big part of it) but with the elves, his parents and his girlfriend that he comes to realize what a waste his life has really been. It is also the same time he realizes he hasn't really been the brother he promised he'd be.As much as I am trying to avoid saying too much about the movie, I really feel my favorite scene was in the room full of siblings of famous people. Wow, was that funny! ""He's not Alec!!!!"" Don't go to this looking for any award winning moments, though I will say there were a couple times I got a little emotional. This is Christmas entertainment with a wonderful cast and well-written script. The North Pole sets were beautiful and elves hilarious. As much as I enjoyed ""The Santa Clause"", I enjoyed ""Fred Clause"" more.Go see it and take the kids. There's nothing in it that is too racy. There's a message in there too and everyone will love the movie. In the end, we are left with a good Christmas-y feeling.The only reason I rated it nine out of ten stars is because for a short time in the beginning, it seemed to drag a little bit, belaboring the point that Fred was a loser who cared for no one but himself.",Fred Claus

Fred's dad, played by Trevor Peacock (of Vicar of Dibley fame, amongst others), had about one line.The plot was predictable and all over the place, and the humour was... lacking. (However, there was one part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) Don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head-on collision with a train (actually- maybe the train would be better...)",Fred Claus

97,Willemite,It is what it is,4,25 November 2007,"Every Christmas eve I make my kids endure yet another showing of It's A Wonderful Life. I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa. So sue me. I admit it. I like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. I like excellent, intelligent ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. What would the Christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of Santa in all his guises, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will make no one forget Bedford Falls, but I do not believe a Christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed. ""Fred"" is a perfectly OK holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top-notch Santa, which helped a lot. Not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice. There's nothing wrong with that.",Fred Claus
98,wunderwhirl,Bit the dust,3,25 November 2007,"Okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since Fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say. To start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic. Simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void. example; who the heck is trying to 'shut down' Santa clause? Is it some sort of corporation? A little explanation would of been lovely. Second: The movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care. Third: I suppose this was suppose to be a family film? Its rating was low at just PG. For a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. It didn't bother me, but if i were a parent i could see a problem. Through the whole movie Paul Giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. Vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies. mouthy frat boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he's been good in other movies)so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce, film and release this flick. In my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick, or if you HAVE to see it save it for a rainy day rental.",Fred Claus
99,NapoleonX,Oh Dear.,1,6 January 2008,"I had to watch this movie as part of my job. I work in a school and as an end of year treat we took our kids to a film of their choice. Well actually we took them to two. The Golden Compass and Fred Claus.Guess who drew the short straw.OK. I knew it was gonna be bad before we even reached the cinema. I'd seen trailers. I was even getting paid to sit in a cinema and watch a film.I'd gladly pay back my wage for the two hours of my life that I lost watching this piece of sewage. A few years ago, the Frat Pack brought out Elf which is one of the most delightful Christmas films I have ever watched. Cute, cuddly, most importantly, funny.Now, I do believe that at some point, this film was a good film. Look at the cast - Giametti, Vaughn, Spacey, Kathy Bates, Miranda Richardson, Rachel Weisz. You don't get that many stars in a film that is a dead cert crap fest. So at some point, there was some good in this movie. Unfortunately if you hired every private detective in Tinsel Town they wouldn't be able to find it. How they kept those stars on after the good parts of this movie went out the window can only be explained by hypnotism or mind altering drugs, or possibly huge wads of cash.This film is so utterly moronic that at ten minutes in I was fighting to stay awake. At 30 mins, I was fighting to keep my food down. At 45 mins another group walked out of the cinema and I had to fight myself not to join them, bearing in mind that I was supervising young children.By the time the end of the second hour rolled around I was catatonic. My motor functions had shut down and I was close to comatose. If the film had gone on much longer then the first ever case of murder by movie watching could have occurred.Take my advice. If you wish to remain sane. Do not, on any account, watch this thing that dares to call itself a film.",Fred Claus
100,JuliaGulia967264,This North Pole Visit Isn't Worth the Trip,3,14 November 2007,"It's a creative idea. What would life be like for the naughty older brother of St. Nick? Spending a lifetime in the shadow of one of the world's biggest pop culture icons would certainly be a lonely and bitter one. Unfortunately none of Vince Vaughn's (Wedding Crashers, Old School) typical ranting monologues and improvisational humor are able to save this season's Fred Claus, another addition to the holiday stinker's hall of fame.Fans of Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kathy Bates, Rachel Weisz, Kevin Spacey, and Ludicrous will be thoroughly disappointed. The laughs are nearly nonexistent, and the acting talents of this powerful cast are put to waste on a weak screenplay. Even Vaughn's improv humor, generally hilarious in his other well-known comedies, does not deliver. (A few of the lines were even word-for-word repeats of lines he's uttered in other films.) Ultimately there is not enough yuletide spirit to lift this movie out of the dumps. It will not appeal to younger siblings, college students or adults. The film billed as this season's newest holiday classic is a dud that will only keep Vaughn amused, as he laughs along with his $20 million dollar paycheck, all the way to the bank.",Fred Claus

GREAT START
PERFECT STORYLINE
FANTASTIC ENDING
BRILLIANT ACTORS
MERRY CHRISTMAS FRED",Fred Claus
103,ozzie227,Loved Fred,9,16 December 2007,We were surprised. After reading many negative reviews we had a good word of mouth referral from a friend. Our friend was right. Fred was funny throughout with many funny lines and scenes. I am usually not a big Vince fan but he was super as Fred. Once again this proves why they make so many flavors of ice cream.My wife and I are in our fifty's and thought this was more for adults than kids due to its quick dialog.(USA Spelling)The supporting cast was very good. It was nice to see Kathy Bates as Fred's Mom. She didn't overact like she often does. All Paul Giamatti has to do is stare and make faces to crack me up. He also played the Santa role without going overboard. The action scenes were nicely played without being drawn out as in many slapstick movies. Go see this flick.,Fred Claus
104,dagourick,Two Miscast Actors and Partridge in a Pear Tree.,5,15 December 2019,"As much as I like Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti they were sorely miscast in this nice, little Christmas movie. A couple different actors would have easily sent this into my top 5 Christmas movies , however, there are still some nice moments and it's a good story and well acted. Anyway, give it a shot and let's hope for a remake in the near future.",Fred Claus
105,nicholasjspears,Classic Vince Vaughn,7,1 December 2007,"You got to know what it is going into it. Its a heart felt comedy Christmas movie. Vaughn had some classic lines (especially the opening scene with the little girl) and I thought carried the movie rather well. Kind of odd not hearing him swear, but in a good way. The guy is funny.Good acting from Paul and Spacey, plus you got to love the dude from Best in Show! If you wanna just chill out and see a fun movie with the kids, this will at least entertain you. Good special effects too. Bad cameo by Ludicrous. Elf is better, but who cares? The blonde elf is hot too... she makes it worth it!",Fred Claus
106,alsmithee2,Christmas Yuks and Yucks,6,26 November 2007,"The best Christmas movies are about connection. Connection to one's family (It's a Wonderful Life), connection to one's past (A Christmas Story), and the sometimes-strained connections that can be dark and twisted and at the same time powerful (Bad Santa).The makers of Fred Claus understand this. Fred's a well-written character, even if it's odd to think of him as a centuries-old man-child. Vince Vaughn does his usual dog-and-pony show and hams it up to add some heart, and it surprisingly works. All of the other characters fill in nicely around him, led by a killer performance of Paul Giamatti as a weight-obsessed Saint Nick straining at the seams to keep everything running smoothly. Rachel Weisz as Fred's girlfriend, Kevin Spacey as the dastardly efficiency expert... I could go on. The ties that bind these characters together seem real, even when they are only briefly explored.These are the foundations for the best moments, when the bonds between the characters are strained by holiday- and life-fueled stress. When Slam (the friendly kid who Fred allows to hang out due to the boy's turbulent family life) is hauled away by child services, Fred gives him some advice: only look out for yourself. You know it's not exactly the best advice, but you understand where Fred is coming from and why he's saying it and why the kid listens to him. They aren't related, but they are connected. And it works.There are dozens of these small moments throughout the various stories in the film, and if they focused more on a few of them, Fred Claus could have been a classic. But it's not the quantity connections that this film is sorely lacking. It's their quality.Don't believe me? Here's the story in as brief a statement as I can make it. Fred and Nick are brothers, but Nick's good intentions alienate Fred at a young age, and when Nick becomes Santa Claus, the two freeze in time and thus live out several hundred years barely talking. Fred now wants to run an OTB spot, but is in trouble with the cops and his girlfriend and needs fifty thousand dollars, so he takes a trip up to see his brother to try and weasel some money out of him. Nick, meanwhile, is desperately trying to get all of the toys out on schedule and dealing with an efficiency expert sent to evaluate the North Pole operation; if everything doesn't go JUST right, their family will be torn apart and Christmas will be canceled.That's just the A story. Along the way, Fred finds out that his girlfriend might be seeing other men and that his kind words to Slam have turned him down a naughty path (although making Slam the number one worst kid in America, simply for getting into a fight, stretches credulity JUST a bit). Kevin Spacey's efficiency expert has his own agenda, and let's not even get into the politics of the workshop.There's just too much here and too many questions that need to be answered and resolved. There's the love story, the brotherly-love story, the ""poor kid who goes down a bad path but then is righted by some sage advice"" story (not just once, but three times). Santa must save his factory. Santa must work with his elves. Santa must re-work the whole ""naughty-nice"" business to please a more politically-correct generation (no kid is naughty, just misunderstood). Fred needs to grow up. Fred needs money. Fred needs his gal. And then there's the love story between a hot (and apparently uniquely normal-sized) helper and a two-foot dwarf. The main story is drowning in a sea of B-Plots that all wind up going somewhere but missing all of the stops along the way.The Santa Claus story (North Pole, Reindeer, one-night-flight) can't stand much examination on it's own, and by adding even more, too many questions are left unresolved for even the most reality-removed film-goer. Why does Santa even NEED an efficiency expert? Who exactly OWNS Christmas? Why, if Santa and Fred are immortal, do the two brothers need to watch their weight? What are the mechanics of elf/human love? Why is it that only a CLAUS can drive the sled? Where do these elves come from? Had the film taken two or three of these ideas, fully fleshed them out, and cut off the excess, Fred Claus could have been great. There are lots of funny jokes, and while Vaughn strains against the PG-muzzle that's been place on him, he still finds plenty of moments. Giamatti and Spacey also get in on the act, and there isn't a dull moment in the picture. Even the film looks great. Unfortunately, there's just too much heart and not enough screen time to go around, even when there's so much that could have made this film fantastic.",Fred Claus
107,kamsander,Stylish rubbish,2,31 May 2016,"It is a well made (Hollywood glamour) Christmas movie about Santa Claus' older brother Fred and his relationship with his, especially, mother. And it was not good. Both the movie and the relations.Only good for having kids to dip in Christmas spirit i guess, but not entertaining enough to do so.And Vince Vaughn is terribly handsome, tall, and everything. but he is terribly BORING as well. Always talk in the same way in all the movies I know of, fast, monotonous and non-stop.If you zero your head and expectations this might be fun, despite Vince. Otherwise waste of (movie) time.",Fred Claus
108,hsellars,Pause for Claus,8,25 November 2007,"This movie hit on many emotional vibes of Brothers & Sons and for that I give it a great recommendation... It spoke to my nephew, he liked it - I think he appreciated the honesty in the relationships. Vince Vaughn has a great sarcastic humor that fits his character well... and I thought they did a great job showing how messy lives can get before they get any better ~ how hurtful small things can be, and how amplified they become as we grow. Kevin Spacey was a nice plus...they could have developed that a little better - but it was good. Overall, I felt a couple adjustments would have made it perfect, it was a GREAT idea (Santa's Brother) made us laugh and we were real happy about seeing it... I would recommend it definitely.",Fred Claus
109,phoxytwicks-11543,If you have siblings - there's a lot to love here,9,22 December 2019,"Quite a few reviews for this are unnecessarily harsh and seem to forget something very important - how you relate to the film. Thats what Christmas movies, romances and well most films are trying to do. And if you have siblings you should quite quickly understand it to some level.The film starts with two children, brothers, Fred and Nicholas..Fred Claus is the overshone older brother of Saint Nick. Fred, has become distant from his family and brother and lives with a dog eat dog world attitude - he is a survivor to the harshness of life like most of us. Verging on being a bad guy.Saint Nick - being the younger, and tirelessly happy and outgoing, wins his father and mothers affections for his generosity and kindness especially empathy towards the less fortunate. This creates jealously and a split between the two brothers because of not just how different they are but because of their parents love. Not helped by their parents saying 'why cant you be like your brother' to Fred, several times.Their relationship hits a breaking point when the Fred is seen on a tree branch talking to his one friend, a bird next to a bird house. Abruptly the tree is cut down by Saint Nick, causing the bird house, tree and Fred to fall. Shattering the house and scaring Freds one friend away forever.At this point we're given something very big to relate too. Freds despair and loneliness, a sibling whom does everything to please everyone but doesn't see yet see the hurt in his brothers eyes.The brothers then go their seperate ways. Were to believe Fred is seen as the disappointment by the family. An opposite to Nicholas.The film then takes us to adulthood, the brothers in their 30s and 40s and how they both need each other at this moment in their lifes. Fred living a life as a repo man, dating a girl and saving at any cost (unscrupulous ways) to put a deposit down on a apartment. Nicholas has become a Saint meanwhilst and is none other than Santa, the deliverer of presents and joy to children the world over. The pressure, of his responsibilities taking its toll on Saint Nick. Fred needing cash to secure his new home. They cross paths for this reason -both to each others disappoint initially.Fred is hired to help Christmas go smoothly in exchange for money. Fred meets the elves and things go from bad to worse as he tries to change things and break up the monotony. Hes only task is to mark children as Naughty or Nice. Naughty children dont get presents. Fred relates to being a naughty child and decides everyone deserves presents because naughty children all have reasons for being that way.Something I want to remind viewers of this review is, a lot of families stop speaking for little to no reason in life. My own being one. We alm take for granted in life and connections to our own is one. And although there is little reason why Saint Nick has not reconciled the brotherly relationship until now, hes clearly human like any one of us.The film then takes a turn of Kevin Spacey appearing as Dr Northcutt. A miserable something year old intending to stop christmas as some power has decided go on a efficiency drive in mind of children wanting more andmore presents.With the brothers arrangement going wrong and Saint Nick exploding at the possibility of giving all children presents, Mr Northcutt makes a final decision to shut down the Christmas factory. Its only then revealed to Fred that Mr northcutt is the way he is because he was a naughty child and didn't get a present he asked for. So naturally hates Christmas.With everything ruined, the brothers have a fight and go their own way again. Fred having his money and Saint Nick losing everything. Only then something must change to Save Christmas and something does. (No Spoilers).Great casting of actors and screenplays. Theres not a lot to not like about this film and honestly who doesnt need to reconnect with someone out there or needs reminding? Great film and very humbling.There's more depth than people realise whilst keeping it fun throughout and not too somber.Definately watch this!",Fred Claus
110,maddi-41173,Vince Vaughn rules,10,5 January 2020,"Everyone giving this any less than 10/10 is wrong. This movie is comedy gold. If this helps enjoy it more, just imagine that every time you've seen Vaughn in a movie it's just Fred Claus living out his immortal life.",Fred Claus
111,ishuanand,Very Underrated movie,10,7 August 2008,"I have to be honest, when this movie came out I wasn't very keen on seeing this movie, even though it had Vince in the lead whose comedy i really like, it was the whole premise of the movie which was putting me off and reading the reviews did not help either because they were not doing the movie any justice. Now finally after a good 8 or 9 months of the films theatrical release, I happened to get it on DVD and boy was I surprised. This film is not your average Vince Vaughn comedy film with lots of slick lines, it has a very few of those, I think this was marketed a little bit vaguely because it certainly is not a comedy but it is a good drama/family movie with quite a lot of heart and especially if you have a brother, watch this movie it wont change your life or anything but for those 2 hours it will make you feel good about yourself.",Fred Claus
112,mnmchurch,Good FAMILY Christmas Movie,9,9 November 2007,"This movie was set up for bad critic ratings by the ad department that decided to tie it to ""Wedding Crashers"".This movie is Jim Carrey-esquire (see ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Liar Liar"") in that it is a Dramady.It turns from Comedy to drama somewhere mid-plot and doesn't turn back. This movie is ideal for the first one, of this genre, for the season. It is very child appropriate and is well worth the inflated theater prices to go see. It will put you in the mood to hear Christmas songs on the radio in WalMart's everywhere already! To all who heed my advice, Enjoy!",Fred Claus
113,scorcher86,Feel good holiday movie,7,24 November 2007,"This movie is a just plain fun holiday movie whose humor reminded me of Tim Allen's Santa Clause. Vince Vaughn will have you laughing in your seat while at the same time empathizing with his story and feeling sorry for him. Besides Fred Claus, the other actors/actresses complement each other well, and throughout the story everyone's story is accounted for in some way to give the viewers an understanding of what's to come next for them. Despite some cliché moments and a lack of complex editing and green screen work, the movie's content makes up for some of its technological shortcomings. All in all, despite what others may say, this movie is a great entertaining feel good family movie and I would suggest going to see it.",Fred Claus
114,nelsonespe,Vince Vaughn at his best,10,10 November 2007,"Let me tell you, i was very disappointed with all the negative reviews i am reading from people on here. I went into the theater last night not expecting to much because of what everybody is saying, and let me tell you, this movie was great. It worked for on all levels for me, it worked as a Christmas movie, it worked at showcasing Vince Vaughn, and let me tell you, no one else could have played his role better then he did, and it worked as a family film getting the true points across of this movie. What i loved so much about this movie, was like the beginning said, the story is about Fred, so the movie is a little darker compared to most Christmas movies. Sure it makes you feel good, and has some sappy clichés, but there are some very dark elements to this movie, like the scene with Kevin Spacey and Vince Vaughn talking outside in the snow. I loved so much how this movie was not trying to be a Christmas movie, and was just telling Freds story. There are some very funny parts in this movie, like the beginning of the movie where Fred is asking for money for charity, and pretty much all the scenes with Willie the Elf are funny. I must add that special effects and the make up were outstanding. Did you see Paul Giamattis hands. He really looked like Santa Claus. And how all those elf's were digitized to look like Elfs, just amazing work. So all in all, the movie does its job in getting you in the mood for Christmas, but don't look at it as a Christmas movie, look at it as a movie about a dysfunctional family trying to reconnect through Santa Claus. Vince Vaughn could never be better. I loved every part of this movie, quite frankly I didn't want it to end! P.S. Kevin Spacey did an amazing job as an evil business man trying to take down the North Pole.",Fred Claus
115,noproblempablo,David Dobkin is a terrible director,1,9 November 2007,"Fred Claus is the worst movie of the year and maybe the worst Christmas movie ever. Dobkin's ""Clay Pigeons"" was his first and last good movie and all he seems able to do is milk Vince Vaughn dry. He has no eye, no sense for pacing or plot, and a complete inability to keep a consistent tone. Don't just blame the writers. A better director could have done something with this idea. Like say Jon Faveau whose ""Elf"" Dobkin clearly saw one to many times yet somehow managed to learn nothing from beyond outright joke theft. ""Fred Claus"" has zero redeeming qualities. It's a jumbled mess that deserves to bomb big that suffers from all of the above as well as a general nastiness that is just no fun. On the other hand this is one of those dumps that makes you realize anybody can be a Hollywood filmmaker.",Fred Claus
116,joab-70946,Great Christmas movie,8,15 February 2018,"Surprisingly, Santa Claus has a brother, Fred. He is not a happy man and always getting himself into trouble. This stemmed from his life-long resentment for his brother, Nick (Santa Claus). When Fred got into a really big predicament, Nicholas bailed him out (literally). To pay off the debt, Nick has Fred come to the North Pole to make toys. Things had been rough up there so Nick needed the help anyway. This was working out but Nick had to watch Fred constantly because he was always making a mess of things.Nick had his hands full trying to keep production up and his brother out of trouble but that was nothing compared to the efficiency expert who wanted to shut down the North Pole if production didn't meet regulation standards. Fred had always felt second-best to his brother so he messes up production any way he can as a way to give his brother some grief.I really liked this movie but I wouldn't recommend it for young children. I loved the way the North Pole was portrayed. The special effects were excellent. The North Pole never looked better.In short, this is a fun Christmas movie with some funny and not so funny parts.",Fred Claus
117,bonehead_arts,Overview review - I liked it - I was entertained!,8,2 December 2007,"This movie is *NOT* Great Art. It is fun, it is fluff, and it's a Feel-Good Christmas Movie. For all of that, it does a great job of DOING JUST THAT.The plot was predicable. The characters were likable (even the antagonist, when all's said and done). The plot points were fairly cut-and-dried. The dialog didn't hurt my brain. The cast was fan-freakin'-tastic.Vince Vaughn's character was believable. One could see the kids they had as the younger Freds growing up into Vaughn. The kids cast to play the youngest Nicholases, not quite so much, but it's mainly on hindsight. Paul Giamatti was great as Santa, and Miranda Richardson was the perfect foil for him. I kept wondering where Kevin Spacey was, but I so totally didn't recognise him as Clyde Northcut! He was fantastic!I would see this in the theater again, if I had the opportunity, and it will definitely be joining our DVD collection when it comes available. I wouldn't say this is good for kids under 7, but I wouldn't hide it from them, either. I enjoyed this film and will have no problem seeing it once more this year, and probably a bunch of times on DVD next year.",Fred Claus
118,geraldf-1,"A fun, underrated movie.",8,20 December 2010,"When this film came out, I didn't go and see it. I didn't even buy the DVD when it came out. I watched it on TV. The main reason behind this was the trailer, which really didn't do the movie justice. When I first saw the trailer, I wasn't inclined to go see it, because there was no sense of what the movie really would be about. When I saw it coming on TV, I didn't know if I would want to see it, but I started to watch anyway. From beginning to end, I enjoyed the movie. This movie will be one I look to pick up on Blu-ray in the future to add the the collection.It was also nice to see Kevin Spacey in something even if the part wasn't that flattering ;).",Fred Claus
119,coolwhiphmm,lovedddddd it!!,10,30 November 2007,OMG we LOVED this movie. My 11 yr old has been begging to see it for the last couple of weeks and we finally made it to the theater tonight. My 11 & 13 yr old girls; as well as myself and my friend were very entertained and left with a heightened Christmas spirit!! I agree with some of the others that I read about the meaning of the movie. The sibling rivalry as well as the way everything can effect you for the rest of your life if you allow it; as well as how you can also rectify those things and make your life better =) I laughed; I cried; I awwwed. Excellent movie and we will definitely watch it on DVD.. give it to me as a gift I wouldn't mind!!!! :D,Fred Claus
120,cindysbox,Nice Film,7,24 November 2007,"Essentially, a nice film. No violence of any significance, sexual references will go over small children's heads. The movie explores sibling rivalry in an interesting, pleasant way: the ""sibling anonymous"" scene was quite amusing (I think a relative of the Smothers Brothers and Morgan Freeman was in that scene. The comments from Roger Clinton ring true to life.) This is a movie that one can explore with kids when they are a bit older and in a mood to discuss sibling rivalry. It also has a lovely use of Chicago, and I loved the assaults from unexpected quarters.Interestingly, I think this movie appeals more to adults than very small children. My kids did get a little restless; my wife and I loved it.",Fred Claus

Better than Superbad and Knocked Up put together. One of the true comedies of this season and I hope there are more to come just like this because I will keep going to the movies and enjoy.

However, I bought it because I wanted something new for my 6 year old, and I really like Vince Vaughn. Many people I talked to didn't like Fred Claus because Vince Vaughn is ""the same as he is in every movie."" I happen to love that. The rest of the cast was A+ and gave perfect performances. I LOVED THIS MOVIE and would recommend it to anyone who loves Christmas! There were so many funny parts as well as heart warming sweet moments that this movie was one that my 6 year old son and I could enjoy together. I'm glad I skipped renting and just bought this movie as it will be one I look forward to every year.",Fred Claus

We own a couple hundred Christmas movies and are only able to watch a small subset each year, but I think this will go into our ""rotation"" as a perennial favorite.Vince Vaughn is his typical self - caustic but charming. Paul Giamatti is great as a jolly Santa Claus who's got just a little bit too much on his plate this year, what with family and productivity challenges . . . Kathy Bates and Trevor Peacock make great parents for the Claus siblings, and Kevin Spacey is great is his pivotal role. The special effects are also excellent: seamless and effective - the North Pole never looked better ;-)In short, this is a fun and funny Christmas movie. See it!",Fred Claus
124,dstar28ent,Not really that bad,7,9 November 2007,"While fans of Vince Vaughn may be surprised at this movie and his role, it really isn't a bad movie. It is a family movie. It is a Christmas movie. It has a good feel to it. While it is not a laugh riot, there are funny moments. The meaning behind the movie is something that is needed in this world. People need to be reminded of the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of giving, and what it means to kids. The supporting cast really help the movie and the plot. Just anybody in the supporting roles would not have made this movie. A downside of this movie is watching Kathy Bates grunt while giving birth. A big upside to the movie is Vince Vaughn still is able to use his sarcastic humor in a family film. Personally, I think Paul Giamatti played a very interesting Santa. It brought a new side of Santa very rarely seen in movies or stories.",Fred Claus

Darrell Alexander deserves an honorary Oscar for his music coordination. What a fun soundtrack.Spoiler Alert: there's a happy ending",Fred Claus
126,marfy_98,Thought it was great and even a little insightful.,7,9 November 2007,"I thought this movie was very funny. My sons were begging to go see it so on a whim we decided to take them tonight. Just got back home and the kids were so excited that they laughed about it all the way home. I also think the movie shows a lot about sibling rivalry and how over the years it can blow up and get worse without anyone really realizing that it is happening. There were a lot of funny moments and I noticed everyone in our packed theater was laughing in what seemed to me all the right areas. I think this movie also shows how childhood disappointments can have effects long into your future. Either way, it was a very entertaining way to spend 2 hours and I would see it again.",Fred Claus
127,mscoyote,Deserves only praise,10,18 November 2007,"This creative movie is a delight to watch. A new idea is developed into a film that concludes with warmth, heart, and wholesome moral values. Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kathy Bates, and Kevin Spacey are excellent, and their talents are well utilized. The movie is funny and enjoyable throughout, with a loving yuletide spirit at the end that is truly moving. The set is beautifully constructed, and the fantasy involved throughout the movie is well done. Yes, one must suspend disbelief, but that is part of the fun and to be expected in any movie about Santa Claus (and his brother). Many people will relate to the original problem that created tension between them. My ten-year-old grandson loved it, as did his grandpa and I. It is this season's holiday classic.",Fred Claus
128,SamTColeridge,"Paul fire your agent, hire a chimpanzee",2,8 November 2007,"Did anyone read the script. This has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson couldn't pull this one out. About two-thirds it looked like Giamatti eyes were saying, I can't believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I ever saw, but it's on the really really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what else can be said? Okay, the movie just doesn't move with Vaughn's con-man dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past. It was just a lackluster walk through, that no one seemed to be able to get into.",Fred Claus
129,jason-18899,This movie is my favorite. Instant classic!,9,6 December 2020,I loved this movie when it came out in the theaters and now I watch it every year during the holidays. The acting is so well done! Vince Vaughn is one of my favorites and he does a great job. Paul Giamatti is equally good as Santa. There are some really touching scenes in this movie and if you have a brother it will make you want to call him up. The message is great. The only issue I have with the movie is the target audience. Who? Kids or adults? You can say both but it gets a little confusing at times. Minor complaint. Great movie about redemption and forgiveness during the holidays. I would highly recommend it.,Fred Claus

Vince Vaughn is so short!😡",Fred Claus

One question is who is the board and why do they have so much influence? Would love a prequel to this movie centered o the board, or more information about the elves, especially Willy and Charlene.
A must see Christmas classic. Not all kids are bad, there is usually a reason.",Fred Claus
132,clarkkent_superman_krypt,The Best Santa Clause movie ever,9,11 November 2007,"This movie Rocks! This is the first Holiday movie I've ever gone to that people were actually clapping at the end of.First, Vince Vaughn as Fred Clause the older brother to Santa Clause was pure genius.Fred comes off as total jerk at the beginning of the movie, then we find out that it's because hes always in the shadow of his younger brother. Santa Clause, who gives to the children of the world the presents they have always wanted. But Santa never got the one thing he always wanted. His family altogether for the holidays. So this causes both brothers to bud heads a lot.Second, Kevin Spacey is amazing once again as the villain! Kevin Spacey's character Clyde comes to the North Pole to investigate why The North Poles production has decreased over the last few years. While Clyde is investigating the North Pole his goals to shut it down become to easy when Fred Clause comes to work for his brother Santa in the North Pole. When Fred arrives he begins causing all kinds of mayhem that delay the production of presents before Christmas. Clyde uses Fred's mayhem against Santa and promptly shuts the North Pole down. Third, Rachel Weisz is adorable as the girlfriend of Fred Clause. Having seen her work in other movies, she really was fun and energetic in this movie.Paul Giamatti really was fantastic as Santa Clause. He seemed tailor made for this role.While this movie isn't as innocent as Tim Allen's ""Santa Clause"" franchise its certainly more realistic. When it comes to family drama during the holidays. Overall this movie is amazing!oh! by the way Any Superman Returns fans out there will get a kick out of Kevin Spacey's characters reason for being a Villain!",Fred Claus
133,naive_harry,Worst movie of this century !!!!,1,15 January 2009,"worst kind of **** I have ever seen, The main lead character, the bitter brother (Fred the ass hole) is the worst actor I have ever seen, I would kill myself but to watch this movie again, If i could go back in time and that only once, I would go back and delete this piece of **** from my comp even before I could even see it. The main lead, he doesn't know ABCD of acting, the guy doesn't even give a hint of expression, If he thinks its cool to act in a way that says ""whatever"", Well thats what the audience should do.I hate that piece of **** actor, I hate him!!!! First I saw him in that Ben stiller movie where he has a piece of **** gym in front of his, I thought how can they make him the lead, ****** up *** hole. The girl at Santa's place that wears mini skirts and deep necks, she is the only good thing about this movie, she is sexy...Worst plot and deserves that worst movie the year or may be this century, I don't know, if any movie be able to beat this one to it...Well I guess I made my point, The rating as it is now, stands at 5.7, pretty misleading, and I would seriously recommend to throw this piece of **** movie out of the window...",Fred Claus
134,rjpatterson-1,Something For The Damily,10,12 November 2007,"This movie is typical of any Christmas movie in that it sends a sort of message to people. Sometimes, I did wonder were some of the funny went because of the funny people that were in it. But even if it wasn't that great of writing, it was the overall effect that draws you in.Christmas is a time of year were miracles happen, and that was what happened. It's just the feeling of a Christmas movie no matter if it was funny or serious that makes you think...wow, I want that feeling too.Some of the things you could get rid of, but overall I say it's something that the whole family can sit down and say..let that be the holidays...",Fred Claus
135,Moreleb1956,Great Movie,10,10 November 2007,"My husband and I just returned from seeing the movie. We are both teachers (high school and first grade) and we appreciated the content greatly. Our children are older (23 and 26) and we decided to see a holiday movie and something lighthearted. It was so refreshing to see a movie with some good ethic education as well as good moral teachings. So often movies depict the holidays as only a secular, money making time and this movie while built around that concept also intertwined the ""REAL"" meaning of Christmas. I thought some of the special effects were not as intricate as they possibly could have been, but I am no animator. The scene where the main character attends a self-help group was hilarious and we laughed so hard we cried. We were fortunate enough to see the movie in a theater filled with several families and it was great to hear laughter and joy from moms, dads, and children. And what a bonus to have Silent Night unedited. Hooray and Merry Christmas!",Fred Claus
136,fiveeleven,"Mildly entertaining, Mostly disappointing",4,6 November 2007,"This movie is mediocre at best. The storyline is predictable and all the typical Christmas movie clichés are overused. Nothing new is done that you haven't seen before. The North Pole and the elves look like a rehashed bargain version of what you've seen before in Elf.Vaughn has either been terribly typecast, or he just doesn't have much depth as an actor. It's the same guy from Old School and Wedding Crashers, except now he's Santa's brother. In fact, he hasn't changed very much from the first time I saw him in Swingers. And because this film is a ""family film"", he holds back his usual surly undertones, making his character dull and sadly one dimensional.",Fred Claus
137,cathriona-bent,Excellent,10,27 November 2007,"This was an excellent movie... could have been more funnier, but I still loved it. Vince is a good actor, could have had a little better performance from Rachel Weisz. She is a good actress. Must team Vince and Will Ferrell in a movie... I'm sure it would brighten everyones day! and am sure it would be smash hit! This movie is excellent and has a story punch line that many could learn from in living their lives. Vince has a remarkable and extraordinary way of talking and getting to people. He is funny by just the way he put things across. Wonder how he would pull off a horror movie, not counting psycho. He has the height and built to go with it all.Excellent acting... must make the production crew go crazy. It's worth owning on DVD and also waiting for Wedding Crasher II to come out. Would be worth having a part two that movie.",Fred Claus
138,katiehawaii,Theme,7,6 December 2007,"I thought the movie was funny and entertaining, not an Oscar winner, but fun to see at Christmas. The weird thing was, they never showed anything that had to do with why Christmas is Christ-mas. And even weirder, they changed the words to Silent Night! I was getting all choked up during that part and kinda singing to myself, hopefully to myself, and then they left out 'Christ the Savior is born'. That part makes me cry every time, it is a reminder of the reason for the season. I am not a super religious person, but it is so strange when the studios do that kinda thing. Anyway, pretty good movie, just bummed about Silent Night. :)",Fred Claus
139,kilgoretrout101,Worst Vince Vaughn movie ever!,1,10 December 2007,"Well, I have to say, this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work. ANd the worst part is, I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city, paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyways, the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview, but it is filled with totally ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turn points. And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN""t have to be saved, and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn, but nope. The only cool part was the sleigh rides, and the little bladck kid was the best character. I'm sure this movie would be great for young kids, but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through.",Fred Claus
140,dmartinez1-921-600738,Great,8,11 December 2010,"I'm glad I read the negative reviews after I saw this film or I may not have watched it. I don't know why there are so many Scrooge's knocking this film. I was bored on a Saturday night after a long tired day of skiing in December in upstate NY when I stumbled upon it by accident and loved it. Come on, Vince Vaughn in his usual dead pan comedy act, Kevin Spacey as an evil spurned child trying to destroy Santa, the hilarious brothers support group, Wanda with the knockers to end all Christmases, Slam and the puppy, I could go on and on. You gotta sometimes just take silly humor for what it is and love life. This will be one Christmas movie I watch year after year. Lighten up people, great movie!",Fred Claus
141,craiggers90,Great Family Film,10,10 November 2007,"This movie was an excellent Christmas Family Film movie. Just like many of these genres there are jokes that are in their that only adults will get so its okay...but overall anyone can watch, young or old.Vince Vaughn does an amazing job as Fred Claus, Santa's older brother. You not only get a film about living in your brother's shadow but also a Christmas movie with a great message. They especially tackle naughty kids, cutting them some slack.Although the animation with some of the elves makes it seem a little bad its really quite funny. I think the reason why some people are disappointed in this film is because it's not like some of the Christmas movies coming out with actors in Vince's class (i.e. Bad Santa). It was a family film that wasn't full of swears and sex jokes, which I'm okay with and enjoy, but I wanted to see a Christmas Family Film, which this is.The supporting cast are all really great and Rachel and Bobbe' are stand outs in my mind. Oh and of course the elf of Willy.",Fred Claus
142,beth_french,"Fine - but no ""Elf""",6,16 December 2013,"This film is a perfectly harmless Christmas movie - apart from Rachel Weisz's accent! It is absolutely horrific and cannot believe they allowed the film to be aired with her speaking like that - really annoyed me! Otherwise it is fine as a bit of background noise for Christmas, but it doesn't compare whatsoever to the films like Elf. Vince Vaughn is the same as he is in everything. Not quite sure why Kevin Spacey agreed to be in it - you would think an actor of his level would have his pick of movies. What else can i say about this film? Well the funniest scene was at the therapy session for people with more famous siblings - and Steven Baldwin was there!",Fred Claus
143,petermorganking,The cinematic equivalent of a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking.,1,5 November 2007,"Painfully bad Christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by Vince Vaughn, who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his R rated films. Vaughn seems like he's on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance. After 30 minutes into the film, you would be in touch your inner scourge and say ""Bahumbag"" at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes, you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point. Out of all the actors involved in this mess, only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that's manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film. Paul Giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself but he's forced to Vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting. You can see in Giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film. Rachel Weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that, so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film. Fortunately for her, she's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face, unlike Giamatti, who looks like he's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie. The direction also feels uninspiring, like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down.I don't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved (Giamatti and Weisz) trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with, spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand ( and this is a Christmas movie of all things) and a actor who just does not care about his performance (Vaughn), you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch.",Fred Claus
144,bigcatsoul,The Critics Got it wrong,10,11 November 2007,"When I 1st heard that Vince Vaughn and Paul giamatti were in this i was more than enthused. I started reading all these neg. reviews so those kind of deterred me a little but, boy am i glad i did go see it the story was excellent the acting even better. Vince Vaughn is at the top of his game. He is his usual part boy character but this one seems different. The supporting cast was also good i especially loved seeing ludicrous making a cameo appearance as a elf DJ. The guy who was in the breakup with Vince was also good. I'm talking about the gay brother. It was good to see giamatti playing Santa and that back story at the beginning priceless so go see it well worth the price of admission",Fred Claus

146,Kaylind,Baaaaaaaad,3,20 December 2007,"I have to say this movie was a huge disappointment as I expected more quality from a film with such great actors aboard. I usually don't expect a lot from holiday movies like this one but they can be funny and enjoyable. This one simply isn't. Literally the only time I laughed was at the scene that takes place at Siblings Anonymous, with Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton and Stephen Baldwin. That was brilliant, but of course the kids don't understand the humor in it. Elizabeth Banks as Santa's Little Helper Blonde Bimbo in the skimpy outfit is just uber pathetic. I'll give it a 3 for the Siblings scene and the visual effects, which are pretty good.",Fred Claus
147,tequilawill,No script?,4,3 December 2008,"I don't think I am the only one who thought this was a movie without a script. I felt that over half the movie was ad-libbed. Granted I knew what I was getting when I watched this -- another Vince Vaughn cookie cutter character (exchange him for wedding crashers or Mr and Mrs smith or old school -- same character). But I couldn't get over the fact that I felt the dialogue was made up right there on the spot. It had great promise with actors and a storyline different than the rest, but fell flat with useless side-stories (momma Claus and Charlene and northcut) that in the end... you felt jipped. The scene with Fred and Slam was completely ad-libbed as well as Fred and Santa. Ah, Christmas movies... simply toss a few well-known actors in here and there, put a Christmas theme on it and release it before the holidays. Someone will buy/watch it. Good on ya. Me, I'll go back to Love Actually or some other entertaining movie.... heck, I might even watch Elf again!",Fred Claus

It tugs on every conceivable emotion, has stupendous acting by all (in particular John Michael Higgins as Willie the Elf – check out the dance lesson scene!), draws from an incredibly deep screenplay, and to boot, (no pun intended), has spectacular special effects. I would consider putting it #2 Christmas movie of all time, behind only Miracle on 34th Street with Natalie Wood, Edmund Gween, etc.",Fred Claus
