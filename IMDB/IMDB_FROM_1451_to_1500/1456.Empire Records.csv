0,SnoopyStyle,crazy wild fun,7,13 May 2016,"A group of young people work at the independent Empire Records. While closing up, Lucas (Rory Cochrane) discovers a contract in manager Joe Reaves (Anthony LaPaglia)'s office to sell out the store to big corporate Music Town. Lucas tries his luck with the store's cash to save the place and promptly loses $9k in Atlantic City. The next morning, A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) and Mark (Ethan Embry) are the first at the store. Corey Mason (Liv Tyler) and flirty friend Gina (Renée Zellweger) have a crush on 80's pop star Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) who is coming to the store. His time is mostly pass and even his assistant Jane (Debi Mazar) doesn't like his music. Angry Deb (Robin Tunney) shaves her head. A.J. vows to reveal his love for Corey. They catch a young shoplifter who claims to be Warren Beatty. It's going to be a crazy day.This is a crazy wild mess of young people fun. The music is loud and mostly good. The story is full of teen angst. The best is the cast of great young up and comers. Tyler and Zellweger are in short skirts. Tunney actually shaves her hair. It's lots of teen melodramatic fun. The characters are appealing. It's certainly possible to be get-off-my-lawn on this movie but not me. Even a bad sleazy Maxwell Caulfield can't get me out of this movie.",Empire Records
1,classicsoncall,"""I guess nobody really has it all together.""",6,11 July 2018,"This film would have been a whole lot better if every character in it wasn't a caricature. Store clerk Mark (Ethan Embry) and shoplifter Warren (Brendan Sexton III) were the worst. There might be teens that clueless and arrogant respectively, but in this film, they were just plain annoying. And the record shop manager Joe Reaves (Anthony LaPaglia) spent an awful lot of time deliberating over what he'd do about the missing nine grand. Seemed pretty simple to me, but in keeping with the one big happy family concept, he presided over the madness going on with the serenity of a Buddhist monk. Maybe I'm just a little too far removed from the target audience for this picture but it did nothing for me. The story was fairly predictable about how the missing money would be replaced, while the teen angst aspect of all the employees wound up pretty much resolved by the time the closing credits rolled. Not very comparable to real life, but I guess the picture had it's time and place, which is to say, it's a good thing the Nineties are over.",Empire Records
2,gavin6942,One Day in A Record Store With Those Kids...,6,3 August 2007,"An employee steals the money from a record store's vault, with the hopes of gambling with it in Atlantic City and making it big. He fails, and the next day the store must face the reality: without the money, they will be turned into one of many chain stores where the more laid back approach to selling music just doesn't slide with those in charge. Also, this day features a visit from washed-up pop star Rex Manning.Directed by the writer and director of ""Pump Up The Volume"", this film simply is not as good as ""Pump Up The Volume"". And, sadly, it's also not the best movie about people hanging out in a record store -- ""High Fidelity"" is a better contender in that category. What this film does excel at is showing a store with way too many employees who do nothing (how can they possibly afford to pay these slackers) and really encapsulating what it was like to live circa 1995 (probably as much or even more so than ""Reality Bites"").That is really the only selling point for this film for me. Reminding me of 1995, when music like the Gin Blossoms was cool and people dressed like they were trying to escape the 1980s but didn't know how (and ended up turning to flannel for help). Sure, we have Robin Tunney (""The Craft"") and a young Liv Tyler... even Renee Zellweger. All fine actresses, but nothing worth seeing the film for if that's all you want to see.There's nothing new about the idea of trying to get a store saved from going under (or a school, or a radio station -- see ""UHF""). What makes this movie different is that the characters are just, well, weird. They sit around, don't do a lot of work, wander off for no reason, and nobody cares. The store could run more effectively with fewer employees, and the film would probably be tighter if one character was dropped (maybe Ethan Embry).Warren was by far the most entertaining part of the film for me. His hoodlum antics just made me very amused, and without him this would have been a highly dull film. Do I care about a girl's depression (which is never really explored or resolved) or another girl's acceptance to Harvard (which is barely covered) or a pill addiction (which is dealt with so minorly)? No. I am never given a reason to give half a fig. Each character is so shallow that their shallowness is almost deep in its presentation.If you need a flashback to 1995, this is a film for you. The music obviously plays a large role in this movie, and the styles will be familiar. But as far as being an outstanding film or a cultural achievement or even a cult classic, I guess I just don't see it. All the hype this film had or has circling around it don't amount to much. But, hype is like that -- almost never delivering on its promises.",Empire Records
3,jboothmillard,Empire Records,6,31 July 2010,"From the title I expected this to be some sort of film charting the success of a music studio or something, it sounded like it, I had no idea it was going to be a teen movie, and a pretty good one at that. Basically, Lucas (A Scanner Darkly's Rory Cochrane) is in charge of closing the Empire Records independent music store, and when he sees that the store could be taken over by another business, he decides to take the $9,000 in the safe and gamble it in Atlantic City to win big and save the store, ultimately he loses it. The next day he returns to work to tell boss Joe Reaves (Lantana's Anthony LaPaglia) the bad news, and Joe punishes him to stay sat on the office sofa, and only to move if he comes up with a way to get the money back. This day happens to be the day that the store has invited pompous and fading pop singer Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) to promote his new album and sign autographs. Each individual teen character, high school students and young adults working in the store, are having their own emotional problems, all coming out on this day. Overachieving student Corey Mason (The Lord of the Rings' Liv Tyler) heading for Harvard University discovers Rex isn't the lovable singer he seems to be. Lovesick A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) wants to tell Corey his feelings for her at a precise time, and when he does it's the wrong time. Gina (Renée Zellweger) is the free spirit who takes advantage of her chance to get with Rex, but it may not have been the best decision and everyone disapproves, don't worry, this will change. Debra (The Craft's Robin Tunney) entered the store immediately shaving her hair off, and continues most of the day being a hostile, antisocial and near suicidal person, burying herself in work, but she come out once in a while. Finally, Mark (Ethan Embry/Randall) is the geeky one who is willing to make a tit of himself on the live news right outside to spread the word that the store needs money to survive. There is also the frequent appearance of the shoplifter calling himself ""Warren Beatty"" (Brendan Sexton III) who starts out as a troublemaker, but everyone warms to him and are willing to forgive him, and even consider him for a job in the store. In the end, after a big alcohol and music filled party in the street and the store, they manage to raise enough money for Joe to pay manager Mitchell Beck (Ben Bode) at first for a deposit, but he allows him to buy the store for himself. Also starring Debi Mazar as Jane and Coyote Shivers as Berko. Besides the up and coming stars Tyler and a more overshadowing Zellweger appearing, Cochrane is really good as the sarcastic and near brooding at times teen, and Caulfield has his moments as the snobbish and despised disappearing pop star. What I really liked about this teen movie, besides the great cast and ""let's pull together"" attitude, was the soundtrack, including The Buggles - ""Video Killed The Radio Star"", Edwyn Collins - ""A Girl Like You"" and The Flying Lizards - ""Money (That's What I Want)"", a fun comedy drama. Good!",Empire Records
4,BandSAboutMovies,A failure at first,7,29 May 2019,"Empire Records may not be a musical, but without music, it wouldn't really have much of a story, would it? It does fit into the main prerequisite for this week: it was a total bomb on release before finding an audience that was ready for it years after it was actually made. This coming of age and battle against the corporation film may have just been too much for 1995, but in 2019? It fits right in.Writer Carol Heikkinen supposedly worked at a Tower Records store (IMDB claims that it was store #166 at Phoenix's Christown Mall) and used tons of stories that she had experienced while working there.This is the story of 24 hours in the life of Delaware's Empire Records, an independent music store. It starts when Joe (Anthony LaPaglia, The Client, Annabelle: Creation), the store manager, allows Lucas (Rory Cochrane, Dazed and Confused) to close the store alone for the first time.That's when he learns that Music Town, a national entertainment big box store, is buying Empire Records. To keep its spirit of independence alive, he takes all $9,000 from that day's sales and sets out to quadruple it in Atlantic City. Sure, he doubles it, but Lucas' luck could never hold out.The next morning, a decimated Luchas is found by A.J. (Johnny Whitworth, who ended up being Blackout in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance before anyone cared about superhero movies) and Mark (Ethan Embry, Pete on Sneaky Pete). He tells the two of them of his plight as they try to keep him away from Joe, who is looking for the missing deposit once the bank and the actual owner call.The real heart of Empire Records lies within the kids that work there, like Corey (Liv Tyler), Gina (an impossibly young Renée Zellweger), the suicidal and soon-to-be bald Deb (Robin Tunney, The Craft) and her hanger-on boyfriend Berko (Coyote Shivers, who was married to Liv Tyler's mom at the time, former groupie Bebe Buell).The truth of it all is that Joe had wanted to become co-owner all along and had hoped to use that $9,000 to make it happen, keeping the store independent. Meanwhile, all hell is breaking loose because the store is dealing with Rex Manning Day.Yes, former 80's pop star Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) is coming to the store, which has a line of older women and gay men ready to greet him. The store employees and even Rex's assistant (Debi Mazar, who continually wins me over in small roles) openly hate the singer, but Corey has been planning to give him her virginity. He blows her off and ends up sleeping with her best friend, Gina, as all hell breaks loose.So much of Empire Records really does hold true to the hijinks ensue manifesto. It's an episodic account of this one big day in the heart of a record store, complete with shoplifters being converted into employees, a mock funeral for Deb to cheer her up, an all-night benefit to ""Save the Empire"" and love winning against all costs. Oh yeah and Gwar shows up.It's amazing that this movie even made it on the screen, as it was severely edited in post-production, with three significant characters and 40 minutes of footage ending up on the cutting room floor.Reviewers said things like the movie was a ""soundtrack in search of a movie,"" ""deserved a bullet to put it out of its misery"" and it was a ""lost cause."" That said - the soundtrack album peaked at #63 on the Billboard charts and The Gin Blossoms' ""Til I Hear It From You"" and Edwyn Collins' ""A Girl Like You"" made it into the top 40.Today, a film that only made $300,000 on initial release plays revival houses and has enjoyed several home video re-releases. April 8th has now become Rex Manning Day to so many people now.Sadly, this movie may not mean much to kids today, as music stores have disappeared. Yes. even the big stores like Music Town.",Empire Records
5,michaelRokeefe,And the beat goes on.,4,13 June 2003,"A nice cast to look at and some good tunes spin; but don't expect more. Anthony LaPaglia is the manager of Empire Records an independent music store that is about to be taken over by a bigger music chain. He and his odd squad of employees must come up with the money to buy their collective personal haven. Teetering cult status with nothing but rampant chaotic bursts of action to show for it. The winsome part of the cast is Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger and Robin Tunney. Also in the cast are Rory Cochrane, Debi Mazer and Maxwell Caulfield as the despised pop star. Toss back a couple of cool ones and relax.",Empire Records
6,hitchcockthelegend,"I do not regret the things I've done, but those I did not do.",8,2 May 2011,"Empire Records is directed by Allan Moyle and written by Carol Heikkinen. It stars, Anthony LaPaglia, Maxwell Caulfield, Debi Mazar, Johnny Whitworth, Liv Tyler, Renée Zellweger, Rory Cochrane, Robin Tunney & Ethan Embry. Plot centre's on one day at independent record store Empire Records. With the store under imminent threat of a take over by a corporate chain, this is no ordinary day. For on the day that the store will be visited by a fading pop star, they are forced to confront their personal issues, and maybe, just maybe, learn something about the people they work with.The film was a box office failure and was met with mostly negative reviews from the professional critics. Coming as it does from the director of critical/cult darling Pump Up the Volume, many were expecting a better and more hard edged picture than what they got. It also had to compete with certain 80's favourites brought to the cinematic world by John Hughes. While coming fast on the heels of the immensely popular Clerks (94) didn't help its cause either. Was it a case of bad timing? Is the film really just poor? And or, as mooted at the time: a career killer for those involved? Personally I think it's a film that needs revisiting now some 15 odd years after its release. In fact time has actually been kind to it and it now appears to have a good solid cult following. So unless you are judging it against the superior, record shop set, High Fidelity, you may find it's a film that's hard to dislike.Some of the complaints against it are fair, with the main one about it not having fully developed characters being as true as day is a day. While calling it one long stitched together music video has some substance when taking it at face value. Yet what is there is worthy of a second glance, they are interesting characters, and their respective hang-ups and pressures are evident enough for us to hang our hats on; even if it's set up to be accompanied by still more hipster indie rock music. There's also been much guff written about the film as regards calling it a teen angst film. Yes it is, but have these reviewers forgotten about the adults in the movie? LaPaglia's store owner, the father figure, trying to remain cool as his charges come under threat. Or Mazar, needing a wake up call from her job/career ignorance; and the big one, the delightful Caulfield (splendid bit of casting) as fading pop singer Rex Manning, imposter? Indeed. It's all relative as to why Empire Records deserves more than a once only viewing. As for the music, it does indeed rock, with each track carefully selected to be at one with the scene it accompanies. My favourite? AC/DC-If You Want Blood, a ball busting track for a vibrant and kicking scene.As for it being a career killing movie? The ladies of the piece have done rather well for themselves, Zellweger, Tunney and Tyler have made their marks in the industry, while Mazar has never been without work prior or post Empire Records. The guys haven't hit the heights of Zellweger and Tyler, which in the case of the excellent Rory Cochrane is not only a surprise, but also sad. Cochrane's Lucas is the key character and the glue in the middle of it all, always on hand with a dry quip or some philosophy, he's also supremely cool. Cochrane can be seen in serious mode leading 2006 thriller Right at Your Door. LaPaglia has always worked since 95, playing a number of different supporting characters, and Embry has appeared in big release's such as Vacancy and Eagle Eye. Caulfield has turned into the go to guy for TV shows and Whitworth, who quit acting for a while, pops up from time to time in minor roles such as in 3:10 To Yuma and The Rainmaker. So, not a career killer then.Stick it to the Man, Baby, Empire Records is a vibrant and funny movie. 7.5/10",Empire Records
7,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Empire Records Remix! Special Fan Edition (1995),7,29 November 2005,"This quirky take with memorable characters take place in a span of 24 hours in a record store known as Empire Records (Tower Records anyone?) It highlights a day in the life of the store employees, made up of teeny boppers like proverb spewing Lucas (Rory Cochrane), suicidal rebel Jane (Debi Mazar), slutty Gina (Renee Zellweger), smarty pants Corey (Liv Tyler), amongst others.The story starts off with Lucas taking nine thousand dollars from the cashier at night before he closes the store, and loses it all in a hilarious sequence at Atlantic City. Joe, the co-owner, learns about this, and the recovery of this amount of money forms the running theme in this movie.Thrown into the plot is an equally hilarious character Rex Manning, a has-been singer who's due at the store for an autograph session with his fans. You'll definitely dig one of his cheesy music videos. Corey has a crush on Rex, and tries to seduce him, but falls flat in embarrassment. Of course she's shocked when good friend Gina manages to pull the seduction off, and me-ow, a catfight ensues.As if the day isn't bogged down with too much activities in serving customers and spinning good music in the store, the employees learn that their beloved Empire Records will be absorbed by Music Town, a larger competitor. Therefore it's also a race against time to preserve the identity of their store.But it's a feel good movie, with feel good songs sprinkled with the occasional metal, so the ending is somewhat predictable with all threads and sub plots merging into one grand finale. Needless to mention, my primary objective is actually to watch Liv and Renee in one of their earlier movies :-)",Empire Records
8,Smells_Like_Cheese,A rock and roll good time of teen movies,8,31 October 2005,"I remember watching some of this when I was like 11 years old, a year after it came out. A friend of mine was just in love with this movie, but I didn't really watch much of it. I just couldn't relate or didn't get it.When I made my wonderful journey to Blockbuster Video, I noticed it again, and was just curious to see it. Renee Zelleweger, Liv Tyler, Robin Tunney? Wow. I'm glad I watched this movie, because I can relate to it more now. My work, lucky enough, is a lot like this movie. We're all close friends and have fun. But I'd like to work at Empire Records, they can actually dance in the store! :D The acting was fun and enjoyable and the story is a hoot. I would recommend Empire records for a watch. Just have fun with it. This was the time where there were some actual good teen movies. You also get the early glimpses of Rene and Liv. They actually look good in this movie! :D No offense to them. They just look weird now.8/10",Empire Records
9,The-Sarkologist,Pretty much my favourite romantic comedy,10,14 January 2012,"When coming to this movie there is so much in it that needs to be said and can be said that it is almost impossible to get everything out of it in 1000 words. Aristotle's unity of time and place plays out well in this film as the action occurs through a single day and plays out mostly in the record shop. Further, each of the characters in the film have an epiphany which will change the direction of their life.The first is Lucas. He is a character that had a hard life but Joe, the manager of the store, was willing to drag him out of the muck that he was in and give him a second chance. This willingness occurs at the beginning of the movie where he is entrusted to lock up, but he finds out that the store is going to be bought out so he attempts to win enough money to buy it out. What can be said is he fails, yet he still returns to face the problem, and Joe does not turn him over to the police, even though he deserves it. Lucas is basically the voice of wisdom. He has been through everything that everybody is going to, so even though he is facing the possibility of a lot of trouble, he is still able to console everybody and give them the wisdom that is needed.This brings me to Warren. He is a kid that is a shoplifter, but it seems that the kid has never had a close family. His background is not drawn out, but a lot of it is implied with his reaction to the close knit family that are the employers of Empire Records. He is hostile towards them, but the truth comes out when he enters the shop with a gun in a fit of jealous rage. He has never had a group of caring friends like those at Empire Records, so when he sees it, he wants to destroy it. If he cannot have it then nobody else can have it. The caring nature of Joe, and the people at Empire Records, turn to welcome him even though he stole from them and held them hostage.Debbie is the next namely because she faces up to Warren. It is not because she is tough but because she has been through death and is no longer scared of it. She enters the movie, goes straight into the bathroom and shaves off all of her hair. She constantly tries to avoid the questions of the others, though her bandaged wrist attracts their attention. Why did she try to commit suicide? Her answer is that she woke up and realised that everyday of her life was the same: the only difference was that the problems that piled upon her were different. But what was her real problem? We realise this at her funeral - she does not die but they give her a funeral so that she knows not only that she is a part of this family but that her death would hurt people and that she would be missed. She realises what her problem is - she simply wants to be noticed, that is why she dresses the way she does, acts the way she does, and shaves her hair - she simply wants to be noticed. At he funeral she suddenly realises that people not only notice her, but also love her.AJ is the next character. He is in love with Corey and wants to go to art college but he does not think that he is good enough. That is his problem: he does not have any faith in himself. He seems to be okay, but Lucas tells us at the beginning that everybody has a problem even though everybody denies that they do not have one. It is only when AJ is confronted by Corey that he realises that he has no faith in himself. He tells Corey that he loves her, but to Corey it is the wrong time. It wasn't because it started her thinking and she realised that she did love him, but even then he had given up because he did not expect it to happen, not to him. When confronted by Corey he realises that he is not hopeless and can do things, so he does.Gina doesn't really change because she already knows herself. She is more of a character that Corey reacts from. She and Corey are good friends, but Corey does not understand so when Gina screws Rex Manning, Corey freaks. She then realises that Gina was simply being herself and that is something that must be admired. Gina does not care what people think, and lets that known plain and clear.Joe is also an important character as he is the father figure in the movie. He has taken all of the characters in, including the delinquent Warren, and makes them apart of his family. Jane becomes the mother figure, or will as she does not take that role in the movie. Joe is the one that takes the big problems upon his own shoulders, but others come to him for help.Empire Records is a very good movie and as a friend says, it seems to capture the hopelessness of the 90's. It is a movie about family when the family unit is collapsing. It shows us that going out on our own never solves anything, and this is made clear right at the beginning when Lucas fails in his bid to win enough money to buy the store back. It is a movie that shows us that me must work together to survive and to overcome all of our problems, yet also shows us that there are somethings that we must do for ourselves.",Empire Records
10,helpless_dancer,Never hire a teen!,7,15 March 2002,"This film started off annoying the hell out of me but ended up as a total delight. Here we have several very mixed up kids full of angst and various problems making life miserable for a record store manager....and, at times, each other.

11,GOWBTW,Rock 'n Roll Fun!,9,11 April 2006,"This movie was worth seeing in my opinion. My instincts shows that this movie is a real hit. A marvelous cast, a great plot, and plenty of sex appeal made this movie really good. Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar, Renne Zellweger, and Liv Tyler made this movie a hit. Rory Cochrane is astonishing at playing Lucas, the employee who gambles the $9000+ in a casino. Sure he got slammed by the boss, but who wants to be bought out by a bigwig who wants only money? I wouldn't. Then comes in Rex Manning(Maxwell Caulfield), a music video, TV legend who helps promote the store, is nothing more than a time-warped has been. Cory(Tyler) really showed her sexual prowess in the lunch scene. That's Steve's daughter for ya! Rock on! And there's Debra(Robin Tunney) very bipolar, shaves her head, then gets to lighten up and see what's really important. When the employees and their boss fight against the buyout, they are the heroes of the movie. Strum a guitar on that one. The music was great, the scenes are fantastic, it's too bad this movie was a limited premiere. I give it 3 stars, just to be honest.",Empire Records
12,generationofswine,Time Capsule,10,20 October 2016,"Once upon a time there was this magical place called ""the record store."" It was a place that appeared for many generations following World War II. A place that had a vivid spot in American culture, especially American teenage culture, before we even walked on the moon.I for one still have cherished memories of piling into a car with my friends, taking the trip out to Tower Records, only to get publicly castrated by the super-hot chick with the pierced nose that worked behind the counter because I brought a copy of the ""The Book of Secrets"" for my girlfriend.She forced me to turn around, hold the album high, and announce to the entire store that I was buying Loreena McKennitt.It was one of the most humiliating moments in my high school career...And you just don't get that level of quality service at Best Buy...let alone Itunes. So occasionally you took a shot in the face for your girlfriend's bad taste...but you also did it in an environment where you were talked into buying Getz and Jobim and a complete collection of Bossa Nova, just because one of the clerks caught you walking through the Jazz section.""Empire Records"" is just like that, it's a time testament to childhood. It's your youth wrapped up into a feature film. It may be a flawed movie, from time to time, but the jokes are there and they are funny. The people that you used to know are all there too.I can't remember what the hot clerk that made me do the Mummers Dance looked like, but in my minds eye now she looks just like Robin Tunney. James 'Kimo' Wills was the stoner clerk that took me from Pearl Jam to Coltrane in one shopping trip...and if you are out there, whoever did that for me...thank you.Maybe you were never lucky enough to get a job at the record store, but you still knew some of the clerks very well. You spent your hard earned money there and you can never go home again.You can never REALLY go home again. Maybe you can head to Rolling Stone, but the staff there are all Millennials and most of their knowledge stops no later than 2006. They are polite to the customers, not surly and hysterical. The Record Stores of today are an empty shell of their former glory...But you can still watch ""Empire Records"" you can still go back in time to the day BEFORE the music died...well, before it died again, and, for a little while, pretend you are still living in that time and place where music was played on instruments and people sang without auto-tune.The movie is like the baseball diamond in ""Field of Dreams""...only for audiophiles. What makes it great is that sense of peace in the universe.For Gen-X to Baby Boomers ""Empire Records"" reminds us that we were there, and alive, in that little corner of time. Now, twenty-years back, we can watch it with all the warm, glowing, nostalgia it deserves.",Empire Records
13,drqshadow-reviews,Melodrama at Play,3,23 August 2011,"This was much better off as a fond memory; digging it out of the archives for a modern viewing just made me question my younger self's taste in movies. A storeful of vapid, self-absorbed caricatures come together to hawk records, listen to radio-friendly '90s mush and reveal just how shallow they truly are as a collective. Very young Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger show some skin and look good doing so, but that's pretty much the only highlight. Whoever chose the soundtrack for this needs to be deafened for the good of all mankind - for a store that's supposed to be all about the anti-establishment, it's got very bland, mainstream tastes.",Empire Records
14,smatysia,OK teenage angst film,6,22 September 2009,"Neither as good nor as bad as people seem to think. About halfway through, I didn't think much of it. Teenage angst tends to bore me nowadays. I guess that makes me a geezer. Point taken. However, by the end of the movie, I would have to say that I ended up liking it. Pretty good performances by Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar in a small role, Robin Tunney, and especially Renee Zellweger. The direction was suitably unobjectionable. I rented the movie in the first place to see some of Ms. Zellweger's early work, and was not disappointed. She was sooooo cute. Any fan of hers should see this film. Otherwise it is OK, nice, but nothing to write home about.",Empire Records
15,RavenGlamDVDCollector,charming little gem,9,4 September 2016,"As I sit there watching DVDs, I very often tell myself I'm great at selecting glamorous, likable TV shows, but when it comes to movies... There are so many I watch that just doesn't hit it off with me. TV show characters tend to become friends, a movie is very different, everybody's a stranger, I don't care for them. Well, happy to say that EMPIRE RECORDS is a big hot hit with me. It's a small production with a lot of heart that beats a lot of much-bigger movies simply because it is likable, with likable characters. And what a treat to see Renée Zellweger during her glory days! And Liv Tyler entering her STEALING BEAUTY phase. A dream cast, with those two going on as if they're in an Aerosmith music video! Yeah, back then, they weren't big marquee names. Now it is an oddity to see their names so low on the cast list.Not saying it's perfect. I found the first half to be very promising, with the second half a letdown in many places. There are characters (like Jane) going nowhere, just wasting space. But overall, I can see why there is a board poster so obsessed with it, the dude wrote a self- proposed TV series sequel, and, yes, I would have watched.I heartily recommend this one. It's fun! And, guys, Liv and Renée are hot! Prima quality eye candy!",Empire Records
16,jfgibson73,One of the least essential movies of the 90s,4,27 July 2021,"I really wasn't into this movie. It's been masquerading as it was a cultural touchstone for years, but the soundtrack is the only memorable bit. I like most of the actors in it, but I saw this as a largely wasted opportunity. A record store can totally be an interesting setting--check out ""Hi-Fidelity. This one here seems to think we should care about these kids' problems and struggles, but doesn't take any time for us to get to know them. I also find most of the characters unlikeable, and most of the situations are not interesting. But it keeps on going, like it's a tv show we've been watching for years, showing us the lives of these workers who we have no reason to want to watch.

18,vertigo_14,"Damn the Man, Save the Empire! (spoilers)",8,7 August 2004,"Empire Records is one of the great music-based teen comedies made at the tail end of the grunge years. The characters are fantastic, the story is completely nutty, its got a pretty fantastic soundtrack, and the movie is really a good time all around, destined to bring a smile to your face.Joe Reeves (Anthony LaPaglia) runs a record store, Empire Records. The movie takes place pretty much over the course of one crazy day of adventures and disasters at the store. Adventures and disasters that begin with a night of fowl gambling and the loss of the store profits by the cynical, sarcastic Lucas (Rory Cochrane). That sets things in motion. Joe sees the situation as major trouble (obviously, since he's the manager and responsible for the cash), while the rest of the clerks see it as an opportunity to seize the day! In the course of this day, several things go on behind the scenes of Joe trying to figure out how to get the money back and in the meantime, explain to the owner why there was no deposit made at the bank the day before. As your typical Generation X comedies made in the early and mid 90s goes, you'll have a bunch of different, fairly interconnected situations among a scattered cast of characters and most of these stories are all about who is in love with whom. On this day at Empire Records, retro retard rock singer, Rex Manning, is at the store to autograph CDs for aging fans. Soft-spoken braniac, Cory (Liv Tyler) has made plans to approach Rex and let him know that basically she's grossly obsessed with him. Meanwhile, AJ (Johnny Whitworth), wants to seize the day and boldly profess his love to Cory, if only he can get the confidence to do so. Jane (Debi Mazar), the stereotypical badass of the group complete with shaved head and black attire, avoids explanation of some fresh scars on her wrists. Mark (Ethan Embry) and Eddie (my favorite character, played by James 'Kimo' Wills) are just being themselves, a crazy duo who love to have fun. All this going on while Joe has to try and save Empire Records thanks to Lucas's big mistake.Sad but true, some things get quite corny. Some of the characters are obviously stereotypical and the Hollywood happy ending of such a bizarre day is quite unbelievable. But, basically, it's a movie about music, friendship, and romance played out to a good mid 90s soundtrack the features The Cranberries, The Gin Blossoms, Dire Straits, Edwyn Collins, and tons more. It ain't no cinematic masterpiece, but it is definitely one of the best teen/gen x comedies of its day (sharing the ranks with Freaked and Tank Girl, of course).

Being that I used to search for movies of this type, I don't see how this gem slipped me by. I just watched saw it for the first time this week(after being inspired by many a glowing IMDb user comment!!) and found it be really terrific. The movie really affected me and watching it was an absolute trip. I want them to do a part two and I just saw part one! I guess I'm a little late in jumping on on the Empire Records train....This movie is a breath of fresh air. The characters are so relateable. And lovable. Joe is awesome! ""Warren Beaty"" steals every scene he's in. And it is just so much fun in general. The musical choices are great. The numerous one liners are Brilliant! Of Coarse I saw other movies I've loved reflected in this one (examples being ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Clerks"", etc). But I think this had it's own unique charm. It's such a good choice for anyone who's a music fan out there, as well as to anyone who's coming of age and just not really sure what they want and where their going. It's a little less talky then some of the other similar movies and it seems a celebration of freedom and rock-n-roll. I was also strongly reminded of ""High Fidelity"".Besides being hilarious, touching and nostalgic all at once, Empire Records also had another effect on me and that was making me want to call all my old buddies from that time period to yell at them to see this great movie....immediately. Unfortunately, I doubt many of them would be able to relate anymore. To the people who CAN relate however, who haven't seen this and who may stumble upon this review....take ninety minutes or so and See this little gem and take your own trip down memory lane.I will be recommending this movie to the people in my life who I know will dig this peppy flick.",Empire Records
20,aimless-46,The Time to Hesitate is Through,10,6 February 2006,"Trying to contribute something useful to prospective viewers means trying to explain the extremely polarized nature of the comments about ""Empire Records"". An uninitiated reader would think that the love-it and hate-it groups were talking about two different films. Which is actually a relatively accurate take on the situation. Allan Moyle's films may differ in subject and structure, but they all have the same indefinable quality that literally connects them to a segment of viewers. This is not the same thing as ""getting it"" which you would use explain the positive/negative reactions to ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Nashville"", or ""Clockwork Orange"".The connection process is more subtle, and it doesn't seem to matter whether you are watching ""Times Square"", ""Pump Up the Volume"", ""New Waterford Girl"", or ""Empire Records"". An earlier comment came close to capturing this quality: "".....watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts....."". The point being that if you have ever connected with a Moyle film you will most likely connect with ""Empire Records"" and will see an entirely different film that those not so lucky.What about those with no prior exposure to Moyle? Think of ""Empire Records"" as the ""American Graffiti"" of the 90's, a similar ""one-day"" structure and a cast of relatively unknown young actors destined to make it big. Structurally it's a microcosm movie like ""The Big Chill"", as almost all the action takes place in the same location and the day being portrayed is not a routine one but an extraordinary one (it's Rex Manning day). Not all fans of ""Ghost World"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" will enjoy ""Empire Records"" but it is probably safe to say that if you hated those two films you should avoid ""Empire Records"".It has a happy ending with characters you like and identify with, and the small world of the record store functions as family and universe for these characters. There are lots of little things that you only pick up on after repeated viewings. I'm convinced that the over-the-top stuff works (i.e doesn't come across as totally lame) because Moyle and his editor have carefully set things up on a subconscious level. For example when Corey is agonizing about opening her Harvard admissions letter, they cut between her and attentive shots of both AJ and Gina, who are standing near her to be supportive despite having mixed feelings about her going away. They are the two people who care the most about her. Which furnishes the viewer with the information to understand the nature of her meltdown later in the film, she comes unglued not about Rex Manning but with the sudden realization that her preoccupation with herself has alienated the two people she cares about the most.My favorite sequence is when Joe tracks down Deb (Robin Tunney) who has retreated from everyone and is sitting on the floor of one of the listening booths doing the store's tax return, symbolic of the protective niche she has found working in the store for Joe. In an extremely touching scene Joe finally just tells her that she is doing a good job. Tunney nicely underplays her character's gentle sarcasm during their exchange, but there is a huge dimensionality in her responses that perfectly communicates her connection to Joe and the store. So that in about 30 seconds Moyle has set up a believable explanation for the sacrifice Deb will later make to help save them.My second favorite sequence is a montage of activity inside the store early in the film. While the soundtrack plays Dire Straits' ""Romeo and Juliet"", the editor cuts between characters, coming back to ""Juliet"" Mills' daughter each time the Juliet lyric is sung.Plus there is a nice bit of irony as the film opens with a customer asking a question which sets all the events in motion: ""Do you think the story is already written or do you think a bold courageous act can change the course of history?"". The irony being that the bold act changes the course of history in a totally unintended manner.The ending is a mix of the ""Times Square's"" ending and something out of a Judy Garland- Mickey Rooney movie where they get the gang together and put on a show.""Empire Records"" has no obvious technical problems and Moyle gets very even performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. The soundtrack is the most diverse and extensive you are likely to encounter.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Empire Records

Not the actors, they were all pretty decent. But the characters themselves, and the way they were written. So many of them are initially annoying and of-putting, that I almost was dead-set on disliking them from the start. As the movie went on, that slowly began to change. I started to see a bit more of the humans beneath these initially shallow characters. It's only deep in a Breakfast Club kind of way, so don't expect a deep study on the human condition. If you can't stomach the characters, you haven't missed very much. But, if you can, there's a mildly interesting (but throughly frivolous) tale to be seen. Plus, you get to see Renée Zellweger actually looking semi-attractive.

But the feeling's there, and some parts (musical interludes) are really good. No real complaints about the acting. The movie is like a teen version of Clerks, with the same offbeat ness, only it's not Clerks (hah!). And for once, the romantic aspect didn't take too much of the screen time. Only to be reminded to us, at the very end. I don't see the Breakfast Club parallel, other reviewers find. They are more or less friends, and are already used to be amongst each other. So where is this coming from?... The movie aged a lot, and has MTV generation written all over. But it's a cool little time capsule of 90s music, fashion and even pop culture. Also, well known actors were at their earliest of acting career. So why not checking it out?",Empire Records

It has definitely built a deserved cult following over the years. It's one of my favorite go to make me feel great movies that explores a plethora of emotions making it similar to having the impact of the breakfast club and fitting perfectly in the wheelhouse of films that explore youth in a genuine way. This review is for both the Superior theatrical version and the interesting but flawed extended version. It centers on a group of employees whom deal with a variety of issues while working at a record store that's on the verge of closing. All the characters are quirky and wonderfully likable Renee Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler being the standouts. It's easy to see why the extended stuff was cut and the impact of some of the films best scenes are lessened including the amazing finale. I would highly reccomend just skipping the extended version and just sticking with the best cut. As it stands it's a love letter to the changing music scene as well as youth in general.

26,hall895,Entirely unremarkable,5,8 June 2011,"Once upon a time there were these places called record stores. People went to these places to buy music. Empire Records is a movie set in such a place. The young employees of Empire Records band together to try and prevent their quirky, independent store being sold to one of those big, bad corporations which will turn the place into a soulless, generic Music Town. If they'd only known the changes which would be coming to the music industry in the next decade they wouldn't have bothered. Anyone up for Empire Records 2: The Day iPods Put Us Out of Business? Eh, probably not. One movie spent with this bunch of unremarkable, unoriginal slackers is enough.Empire Records is a movie which is overly familiar. We've seen so many similar stories with similar characters. There's nothing to make this movie stand out from the crowd. All the clichéd characters we've come to expect from a movie like this are here. The slut, the virgin, the depressed loner, the artist, the stoner. There's the eccentric guy, the comic relief guy, the father figure. Every character fits into a neat little box. The result is less than inspiring. The movie is incredibly predictable. There's no real drama. Attempts at comedy fall flat. The whole thing seems very unfocused. All the characters have their own little stories. But we never really spend enough time with any of those characters to become fully engaged in those stories. Everyone and everything gets tossed together into a big stew and the end result is underwhelming. Some of the performances are pretty good, with the girls generally coming off better than the boys. Watching this movie it's easy to see why Renée Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler were destined for bigger and better things. The guys though are rather forgettable. Probably the best male performance comes from Maxwell Caulfield playing a washed-up pop star. At least his character adds a little something different to the movie. Otherwise it's all about this group of young slackers, none of whom has an individual story which stands out and whose overriding collective quest, to save the store from corporate blandness, isn't particularly compelling. The best thing the movie has to offer is its soundtrack, a nice mid-1990s musical time capsule. But tossing some snippets from some good songs into the mix, and somehow managing to entertainingly shoehorn Gwar into the plot, isn't enough to save the movie. We've seen a lot of other movies like this one. Most of those other movies have been much better than Empire Records.",Empire Records
27,CitizenCaine,Empire Records Full Of Idiot Slackers,4,31 May 2009,"Empire Records is a classic case of someone saying ""hey, I think I'll write a screenplay about the place where I work. There are all these weird, eccentric characters I can develop by easily basing them on the goofballs I work with."" The threadbare plot about a slacker who gambles away the day's record sales at Atlantic City isn't enough to sustain or entertain throughout a feature length film. The characters, while weird and eccentric, are so unlikeable and have few if any redeeming traits. The best of the lot are Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger. The male characters are all slackers who haven't grown up yet. There's absolutely no reason why the store manager shouldn't have turned in the Lucas character to the police. There's obviously a history shared between the store manager and the employees, but the store manager only demonstrates that he's a huge pushover unable to grow up himself. The film tries to portray the manager and his employees as a surrogate family with a ""Breakfast Club"" screenplay. Then the characters release all their angst and are supposed to be a little more together and wiser at the end. It doesn't work. I don't care about any of these extremely immature idiots; they're all just annoying and need to grow up. *1/2 of 4 stars.",Empire Records

While none of them was as exciting as Empire Records, they were wonderful places where music fans could meet and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere, and who didn't light up when the man behind the counter put on some great music track that everybody started dancing or swaying to.Unfortunately, Barnes and Nobles is the closest thing we have today to an Empire Records store.Still, I say, along with 100 million other fans, lets have an Empire Records Two, Mr. Moyle.",Empire Records

A very funny film, with a great atmosphere, nice dialogues, and a very talented young cast. The screenplay was very well written, with some very cool dialogues. La Paglia was good in his role, however the best performances in the film came from Renee Zellweger, Rory Cochrane and a very hilarious Brendan Sexton.

Knowing that 2 of the co-stars later appeared in ""That Thing You Do"" (one of my favorite Rock & Roll oriented films), gave me false hope that ""Empire Records"" would be another Rock & Roll music-driven joy-ride. No such luck.The plot is virtually non-existent, appearing to be made-up-as-they go. The opener has one of the half-dozen co-workers of a CD/record store run off to Atlantic City, determined to quadruple the embezzled daily takings, so the store won't be sold to a ruthless chain. Immediately the story switches to showing how each of the late-teen-ish store workers are ""messed up"".A young shoplifter who is prosecuted, then returns with a gun, is forgiven and offered a job (apparently all in the same day). A side-plot shows a has-been Pop-Idol (with far too much pancake make-up) as a shameless womanizing creep. All ends well, when a Party-A-Thon saves the store. Lots of teen-stuff, with references to inappropriate and dangerous behavior, glamourized and made appealing. This film is a disservice to films of this genre. Teens are not better for watching this poor example of how-to-be-a-success. Harldy any POOR decision has been missed by this teen-angst nightmare. AVOID this film.

For many of Reaves teenage staff, Empire Records is their last chance saloon. On the day after Lucas (Cochrane) in a last ditch attempt to save the store, steals all of the money from the store safe and loses it at a casino, Reaves tells his employees about the impending sale. With a past his prime 80s rock star Rex Manning (Caulfield, brilliant) visiting the shop to sign autographs the confused staff work through their various issues and try to come to terms with the coming change.The film has an excellent soundtrack and some great comedy scenes. LaPaglia is excellent and he is ably supported by the minor players. Cochrane's Lucas and Tunney's Debra being the standouts. Though Whitmore and Tyler do their best to drag proceedings down with a fairly unremarkable love story. This was a much loved film among teen audiences when it came out in 1995, and many years on, while dated, still stands up. It goes a little more deeply into some significant issues faced by the characters, without getting bogged down by them, though it does offer some too easy solutions.In the end if you take good performances, a great soundtrack, and an basic plot, you get a good movie.",Empire Records

The rest of the employees are some of the craziest people; it would be awesome to work at empire records.This was such a surprise watch. It doesn't really try to be anything prolific about teen life; instead is a honest comedy about a group of odd characters trying to set their lives on course. The jokes are perfectly timed; just before it seems to drop the ball and go flat, it quickly catches it and your attention is brought back. This does towards the end dive deep into the sentimentality, but it fits perfectly and it works to its advantage. Its also great to see a lot of actors at the beginning of their career before they became big. Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler and Anthony LaPaglia give good honest performances, and Robin Tunney is great as the misunderstood Debra.

For example, the owner is supposed to be (we are told) a big jerk, but he never does anything jerky and in fact is nice enough to let Joe run the store however he wants.

Liv Tyler was definitely my favourite (and is fashion goals may I add). Although subtle, Empire records did shine light on the insecurities young people face and how their lives aren't always as good as it's cracked up to be. It portrays the young characters realistically ; naive, sensitive but full of heart. The ending scene is one of my favourites and the song that goes along with it is even better.

Annoying... that's the best world to describe this film.",Empire Records
46,shawnmikedryer,Nineties essence,9,23 February 2021,"Empire records is the last of a dying breed, the heart and soul of the place is held together by a tight knit group of young people who work there. This film shows a day in the life of the group who all share a common bond with the love of music. Now the business is at risk of being taken over by a larger conglomerate, Music town. With a stricter business model the plan would turn the beautiful essence of the place on its head and become just another money greedy chain. With countless personal complications amongst the gang whilst trying like hell to raise enough money to keep the owner happy enough to keep the place independent it won't be easy. This is a last ditch effort for Empire Records to escape being swallowed whole by corporate greed.A absolute celebration of youthful optimism with a beautifully selected soundtrack that helps take you back. A true showcase of a few amazing up and coming actors and actresses of the nineties. This films delivers the pure essence of musical expression and most times can be the driving force of mental stability. It certainly fits the profile of your typical dramedy no doubt but the well written and realistic interactions help set this apart. Really goes to show how bad teen movies have gotten over the years going to show it's hard to touch the nineties in that category.",Empire Records
47,Hotoil,As bad as it gets,1,25 November 2000,"A variety of cliche plots.  Stereotypical characters. A generally horrible film!  It really plays like a bad sitcom.  Hell, just about every theme and plot twist has previously played out in about a hundred old sitcoms in the past. If you've never watched TV before, you might find some of this original and unpredictable. I guess it's supposed to be one of those ""fun romps"" that your not supposed to think about and just enjoy.

50,rams_lakers,Tries too hard to be cool...and fails,3,26 January 2013,"Just saw this on a cable channel today and it's one of the worst out there. It's a 90's movie that tries too hard to be cool. It tries to tell the viewer that what these kids are doing and saying are cool - but it's not. It's datedly uncool - the girl that shaved her head to be like Sinead O'Connor - really??? Was this an attempt to be the 90's version of Fast Times at Ridgemont High? I see some similar characters, but these actors can't act, and they don't have much to do in the movie except behave like dumb shallow teenagers. Obviously before CDs became the norm, there's a few nostalgic scenes with a TDK product placement sign and shelves of cassette tapes. It reminds me of Tower Records when idiots take over. Pass on this garbage if you haven't seen it.",Empire Records
51,hershiser2,Has some cult status,7,3 November 2002,"For the most part, I don't enjoy the current wave of teen films (such as the Scream series, though I am a horror fan), as they seem entirely too fake and cheesy (the only one I truly liked was 10 Things I Hate About You, basically because I like the entire cast). Where Empire Records did seem fake (the story line of an employee blowing $9000 of the store's money gambling and the boss deciding to pay it out of his own pocket is ridiculous), for some reason I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. I think the story in this film is quite a bit better than most in this crazed genre, and its one that keeps your attention. Why? I'm not quite sure. I think one of the reasons could possibly be that I have always wanted to have a job like that. I always wanted to work to be a fun place to go to, one that you did not mind going into day after day. In some ways, it reminded me of a job I once had, as my coworkers were great, and we considered our managers as friends, and we had fun at work while we actually got things accomplished, but not to the extent of fun these people had. 	The acting in this film is quite good, surprisingly. There is only one actor (the stoner) who I found to be quite unlaughably bad (so bad he's not even funny). Where most of the actors aren't overly known (Johnny Whitworth, Rory Cochrane), they do their parts convincingly, yet failed to make a name for themselves. I found both of those actors to be quite good, yet I'd never seen them in anything before. Other key players (Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler) have become more `mainstream' after Empire Records. 	I'd been recommended this film several times since its release, and I never thought it seemed interesting enough to sit down and watch it. I'm certainly glad I saw it, however. I believe the film has a certain rewatchability that I look for in films (that so many films lack). 	Though I don't think this film would be considered cult just yet, it certainly will gain that status some day along with the dozens of other teen movies in the genre. In another ten years or so, people will look back upon these films and undoubtedly laugh at them the way we now laugh at films from the 1980s. I am not a fan of this genre mainly because I find it quite ridiculous that they portray `teens' (however, most of the time the actors portraying these teens are actually in their 20s, which is another thing that bothers me) acting the way they do. It's even more disturbing to see some idiotic people follow the lead of these `teens' and act like this in real life, which I see more and more, and tend to avoid people like this. I do think that when looking back on this genre after 20 years that this film will be considered one of the better ones. 	Where I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, I would have to recommend it to certain types of people.",Empire Records
52,ghettodogaudio06,Very Cool Little Movie From The 90's,5,8 January 2008,"I own and have seen empire records many times. The first time I seen this movie was at film school. I love this movie for the soundtrack and cheesy teenage love between Liv Tyler and A.J. My favorite character is Deb, played by Robin Tunny. She shaves all her hair off like G.I. Jane to prove a point. She hates her life and wants to kill herself. Then you have Rene Z who is gorgeous in her youth in this film. She plays Liv Tyler's nymphomaniac friend. Then there is a couple other characters along with the cool boss Joe. The main plot of this story is about Lucas, assistant manager wanting to save the store from being bought out by Mega Mart or whatever cheesy corporate company wants to buy out Empire Records. So he takes all the closing money from Empire one night when he works and gets on his bike and goes to Atlantic city in hopes of making a lot of money so he can save the store. This movie is highly cheesy but a good teen flick with not too much inappropriate content for the youngsters. It also has an amazing soundtrack with, The Cranberries, Better Than Ezra, Cracker, Toad The Wet Sprocket and more!",Empire Records
53,LawnBoy-4,The ultimate poser flick,2,10 January 1999,"I wanted to like this film - I really did - but from the outset, I couldn't help but notice how cliched the characters were. I just couldn't bring myself to lend any empathy whatsoever to the ""tortured souls"" which were gratuitously scattered about the store. Frankly, they came across as posers.Let's see, there was the brainy, just-trying-to-be-accepted girl, the suicidal ""walk one day in my shoes and I MIGHT respect you"" girl, the token slut, the oh-so-cool but mighty mysterious & outrageously unrealistic beatnik dude, etc, etc. I couldn't help but think that the writer must've spent hours upon end in a local mall trying to get a beat on the pulse of today's youth. Sadly, he produced this bouillabaisse.Even more maddening was the intertwining of sub-plots designed to lend credence to each character. The scene in which the brainy one finally goes mad and begins ripping things apart was utterly ridiculous and completely forced.This is one of those films that actually made me blush - not because of any suggestive scenes, but because I became embarrassed that I was actually watching it!",Empire Records
54,Michael Bennett Cohn,so bad it's not even enjoyable in a bad way,3,26 July 2000,"There's not much to say about this movie. A boring, cliche story, poorly developed characters, and terrible writing. Renee Zellweger looks good in a short skirt, but Liv Tyler actually looks clownish and unattractive in many scenes. It's obviously meant to be a Breakfast Club/Big Chill for the 90s, but it isn't. One scene is even an over rip-off from the mock funeral in MASH. At one point, an aging baby-boomer rock star, teased by the hip, young record-store employees, says: ""Why don't you all just fade away?"" There. Now I've told you the best part of the movie. Don't see it.",Empire Records

What a mistake.This movie is full of soulless characters that share no chemistry. The dialogue is incredibly dull and there is practically no plot, aside for them having to save the store which rarely seems to come up and who cares anyway. It tries to be wacky for the sake of it, but just feels forced and inauthentic.Couldn't be more happy to reach the end of a movie.",Empire Records

Good Movie 7/10",Empire Records
57,Leatherface33,A funny and witty movie. Highly recommended for and fans of the rock music genre.,1,4 January 2004,"I was actually very impressed with this movie. Not only did it pack laugh-out-loud funny moments, but it even had a moral of friendship and love deep down. It had an awesome climax, a great ending, good acting, and some skillfully executed dramatic moments. Any fan of the rock genre will love this movie too. I like mostly old punk and some new stuff as well, and this movie had tunes from AC/DC and even cool original music (at least I think its original) that Renee Zellwegger sings. All in all, I praise the skillfully witty humor, and the moral that, and I know it's corny, you can accomplish great things if you stick by your friends. It is also quite entertaining to see Liv Tyler flip out after being criticized for a speed addiction, (generally not one of Liv Tyler's roles) and the character of ""Lucas"" is hilarious with his insightful views. So, if you are into modern or old rock music, check this out. As for me, 10 out of 10. ......Just Kidding! This movie sucked. 0 stars.",Empire Records

Americans came barging into the room at 2 in the morning and proceeded to make out in each other's beds for the next 5 hours. When I left at 6am the following morning two thoughts were racing(actually more like plodding) through my head: ""I hate American teenagers and I hate this movie.""

When Rory Cochrane says ""I wish that I was born blind so that I could look upon your face but once and spit in the wrong direction"" you know that it ain't no jive talking. Everyone else is excellent. When I comb my hair it creates a natural pompadour similar to Rex Manning, who has a sort of priggish charm.

I thought that besides Jeanie, the characters all had so much depth to them, and were very believable. I think that a lot of work has gone into this film, and the music fit each scene well.
This film makes me want to work in a record store too. I loved the dance scenes, these employees aren't just colleagues, they are lifelong friends, and it warmed my icy, cold heart.

It's the greatest collection of songs put into a movie.  Even better than Pulp Fiction.  There should be a BEST COMPILATION Oscar given to a music supervisor.  That's hard but in this kick-ass movie, it seems so effortless. The acting is also top-notch.  Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Anthony LaPaglia, Robin Tunney, Johnny Whitworth, Max Caulfield, Debi Mazur, and Rory Cochrane, one of the coolest people alive.  The script is really good. Directing, also good.  Everything was pretty invisible, and I absolutely mean that in a positive way.  Just like in the old days, when it was invisible, they put you in the movie.  I felt like I was with these characters the whole way.  The new ""Remix!  Special Fan Edition"" is probably better.  I can't decide.  They're both superb.10/10",Empire Records

And the funny thing is, we've all known these people ... and in some way, we've all been to Empire Records (for me, it's the legendary Princeton Record Exchange).So, the film has the cast, it has the ""feel"", and it certainly has the music.

65,michaelmunkvold,One of my favorite bad movies,6,30 May 2015,"""Empire Records"" is not a good movie: it's flimsy, shallow and deeply, profoundly stupid. It's like a cross between a Guess jeans commercial and an episode of ""I Love the 90s"", with pop culture references instead of dialog and youth culture clichés instead of characters. It's a Twinkie of a movie - a momentary sugar high with no nutritional value whatsoever.Yet, I can't help but like it. ""Empire Records"" is the kind of cheerfully brainless movie you watch when you're sick or you can't sleep. When you're too stressed to take anything of any substance, its high-spirited, empty-headed charm is pretty soothing, like comfort food or a pair of well-worn sweat pants. Sometimes you need to watch a stupid movie; when you feel such a need, ""Empire Records"" is just what the doctor ordered.""Empire Records"" doesn't have a story so much as a series of vignettes held together by a thin plot device: the titular record store, which is about to go out of business. The store is staffed by a motley group of Pretty White Kids With Problems who listen to inoffensively ""edgy"" alternative rock (Gin Blossoms, the Cranberries, etc). They spend their day in the store angsting over unrequited love, musing about movies and bands, and having the obligatory life-changing revelations. (This keeps them too busy to do any actual work; not once do you see anyone so much as clean the bathroom.) They then throw a big party that miraculously saves the store, and everybody finds love and happiness. The end.I know, it's ridiculous. ""Empire Records"" redefines the word ""stupid"". Nevertheless, every time I see this movie I can't help but smile. Maybe it takes me back to when I first saw it, at 14 - when all I wanted out of life was to hang out, listen to music, and feel like I had the elusive, all-important power of being cool.The cast - actors like Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger, and Brendan Sexton - were avatars of cool for adolescents in the mid-90s, and the simple act of watching them made us feel cool by proxy, as if they were letting us hang out with them at the popular kids' table. At that moment in our lives, they gave us what was then the ultimate gift: the fantasy of being forever young, beautiful and hip. Most people eventually outgrow the need to be cool, but when you're a teenager, it's like oxygen. ""Empire Records"" brings us back to an idealized version of that time, and the nostalgia washes over us in a wave of warm fuzzies. If a movie can do that, it doesn't need to be good.""Empire Records"" may not be a good movie in the strictest sense, but I can watch it with a smile on my face, even if I forget about it moments after I finish watching it. It's cinematic junk food, but so what? There's nothing wrong with a donut every now and again. Just don't let it spoil your appetite for more substantial fare.",Empire Records
66,po5mrk,"Perfect...Well, not quite Perfect",10,11 August 2001,"For me, Empire Records is a very conflicting movie.  On the one hand, it's hysterically funny.  On the other hand, it attempts to make great revelations about America's youth.  Somehow, though, it all works!  Sure, there are some ""sappy"" predictable parts that you're not sure whether to laugh or cry at, but the timing of these scenes is fantastic.  One thing that really struck me about this film is the amazing use of music.  Certain songs can be heard repeatedly throughout the movie which really help to distinguish parallel story lines.

The drama, comedy, and music work well together all around.Liv Tyler really impressed me in her role. She was very convincing as an intelligent young lady on her way to Harvard.

68,emily37,a good teen movie that shows how bad today's teen movies have gotten,9,27 August 2003,"with the recent release of the special edition dvd of this film, i'd suggest you go watch it.  yeah, this movie is a light, fluffy gen-x teen movie with its music video moments.  however, what was eight years ago just a normal teen movie has gained some semblance of social relevance --  compared to today's teen movies, this film can be seen as some sort of masterpiece. 
for one thing, you never see films anymore where teens are actually fighting for something except for a date to the prom.  the characters in empire records, yes, are submerged in their overdramatic romantic escapades, but their main prerogative in the film is to prevent a large corporation from buying out their independent record store.  are there films that spark that kind of activist spirit in middle- and high- schoolers today?  no.  we're going backwards.  also, the humor in this film offers up some absurdist wit, which you never find in teen movies now.  a kid glues some quarters to the floor so he can laugh at the poor saps who later try desperately to pick them up.  a shoplifting teenager gives the fake name of 'warren beatty'.  do kids today even know who warren beatty is?  i doubt it.this film was made in 1995, right before many of the laws allowing corporations to buy and control multiple media outlets were passed.  the years since '96 have shown us a homogenization of music and movies, especially in the teen sphere, and it is turning today's teens into a bunch of celebrity-obsessed idiots. compared to your sons and daughters, the kids in empire records can be now seen as role models.",Empire Records

Empire Records is not one of those films. I know some people have a soft spot for this one, but not me. Empire Records is one of the most abysmally annoying films I've ever seen in my life. There is no character, no charm, no originality, no effort! It all feels like one long, poorly edited music video with a sloppy screenplay attached at the last minute. Speaking of which, this movie is written terribly! There is a point when one character commits a federal crime, which would normally result in a prison sentence, and the action is brushed off like nothing! In fact, there are multiple scenes just like this. The film also has the dignity to take difficult subject matter such as drugs, depression, and even suicide, and just brush them off in its own idiotic way before returning to more quick editing, loud music, and screaming teenagers. I want to say Empire Records is so bad it's good, but that would require actual enjoyment from the film. As far as that goes, I received none.

I will focus on one thing, simply to hint at how horrible this film is.  The music.  The music was absolutely chosen by director, who demanded that hip music only existed between 1976 and 1983.  That period, I fear, was not exactly a stellar period.  This film contains a dance number to AC-DC.  Thats right.  Because the kids absolutely LOVE David Bowie.  And dance numbers.

But since this movie wants to be a comedy with some drama parts I can only advise to never watch it.

I guess not. I hated this movie the first time, and I hated it the second time. It is so fake and so obnoxious with these characters who are all a bunch of dumb asses. I have no idea what anyone sees in this movie. Liv Tyler was god awful (as usual), playing a virgin who is really a slutty bimbo.

What Empire Records succeedes in doing is taking a day in the life of a place that all teenagers can relate to (A music shop), taking a cast of gorgeous, hip young things, playing a brilliant soundtrack throughout, and chucking in some quotes that you can go over again, and again with your friends (me and my friend's personal favourite is Joe and Lucas' 'where's the money gone' conversation, that is as funny now as it was all those many viwings ago).Anybody who disregards Empire Records as a badly-acted, unrealistic film with a weak story-line, and cliched characters are missing the point entirely.

I found myself identifying with every single character in some way, and Empire made it easy to laugh at the true insanity of what people who work retail go through: obnoxious customers, bosses that are cool, higher ups that suck, etc.The movie made me a lifelong fan of Coyote Shivers' music (check out his CD if you haven't already -- it's a scream) and many of the talented players, but especially Ethan (Randall) Embry and Kimo Wills.Highly recommended by this ex-record store clerk!",Empire Records

People who see it after about 1996 won't like it due to the fact that most of the music in the movie A)  Is terrible and B) has disappeared with the rest of the crap that was in the mid-90s music genre.Many problems go unresolved in this movie, dialogue is forced, and everything is very unimaginable.

It just makes me happy.",Empire Records
80,DecemberGirl86,One of my all time favorites!,9,14 October 2002,"Empire Records is a hilarious and moving look into the lives of a group of teenagers during one day at the independent record store where they work. Though they may be very different, they all have the common bond of simply loving music. There's all types of personalities in this wonderful cast: the straight-A perfectionist with more than a few secrets (Liv Tyler), the slut who only acts the way she does to cover up her insecurities (Renee Zellweger), the lovably funny and hyperactive punk-rock kid who dreams of being in his own band (Ethan Embry), the misunderstood suicidal goth whose self-destructive ways only make you like her more (Debi Mazar), the wise father-figure *though he's still their age* who has made his own share of mistakes that have a cost (Rory Cochrane), and finally the hopeless romantic who obsesses over the people he cares about (Johnny Whitworth). This is wildly entertaining, a little bit weird, but overall a great look into 1990's culture. The whole cast is great, but standouts are Ethan Embry and Rory Cochrane who steal the scenes they are in. Also the soundtrack is awesome. Go check this one out, you won't be dissappointed! 9/10",Empire Records
81,fatality713,they cant be serious,4,24 April 2002,"I just finished watching this movie. let me start by saying that I usually dont comment on movies, unless they are exceptionally good or exceptionally bad. normally I just leave a rating. I'll admit, I downloaded this movie purely because Liv Tyler was in it. My expectations were not all that high, just that it have something resembling a plot, decent acting and that she look good in it. Well, they got one of those right, and it damn sure wasn't the acting or the plot. what kind of high quality **** are these people smoking and where can I get some of this stuff. Okay, the main story line of this movie is that this kid stole over $9000 dollars from his employer. this is not a spoiler by the way, it occurs in the first five minutes of the movie. The only form of punishment that he is subjected to is that he has to sit on the couch. no police report, no termination of employment, as a matter of fact, the manager tries to commit fraud to cover up for this guy. Horrible acting, one of the basic 14 or so plots floating around in hollywood, just the names and places substituted. I gave it 3/10, just because of the fact that liv tyler appeared in her underwear, and that you get to see rene zellweger in skimpy clothing, but that was being liberal. I just don't like giving anything a real low score. I dont know what else I can possibly say that could be considered positive. don't waste your time. later.",Empire Records
82,Chandler81,Yuck,3,12 April 2005,"I was excited to see Empire Records for the first time a few years ago. I had several friends and acquaintances who raved about it and I was more than impressed to see Toad the Wet Sprocket and Gin Blossoms on the soundtrack. Talk about being disappointed. This is a dull film with little merit beyond the obvious appeal of its idle fantasy. ""We're young and we have problems but we stick together and straighten ourselves out with a party"" seems to be the single puerile point this movie drives for.The characters are almost without exception completely unlikable and poorly developed (although the bald girl is rather cool). One character blows all the record store's money at the beginning of the film, no reason given. Liv Tyler wants to sleep with her aging pop idol and elicits no sympathy. Zellweger actually does sleep with him and elicits even less. I wanted to slap them both. The artist with the coins in the floor is in love with Liv but I just wished he would see how impossibly stupid she was and date someone else. Maybe the bald girl, since she was the film's single redeeming character (and that's not saying much).Worst of all is the erratic, potentially mentally ill manager played by Anthony LaPaglia. This is by no means a criticism of fine actor Anthony, but his character is appallingly written, shifting from nurturing and understanding father figure to angry and psychotic manager type between - and even within - scenes. Nothing about the film feels consistent or worth caring about.If you want to watch a good film about music try High Fidelity or Almost Famous, where the characters are actually entertaining and well written and the stories not the stuff of ridiculous adolescent fantasy.",Empire Records

84,Jockey1,Teen Cult Classic,9,26 December 2003,"I know this film isn't everyone's 'cup of tea,' but for anybody who likes watching this type of teen movie, this is one of the best around!  I first watched it all the way through on video at a friends house, and found myself in hysterics throughout most of it!  Okay, the characters and plot aren't very well developed, but its a feel good, escapist teen movie full of laughs, and is probably responsible for much of the younger generations' aspirations to work in a record store.  The characters are funny, especially Mark, and there is an abundance of one-liners.  Also, as someone else commented, it has become very nostalgic of the early to mid-90s.  Don't watch it if you hate teen movies, but if you do, go out and buy it now!",Empire Records
85,mr pink,damn the man,9,28 September 1998,"Empire Records is very 80's but for the 90's.  Great cast, great script, well directed and entertaining.  Not to be taken seriously but to be enjoyed.  It gives hope to me in a strange way that even though everything around you sucks that you have the power to change it...all it takes is fate.  The reason that this movie is so great is that its characters are all of us,(very reminiscent of Breakfast Club) you have to identify with at least one if not all of the characters in some asspect.  Also superb soundtrack. Damn the man save the empire!!!!",Empire Records
86,lclarricoates,Probably the best Record Shop in the world!,9,4 April 2006,"Get out the popcorn, pour yourself a coke, put the dog and cat out and go to the toilet cause you don't wanna leave your seat because you are gonna be glued to your TV screen! The plot isn't the best in the world but 5 minutes in and you want the delectable Anthony LaPaglia to be your boss, and Liv Tyler to be your best mate! I only have one problem with the whole thing - Max Caulfield as a cheap Z-list singer and the cheesy tune they enjoy inflicting upon your poor ears! Anyway thats not the point! If you love movies like Grosse Point Blank or anything from that mid-nineties late teenage movie boom, you'll love this movie as much as I love this movie and I love Anthony LaPaglia even more! But don't take my word for it people - Go Watch The Movie!",Empire Records
87,chocokitty11,A really underrated movie,9,22 January 2011,"I adore this movie. Right after I saw it, it was my new favorite. It was really funny and had a great script. The soundtrack ROCKED. But I think my favorite part about this movie is the characters. They all seemed so real, like people I could be friends with or go to school with. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and good points and bad points. It seemed a lot more realistic than how most teen movies are where there is one really bland main character and then he or she has its quirky stereotypical friends. This movie is little hard to get into at first but thats the only thing I don't like. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially if they like movies like The Breakfast Club. I fell in love with this movie, and I hope you will enjoy it too. DAMN THE MAN, SAVE THE EMPIRE! ;)",Empire Records
88,andrew-traynor1,"I'm Cool, Honest!",4,29 October 2003,"Well get this, kids.  Hip indie record story is threatened by The Man (i.e. a proposed take-over by a big, and therefore evil, music chain).  The manager isn't helped by on of his employees gambling away his buyout funds, the rest of them spending most of their time pratting about or the visit of a superannuated rock star.  But, after a few predictable bouts of teenage angst, everything somehow ends happily in a big party.It's actually quite hard putting down a film which so desperately wants to be liked, and which features some of Hollywood's brighter young things (Angeline Joly etc.)  There are also a couple of good moments and a smattering of fine lines.  Unfortunately it shares the common Hollywood misconception that record shop employees are impossibly cool and they and their customers keeping breaking out into spontaneous dance.  And most of the scenes not irritating are soppy.  And for such a supposedly happening film, its soundtrack is frankly lame.  (No Nirvana or Pixies but plenty of Meatloaf and, for Christ's sake, Dire Straits).  And all along you are wishing Kevin Smith had scripted it so the annoying bits would be replaced by, well, funny ones.",Empire Records
89,hammerfan1,A Day In The Life,10,5 September 2007,"Ever wonder where the cool slackers hang out and what they do on a daily basis. Well, here is the 1995 version of that. This comedy / drama is easily the best of it's kind. This ranks up there with ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Chasing Amy"" as the best slacker movies of all time, even though all three are from the same decade. Maybe it's because the 90's was the decade of the slacker.Once upon a time, before digital downloading dominated the music scene, cool kids hung out at record stores. In this film a talented cast plays a variety of these cool kids (and adults). Liv Tyler plays the pretty and popular brainiac who is headed to Harvard. Renee Zelweger is the sultry teenaged seductress. Johnny Whitworth is the artist who is afraid to do anything with his talent. The amazing Rory Cochrane is the 'James Dean' type who is sort of the mystical center of the movie. Robin Tunney gives a haunted performance of a troubled, suicidal teen. Rounding out the rest of the teen cast, there are also two boys who worship rock & roll as well as a wanna-be guitarist.The adult cast is just as amazing as the younger actors, though outnumbered. Joe Mantegna plays 'Joe', the ex-musician and current record store manager who knows that he was meant for bigger and better things. Zoe Deschanel is the manager of a washed up pop star who is attempting a comeback. She shares Joe's views of her life. And Maxwell Caulfield is 'Rex Manning', the aforementioned pop star. He is perhaps the most underrated actor in the film. He plays ""Sexy Rexy"" with a cheesy self assurance that is masking the fact that Rex knows that his sex symbol days are well behind him.The plot of the film is pretty thin. The owner of the record store plans to sell the store to a franchise that promises to rid the store and it's employees of any individuality. But that's okay, because the movie isn't really plot driven. It's a character study about the young and the young at heart hiding their true ambitions and selves behind false facades while they wile away their days hanging out at the record store.Overall, this is a well written movie about characters that are well worth rooting for. It also boasts a great soundtrack of rock and alternative music that helps add to the fun atmosphere.",Empire Records

I love Anthony Lapaglia, I love the quotes from this film (too many to list, really!) and I think there's no one more attractive than Johnny Lee Miller as ""AJ the soulful artist, in love..."", though Ethan Embry in his skaters doofballness is still cute, in my mind's eye.

97,Brad Eleven,Suspend your disbelief and enjoy,8,3 July 2005,"From a cynical viewpoint, you could say that this is just ""Friends"" with great music, near-profanity, and sex. There's nothing wrong with that perspective, but you'd be missing out on a treat. An overly sugary treat (like the brownies in the film), but with some actual nutrition within. If nothing else, you get to see some now-successful actors in some of their earliest work.I randomly found this film on the TV this morning, and I couldn't look away. The angle to this ""I found family"" film is that it starts with what most films take half of their time to get to: the failure that transforms the characters. Right off the bat, the misfit loner takes money that either belongs to the manager, the store, or both, and loses it gambling in Atlantic City. Here's one of the things that works: the manager doesn't turn him in, or beat him up (at least not until an hour into the film). He makes him sit on the couch!! Yes, there are stereotypes, and shallow ones at that, and still there is some character transformation during the course of the story. The saving grace is the music, which for 1995 was pretty daring. And everyone works their issues out somehow, i.e., we don't really get to see how, we just get the headlines. The exposition is predictable and predictably presented: for the most part, the characters announce to each other what's happened. A few times, they do it right to the camera.It still works, somehow. Of course it has a happy ending. And there's a very Friends-like dance scene, but not in some fountain, it's on the roof of the store, and it's not at the beginning, it's at the end. Like refined sugar, this kind of treat isn't bad for you in moderation.",Empire Records
98,konichiwaboonichika,A missed opportunity,6,26 May 2021,"This had a chance to be a ""Breakfast Club"" of the 90s, but fell short.The story had too many characters, too many forced situations, too many cliches and no surprise twists at the end. So much of the movie is the cast sitting around doing nothing, that about 10 minutes could have easily been cut from the run time.Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. It's just easily forgettable like so many other ""teen"" movies from the 90s. It truly was a soundtrack in search of a movie and nostalgia is the best thing going for it.",Empire Records

The advantage is that good music and movies are coming in more easily and that is importantI might be biased by all this, but this i such a nice movie, even with all the cheesy lines and happenings. I like the characters, so different and quirky and the plot, so easy to digest, yet not simple. Of course this is not a masterpiece and yet it is enjoyable and funny and even the fact that it's portraying some small piece of an era so well is amazing. I've watched this in 2013 and yet I could relate and understand it was a good teen movie, meant to entertain and make you fell like those simpler times were the place to be, like you wanted to go back to that somehow...

It's hard to not adore it, in my opinion. However, I'm not sure if you'd be able to really enjoy it if you're not a fan of rock music.Anyway, there was a LITTLE predictability, but if there wasn't any, it wouldn't be a fictional movie, you know? The cast was pretty good and the multiple plot lines kept me interested. Besides...who can resist the scenes that all of the employees rock out to and the witty lines? I can't think of anyone who could. Anyway, at least give the movie a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed if you're looking for a fun movie.",Empire Records

It represents teen life in my opinion and it just good fun. My favorite character would have to be Lucus (the guy who has to sit on the couch for almost the whole movie.) He is so funny! He's just gives insight on life and is so funny to watch. I think that you should see this movie if you haven't and enjoy. Buh-Bye,Empire Records

104,jaimiedlev,Wow--This movie has certainly become dated,3,15 January 2007,"I remember when this came out--it was 1995 and I had just graduated high school and was entering university. Everyone I spoke to who had seen this movie at that time really liked it, but I thought it looked totally lame, so I never saw it.Fast forward to last night, when I did! Owch! It was so bad. Worst of all, the music, the clothes, all that stuff--I wore the little minis, the belly shirts, the big boots, dated boys with skater haircuts--now I know how my mom felt when she looked back into the '70's and realized that the Farrah Fawcett hair and big owl glasses were not the height of style.Plus the plot on this movie was weak, weak, weak. If there EVER was a place where people could work and this kind of adolescent s**t went on, even in the mid-nineties, I would guarantee they would get fired. What kind of manager puts up with this drama? And to have an employee have sex with a guest in a closet AT WORK? Classy! Dancing with your shirt off in the aisles? Woo-hoo! Sounds professional to me! Why not shave your head at work before your shift--and leave all your hair in the sink? Yay! But I guess I perhaps missed seeing this in the window where it might have been relevant to me. I hope that teenagers today realize that someday they are going to look back someday and see just how silly their fashions (hello 80's new wave! Wait--there's nothing new about it) will look with 12 years distance. This movie takes whatever coolness that existed in the time period and encapsulates it into a sitcom-esquire music video. So I do have to say, Booo.On a horrible note, this movie brought home the fact that Renee Zellweger has NEVER BEEN YOUNG. Liv Tyler and I are the same age (29) and I don't think that she looks much different, which is a good thing. Renee Zellweger looks like a less pruney version of herself, but definitely not a teenager! Don't waste your time on this crap! See ""Kids"" or even ""Swingers"" if you want a cooler mid-nineties vibe.",Empire Records
105,write_the_wrong,Why do people love this movie so much?,7,12 September 2008,"Empire Records has been regarded as a cult favorite from the last couple decades. The story in general is nothing special. It's predictable, generic, and at times not even existent. Lets be serious here, the film ends in about a half dozen separate miracles, every problem was solved by the end of the day  everybody's never been better, and they all dance on a rooftop. So how has this film maintained such a dedicated fan base over all these years? What this film was so successful in was having such a great cast, and an even better soundtrack. Since the plot of the film was so lacking, the film had to rely heavily on dialogue in order to push the story forward and keep the audience engaged. Every role was cast perfectly, each character unique and troubled in their own way. All of the performers played very well off of each other, when you watched the movie it truly felt as though you were watching these people for a day at their record store. All of the characters were believable, and interesting to watch.Perhaps the strongest attribute to the film, however, was its soundtrack. The music throughout the film was able to keep the audience into every character, every emotion, and every scene that was appearing before them. The music was refreshing, fun, and very fitting to the scenes they were attached to. The music will probably always be regarded as the most remarkable aspect of the film.What's so interesting about this movie is the fact that it is able to be so successful even without a decent story. The filmmakers were able to use different resources in order to engage an audience and keep so many people interested in the film  even so many years after its release. Empire Records truly was revolutionary for its time.",Empire Records

108,andy_hall,Something for everyone,10,25 November 2000,"Well, first of all, Empire Records reminded me of Seinfeld in the way that it's plotlines are very deep and inter-related.  Every character interacts with the others at one point in the movie.  In the end, every single loose end is tied up and the audience is left feeling satisfied.Another main attraction to this movie is the music.  There are tons of songs in the movie, each one is well placed and important.  The music practically pulls the story along at times.  Overall, the movie was well edited, well scored, and well acted.

Movies often lose their appeal as I mature, but this one never has.  My second favorite thing about this movie is that every scene is one of my favorite scenes.  There are no bad or dull parts to this movie.  It is a classic that many different people can agree on.  Another great thing about this movie is that all of the characters (except one whom we're not meant to like) are REALLY likeable.

It not only has a great cast, full of young and talented actors, but it also has a good plot, and a killer soundtrack. There are several smaller story lines running together, which all meet up in the end to prove that, while music may not actually save lives, it sure can make you feel a whole heck of a lot better. The characters are easily identifiable, and you can almost instantly relate to at least one of them in one way or another.

Empire Records has everything: the music, great and likable characters, comedy, romance and drama. All the actors are superb, and many of them I find still don't get the credit they deserve. One of Liv Taylor's best performances to date, and one of Renee Zellweger's first but best roles. I could name the rest of the cast too, because they are equally or even more brilliant than those mentioned, lets just say there is a huge diversity in character, yet they all seem to have something in common. They all love their job, and who wouldn't! Believe me, when you watch this film, you will be wishing you too worked at Empire.

115,corridorg4,every possible teen angst in two hour period,3,4 May 2005,"This was like a large puddle - shallow and muddy. It's a sad day when the best performance in a film is by a C-grade washed up actor playing a washed up singer. Maxwell Caulfield drew from his own experiences and it showed - him I believed. The rest of the characters were so cookie cutter.I couldn't believe the level of angst and pathos in this film. It just went on and on. I managed a CD/video store for a while and had teenage employees AND worked counseling teenagers for two years. I saw some of those problems, but in one day???!!! Give me a break. The writers got together and threw in the entire table of contents of a high school counselor's handbook. Maybe if the writers had reduced the number of characters and their many manias, there could have been a bit of character development.And as the store manager, I would have been on the phone so fast to report the theft and the thief. I am not going down for some punk kid who thinks he has the magic touch at a craps table.I gave it a 3 because I liked the music and from a technical standpoint, it was well done.",Empire Records
116,SenshiKid,"Memorable, time-appropriate movie for the ages",9,7 September 2005,"First off, the main reason I like this movie is because it's so memorable. It's set in the mid-90's in a giant record store(think Tower without the corporation) called ""Empire Records."" So, basically what happens is a chain of events that are only related to each other in the sense that they have to do with either the shop or its employees. It's very basic, with a pretty weak plot, but is fulfilled through its characters. Speaking of characters, there is a LOT of symbolism going for this movie. What I admire about it most is that some of these characters, though symbolic, are very well fleshed out and I could swear that I've actually met people exactly like this. On the other hand, the character Rex Manning, supposed to symbolize the death of pop ""artists"" who sing and get paid, is very flat and has no background to speak of. The director made him just a tad bit too obvious about his role, so he didn't seem like a real person. You get my point.Favorite character: Debra (remember the Craft?!) Favorite scene: Ethan's character chomping some herbal brownies and watching TV was hilarious, but the scene after the credits roll between the same character and the long haired boy talking about music was probably the most meaningful scene in the whole movie. Least favorite scene: Lucas gets anchored to the couch after he lost all the money. I think if I was a manager I might have actually fired him at some point...or at least smacked the snot out of him. Least favorite character: The manager! No back story, no good dialog really, and he was so freaking unrealistic(especially when he was mad at someone). He was a good actor but the director should have written him a back story, because he only /looked/ like he was complicated. Not good enough.And that's my review. This movie has great music and unforgettable characters, but an uninteresting meta-plot and two-dimensional adults kills the fun considerably.Until I hear it frooooom you...",Empire Records
117,vicki_lee,MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER!,10,14 July 2019,I stumbled upon this movie one day in high school on my regular cable. I love Liv Tyler so automatically I stopped on this channel to watch this movie. As I continue to watch I laughed I smiled and I felt for the characters. This movie is one of the most feel good and real movies I have ever seen in my whole entire life and it will continue to be my favorite movie from the day I watched it and on.,Empire Records
118,freymaroto,"Good, but not great",7,16 February 2006,"it's a good movie, it is good to see a movie about music and rock and roll, but it is only a nice try. the soundtrack is weak, the jokes are funny but not funny enough. Liv Tyler was the coolest thing on the movie. Good bands are missing, but any way it is a good movie, but just that...now that you've seen it, i say you check out High Fidelity or Almost Famous for a real great Rock and Roll movie.The soundtrack does not contain legendary bands, maybe just Gin Blossoms, there is so much to comment about bands and styles, different music when you are in a record store. the country singer was ridiculous, but any way i have to say i really liked the part where one guy says that a record y like an investment.",Empire Records

123,g_cribbage,"""Breakfast Club"" of the 90's",10,4 June 2007,"Empire Records is a great movie about life and music in the 90's. The characters are in some ways generic archetypes, and in other ways well fleshed out individuals. Much like the characters in The Breakfast Club showed how it was to be a youth in the 80's. The cast of this movie did not become another ""bratpack"" but many have went on to successful careers. They did a great job of acting without taking themselves too seriously. The movie also has great quotable lines and a wonderful soundtrack. The movie was released the year I graduated from high school and entered college. It resonated with what I felt at this time. I echo many other who said they would love to have worked in a place like this.",Empire Records

125,mattstengel,Plotless,5,4 March 2003,"Going into Empire records, I admit that I had high expectations.  Having just come off of a High Fidelity buzz (Record store movies were kind of a theme that night), I decided to watch Empire for the first time and afterwards I was very let down.So many people I know talk about this movie as if it were some kind of a god-send or something.  To me it was just mediocre at best.  The beginning starts off very funny with Lucas' debacle, and I would think that they would really take that and build a decent plot around it; but the writer and director failed...miserably.The problem is that this movie is way too outlandish and indecisive.  No one person is the central focus, the movie is comprised of several little sub plots, and this gives the audience no real connection to any of the characters and caused me to not give a d-mn about any of them.  What little plot the movie has is just too weak to hold up, and so many unrealistic situations happen.As far as being funny, there were few moments where I genuinely laughed. And as far as being dramatic, I couldn't feel for any of the characters because of the lack of attention focused on any one of them.  Empire Records is at best an average ""teen flick"" and couldn't keep me interested.  Want a better movie involving a record store?  See High Fidelity.  It has much more meaning than this shallow movie.",Empire Records
126,Neo_Reloaded1,Excellent plotline and cast!,10,3 January 2004,"Empire Records is a unique, hilarious movie that has been my favorite since I've seen it in 95. There's an intriguing and original plotline, yes, but the cast of characters really brought it to life. Liv Tyler plays the short-tempered Corey, Johnny Whitworth plays the adorable (A.K.A. hot) artist A.J., Ethan Embry (as Ethan Randall) plays the strange rocker Mark, Coyote Shivers plays the guitar playing Berko, and Anthony LaPaglia plays Joe, the manager of Empire Records, who brings it all together. This movie has a great soundtrack, and I especially liked the headbanging scenes. All in all, a great funny movie you can watch again and again.",Empire Records

Sure, there is a plot- they need to make money to save the record store but that's not the most important thing about this movie.  I love the characters in this movie.  They're not the typical teen movie characters but you can see a little Breakfast Club in them if you look hard enough.   It is cleverly written and very applicable if you're into memorizing lines.  I strongly recommend seeing this movie- several times! Save the Empire!",Empire Records

A disaster. There are no words that describe how bad this movie really is. Who wrote this crap? You need a script a director and actors to make a movie; it looks like they had none on this one. Just watched it on Cable TV on ""Multiplex"". The words ""stupid"" ""inane"" and ""childish"" come to mind. What a waste of money time and film. Did anyone actually think this project was worth making? Why waste your time on this. BAD BAD BAD Above all they needed a producer who could say NO NO NO rather than yes.

It is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again and not tire of.  It is by far the best teen film ever made.  Although it is not a cinematic masterpiece, Empire Records is the most unique teen film.  The characters have depth, the dialogue is snappy, and no one in the movie is a cliche.  I enjoy that it's portrayal of teenagers is the most accurate I have seen.  There are no popular group or geeks, but instead a diverse group that manages to get along even though they do not all like each other.  For what it is, Empire Records is an amazing movie worth watching many, many times.",Empire Records

This movie wants so hard to be Malllrats or High Fidelity (yes, I know that movie was a couple of years later) and fails miserably. Even the way they sing in that whiny pop-punk voice irritates me.Also, why the hell does the guy get away with stealing the money? In fairness, the movie may be a victim of its age as its now 21 years old, but I can't ever imagined having watched it back in the day and thought it was worth it.",Empire Records

144,thetruewheel,"Feature-length version of the musical montage from ""The Breakfast Club""",2,22 March 2003,"This dog's theatrical release was canceled in most cities due largely to the uniformly terrible reviews it got. Straight-to-video is seldom the mark of a great film, and this one is no exception. Way too many montages of the standard cast of variously troubled teen stereotypes dancing, working, and jumping around pointlessly to the soundtrack tunes. Thin plot, dumb dialogue, no character development. Attempts at humor are lame, attempts at drama are laughable. Strictly for the Renee Zellweger or Liv Tyler completist. Only plus: may seem funny (in a camp sort of way) in five years or so when we're all laughing at how stupid the 90s were. If you're thinking about renting this one, do yourself a favor and just see ""High Fidelity"" again instead.",Empire Records
145,votefornumbersix,Great for what it is,9,23 October 2010,"Empire Records is a simple, feel-good teen movie with a predictable and cliché happy ending and, as other reviewers have noted, completely one dimensional characters. That being said, I have to admit that I love it for what it is. Sometimes I want to watch a deep and thought provoking movie with a complex storyline and sometimes I just want to keep it light. For the latter, Empire Records is perfect. The primary characters are a bunch of teens working in a record store, each with their own set of problems ranging from unrequited love to attempted suicide. The plot of the story is centered around the possibility of Empire Records turning into a MusicTown, which would put an end to the kids' relaxed and fun work environment. It's simple, sure, and there's something so overdone and cliché about a bunch of teens complaining about ""the man,"" but the good music, original jokes, and hilarious antics of the store employees more than make up for this.While it's true that each character is only as deep as their typical teen problem, you almost don't want to know anything else about them. The existence of their problems makes for a legitimate storyline but the absence of anything else keeps the movie light and unpretentious. Almost every one of them is likable simply because they listen to good music and make funny jokes. Ethan Embry's character Mark is hands down the best, as a lovable dopey pothead with some of the best lines in the movie. Next would have to be Rory Cochrane's character Lucas. His little sayings throughout the film aren't supposed to be taken as insightful because they're such obvious BS, just like all teenage attempts at being deep. They're hilarious because they are so empty and ridiculous. It's only a nine because I hate Liv Tyler's whiny and annoying character Corey. She's smart enough to get into Harvard but stupid enough to think that offering her virginity to Rex Manning would be in any way special. Her little faux-tirade at A.J. toward the end of the movie (""You're so special and you're so talented...."" blah, blah, blah) is the absolute worst.",Empire Records
146,shinyobjects,required viewing,9,20 May 2007,"It's safe to say I love this movie. Anyone who works with high school or college students (or those of that age group) must watch this film. It proves that life is never dull or meaningless if you're surrounded by people who really care about you, even if those people are your fellow tattooed, gum-chewing freaks. I love the friendships between these kids and their relationship with their boss. Anyone who doesn't understand Lucas and Joe's relationship has never had a mentor or been one. And Joe's love/hate relationship with his workers is so well written and portrayed. When I watched this for the first time, I was trying to figure out just when the writer had been a fly on my wall. My favorite line: ""Have I fired anyone today? No! Why would I start with you?"" I suggest watching it repeatedly. You'll catch something new every time.",Empire Records
147,fat_nerd,I've seen better,6,21 February 2004,"Alright, I just finished watching this movie for the first time because a couple of my friends highly recommended it to me, saying it was by far their favorite movie. So, when my other friend bought it, i headed on over in anticipation, only to be disappointed by its bland and played out plot, little and sporadic humor, and lack of character development. Also, a few characters really annoyed the crap out of me like Mark and Corey. Mark is possibly the most annoying character I've ever seen or at least in the top 5 or 10. I also wanted to strangle Cory, Liv Tyler's character, at times, especially with her psychotic bipolar disorder shown a few times in the movie. I dunno I just felt like the end couldn't have come at a better time. In spite of these problems, I did enjoy Joe and most of the other character's however. All in all, I would give this movie a 6 to 6.5 on a scale of 10.",Empire Records
148,lelizardqueen,perfect and genuine and amazing,9,20 February 2005,"this movie is perfection. its not deep, but it means something. its not groundbreaking, but its funny. really funny. the soundtrack is quirky and delightful and fitting, its characters are at once cliché and then universally relatable to your life. you don't always need cinematic brilliance to never forget a film like this. I've seen it over 20 times with all of my friends and can say every line like i wrote the script. i don't like sentimental teen flicks, but this is a cult classic that is worth a rental, no, purchase...because you'll want to see it again. for every random act of dancing, every perfect one-liner, and how much it makes you want to work in a record store....i LOVE this movie.",Empire Records
149,queenofthehighway2,"Not Shawshank Redemption, but wasn't meant to be.",7,10 January 2005,"I first discovered this film as a teenager and loved it(probably owing to the number of attractive males in the cast!). I haven't seen it in a few years and wonder if I'd still be as enthusiastic about it now.However, I do remember that at the time of my obsession with this film I always maintained that it was not yet another pointless teen movie. The cast was well picked and stand-out performances come from (despite previous role as a nobody in the excruciatingly awful 'Dazed and Confused') Rory Cochrane, who is utterly endearing as the witty Lucas. The mix of new actors like Liv Tyler and Ethan Randall with better known actors such as Anthony la Paglia and Maxwell Caulfield (who is outstanding as the sleazy Rex Manning) works a treat and makes for a thoroughly entertaining film. Not only is it filled with gags and myriad band name-checks, but for anyone in their late teens/early twenties who posed the question 'what the hell am I doing with my life?' this film touches on the more sensitive side of growing up too. And lets not forget the triumphant ending which sees the independent store achieve victory over corporate take-over! Excellent soundtrack and amusing music-geek conversations between 'Eddie' and 'Mark' could easily be two of your friends at a party.",Empire Records
150,boxybrown305,if you see one movie this year... make sure its not this one,1,24 February 2005,"Empire Records is the worst movie about music there possibly can be (with the exception of possibly 8 mile). The basic theme is the workings of a small time record store, about to become a major music store. The problem with this is the fact that it is ALREADY a major music store, but everyone is too damn dumb and blind to realize it. Its an awful movie with awful actors and an awful plot.Absolutely none of the characters have any emotion that's more than skin deep. The one and only thing that was ever remotely good about the movie was seeing Lyv Tyler undress, though it certainly isn't worth it to sit through over an hour and a half of CRAP to see less than I could find on the internet in less than five seconds. Honestly, who could actually like bulls**t like this? I borrowed the movie from a friend, and having seen it I am very glad that I did not pay money to see something like this. I would say I want my money back, but instead I'd like the time wasted on this back to do something more useful like burn as many copies of it as I can. If you really want to see what a real small time record store looks like in the form of a movie (with good acting and an actually interesting plot), see High Fidelity. It's soooooo much better.Once I finished watching this movie, I could only think two things: 1) THANK GOD!!!!!!, and 2) I can't believe that I actually sat through the whole thing. It's probably because I have such a high appreciation for music, that I though it must get better at some point (Steven Tyler must have disowned his daughter after such a disgraceful movie). Despite anticipation though, it only got worse as the ""plot"" thickened, finally drawing to a conclusion that's ""fun for the whole family!""...

I especially liked Ethan Embry as Mark and Johnny Whitworth as A.J. I was really surprised with how well Liv Tyler acted the part. The characters themselves are really relate able, and made me want to work at that store so badly. Also, it had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.

The characters are all completely different and the different reactions we get from each them in each situation allows the audience to relate to every circumstance in one way or another. Many people, however, may not like the movie, simply because it does not mesh with their sense of humor. The humor is definately aimed at teens of today, although my parents think it is hilarious. Backed with an outstanding soundtrack, I have found it impossible to get sick of it. I laugh everytime. Most of the humor is not found in jokes but rather in the characters, especially Lucas, Mark, and Rex Manning (at least in his video). Well definately see the movie, but keep in mind while your watching it, the movie isn't a comedy but the character's personalities make it funny.",Empire Records

I'd like to remind those viewers that life doesn't always need to be serious.  Go Crazy, have a little fun!  It won't hurt you once, and that's the attitude you must have while watching this movie.Also, I'd like to address the fact that many negative reviewers have targeted the fans of the movie, saying that they are ""dumb,"" and that they hate the watch the world be taken over by them.  Don't target the fans, everyone has a different taste.  Please.  Its just immature.In conclusion, I rate this movie a 10 out of 10.  The acting is brilliant, (once again, especially by Embry, his laugh, attitude, the entire essence of him never to be duplicated) and the one liners are hilarious.  Great Job!",Empire Records

We are young and that movie remind us about us =) We fall in love, we fight we love and ""hate"" our friends. That is what that movie is about. I have never written a comment on a movie so I don't know how to do a good job on this.But the movie is about a video store and the people that works there. They are young and they are good friends but there is some trouble among them but it is a fun, beautiful and GREAT movie. You will: LLL *Love it, Learn it and Live it*  =)Have a great day!!

162,reskusic,"Not the best movie I've seen, but possibly the one I've seen the most.",8,5 August 2000,"Ever since the second day of my Junior year in college, Empire Records has held a position of mythic importance in my life and that of those around me. I've probably seen it around 100 times, often provoking others with taunts such as, ""You could study, or you could watch Empire Records!"" I'll be the first to admit that as film goes, ER is not all that great, but then again, something must be right for it to still be watchable after 100 viewings. Go watch it.  Many times.",Empire Records
163,annkz_23,"I love and own the movie - funny, sad, interesting, realistic",9,3 June 2000,"This is a great story of an amazing record store owner, Joe, who hires any one who's in need of some help, and he dipenses it.  Together, him and the employees have to deal with a has-been pretentious singer who comes to sign CDs, a lack of necessary money, and general depression and confusion.  The movie is about finding yourself and being happy with what you find.  Damn the Man.  Save the Empire. ""What is with you today?"" ""what's with today today?""",Empire Records
164,Spiderman-2,all praise,9,1 March 2001,"this film is great, and like few others i have ever seen. if you can find it (these days in the UK HMV has exclusive VHS rights) i urge you to buy it. it's not expensive and is very funny indeed. Lucas alone could hold this film, but the rest of the cast make this a truly cool, smart, stupid, comedy.",Empire Records
165,apple_head11,i adore this film,9,7 July 2000,"this is my happy film if i am upset i sit and watch this and sing along. i've said it once i'll say it again. i adore this film.  its like at the end for one night everyone forgets their differences forgets their problems and just dances and enjoys the music. which is what everyone should do whenever it all gets too much. music is a great thing and this film celebrates it. it is in a way a happy ending everyone gets there wish. but they arent changed maybe they are wiser or realised something during the film, but they are still the same characters and have the same faults unlike other films where everyone becomes virtuous and there is an unbelievable happy ending. i love this film see it and ignore any the bad reviews",Empire Records
166,jess_k,GREAT ~!,10,15 August 2000,"Empire Records is a really fun, light movie that you could watch over and over and not get sick of!  Ethan Embry (credited as Ethan Randall) is really good in it, even though it's just a supporting role, he delivers an amazing performance!",Empire Records
167,da_jubsta,More than just a fun movie,10,25 October 2000,"Sure, Empire is fun.  It's a great movie, it's got some awesome quotes, and it's just plain hilarious.  But it's got some deeper stuff to it, and that's why I like it.  You can view each of the people in the movie as one of the popular 'cliques' in high school, and see objectively how these groups treat each other.  I love this movie, and that's why I gave it a 10.",Empire Records
168,zippo-16,Empire Records kicks major @ss!!!,10,24 September 2000,"Empire Records is a Masterpiece. It is the best movie I have ever seen. Ethan Embry(Mark)is the coolest character ever thought up. Ethan is probably the only person who could make Mark look so cool. I think the whole cast has talented actors and actresse. If someone doesn't like the movie then they are the dumbest, most insane person i have ever seen. This movie f***ing rocks!!!!!!",Empire Records
169,cellophane808,does anyone work here?,7,16 December 2000,"The first time I saw this film, I loved it. Then I got a job in retail. I watched the movie again. I still liked it a lot, but it is really not realistic to what goes on in retail, at least from the 7 years I've spent in the field. First of all, there are many times when there is only ONE person on the floor and that store is really big. And they only had one shoplifting incident? I'm surprised they weren't cleaned out. I guess I'm a stickler for reality, even in the movies. Still fun and great to watch and laugh at from a retailer's p.o.v.",Empire Records
170,ksp6s,One of the three worst movies I've ever seen,1,17 January 2001,"One of the three worst movies I have ever seen, right there with ""Pushing Tin"" and ""Batman and Robin."" The completely unbelievable, highly annoying, and one-dimensional characters in this movie were the victims of some of the worst character development I have ever seen. Their interaction and dialogue was completely unrealistic, and their parts seemed so blatantly stereotypical. It was one of those movies I would have thought was cool in 8th grade, when I had no idea what a good movie, or even reality for that matter, was like. However, maturity makes this movie get worse and worse from a viewer's standpoint. A decent soundtrack is not enough to justify seeing this movie - I think I would have been better off spending my 2 hours doing just about anything other than seeing Empire Records.",Empire Records

I bought its fan edition and sound track. I love this movies comedy and funny catchy phrases and awesome quotes. I don't think I can ever stop raving about this movie. This is a great movie for teens or people that love movies based on music. I know i sound like a dinky teen but trust we rent or watch it on H.B.O. and you will like it too!!!L0Ve L0Ve L0Ve tHiS M0Vie!!!If I could I would give it 1,959 stars!!!Damn The Man!

172,mynameisalec,Worst 'alternative' teen flick evaaaaaaaaaaar,1,22 May 2006,"This was appalling, seriously, who wrote and directed this sham of a film; Sixth form students on a ketamine come-down? It hangs together like a shoddy patchwork quilt.The characters are utterly 1 dimensional and unbelievable, it is impossible to care for any of them for even one second. I wanted to pulverise Lucas' smug face until it was just Pate in a skull shaped bowl. Ug, it makes me sick just thinking back about it to review it.Gwar are on screen for a couple of seconds which is good, but even they are tarnished by this cinematic turd.Whichever cynical film company put together this mockery of alternative teen life should feel ashamed and should probably be taken outside and shot.",Empire Records
173,jman-2011,Best Movie I Have Seen In A While,10,24 May 2006,"This is maybe one the best films i have ever seen... but not to the people to the box office. I have some news for the people @ in the box office... we know it only made $300,000.. but does money matter? The movie has one of the best soundtracks... great story which is simple. **Spoiler Alert** Empire Records is becoming ""Music Town""..but the workers wont allow it.. so they raise money.. along with a few relationship problems.. and a kid comes in with a gun... that is solved.. and the last part.. band on roof to raise money to keep the original people to run the store.. so this is your average teen movie.. with a lot of music in it too... if you have the soundtrack, listen to it.. you will like what you hear.. go rent this movie,watch it on TV.. whatsoever you can do to watch it.. do that.",Empire Records
174,groots,Highly enjoyable,7,14 April 2001,This movie definitely deserves more than the 5.9 that is its rating as of now.  Anybody who likes music will think this movie is pretty good.  This movie is about having fun and being yourself.  It's just a good change of pace in the movie world.  I thought it was good stuff.  Totally a 7...at least.,Empire Records
175,SuperSpyChick,"Damn the man, save the Empire",10,9 June 2006,"""Damn the man, save the Empire"". That is the theme of the movie and one of the best quotes ever.My friends and I watched this movie over and over (and over again) in around 1997. I just saw it again recently and was flooded with memories.It is probably not the best theatrical movie of it's time but it is one that I feel really captured a time in America's youth when we were coming out of grunge rock and heading to god knows what. It is a movie that will always remind me of my youth, when it was easier to say ""Damn the man, save the Empire!"" and not be worried about the consequences that those words may have.",Empire Records
176,garethlatraille,Oh no!,1,30 June 2001,"This is perhaps the worst film I have ever seen with the possible exception of ""Burn Hollywood, Burn"". Bland soundtrack, truly awful acting and a store manager that made the Dad from ""Blossom"" seem at the cutting edge of music. The most irritating part was that it was trying so hard to be cool - but one of the characters had a mullet! Not even one of these post-modern mullets that are coming back (still bad) but a genuine Eastern European style ape drape.",Empire Records
177,actress_singer,This FILM RULES !!!!!,10,26 April 2001,I love this film. It's my favourite IT RULES it's so funny and sassy and so cool I LOVE THIS FILM. !!!!!!!! All the actors are so good in it. I've watched it so many times. I even stayed up till 2.30am to watch this film. It's the best ever but I can't find out where to get the video for coz I've not got it and I wanna see so much again. does anyone know where 2 get it.,Empire Records

I can watch it over and over because it is FUNNY! Not only is the movie funny but it has a great story line and also a love story included. If you haven't seen it plz do yourself a favor and go rent it. It's about teens that work in a record store that is going out of business and they are trying to save their favorite place to be. While learning they have a problem on their hands,along comes a rock star, Rex Manning. He doesn't bring anything but trouble and tons of laughs.",Empire Records
179,peetah38,"Better for a second watch, great soundtrack",8,30 October 2006,"Found this by accident really. Had browsed the 'top titles' and nothing took my fancy and just went surfing the racks and saw this. After the first view was pleasantly surprised and subsequently have re-viewed and have taken to it a lot. Still haven't mentioned the greatest thing about this movie - the soundtrack. So many classics, and for me so many from when I grew up. Flying Lizards sticks out as a favourite and sadly doesn't appear on the soundtrack CD. As for the acting, it was as expected just good performances. Some have moved on to bigger and better, some have not. Some questionable threads in the plot but I always try to remember why I watch movies and that is to be entertained, this movie does that.",Empire Records
180,lollyrozza,Grow a little,10,3 September 2005,"This film is one of the best teen movies, I first watched it ten years ago when I was 12. I was hooked,you may assume that to occupy the mind of a 12 year old would be simple. But for a film to hold its charm throughout the whole period in which a teen ""grows up"" for a whole decade its truly incredible. It wasn't just because of the cast (although it is a good one) it was a mix of passionate music and dark humour, intelligent undertones suggesting subtle but impactive multi- stranded narratives each coping with their own dilemma. However big or small. The film satisfyingly draws you in. You feel every-thing for the film and the characters in it, that Allan Moyles wants you to feel. It is a great great film, which why after ten years after I first saw it (and poss about 195 viewings) I can still sit here and talk about it.",Empire Records
181,kcooper131313,What a cult classic,10,17 February 2007,In my opinion this is one of the best cult classics out there i lost my VCR copy and i just found a DVD copy of it and i love it i watch often and never get board of it i just love all the actors in it and now some of them our big name actors or actress in the movie biz. If you want to Liv and Renee before they got big you have got to see this movie i highly recommend it. I have a friend who forgot what a great movie it was and she just watched again for the first after a long time and she and her daughter watched together and she and her friends just love it and now it is one of there favorites like it was to her mom and me. If you want a good movie to revisit this is the one. Wither you are young or old your going to love this cult classic i highly recommend it.,Empire Records

183,lkuhl,All time favorite movie,10,17 January 2008,"This movie is a classic and needs to be shown more on T.V. Some of my all time favorite quotes are from this movie.I think everyone in the 25-35 age group love this movie.It reminds me of High School and all my friends.I love the plot line and the characters they are all so love able including Mitch""the Man"" you just wanna shove him from the Roof while the band is playing!!!The individual quirks of all the employees was brilliant and added so much drama to the movie.Favorite scene was the chase and arrest of Warren it was so funny.I watch this movie every time it is on which is not that often.DAMN THE MAN SAVE THE EMPIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Empire Records
184,Johnny_Depp_Forever,"Great movie, a sign of it's time",8,7 July 2003,"I love this movie very much. I don't own a lot of movies but this is one that I do. Like any film, it has it's problems but in general it is great. The film was well casted, each actor fit and made the best of his or her role. Maxwell Caulfield played Rex Manning, the character you love to hate. Anthony LaPaglia played Joe who was one of the best managers that you could work for. The actor's attitude toward his role was very well displayed. Rory Cochrane played Lucas, who is my favorite character in this movie. Then there is Johnny Whitworth, now everybody sort of disinclueds him or doesn't like him but I think that he did a good job as AJ, I could not see anyone else there, maybe someone could have done a better job but he did well. The rest of the cast was fantastic. The plot of the film was a little non existent, it's more like a series of events that just go one after the other with no really flow. Anyways, take the movie for what it is: teenagers working at a record store, dealing with life issues with good music playing in the background. This is a great film.",Empire Records
185,linstead88,Pure genius,9,7 November 2007,"I was first introduced to this film by my older sister about 6 years ago. At the time I thought ""this is rubbish"" as I was only 13 years old but as the years went by I thought ""Pure Genius"". It's not your typical magical film full of effects and an all star cast but it has everything a film needs to grasp an audience especially for the 90's - sex, drugs and rock and roll. As a teenager myself, not for long though, it has that typical storyline of drama and romance spiralling out of control then suddenly fulfilling the audiences expectations of a happy ending. However it does tackle honest issues for youth then and today of drugs, exams, parental pressure, boys, girls, jobs and more importantly life. It hits those pivotal issues that none of us want to face unless watching it in a film and I must admit after i watched it a few times I felt understood. As corny as it sounds its true. Even with the scene where Mark eats the brownies and thinks hes being eaten by a character from the TV - classic. I've had more than a few friends who have suffered from similar hallucinations which generally is funny for both them and everyone watching.Empire records will always be a classic of teenage life for me and I will never forget it for that!!! Genius!!!",Empire Records

Who cares what music is in a movie. you don't like acting, well its not realistic so what. think about these things 1:37 is a great time to tell a girl you love her. Lucas was completely normal the day before he stole the money. this adds humor to his behavior. Warren represent the movie watcher.  We all wish we had fun at work and loved what we did, and while you watch this movie and start to think how easy life would be if you could just love your job and have all this fun....well eventually you are warren and maybe one day you will get hired there too.Of course some people just watch movies and don't try and make even the cheesiest movies relevant to their life, but them being lazy is not the movie's fault.",Empire Records
188,b_salyer,Sweet!!!!!,10,10 November 2002,"Definately my Favorite movie to date. As an employee at a local blockbuster I do my best to make sure it is a heavy renter. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet has truely missed an awesome movie, including great performances by Liv Tyler and Renee' Zellwegger.The sound track alone warrents the time to watch the movie, but the intricate interactions between the character make you feel like part of the group and almost always there is someone you can identify with.",Empire Records

But as good as the movie is, there is something even better then it. The soundtrack. With just one listen, it became one of my favorite cd´s. With classic song´s like Gin Blossom´s ""Til I here it from you"", which is the quintessentially amazing song that you´ve loved your whole life, but heard only once.",Empire Records
191,xphilejr,A complete and utter load of rubbish,1,6 February 2003,"I saw this film on the advice of my boyfriend, who ranks it as one of his favourite movies ever. Now, we do usually have a very similar taste in films, but oh dear God I hated Empire Records!!I could kinda tell i wouldn't like it from the video jacket, which makes a lot of fuss about the film's soundtrack, and this brought to memory a piece of advice I'd heard before which everyone should take heed of:BEWARE OF MOVIES THAT VALUE A SOUNDTRACK HIGHLY IN THE TRAILER OR VIDEO SLEEVE - THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS RUBBISHOh how I wish I'd listened to this! I did try to like this movie for my boyfriend's sake, but unfortunately I found every character to be bland and undeveloped; the one day setting meant that plotting was thrown out of the window, indeed I'm not even sure that there was a plot; the dialogue was almost 99% cringe-worthy 'teenspeak'; for a comedy there were no laughs; and worst of all, the lauded soundtrack was appallingly thrown at the movie with no relevance to scenes.Watch this film if... well, actually, just don't watch this film.",Empire Records
192,becker_54,Damn the Man,10,22 December 2009,"This movie does not fit the profile of my other favorite movies, but I love it. Maybe it is because I briefly worked for a small local record shop, but I don't think so.I really enjoy the music. It is a fast paced movie with very few lulls in the plot. It has intriguing characters who face many obstacles I faced during that exact time, at that exact age. I'm now in my early 30s, and this movie provides a brief look at some of what the 90's were about for me. Passion about music, girls, motorcycles, doing goofy things, and having fun. I think music was more diverse back then, and I still love the soundtrack. This is a great movie to sit back and enjoy, it doesn't require a lot of thought, but it creates a lot of laughs and provides many memorable quotes. Damn the man!",Empire Records
193,kevintcp5586,"Someone read this script and said "" Yea I'll give you money to make this"".",2,12 January 2010,"There is truly nothing I love more in this world than laughing at something that is intended to be dramatic. That is what a majority of the so called ""dramatic"" scenes did for me. This movie is intended to be a comedy with dramatic elements. I love when the drama becomes the comedy. One of my favorite touches in these kind of movies are characters like Tyler's who are going to Harvard, and the pretty boy who is secretly an amazing artist, and don't forget the slutty girl with the heart of gold. The suicide girl's character I believe was in every movie of the 90's dealing with teenagers. There is a reveal of Liv Tyler's character's speed addiction which leads to a big falling out between members of the store; this was intended to be dramatic. When the scene unfolded I found myself laughing as hard as I did when I saw Woody Allen's Bananas for the first time. This movie is very very very bad. If your in the mood for escapism than this is the movie for you or if you're dumb.Also there is this scene where Liv Tyler yells at the boss in order to be the one who gives lunch to the 70's lowlife; her yell reminded me of the bad acting of Mischa Barton's yell on the O.C. very uncomfortable.If you like this movie I hope that you're not an adult, if you're not you may still have a chance to be aware of what is good and what is bad. This movie was bad.",Empire Records
194,noelle3,Best movie ever!,10,8 March 2003,"I don't see how anyone could possibly dislike this movie.  It is by far the funniest film ever made.  I am not a big Liv Tyler fan myself, though she works great in this movie.  It has the best cast and the most classic lines. Rory Cochrane does a great job doing his deep part.  ETHAN EMBRY plays Mark who is the most adorable man ever.  Anyone who can say that this movie sucks, has not taste. ""We must not dwell, no not today.  It's Rex Manning day!"" THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!",Empire Records
195,sfgiantsgirl,AWESOME!,10,16 March 2003,"this is my all time favorite movie! If you haven't seen it, DO IT! It's awesome in the best sence of the word. Renee does an incredible job in this movie, and her new one Chicago. watch it, have fun! And don't let the man get you down.",Empire Records
196,hellsablazing,Remarkable piece of film history-a classic!,10,21 March 2003,"Empire Records is by far the most superior Generation X film ever made. It's even the best under 35 film ever made. I, as does everyone else, knows it's no Oscar material; but it never tried to make it self be that, so stop making it out to be and ripping it apart! It's brilliantly acted-probably one of the best casts ever-coordinated, greatly directed, and the script is clever, witty, AND original regardless of what non-movie buffs claim. What other film can get tarnished on a select theater run and then come back to acquire millions, even maybe a billion fans on video; bringing it towards cult status! Anything that includes Zellweger, Tunney, Tyler, Whitworth, Cochrane, and Embry in the same movie gets a thumbs up in my opinion. I only hope that someday there will be something along the lines of an E! True Hollywood story made for this film...they did it for Clueless! So what it all boils down to is that this film is a work of art-sorry, no killing people, massive sex, or violence-it actually relies on the acting and story. So whoever doesn't admire this film is either: very old, jealous, or a fan of the Scary Movie type of films! Get a life, pop in the video, and watch careers and skill be brought to life!  Empire gets an 100 from me!",Empire Records

198,sharona_24,Empire Records Rocks!,8,20 March 2011,"Empire Records is one of my all time favorite films. I watched it as a young teenager and I related to it quite a bit. There were some pretty funny comedic moments in the film and the music of the soundtrack gave a unique vibe to the movie. The best part about this film is that I am still able to watch it as an adult and I still enjoy the film as well as the music.The theme of Empire Records is the struggle of man against the greed of the corporate machine. Empire Records is an independent music store that is very lax with its employees, offers many different genres of music, and in general offers a very artistic environment for its customers. The owners of Empire wish to sell out and make Empire into a chain store. Joe, played by Anthony Lapaglia, is the store manager who takes an employee named Lucas, played by Rory Cochrane, under his wing. Together with the other misfits that work at Empire, they try to figure out a plan to save Empire from turning into a dreaded Music Town while dealing with their own personal problems on one very eventful day at the store.Other important issues that are addressed in this film include depression, Debra (played by Robin Tunney) cuts all of her hair off and tries to slit her wrist, drug addiction, Corey (played by Liv Tyler) is the perfect student who occasionally takes speed to help her stay awake to study, and risky sexual behavior, Gina (played by Renee Zellweger) thinks she will feel better about herself and find love by sleeping around.Two techniques used in this movie to demonstrate the theme were sound and lighting. The soundtrack of the film is very diverse and alternative which can be compared to the environment of Empire Records. Empire is not your typical music store and the music they play there is not always the most well known. The lighting of Empire can be considered dim and a little hazy at times, which compared to the harsh fluorescent lighting found at a chain store, gives Empire Records an even more unique feel. Another film that can be compared to Empire Records based on a similar theme is Office Space. In Office Space the employees (all from different walks of life) of a company are also trying to fight the corporate greed of their boss. Office Space is another one of my favorite movies. I think the reason I relate to these movies so much is because all of these employees band together to do something I probably never could, fight the greed of the corporate machine.",Empire Records
199,princemuchao,What planet are you people from?,3,19 August 2003,"This was horribly written and acted. I can imagine the writer wracking her brains every 10 minutes for what was going to happen next in the script and finishing it in two days. If you notice, she never got a real job after this script (a tv item and an independant film about ballet)...This movie is one of those that gets made because a studio needs to fill a ""teen movie"" quota, not because the filmmaker was inspired by any specific idea or concept.Several parts were mildly amusing, but I don't know how anyone can rate this movie a 10. I can't even begin to describe what is wrong with it - it was just a meaningless mess.  I know some idiot is going to say ""that is the point... it's a slacker film"". If you look at a movie like ""Reality Bites"" or director Alan Moyle's OTHER film, ""Pump up the Volume"", and compare it to this, you see that a movie about people who are a mess doesn't have to be a mess itself.",Empire Records

Every time i have a bad day i watch this to cheer me up!With a great sound track and some pretty great acting for the stars of tomorrow (well now the stars of today!).SO if your looking to feel good about the 90's and want to listen to classic tunes as well this is one for you.

""What's the matter with today, today?""""I'm guided by a force much greater than luck.""Just a very well done teen focused yet adult scripted movie.Anthony LaPaglia and Debbie Mazar are phenomenal. Maxwell Caulfield is so sleazy, yet so awesome.Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, and Robin Tunney work so well against each other in these classic teen stereotypes that actually end up breaking the stereotype in believable ways.Rory Cochrane steals and carries the show, but Ethan Embry and Brendan Sexton just add to the layers of hilarity.",Empire Records
203,baileybrittonrogers,My best friend and I used to watch this everyday after school.,10,18 August 2021,"Movie stores were still active then, so our parents probably had to rent this movie at Least 50 times each (because neither of us owned it). Anyway, now that I'm older and have the DVD and watch it once a year, I laugh So Hard at the parents that I didn't really understand when I was little.Born a classic.An enthusiastic two thumbs up 💖",Empire Records
204,scoobychick25,I love this movie!!!,10,26 May 2004,"When the employees find out there place of employment is being turned into a chain store they do whatever it takes to save it. This movie is soooo funny after watching it I wanted to go out & get a job in a record store. Check out Rory Cochran as ""Lucas"", him & ""Warren"" steal the movie in the shoplifter scene. Renee Zellwegger has a scene in the movie where she sings, not to be missed. Liv Tyler looks hot as usual. Robin Tuney is the depressed girl who hates everyone, & decides to shave her head @ work. Maxwell Caulfield is hilarious as Rex (Sexxy Rexxy) Manning. Debi Mazar has a bit part as Rex's assistant Jane. I also recommend that you check out the soundtrack. It's one of the best soundtracks out there.",Empire Records

207,lyndsey348,greatest movie,10,3 January 2005,"i loved this movie so much.... this movie is not only completely awesome, but the cast is incredible..Jonny whitworth is so beautiful in this movie. Liv Tyler is awesome in this movie too... Renee Zelweger is great in this movie... Ethan Embry is so hilarious in this movie he made me laugh so much and i loved anthony lapaglia and rory cochrane... both of them are in cop shows now so it was good to see them in these kind of roles. The music in this movie is totally awesome too... after seeing this movie i totally wanted to work in a record store but i doubt there is any as cool as this one.. but seriously this is one of the greatest ""teen"" flicks around and i don't think it has gotten the credit that it deserves so if you haven't seen this movie yet seriously go out right now and buy it don't even rent it because your gonna want to own this movie",Empire Records
208,sballandvball11,My favorite,10,1 March 2005,"I love this movie!! My friends (who all have seen it and love it too) and I quote it all of the time!! Its a great movie it has everything! Comedy, drama, rock, roll, and sex! It's amazing. Everyone should see this movie!! The characters in this movie are hilarious! The characters are hilarious you have.. a philosopher,an artist, stoners, a jerk, the store owner, the shoplifter, the slut, the dysfunctional characters, and the clueless. This movie is hilarious, I never get sick of it. I have seen it more times than I've seen any other movie.Some people don't appreciate it the first time around.. I didn't! The second time you will love it because you will pick up on the hilarity! Its great, you'll love it!!",Empire Records
209,lunsford_1969,making of Impire Records,8,20 March 2005,"Back in 1995 I was working as a security guard for the local movie set ,and I was assigned to this move as it was filmed in Wilmington NC .I worked close with the cast ,and sometimes talked to Liv,and Renee.They were a blast to be around ,and made my job fun .I will never forget the way Renee had to go out for lunch ,instead of the food truck provided ,and I had to go with her so she wouldn't get mobbed by fans .Funny thing about the Impire Records store was ,It was filmed in the front of a gay bar ,and well their parties had to go on .I was in charge of rerouting ""them"" to the rear ha ha ....But the movie ,The plot was great ,and coulda used a nude scene .but all in all a good movie .I watched little Renee and Liv grow to become great actors ,and get big roles in big films .I kinda miss those days when I an every day Joe ,got to meet ""the stars"" oh yea by the way ,glad Renee learned to sing lol",Empire Records
210,jumpygurl91,Why the world should view Empire Records,10,28 May 2005,"OK... where do I begin? I LOVE Empire Records. I am a total fanatic. I think that everyone should have a chance to see it!! The trailer was horrible, in my personal opinion, and the summary on the back of the DVD case is not to far from nothing like the movie itself. It's funny, random, romantic, dramatic, and overall overly entertaining. It's very easy to relate to, because there's no real backbone to Empire Records, like real life. It takes place over one day, one day filled with the problems, excitement, and more of different people's lives. Each and every character has an original--yet realistic--personality. So damn the man! Save the Empire! :D",Empire Records
211,jequihua,AUM - Awesome Unknown Movie,10,14 July 2005,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING! It features great music and the plot is very nice. The great character, Lucas is one of the funniest and cunning characters i've seen in any movie. Anyone who loves real music *cough*rock*cough* should watch this movie and whoever says its no good, they can have a personal chat with my fist ^__^. I also agree with everything the last comment said. It's amazing how this movie was never really paid attention to. I, personally loved it and bought the Special Edition a month ago. I am one happy owner of this movie on DVD and i suggest everyone get it too. If you don't buy it, at least rent it first to just watch it. This movie is great for coming home and watching with friends and on a big screen. Thanks for reading this, you wont regret watching it.",Empire Records
212,spinx1066,good film for Gen X,10,21 July 2005,"great film for Gen X group and a better soundtrack than you will find in most movies today, check out daze and confused also a great film. Empire records has many future stars and some stars you could care less about. I am 30 and this movie brings me back to the college days at Lock Haven University in PA..along other good movies such as PCU... People under 25 may find this film and the others I mention to boring because its not along the lines of the non-think crowd. I hope many people watch this film and come away that the early and mid 90s were a great time to be young and in college. This is just a fun film with a happy ending and needs no explosions and death to keep your interest.",Empire Records
213,notactuallyashley,you have finite time on this earth; don't waste it on this.,1,4 May 2016,"Empire Records is arguably the worst ""film"" I have ever seen. I cannot even begin to comprehend how anyone can stand to tolerate this garbage. It seems like the entire film was conceived in a single evening. There was no thought or foresight put into this filth whatsoever. It's as if the screenwriter wrote a first draft and then immediately started handing the scripts out to B-movie actors. The abominations in this film which they call ""characters"" are completely unlikable. Many of their performances could have be pulled off using cardboard cutouts attached to oscillating fans. This movie's paper-thin plot advanced for about the first 10 minutes, then proceeded to spin its wheel in monotony and trash comedy until the last 20 minutes. I can't imagine that anyone could have read this script and thought, ""Yeah that sounds like a great idea. Let's do it!"" The actors in this film come off as budget acting school dropouts, who are hardly worthy of any roles at all. Plain and simple: DO NOT BOTHER. I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy, and I'm fairly certain that playing this during a time of war would be considered inhumane under the Geneva Convention.",Empire Records
214,americanirishbadass,Without a doubt the best movie ever made!!,10,27 August 2005,"I watch this movie daily, it is the greatest movie ever made!! I honestly can not think of one other movie that I can watch everyday and not get tired of it. ""DAMN THE MAN, SAVE THE EMPIRE!!!!"" The acting is great, the storyline is completely original, it's just an all round great film. I mean look at the actors and actresses in this movie who are huge stars now. Renee Zelwegger, Liv Tyler, Anthony Lapaglia (probably not spelled right). From beginning to end this movie is certified platinum. It is packed with memorable quotes, scenes and music. When this movie ends you feel like your going home from a friends house. You bond with every character in very personal ways. Joe, Lucas and Warren by far are the 3 best characters I've seen in a movie. Those 3 alone dished out so many of the memorable scenes and quotes that make Empire the gem that it is.",Empire Records
215,cdmenzel,Allan Moyle & His Awesome 90's flicks...,10,5 May 2008,"If you were a fan when it first came out, I can guarantee YOU ARE STILL A FAN! How many movies can you say that you've grown up watching, and still loved it!! Kudos to Moyle for this and even Pump Up The Volume (which also has a freaking' killer soundtrack).For those that haven't seen it - just one of those day-in-the-life movies that can make you say either: a) Man, I wished I worked there. or b) I worked in a place JUST like that.I actually worked at a place where we tried to figure out what character we were. (Yes, I know, it WAS as dorky as it sounds).Though nowhere near great, watch Weirdsville - Moyle's newest. A good old Canadian stoner film with many a twists and turns. Different but funny in its own way.Bottom line...EMPIRE RECORDS IS STILL THE BEST MOVIE EVER!",Empire Records
216,takila_alikat,love this movie,10,2 November 2005,"This would have to be my favourite movie.. Seriously ten out of ten loved it... every single character has the quirky little personality's Great soundtrack loved every moment of the dilouge....""I do not regret the things I have done, but those I did not do."" O and i wont stop there here is another... ""No I mean, do you really know where Harvard is? It's another planet man- another universe. Totally unlike the one we know. Filled with big blond guys who eat ivy and row boats. What I'm trying to say is, you and Corey just aren't made for each other. "" Seriously anyone that hasn't seen this movie you are missing out!!! i Saw this movie when i was ten...I'm now eighteen still my favourite movie and i work in a video store so i see lots of movies",Empire Records
217,maccas01,Thankyou for making this film!,10,9 November 2005,"What I loved about this movie was it's connection with the audience across multiple levels. There were moments of hilarity, anguish, excitement, disgust and outright loss of control, which were all bolstered by the thematic mirroring of music. The soundtrack to Empire Records evokes the mindset of the youths in the record store and enhances everything so that that it leaps off the screen, into your ears, swirls around your brain for a bit and then spurts out again through every limb. I found myself banging along to the music of the Gin Blossoms, AC/DC and even Sexy Rex Manning! It conveyed the plight of the youth without being trite or pretentious owing to great performances from the whole cast and some inspired direction. The casting agents must have wet their pants when these guys rolled in to audition! All in all this is a top flick that makes you wanna start a band, rock out in public places and work in a record store. Thankyou for making this film!",Empire Records
218,jonstevens4,How this became my favorite movie ever...,10,20 January 2007,"Way back in 1997, at the young age of 17, I wandered into my local Hollywood Video store with the family, looking for a comedy to get me through the night.At the time, I had been trying to get a job at one of the music shops in the mall (for the record, I never got one there). So when I stumbled upon this movie I had never heard of I thought it might be worth the $1.99 I'd pay for it. So I take it home and it became a favorite, but not my favorite.Fast forward to a year later and I decide to move from Virginia to Alabama to be with my girlfriend who I met online. That weekend after moving my stuff into her apartment all we wanted to do was cuddle (as we haven't seen each other in months). We decided to watch a couple of movies. I started digging in my movies and she started digging in hers. We turned to each other and low and behold, we both were holding our copies of Empire Records. It was pretty hilarious at the time and the taste in movies sealed the deal on our relationship... We've been together nine years next month and have a four year old daughter together.But the love for 'Empire' doesn't end there.After moving to Alabama, I got a job at a movie theater. One of my co-workers there also held a second job at a movie rental store. He is the master of movie knowledge and he became one of my best friends. One day I started telling him about this movie. He had never even heard of it (this was in 2001 mind you). He said he wanted to see it so I brought it over and we watched it. He instantly named it his favorite movie of all time.From that point forward, we couldn't work together a day without cracking jokes by referencing lines from this movie. Every day, at that place, was Rex Manning Day!",Empire Records
219,bodhisattva14,"Destroy Every Copy of this ""Film""",1,14 October 2007,"If you're looking for plot, serviceable acting, continuity, and general viewing satisfaction, you would be better off renting a copy of ""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie."" Poor Anthony LaPaglia. He is a fine actor and does not deserve to have any affiliation to this crap. The only explanation is that he agreed to star in this film to pay off drug and/or gambling debts. Either that or the producers have some seriously compromising pictures of him. Everybody involved in the making of Empire Records should spend the rest of their careers writing apology letters to every sucker (of which I am one) who had the misfortune of viewing such amateurish tripe. To anyone who actually enjoyed this ""film"", I pity you - seriously.",Empire Records
220,lostgirls44,"A really fun, funny and touching look into the lives of people who work at a record store",10,19 February 2006,"This is a really great movie. Before I saw it someone told be it was bad, not realistic etc. They were wrong. It is funny, has great characters (that do things that one would never guess) good music and the acting is very good. The story is totally unconventional. The writing is great. I hope Allen Moyle does more movies of this kind. It is definitely his strong suit. I never like Robin Tunney much before i saw this movie but I am a fan now. She's a fearless actress. Very underrated and deserves to have a much better career. If you haven't seen this movie and love music, love record stores and play real records, definitely rent it. You won't be disappointed. I want to see it again. Also, Why is it that really good movies never get the marketing they deserve and crap movies do?!",Empire Records
221,Sexual_Plectrum,Mildly offensive teen drama,2,8 March 2006,"Let me start out by saying i was very relieved when i logged onto IMDb and saw that this movie got a 6.1 as this is a pretty bad score (and I'm quite sure this will decrease over time).I know this is a teen movie and i saw it probably a few years too late, but this movie is trash. Bad script, excessive levels of drama (even for a teen flick) and terrible teen stereotyping. What annoys me most about this movie though is the way it trivialises complex issues such as suicide and anorexia/bulimia by presenting them as something you can just simply get over as soon as you accept that you are an incredibly attractive person that perfectly fits the mass media's stereotype of beauty. (which of course most people do not).This is just another Hollywood insult like Pretty Woman and Driving Miss Daisy. If you watch this movie, then it should be back to back with Welcome to the Dolls House, although I'm sure anyone who rated this 8 or higher has probably never heard of that movie.I gave it a 2 because Liv Tyler is worth a squirt.",Empire Records
